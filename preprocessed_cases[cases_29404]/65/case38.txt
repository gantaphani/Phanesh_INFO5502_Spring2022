this product design case tests some of the limits of the minority rule,adopted by puerto rico and california,that the defendant bears the burden of proving that the utility of a product design outweighs the risks.aponte rivera sears roebuck de,wl barker lull eng r,cal d.the question here is whether a jury may find for a plaintiff,injured when her airbag properly deployed in an auto accident,when the evidence is that the overall utility of the design exceeds the overall risk,there is no evidence of the existence of an alternative safer design,and the jury verdict is based either on a misunderstanding of the law or solely on the jury rejection of the testimony of the experts retained by the defendant.we hold that such a jury verdict is not sustainable.it effectively,in these circumstances,either converts the defendant to the status of an insurer or creates liability based on a consumer expectation theory.since neither of these outcomes is permissible under puerto rican law,we reverse and direct entry of judgment for defendant.
early in the morning of august,ines,then fifteen years old,was returning from a party in a hyundai accent.brother was driving the car and was in the front passenger seat.the hyundai was in the left lane of a road.a nissan station wagon,traveling at a substantially slower speed,crossed from the right lane into the left lane,in front of the hyundai.the hyundai braked,leaving about feet worth of skid marks on the road.the hyundai then the nissan at a speed differential of about miles per hour.the airbag deployed,striking hand,which she had raised as if to brace herself.
the force of the airbag striking her arm fractured arm and wrist in four places.these were the only injuries sustained in the accident the fractures required three surgeries,including the permanent attachment of two metal plates and sixteen metal screws.has also experienced some permanent loss of strength and scarring in that arm.the hyundai sustained significant damage,estimated at over.
ii.trial proceedings 
only two experts testified on the airbag design.both experts were retained by the defendant,hyundai.the plaintiff also offered the testimony of a medical expert to establish injuries.
testimony of martinez 
jose martinez,formerly of texas a m university,testified as an accident reconstruction expert,providing the probable explanation of how the accident took place.he testified that the police reports showed feet of braking marks before impact.based on the damage sustained by the hyundai,martinez concluded that it was traveling thirty miles per hour faster than the nissan at the point of impact.based on this conclusion and the length of the skid marks,martinez opined that the hyundai had to be traveling at least miles per hour before the driver began to brake.
martinez explained the mechanics of accident reconstruction,a short summary of which is necessary in order to understand the issues in this case.barrier equivalent velocity,referred to as bev,is the speed at which a vehicle goes into a barrier,measured in miles per hour.bev is used for setting the deployment level for airbags,and it is the measurement used in the relevant federal regulations.delta v,a related but not identical concept,is the change in velocity of a vehicle,usually at the center of gravity,also measured in miles per hour.generally,accident reconstruction experts measure the delta v of the car environment,rather than that of a specific occupant.in accidents involving impact into a barrier,the bev is often slightly less than the delta 
the higher the delta v is,the more serious the injuries are likely to be.conversely,the lower the delta v,the less serious the injuries are likely to be.the majority of accidents occur in the to delta v range.generally,accidents with a delta v under are considered to be of lower severity.middle severity accidents are in the to delta v range above is considered high severity.martinez testified that a bev of is where you start to get serious injuries,according to the statistics and that is where you want that air bag to go off.he also testified that even an accident referred to as low severity is not mild because,if you are unrestrained,such an accident can put your head in the windshield and cause serious injuries.although he could not provide the specific percentiles of how many people would get hurt in an accident with a bev under,he stated that people do get hurt and will get hurt in those types of accidents.martinez testified that an accident with a bev of would cause an unbelted test dummy to go through the windshield.based on his reconstruction of the plaintiff accident,martinez estimated the bev of the accident at to,or maybe thirteen and change and the delta v at to,could be to.
the airbag in this hyundai model is designed to always deploy in accidents with a bev of or greater,and so the deployment of the airbag was in keeping with its intended design.martinez testified that,in any american car with an airbag,the airbag would have deployed in an accident of the type at issue here.nothing in the impeached any of these conclusions.the plaintiff counsel attempted to make martinez concede that hyundai could have chosen an airbag design that would deploy at a higher bev martinez responded that he did not know whether it was possible to create a design that would only deploy at a bev of over and still meet the federal performance standards.
the plaintiff counsel also attempted to get martinez to concede that he knew of studies indicating that airbag deployment at a bev of less than causes more injuries than it prevents martinez responded that he had no knowledge of such studies.no such studies were introduced.martinez overall conclusion was that,even at accidents with a bev of and less,the airbag does more good than harm.
testimony of benedict 
james benedict,an expert in the response of the human body to acceleration and impact forces,such as in accidents,also testified.specifically,he is an expert in biomechanical analysis,occupant kinematics,injury causation,and airbag performance.although the defense retained benedict,the plaintiff called him as a witness and presented his testimony.he testified that arm injuries were consistent with impact with the deploying passenger airbag.he estimated that her forearm was one to three inches from the dashboard at the time of the injury,based on the fact that forearm fractures rarely occur when the arm is three or more inches away from the airbag.he also testified that even if the airbag had not deployed,could have received the same fractures in her forearm.
according to benedict testimony,the airbag deploys when sensors in the car detect a change in acceleration level the airbag is essentially predictive in nature,in that it must predict the severity of the collision based on the initial change in acceleration.the airbag deploys in about of the time it takes to blink an eye.benedict testified that he knew of no way for an airbag to deploy more slowly and still provide the required protection.as for the hyundai involved in this particular accident,benedict testified that the airbag was designed to deploy in every accident with a bev of or higher which he referred to as the must fire level,but because of variances in vehicle tolerances,could deploy at a bev of as low as.he agreed that in any car in america in,the airbag would deploy during a crash with a bev of.
like martinez,benedict testified that he would classify an accident occurring at zero to or delta v as a low severity accident an accident occurring at to delta v as a moderate severity accident an accident occurring at to delta v as a severe accident and any accident over delta v as very severe.he testified that these are ranges,and the categorization may vary from expert to expert.
benedict testified that the effects of a crash with a bev of could vary.some occupants will emerge from such an accident with minor or moderate injuries,referred to as or injuries,in reference to the abbreviated injury scale system for categorizing the severity of injuries.perhaps as many as half of those involved in such crashes would walk away from the accident with no injuries.an unbelted individual without an airbag in the type of crash experienced by,however,could hit and shatter the windshield,sustaining facial bone fractures,lacerations to the face,and perhaps neck injuries.death could even result.accidents with a delta v of account for twenty percent of all or greater injuries.injuries are severe,serious or critical,including injuries such as contusions to the lung or a penetrating injury to the skull,and may pose a threat to life.
benedict acknowledged that there have been injuries and some deaths caused by deployment of airbags.at the same time,over six thousand lives had been saved by the presence of airbags.he characterized this as a.airbags are meant to protect the primary systems that keep people alive the head,neck,spine,chest,heart,and lungs.airbag systems are most effective in preventing these head,neck,and chest injuries,although they may increase the risk of less severe injuries in some crashes.
as he had with martinez,the plaintiff counsel attempted to get benedict to admit that reports had concluded that,in low severity crashes,occupants are more likely to be injured by the airbag than by the accident itself.benedict responded that he knew of one study concerning driver side airbags,but denied that he knew of any such conclusion.at no point did any expert testify that such a conclusion would be accurate.
the plaintiff counsel attempted to focus benedict testimony specifically on a belted passenger risk of injuries.on examination by the plaintiff,benedict testified that you can have significant injury in delta vs of,even when wearing a seat belt,although he conceded that it less likely wearing a seat belt and the probability of the head hitting something when a passenger is wearing a seat belt is low.according to benedict,however,federal law requires that airbags be designed to protect unrestrained passengers as well as restrained passengers.
offered no evidence to contradict any of the evidence described.
proceedings after close of evidence 
after all the evidence had been introduced,hyundai moved for judgment as a matter of law.the district court granted the motion on the plaintiff failure to warn claim but denied it on the plaintiff design defect claim.
in closing,the plaintiff attorney argued that the only question for the jury was whether the damages suffered by ines would have been less had the airbag not been in the car or not deployed in the car.he argued that the delta v was around and the bev was in the to range,classifying the accident as a minor collision,and that there should not be airbag deployment at these speeds.in referring to martinez,the plaintiff attorney specifically said believe him on just about everything.with regard to benedict,the plaintiff attorney said that he knew what the truth was.he was an honest man.
the judge instructed the jury,in relevant part,that 
because a manufacturer of a product is not the insurer of all the damages its product may cause,you must weigh the evidence according to the following legal theories under the doctrine of product liability,a plaintiff may bring an action against a manufacturer who defectively designed a product,or in the alternative,failed to provide instructions or warnings.
under the design theory,a plaintiff must establish that,first,the product failed to perform as safely as an ordinary consumer would expect when used in an intended or reasonably foreseeable manner or the product design is the proximate cause of the plaintiff injury and the defendant failed to establish,in light of the relevant factors,that,on balance,the benefits of the challenged design outweigh the risk of danger inherent in such a design 
if you find that the benefits surpass the risks,then the defendants are not liable under this theory.
on the other hand,if you find that the benefits do not surpass the risks,then you find for the plaintiffs.
after deliberations,the jury found for the plaintiff,and also found that the plaintiff bore no share of the comparative fault.the jury awarded to ines who had sued through her mother,plaintiff and in emotional distress damages to mother,plaintiff.
hyundai again moved for judgment as a matter of law or,in the alternative,a new trial or remittitur of damages.the trial court denied the motions for judgment as a matter of law,but found the damages to be excessive and ordered a new trial unless the plaintiff accepted a remittitur to of the emotional distress damages awarded to,the mother.the district court did not order remittitur of the award to.quintana ruiz hyundai motor.in denying the motion for judgment as a matter of law,the district court held that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that the deployment of the airbag in an accident of this type was unwarranted given the risks posed by the high speed at which the airbag deploys or that,given the evidence that airbags are designed to protect the upper body areas,the jury may have reasonably found that the risk posed to other parts of the body,like plaintiff arm,were too high and that the overall design was defective,slip op.at.the district court further reasoned that,even if all the experts testified that the utility of the airbag design outweighed the risk,there was testimony from which the jury could have found that defendant experts testimony was biased and unreliable.id.the judge also found that hyundai had forfeited any claim of error regarding the consumer expectation test by not specifically objecting to its inclusion in the jury instructions,and that,regardless,the fleeting reference to consumer expectations in the jury instructions was harmless error id.at.
on appeal,hyundai argues that there is insufficient evidence,as a matter of law,to support the jury verdict.we review the district court denial of judgment as a matter of law de novo,reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury verdict to determine if the verdict is supported by the evidence.see rodowicz.mut.life ins,cir.we assume the veracity,however,of any admissions made and stipulations entered into by the party opposing the rule motion,see.b,as well as any evidence derived from disinterested witnesses that has not been contradicted or impeached.pepsi cola of bottling,cir.
evidence of design defect 
under puerto rican tort law governing design defect claims,if the plaintiff proves that the product design is the proximate cause of the damage,the burden shifts to the defendant to prove that the benefits of the design at issue outweigh the risk of danger inherent in such a design.aponte rivera sears roebuck de,wl see also toyota motor,cir rivera santana superior packaging,wl.this rule,which follows california law as established in barker lull eng r,cal d,is a minority rule.compare,vineyard empire mach,app rejecting burden shifting armentrout fmc,same kallio ford motor,same wilson piper aircraft,or,same ray bic,same,with keogh grasle,alaska following barker ontai straub clinic hosp,haw,same.the rationale articulated for this burden shifting is that most of the evidentiary matters which may be relevant to the determination of the adequacy of a product design under the standard,the feasibility and cost of alternative designs involve technical matters peculiarly within the knowledge of the manufacturer.barker,at.the goal of the barker rule,therefore,was to lighten the plaintiff burden in proving a design defect,id,at,not to radically expand the scope of products considered defective by design.
in this case,the defendant concedes that the plaintiff has met her burden of establishing that the airbag was the proximate cause of injuries.the question is whether the defendant has met its burden of showing that the benefits accruing from the airbag design outweigh the risks.
the defect claimed in this case is that the airbag was designed to deploy at a bev of,the bev level of the crash in this case.both parties agree that the airbag operated exactly as it was intended and that the challenged design aspect was a conscious design decision,rather than an unforeseen consequence for instance,a premature or unexpected deployment of the airbag design,at challenged design aspect involved whether airbag could have been better designed to minimize injuries when it did deploy.
in,another case from puerto rico involving a design defect claim based on injuries,we noted that a s identified in barker,factors to be considered by the jury in evaluating whether the defendant has met its burden of establishing that the design benefits outweighed its risks include 
the gravity of the danger posed by the challenged design,the likelihood that such a danger would occur,the mechanical feasibility of a safer alternative design,the financial cost of an improved design,and the adverse consequences to the product and to the consumer that would result from an alternative design.
id.at quoting barker,at.the puerto rico supreme court has also quoted this language approvingly.rivera santana,wl.
risk utility balancing 
there is little guidance from the puerto rico supreme court on how the test should be applied.the case that first adopted the rule,rivera santana,wl,was resolved on another manufacturer failure to warn of the inherently dangerous nature of the product.a subsequent case reiterating the rule,aponte rivera,wl,was also resolved on a failure to warn theory.
the plaintiff attorney argued in his closing that the question was whether the damages suffered by ines would have been less had the air bag not been in the car or not deployed in the car.that,however,is not the correct question in a design defect case.the question posed by the plaintiff attorney unfairly stacks the deck in the the question is based on the plaintiff particular circumstances,the risk of injury is,as the plaintiff in question has by definition been injured,and therefore the risk will almost always outweigh the utility for that particular plaintiff in that particular instance.similarly,the trial court conclusion that,given the evidence that airbags are designed to protect the upper body areas,the jury may have reasonably found that the risk posed to other parts of the body,like plaintiff arm,were too high and that the overall design was defective,quintana ruiz,slip op.at,misstates the test.the issue is not whether the design posed too great a risk to the passenger arm,or any one specific body part.
instead,the question for the jury was whether,generally,the benefits imposed by the airbag challenged design aspect here,the fact that the passenger side airbag deploys in accidents with a bev in the range of to outweigh its risks.in this inquiry,the jury should have considered the risk and utility to unbelted passengers,as well as the risk to belted passengers.the evidence was that unbelted passengers receive a considerable utility from airbags in such accidents,as,absent the airbag,there is a substantial risk of severe facial,head and spinal injuries 
there was much evidence presented at trial on the risks posed by,and the utility created by,airbag deployment at a bev of.the uncontradicted evidence was that the benefits outweighed the risks.no expert testified that the risk of harm posed to passengers by airbags in accidents with a bev of exceeded the benefits of airbags deploying in those types of crashes.in fact,both martinez and benedict testified that they knew of no studies coming to such a conclusion.martinez specifically testified that,at accidents with a bev of and under,the airbag does more good than harm.the evidence was that airbags are designed to prevent the most serious types of injuries and therefore to preserve lives,although the cost of preserving these lives may be an increased risk of injuries of a less serious variety in some crashes.
the plaintiff argument that these serious injuries do not occur in the type of accident she had was not supported by the evidence.the evidence was that of all injuries occur at a delta v of or,a significant percentage of serious injuries are the result of these moderate severity accidents.had the benefit of the protection against these types of injuries afforded by the airbag.she did not suffer any head,face or brain injuries,precisely the types of injuries an airbag protects against in an accident with a delta v of.
much of the plaintiff examination of benedict concerned whether the airbag would deploy at a bev of,and with the fact that hyundai does not warn consumers that airbags may cause serious bodily injury.neither of those topics was material to the questions before the jury.it was undisputed that the bev and delta v were well above and therefore a design choice to make the airbag deploy at a bev of could not be a proximate cause of the plaintiff injuries.and,because the matter of labels is so extensively regulated by federal law,there was no viable claim for failure to warn.
many products,like airbags,involve a trade off between the benefits offered to the consumer and the risk created by the product.the balancing test is designed to avoid converting the manufacturer into the insurer of every harm that arises out of a product from which the consumer derives utility.the puerto rico supreme court has emphasized that t he manufacturer is not the insurer of every damage his products may cause.aponte rivera,wl accord rivera santana,wl same language quoting mendoza cerveceria corona,wl see also barker,at noting that this test stop s short of making the manufacturer an insurer for all injuries which may result from the use of its product.the plaintiff is entitled to compensation only if the challenged design aspect does more harm than good,overall,for the consumer.
alternative design 
an important part of the test is the question of whether there is a mechanically feasible safer alternative design see barker,at rivera santana,wl.
there are at least three views of how the existence,or,of a mechanically feasible alternative design fits into the balancing test a showing of an alternative design is the sine qua non of a design defect claim,meaning that a plaintiff can not prevail even if the risk exceeds the utility unless there is a showing of alternative design,see henderson twerski,achieving consensus on defective product design,cornell,the plaintiff can not prevail if there is no showing of a feasible alternative design,unless the risk so far outweighs the utility that no reasonable person would market the product,see restatement third of torts product liability,cmt.b p roduct sellers may be subject to liability even absent a reasonable alternative design when the product design is manifestly unreasonable.and it is not necessary to show the existence of an alternative design if the risk outweighs the utility,but if the actual utility exceeds the actual risk,then the plaintiff may still prevail if there is a showing of a feasible alternate design that would achieve the same utility with a lesser degree of risk see prosser keeton on torts,at keeton et,ed.it is not clear what view the puerto rico courts would follow,but none of the three approaches assists the plaintiff.as discussed above,the evidence shows that the actual utility of an airbag deploying at a bev of outweighs the actual risk posed by such an airbag.therefore,even under the third view of alternate design the most view,can not prevail unless there is a feasible alternative design.
even taking this third view,it is that the inquiry into the mechanical feasibility of an alternative design must be determined based on the universe of existing technology at the time of manufacture and design or possibly the time of sale not some future development leading to a potentially feasible possibility.see prosser keeton on torts,supra,at the courts have almost universally held that the feasibility of designing a safer product must be determined as of the time the product was designed.restatement third of torts product liability,supra,cmt.f q ualified expert testimony on the issue suffices,even though the expert has produced no prototype,if it reasonably supports the conclusion that a reasonable alternative design could have been practically adopted at the time of sale.
california courts as well have accepted the principle that feasibility is determined in light of the technology extant at the relevant time.see brown superior court,cal d,barker contemplates a safer alternative design is possible buccery motors,d.a ny product so designed that it causes injury when used or misused in a foreseeable fashion is defective if the design feature which caused the injury created a danger which was readily preventable through the employment of existing technology at a cost consonant with the economical use of the product.in aguayo crompton knowles,d,the plaintiff attempted to introduce evidence that the defendant successor had instituted a safer alternative design in subsequent versions of the product.the appeals court upheld the district court ruling excluding the evidence.noting that while p laintiff experts had described how this alternate safety system would operate using technology available at the time of manufacture of the original machine which does have a tendency to show it is feasible,the plaintiff offer of proof omitted facts that would show that the knowledge and technology used to manufacture and design the original machine was the same used to produce the proffered machine.id.at.
in light of this,the barker rule potentially puts defendants in an impossible situation with regard to alternative of trying to prove a negative that there is no alternative design that was feasible at the relevant time that would not cause greater risk.barker itself,and the puerto rico cases adopting it,say only that the burden lies with the defendant of proving that the overall utility exceeds the overall risk,not that the burden is on the defendant to prove the impossible the courts of puerto rico will ultimately have to sort through the precise role played by evidence of alternative design.
in this case,no expert presented any evidence that there was any alternative design that would have posed less of a risk to passengers while still providing the same level of protection.in fact,the expert testimony was just the opposite.the only alternative design suggested by the plaintiff was an airbag with a higher deployment level presumably a deployment level at a bev greater than,given that the expert testimony placed the bev of this accident at between and.the expert testimony effectively refuted this as a feasible alternative that would decrease overall risk to passengers.f easibility is not the sole issue,for another relevant consideration is whether an alternative design of the car,while averting the particular harm here,would have created a greater risk of injury in other situations.barker,at.expert testimony established that a deployment trigger above a bev of would leave many individuals unprotected from serious injuries of and higher.
further,benedict testified that airbags can not be designed to trigger at one specific bev level.rather,because of variations in cars,any one design will result in a range of deployment levels.if a designer wants an airbag to definitely deploy at a bev of what benedict referred to as a must fire level,the airbag will sometimes deploy at as low as a bev of.the plaintiff suggestion in closing arguments that hyundai should have designed a bag that would deploy at a bev of and above,but never at a bev of or,is inconsistent with the evidence presented at trial on mechanical feasibility.
in addition,federal regulations governing the performance of airbags must factor into the jury consideration of whether there is any feasible alternative design.the national highway traffic safety administration has mandated that airbags be designed to protect unbelted occupants,as well as belted occupants.this evidence was before the jury.although,states may impose liability under their products liability statutes even if the manufacturer or seller meets the minimum federal standards,wl,an alternative design can not be considered feasible if it would require the manufacturer to run afoul of federal standards.in fact,a state law claim that attempts to impose requirements that conflict with the federal standards would most likely be preempted by federal law.see geier am.honda motor,d wood motors,cir.
on our review of the evidence,no rational jury could have concluded on these facts that the risks of the airbag design outweighed the benefits.
expert testimony 
the district court alternatively upheld the jury verdict on the basis that the defendant bore the burden of proof and that the jury was free to reject the defendant experts testimony as biased.the only bias was that hyundai paid the experts consulting fees including compensation for time spent testifying,and that both experts primarily,although not exclusively,work for the defense side in such cases.
under the rule as stated by puerto rico albeit without consideration of the factors discussed here,a plaintiff need not present any evidence regarding the risk or utility of the product,or even regarding the design of the product.aponte rivera,wl rivera santana superior packaging,wl.from this,the plaintiff argues that when a plaintiff does not present her own expert testimony and convinces the jury to disregard the defense experts testimony,a plaintiff can prevail on her design defect claim simply by showing that the product caused her injury.
the district court thought its alternative ground was compelled by.see quintana ruiz,slip op.at.for the reasons outlined below,we disagree.
was also an airbag design defect case under the puerto rico rule,in which this court upheld a jury verdict for the plaintiff where the jury,in a particular context,rejected the defense expert testimony.the plaintiff has argued that established a flat rule that a jury may reject the testimony of an expert witness on a subject requiring expert testimony solely on the basis of the jury conclusion that the expert is biased in a case where the defendant,as a matter of law,bears the burden of proof on the issue.we describe the law in this area and apply it in the context of the case where the burden of proof is put on the party whose expert testimony is rejected.
the question on appeal is whether there was sufficient evidence to justify the jury rejection of the expert testimony on grounds of bias.a jury is not at liberty,under the guise of passing upon the credibility of a witness,to disregard his testimony,when from no reasonable point of view is it open to doubt.chesapeake ry.martin.see also sonnentheil christian moerlein brewing.chicago,rock island pac.ry.howell,cir the fundamental rule which makes the jury the sole judge of the weight and credibility of testimony is subject to the caveat that testimony concerning a simple fact,capable of contradiction,not incredible,and standing uncontradicted,unimpeached,or in no way discredited by,must be permitted to stand.see generally wright miller,federal practice and procedure,at.
in chesapeake ry,the supreme court reversed a jury verdict based on the jury rejection of a witness testimony where 
a reading of the testimony discloses no lack of candor on the witness part.it was not shaken by its accuracy was not controverted by proof or circumstances,directly or inferentially and it is difficult to see why,if inaccurate,it readily could not have been shown to be so.the witness was not impeached and there is nothing in the record which reflects unfavorably upon his credibility.
at.the only possible basis for questioning the witness credibility in chesapeake ry.was that he was an employee of the defendant.this,the court held,was not sufficient evidence to support a jury verdict based solely on the rejection of his testimony.id.
this rule accords with the standard for reviewing grants or denials of judgments as a matter of law,where generally we accept as true any evidence derived from disinterested witnesses that has not been contradicted or impeached,at.kasper mary of nazareth,cir when a case turns on credibility,neither side is entitled to judgment as a matter of law unless objective evidence shows that it would be unreasonable to believe a critical witness for one side.
