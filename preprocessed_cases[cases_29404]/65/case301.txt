sammie sappington,evelyn sappington,and justin sappington plaintiffs appeal the district court order excluding the testimony of their retained experts and granting summary judgment in favor of skyjack,and rental services corporation,rsc.we reverse.
this strict products liability action arises out of the death of doyle sappington,a carpenter employed by a general contractor performing work on a parking garage construction project in kansas city,missouri.on the day of the accident,sappington was operating a scissors lift model sjii sjii,manufactured by skyjack.the lift was owned by rsc and had been leased to a subcontractor on the construction project.
the skyjack sjii,and the later manufactured skyjack sjiii lift sjiii,are inches wide and can be elevated to a working height of feet.the skyjack sjiii differs from the sjii primarily because skyjack incorporated pothole protection into its design.pothole protection is an industry term of art,referring to design features intended to enhance stability in the event a lift is driven into a depression or pothole.pothole protection,as the phrase is used here,refers specifically to a system of stabilizing bars located at the bottom sides of the lift platform,which,when deployed,reduce the lift ground clearance.when activated,the pothole protection design on the sjiii reduces ground clearance from inches to inches,thereby increasing stability by reducing the distance the sjiii drops if it enters a depression.
both models have controls located on the work platform which allow the operator to raise and lower the work platform,and drive the lift forward and backward without lowering the platform.at the time of the accident,sappington was operating the lift on a smooth concrete surface with a slope of approximately percent,and the work platform was raised to at or near its maximum level of feet.the accident occurred when he drove the lift in reverse and the rear wheels dropped off the concrete floor into a hole created earlier in the day when a portion of the concrete floor was removed.when the rear wheels dropped off the edge of the walkway,the lift became unstable,pitched backwards,and tipped over.sappington fell from the lift and later died from his injuries.
plaintiffs,evelyn doyle mother,sammie doyle daughter,and justin doyle son,brought a strict products liability claim against the manufacturer of the lift,skyjack,and the lift,rsc plaintiffs allege the sjii was defective and unreasonably dangerous because it was not sufficiently stable to remain upright when its wheels dropped into the hole.they contend skyjack should not have manufactured the lift without pothole protection,and all lifts currently manufactured are so equipped,including the sjiii,the successor to the sjii.plaintiffs argue the pothole protection technology incorporated into the design of the sjiii,manufactured two years after the sjii lift involved in the accident,was available and feasible in when the subject sjii lift was manufactured.plaintiffs contend the sjiii design would have prevented the accident,the design was available at the time the sjii was manufactured,economically and technologically feasible,and the safer design should have been used by skyjack instead of the sjii design.plaintiffs also allege rsc had both sjii and sjiii lifts available for lease and the sjii it leased to the subcontractor was defective and unreasonably dangerous.
to support their strict products liability claims,plaintiffs hired two experts.the first,bryan johnson,was hired to perform testing on an sjiii lift to determine whether,under conditions similar to those at the accident scene,it would remain upright.johnson placed the sjiii on a wooden platform,sloped at approximately two degrees,which raised the lift seven inches off the road surface.he loaded the lift work platform with pounds,raised it to its maximum height of feet,and drove it at a top speed forward and backward until the wheels dropped off the edge of the platform.on each occasion,the lift remained upright.
the second expert,james blundell,is an associate professor of mechanical engineering with the undergraduate mechanical engineering school at the university of missouri,kansas city.he holds a phd in mechanical engineering and teaches courses in machine design and design safety.in connection with his work on the case,blundell reviewed depositions including testimony detailing stability testing of the sjiii conducted by skyjack,accident scene photographs,photographs from skyjack investigation,reports authored by johnson and ken zimmer plaintiffs previous expert witness,the osha investigation file,documents produced under seal by skyjack,the sjii and sjiii operating manuals,american national standards institute ansi standards and for self propelled elevating work platforms,and a video created by mayville engineering company mec,entitled pot hole protection can you live without it blundell did not conduct independent testing,but instead relied on stability testing of the sjiii lift performed by johnson and skyjack.
blundell stated the sjii operated by sappington was defective and unreasonably dangerous because it did not remain upright when its wheels dropped into the depression.he further opined the pothole protection would have prevented the unit from overturning.blundell concluded,based on his review of current ansi standards,that elevated lifts are now required to withstand the instability encountered in sappington accident.he further stated the sjiii was technically and economically feasible when the sjii was manufactured in and complies with the current ansi standard.see ansi standard american national standard for elevating work platforms promulgated and replacing ansi standard promulgated.in other words,according to blundell,the sjiii could and should have replaced the sjii by,and the accident would not have occurred had sappington been using an sjiii lift 
as evidence of feasibility,blundell report indicated other lift manufacturers,mec,snorkel,and upright,recognized the need for and incorporated pothole protection into their designs before the skyjack ii involved in the accident was manufactured in mec case,as early as.additionally,he identified internal skyjack memoranda,dated beginning january,discussing the need to implement pothole protection,and reflecting plans to do so as of august.
after discovery,skyjack and rsc moved to exclude the testimony of both experts,and for summary judgment,arguing that without expert testimony plaintiffs could not prove the sjii lift was defective and unreasonably dangerous.the district court,relying on daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d,held the experts testimony was neither relevant or reliable and excluded the evidence.it further held plaintiffs could not prove their claims without expert testimony and granted summary judgment.on appeal,plaintiffs argue the district court abused its discretion when it excluded the expert testimony,and summary judgment was inappropriate.
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.jaurequi carter,cir.summary judgment is proper if there exists no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.when ruling on a summary judgment motion,a court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.dush appleton,cir citing bell,cir.however,a nonmovant must present more than a scintilla of evidence and must advance specific facts to create a genuine issue of material fact for trial,at citing rolscreen pella prods.of louis,cir.
this is a diversity action and is governed by state substantive law.erie tompkins.the parties agree missouri substantive law controls.
under missouri law,
t he term products liability claim means a claim or portion of a claim in which the plaintiff seeks relief in the form of damages on a theory that the defendant is strictly liable for such damages because 
the defendant,wherever situated in the chain of commerce,transferred a product in the course of his business and 
the product was used in a manner reasonably anticipated and 
either or both of the following 
a the product was then in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous when put to a reasonably anticipated use,and the plaintiff was damaged as a direct result of such defective condition as existed when the product was sold or 
b the product was then unreasonably dangerous when put to a reasonably anticipated use without knowledge of its characteristics,and the plaintiff was damaged as a direct result of the product being sold without an adequate warning.
to prove a claim of strict products liability,a missouri plaintiff must prove that the product was defective and dangerous when put to a reasonable use anticipated by the manufacturer and that the plaintiff sustained damage as a direct result of the defect.peters motors,citations omitted see also nesselrode executive beechcraft,en banc t he primary inquiry in a design defect case is whether the of the way it is an unreasonable risk of danger to the consumer or user when put to normal use.
in missouri,the concept of unreasonable danger is to be treated as an ultimate issue for the jury.rodriguez suzuki motor,en banc citing nesselrode,at.missouri courts have consistently refused to impose any judicial definition of unreasonably dangerous whether derived from consumer expectations,or otherwise.id.instead,juries give the concept of unreasonable danger content by applying their collective intelligence and experience to the broad evidentiary spectrum of facts and circumstances presented by the parties.thompson brown williamson tobacco,citations and quotations omitted.the parties are entitled to assist the jury in defining the term unreasonably dangerous by presenting evidence that the utility of a design outweighs its risks,or that consumer expectations were violated,or any other theory of unreasonable dangerousness supported by the evidence.id.citations and quotations omitted.such evidence,however,is not required and a plaintiff is not,for example,required to prove the existence of a reasonable alternative design in order to make a submissible case.id.at.further,a plaintiff has no burden to prove a product failure or malfunction,stinson dupont de nemours and,citation and quotations omitted,and t he existence of a defect may be inferred from circumstantial evidence with or without the aid of an expert witness,klein general.
for summary judgment purposes,the evidence plaintiffs offer shows the sjii lift sappington was operating was manufactured and leased by defendants.further,the alleged defect,the failure of the lift to remain stable during an encounter with a drop off,existed at the time the lift was manufactured and leased.neither defendant contends the subject lift had been altered in any manner.finally,there is no dispute sappington death was the direct result of injuries he sustained when the lift overturned.
additionally,there has been no evidence offered to suggest sappington was using the sjii lift in a manner not reasonably anticipated.skyjack hints sappington was at fault for the accident because he failed to observe the depression,and sappington caused the accident when he drove the lift into the pothole.using lifts at constructions sites,where depressions or potholes are common,does not constitute an unforeseeable misuse of the product.furthermore,even assuming the depression constituted an open and obvious hazard,and sappington fault contributed to the accident,e vidence that the defect was readily apparent would not bar plaintiffs recovery,but could be properly considered in apportioning fault.miller varity.
the defendants also suggest the absence of evidence of other accidents is fatal to plaintiffs claims.evidence of the absence of other accidents has been held relevant and admissible in a product liability case.savant lincoln eng g.a defendant offering such evidence,however,must show no accidents occurred when the product was used under conditions substantially similar to those faced by plaintiff and that an adequate number of those situations occurred to make the absence of accidents meaningful.id.even assuming a lack of other accident evidence could,as a matter of law,bar plaintiffs claims,there has been no such evidence offered in this case.
in considering defendants arguments,the district court,relying on morrison kubota tractor,noted 
w here the perilous nature of the product and the danger of using it is obvious and not concealed where its normal functioning creates no danger not known or appreciated by the user where it is properly manufactured to accomplish the function for which it is designed,the manufacturer has satisfied the law demands and is under no duty to make it more safe by providing a safety device.
dist.order.
morrison,however,is inapposite,and offers no support for the district court erroneous decision to grant summary judgment.in morrison,the missouri court of appeals was asked to determine whether a trial court erred in directing verdicts on plaintiffs negligence claims.at.the court of appeals held a manufacturer can not be held liable under a negligent design theory when the defect or danger is open,obvious and apparent.id.the holding of morrison,however,was specifically limited to negligence claims.id.at.since morrison,the court of appeals has confirmed the open and obvious nature of a hazard does not bar recovery by a plaintiff in a strict products liability claim,but may be considered in apportioning fault.miller,at.
the district court ultimately concluded,and the defendants assert on appeal,that plaintiffs can not maintain a submissible claim for strict products liability without the excluded expert testimony.we disagree.a claim of strict products liability may be based solely upon circumstantial evidence and does not require expert testimony.klein,at.moreover,a missouri plaintiff is not required to present evidence that the utility of a design outweighs its risks,or that consumer expectations were violated,or any other theory of unreasonable dangerousness supported by the evidence.thompson,at.in this case,the contested issue on summary judgment is whether the lift was unreasonably dangerous,and is an issue which resides solely within the province of the jury.rodriguez,at.plaintiffs contend sappington was killed because the lift failed to remain upright when it encountered the common workplace hazard.according to plaintiffs,the propensity for lifts to tip over when driven into drop offs was a concern within the industry before the subject lift was manufactured.plaintiffs have offered evidence tending to show the technology exists,and indeed existed in,to manufacture more stable a lift which would not have overturned under the conditions presented by this accident.this evidence does not require the testimony of experts,and we are not able to say,under missouri law of strict products liability,there is no conceivable way for plaintiffs to convince a jury the lift was unreasonably dangerous.
it is true that manufacturers need only build reasonably safe products,and that when plaintiffs fail to prove otherwise they do not make a submissible case.nevertheless,this determination is normally made after plaintiff puts on evidence.unless there is no conceivable way for plaintiff to prove the ultimate facts alleged,plaintiff should be allowed to proceed.

accordingly,we determine summary judgment was improvidently granted.
we next district court bases for excluding the testimony of plaintiffs experts.
the district court exclusion of expert testimony is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.turner iowa fire equip,cir.
the admissibility of expert testimony is governed by federal rule of evidence under rule the trial judge acts as a gatekeeper screening evidence for relevance and reliability.daubert,at.rule reflects an attempt to liberalize the rules governing the admission of expert testimony.the rule clearly is one of admissibility rather than exclusion.lauzon senco,cir internal quotations and citations omitted.the exclusion of an expert opinion is proper only if it is so fundamentally unsupported that it can offer no assistance to the jury.wood.mining,cir internal quotations and citation omitted.
a district court should apply a test when screening testimony under rule.
first,evidence based on scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge must be useful to the finder of fact in deciding the ultimate issue of fact.this is the basic rule of relevancy.second,the proposed witness must be qualified to assist the finder of fact.third,the proposed evidence must be reliable or trustworthy in an evidentiary sense,so that,if the finder of fact accepts it as true,it provides the assistance the finder of fact requires.
lauzon,at internal citations and quotations omitted.
in daubert,the supreme court provided a list of factors a district court should consider when performing its gatekeeper function,including,
whether the theory or technique can be and has been tested whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication the known or potential rate of error and whether the theory has been generally accepted.
subsequent cases have proposed additional factors,including,whether the expertise was developed for litigation or naturally flowed from the expert research whether the proposed expert ruled out other alternative explanations and whether the proposed expert sufficiently connected the proposed testimony with the facts of the case.
the district court excluded the results of johnson testing finding them irrelevant and unreliable.in so holding,the court relied on what it perceived to be numerous important dissimilarities between the test conditions and the accident conditions.we discuss each below.
the district court focused on the fact johnson testing involved the sjiii,instead of the sjii,and apparently concluded johnson testing would only have been relevant and reliable had it been conducted using an sjii lift retrofitted with pothole protection.the district court reasoning on this issue,and in other portions of its order,reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of plaintiffs theory of the case and the arguments advanced by the plaintiffs.plaintiffs do not argue the sjii lift should have been retrofitted with pothole protection.instead,they contend the accident would not have happened had sappington been operating an sjiii lift,which in was a reasonable alternative design to the sjii lift.because plaintiffs offer the sjiii as a reasonable alternative to the sjii,testing of the sjiii is highly relevant.assuming plaintiffs prove the sjiii design was feasible at the time the sjii was manufactured,they still must prove the sjiii would not have tipped over under conditions similar to those present at the site.while the district court viewed johnson tests as an attempt to reconstruct the accident using the wrong lift,johnson performed the tests to show the proffered reasonable alternative design the sjiii would not have tipped under similar conditions.thus,johnson testing of the sjiii is highly relevant,whereas testing on an sjii would have been irrelevant.
the district court also focused on the difference in overall weight between the sjii and the sjiii.the sjii lift is approximately pounds lighter than the sjiii,giving the sjiii a lower center of gravity.because center of gravity affects stability,the district court found the weight difference between the machines made testing of the sjiii irrelevant and unreliable.plaintiffs do not argue an sjii lift retrofitted with pothole protection would have prevented the accident.if they did,testing on a modified sjii machine would be necessary and weight differences between the sjii and sjiii would be relevant.instead,plaintiffs argue the sjiii lift should have replaced the sjii lift and the sjii should not have been manufactured in.once plaintiffs theory of the case is cast in the proper light,johnson testing to determine the stability parameters of the sjiii becomes highly relevant,and weight differences between it and the sjii are irrelevant.
next,the district court focused on differences between the conditions under which johnson conducted his testing and those which existed at the accident scene.in particular,the district court found the platform off which johnson drove the lift varied from the slope of the concrete flooring on which sappington was driving the lift.additionally,the court found sappington was driving on concrete and johnson tested the sjiii by driving it off a wooden platform.neither of these differences are relevant.
the slope at the accident scene was approximately percent.the slope of the platform used by johnson was approximately two percent.thus,the difference was minimal.more importantly,to the extent there was a difference,johnson testing involved a greater degree of slope,thereby presenting conditions more adverse than those present at the accident.if the lift could remain stable under more adverse conditions,johnson testing suggests it would have remained stable during the accident.
as for the difference in surface material,concrete versus wood,the record offers no explanation for why the differences would undermine the relevance or reliability of johnson tests,and we will not speculate on a matter more appropriately reserved for cross examination.
the final dissimilarity noted by the district court relates to the load on the work platform at the time of the accident,compared to the load on the platform during the testing.the parties agree the platform load at the time of the accident was approximately pounds.johnson,however,believed the load was approximately pounds less.thus,he did not test the sjiii under the same load conditions as were present at the time of the accident.
as the load on the work platform increases,the center of gravity changes and reduces stability.the pound difference in work platform load between the accident and the testing,however,is not sufficient in our view to render johnson testing inadmissible.as a general rule,the factual basis of an expert opinion goes to the credibility of the testimony,not the admissibility.triton hardrives,cir quoting loudermill dow chem,cir 
we conclude it was an abuse of discretion to exclude the results of johnson testing because the purported dissimilarities offered by the district court are not relevant or sufficient to render johnson opinions inadmissible.
the district court also excluded the opinions of blundell,finding them irrelevant and unreliable.as with johnson opinions,the reasons articulated by the district court for excluding blundell are considered below.
the district court noted blundell relied on johnson testing to form part of the factual basis for his opinions,because the sjiii remained stable during testing it would not have tipped under the circumstances present during the accident.the district court,having mistakenly concluded johnson testing was designed to show the sjii would not have tipped over if retrofitted with pothole protection,concluded brundell opinions were based on irrelevant and unreliable information.as noted,johnson testing should not have been rejected and the district court erred in excluding brundell opinions because they rely in part on johnson testing.
the district court also refused to allow blundell to rely on testing skyjack performed on the sjiii lift.even assuming johnson testing was sufficiently flawed to warrant its rejection,plaintiffs argue the stability testing conducted by skyjack to ensure the sjiii complied with the current ansi standard can be used to prove the sjiii would not have overturned in the accident.according to plaintiffs,skyjack drove the sjiii into a drop off times and on every occasion it remained stable,thereby proving it would not have tipped in the accident.the district court rejected the argument,finding the testimony from skyjack expert did not explain under what conditions the testing was performed,height of the work platform,slope,and the amount of load on the work platform.
the deposition testimony of skyjack expert does not include information about the height of the platform,slope,or the amount of load on the work platform during skyjack testing.skyjack,however,concedes its sjiii lift complies with the current ansi standard and has passed the testing requirements imposed by the standard.therefore,as explained belo
