silvandria iracheta was driving a general motors oldsmobile toronado on a highway near laredo just after noon on a clear day when she suddenly veered across the center line into an oncoming at a closing speed of over.the truck rolled over the car,ripping off its hood and roof,and severely damaging its left side.the collision ruptured the truck fuel system,splattering diesel over both vehicles that exploded in flame.several minutes after the car came to rest at the side of the road,a second fire exploded,this one fueled by gasoline from the car.silvandria died instantly in the collision,and her son david,seated in the back,may have as well.her other passenger,son edgar,belted in the passenger seat,remained conscious and died in the second fire.
the boys grandmother,rita iracheta,sued general motors corporation on behalf of their estates the boys father could not be found to bring a wrongful death action.a jury failed to find that silvandria negligence caused the boys deaths and found instead that edgar death,but not david,was caused by a design defect in the car which allowed gasoline to siphon from the fuel system.the jury found edgar pain and anguish damages to be million.the trial court rendered judgment on the verdict,only general motors appealed,and the court of appeals affirmed 
in this court,general motors raises a number of issues,one of which,we conclude,is dispositive there is no evidence that the second fire was caused by the defect in the toronado.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and render judgment for general motors.
iracheta proof of causation rests on the testimony of two expert witnesses.one,eduardo sanchez,testified on the origins and causes of the fires resulting from the collision.the diesel from the truck ruptured fuel system,he said,exploded on impact in a fireball that,although intense,lasted only the few seconds it took for the toronado to skid down the highway to a stop.consistent with the accounts of the truck driver and two other men at the scene,sanchez testified that after this first flash fire,small spot fires broke out and continued to burn in the car engine and passenger compartments and in the grass around the vehicle for about ten minutes,more or less.the three men approached the vehicle and tried to free edgar,who was screaming in pain in the front seat,but the car was too hot for them to reach inside.suddenly,they heard what they described as a whoosh sound at the rear of the vehicle,and the second fire exploded,fueled by gasoline from the car.although the gas tank had remained intact,sanchez testified that gasoline leaked from the fuel system onto the ground for several minutes until the vapors ignited.
determining whether the car fuel system could leak was not,according to sanchez,within the scope of his expertise.for that,he said,he relied on iracheta other expert,john stilson,a mechanical engineer with experience in accident reconstruction.stilson testified that gasoline could leak or siphon from the fuel tank only through a return line that ran from the engine along the left side of the car to the tank.the line was made of steel tubing and did not rupture in the collision,but it was attached on one end to the engine and on the other to the tank by short,flexible rubber hoses that were both found to have burned away at some point.tests stilson conducted on a similar vehicle showed that when the car was inclined toward the front,as iracheta was when it came to rest off to the side of the highway,gasoline would siphon out of the tank onto the ground if either the front hose or the rear hose was opened.this condition,stilson testified,was a design defect in the car.
although stilson found that gasoline would siphon from the return line at either end,depending on where the breach occurred,iracheta concedes that she had to prove that gasoline leaked at the rear of the car rather than the front,since all of the witnesses present at the scene testified that the whoosh and the second fire came from the rear,and sanchez testified that the fire could not have happened as it did if gasoline had not siphoned at the rear.furthermore,iracheta concedes that she was required to prove that the rear hose was severed or torn in the impact before it burned otherwise the gasoline escaping from the burning hose would have been ignited immediately by the flame and there would never have been the whoosh sound that everyone present heard.as iracheta counsel explained at oral argument 
justice you do have to show siphoning occurred at the rear to get causation here on this record,because it would be inconclusive if there were only siphoning at the front 
counsel we have to present evidence that a jury could reasonably find that the siphoning caused a spill at the rear of the car,yes.
justice does it matter how the rear opened up does it matter whether it burned through or whether it was caused by the collision 
counsel i think it may,and the reason for that is the whoosh.again,it comes back to how did this car suddenly,after several to engulfed in this cloud of flames that ultimately killed edgar iracheta if the line burned,there could have been just a jet stream of flame like at the end of a welding torch,which might not create that whoosh.and here the spill at the there was no immediate fire,or no testimony that there was any immediate fire,falling on the a vapor that spread until it found an ignition source and then what sanchez testimony establishes.also the were at the vehicle,and that why this is not a circumstantial evidence case that the fire came from the rear,the whoosh came from the rear.and sanchez in his investigation in reaching his conclusions talked to all of those eyewitnesses,talked to stilson,observed the replica of the car,observed the car itself,the damage that went all down the side of the car,including the rear where the rear hose was broken,and that how he came to his opinion that the rear hose was broken and that where it siphoned.
the difficulty is that there are significant conflicts in and between the testimony of sanchez and stilson,each stressing both the extent and the limits of his own expertise and that of the other.stilson testified that his assignment in the case was to determine exactly where gasoline leaked or siphoned from the toronado fuel tank and that he took it upon himself to make that determination this,he stated,was his area of expertise,not sanchez stilson testified that gasoline siphoned at the front of the return line and did not siphon at the rear the rear hose on the return line,he said,was not injured in the collision but burned away in the fire 
sanchez testified at his deposition that he could not say where the leak in the return fuel line occurred that he was unable to establish whether the line had been compromised at impact that he was not an expert on that subject,and that he would leave the determination to someone else at trial,however,sanchez was percent certain that the leak occurred at the rear of the car and not at the front for one thing,he said,there was no evidence of intensified fire in the front and for another,a leak at the front of the car could not have caused the whoosh at the rear furthermore,sanchez stated,he had been told by stilson that gasoline siphoned from the rear hose because it was damaged by the impact of the two vehicles but later in his testimony,sanchez admitted that stilson had told him many times the rear hose had burned through,not that it broke from the impact of the two vehicles sanchez stated that it was impossible for the rear hose to have burned through because gasoline in the hose would have been ignited immediately,without the delay and the whoosh sound he was percent sure of this,too yet at another point he testified that where the leak occurred was immaterial because fires inside the car and in the surrounding grass could have ignited the gasoline vapors the internally conflicting nature of sanchez testimony is perhaps best illustrated in the following answers to questions by iracheta counsel within four minutes of each other at trial as indicated in the reporter record 
q i written up here,sir,the question where did the line siphon and i referring to the return line.that is a question that you have given an answer to in this case,correct 
a that correct.
q would you tell us your understanding of whether or not that was stilson area of expertise for purposes of this case 
a yes,it was.
q so although stilson was asked his opinion in the case with regard to the question of where did the return line siphon,would you tell the jury is that your area to answer 
a that is my area of expertise.
to support his opinion that gasoline siphoned from the rear hose,sanchez offered simply that he had excluded the only other possibility which was that gasoline or vapors from the filler neck where gasoline is pumped into the tank ignited.he believed that vapor from the tank would be too lean and that the gasoline in the tank would have had to boil out onto the ground before it could ignite,which it was not hot enough to do sanchez asserted that the grass fires were not hot enough to have caused gasoline or vapors to escape from the filler neck and ignite even though he had testified that those same fires could have ignited any gasoline leak,and despite the unchallenged testimony of the eyewitnesses that fires in and around the car made it too hot to approach.sanchez also asserted that the initial flash fire was too short in duration to heat the fuel tank sanchez cited no testing or other basis for these opinions.
confronted at trial by sanchez testimony the previous day,stilson stated that while he still believed that the rear hose had burned away,instead of being severed in the impact,his was only one explanation although stilson continued to insist that the return fuel line siphoned at the front of the car,contrary to what sanchez had said,he would not take exception with sanchez that siphoning at the rear was a possibility 
the court of appeals concluded that sanchez was not qualified to render an opinion regarding where the siphoning actually occurred and further,that n othing in the record shows sanchez engineering the fuel line ruptured in the rear end of the car.the court nevertheless concluded that there is legally sufficient evidence to support a finding that the toronado fuel system failed during the crash namely 
stilson opinion that the front rubber hose of the return line failed in some manner stilson opinion that one explanation for a compromise in the rear hose is that it burned away and general motors expert opinion that the hoses did not rupture 
but none of this evidence supports a finding that a fuel system failure resulted in the second fire.there is no evidence that the second fire could have been caused by a failure of the front hose or the burning of the rear hose indeed,sanchez testimony was exactly the opposite.the court cite to general motors expert testimony in this context is difficult to understand,since it directly contradicts iracheta theory that the rear hose was ruptured by the impact.the court of appeals added 
problematically,stilson theorized that the return line opened near the front of the vehicle as a result of the initial impact,but sanchez determined that the fire detonated near the vehicle rear.although this conflict may appear to be fatal to iracheta claim,sanchez recognized that there might be a conflict between his theory and stilson.specifically,sanchez stated but it could have been,it immaterial,the gasoline is out of that environment,out of the contained fuel system.whether it did leak in the front or whether it leaked in the back is immaterial in my opinion.
we agree with the court of appeals that the conflict between stilson and sanchez appears fatal to iracheta claim,but we do not agree that the conflict can be avoided by sanchez bare assertion that it immaterial.undisputedly,gasoline could have siphoned from the return fuel line at both the front and the rear.tests proved that.but there is no evidence that siphoning at the front could have caused the second fire in the way every witness testified it occurred.indeed,sanchez himself testified that siphoning at the front could not have caused the second fire for sanchez to characterize his conflict with stilson as immaterial is contradicted by their testimony.
we agree with the court of appeals that sanchez was not qualified to testify.it was iracheta burden to establish sanchez qualifications sanchez and stilson both testified that sanchez was not qualified to offer an opinion on where the siphoning occurred.although both also equivocated on the subject,experts can not be as ambivalent as these two were and establish the privilege of offering opinion testimony under rule of the texas rules of evidence.
furthermore,while sanchez did assert that gasoline siphoned from the return fuel line at the rear of the car,the only support he offered for this opinion was that he had eliminated all other possibilities.he eliminated the obvious possibility that fuel or vapors from the tank filler neck ignited only by saying so,offering no other basis for his opinion.such a bare opinion was not enough.just last year we wrote 
we noted in burrow arce that,although expert opinion testimony often provides valuable evidence in a case,it is the basis of the witness opinion,and not the witness qualifications or his bare opinions alone,that can settle an issue as a matter of law a claim will not stand or fall on the mere ipse dixit of a credentialed witness.burrow arce.opinion testimony that is conclusory or speculative is not relevant evidence,because it does not tend to make the existence of a material fact more probable or less probable.see evid.this court has labeled such testimony as incompetent evidence,and has often held that such conclusory testimony can not support a judgment.cas.underwriters rhone,holding that a witness statements were but bare conclusions and therefore incompetent see also wadewitz montgomery,a n expert witness conclusory statement will neither establish good faith at the summary judgment stage nor raise a fact issue to defeat summary judgment.furthermore,this court has held that such conclusory statements can not support a judgment even when no objection was made to the statements at trial.dallas ry.terminal gossett,it is well settled that the naked and unsupported opinion or conclusion of a witness does not constitute evidence of probative force and will not support a jury finding even when admitted without objection.rhone,at holding that bare conclusions did not amount to any evidence at all,and that the fact that they were admitted without objection add ed nothing to their probative force see also merrell dow,havner,when the expert brings to court little more than his credentials and a subjective opinion,this is not evidence that would support a judgment if for some reason such testimony were admitted in a trial without objection,would a reviewing court be obliged to accept it as some evidence the answer is no.
thus,even if sanchez had been qualified to testify about where gasoline leaked,none of his opinions rise to the level of competent evidence.
moreover,sanchez testimony was rather clearly unreliable.it had no basis outside his own assertions,which were irreconcilably.a fair view of his testimony is that he was willing to say almost anything,directly contradicting himself iracheta argues that general motors waived any complaint regarding the reliability of sanchez testimony by waiting until the end of to object.but the utterly conflicting nature of sanchez testimony was not fully apparent until.indeed,the conflict in his testimony regarding his and stilson respective expertise did not occur until redirect.the unreliability of expert opinions may be apparent as early as the discovery process but also may not emerge until trial,during or after the expert testimony,or even later.an objection must be timely,but it need not anticipate a deficiency before it is apparent.here we can not say that general motors objection following came too late.
apart from sanchez testimony,only stilson could support the verdict,and it falls short.in stilson view,the rear hose on the return fuel line burned away.but as sanchez demonstrated,the fire that burned th
