augusta fiberglass coatings,augusta appeals from an adverse jury verdict against it in a personal injury action filed by doug mccoy and his wife,linda mccoy.the mccoys alleged that augusta manufactured a defective tank that proximately caused doug mccoy injuries.the mccoys originally sued lion oil company lion oil where mccoy injuries occurred they then amended their complaint to state a cause of action for product liability against augusta.prior to trial,lion oil filed a complaint against custom fiberglass products,custom,mccoy employer,and custom and augusta filed against each other.the mccoys settled with lion oil and custom workers compensation carrier who had intervened in the case.the case ultimately proceeded to trial with augusta as the sole defendant.despite augusta being the sole defendant at trial,the jury was allowed to apportion fault to mccoy and lion oil,applying comparative fault principles of arkansas law.the jury found in favor of the mccoys,finding that augusta was percent at fault for mccoy injuries,lion oil was percent at fault,and mccoy was ten percent at fault.
augusta appeals,arguing that the district erred in refusing to allow the jury to apportion fault to custom in accordance with arkansas code annotated abused its discretion in refusing to instruct the jury that custom fault could be a superseding proximate cause of mccoy injuries and abused its discretion in refusing to admit into evidence an occupational therapist report.we affirm.
background 
mccoy,an employee of custom,and his supervisor,luther amos,arrived at lion oil to repair a leaking flange on a tank.their vehicle contained hard hats,safety glasses,rubber gloves,and a pair of size rubber sizes larger than mccoy normally wore.after their arrival at lion oil at noon,mccoy and amos met jeff carr,a lion oil engineer,who showed them the tank in need of repair.carr voiced concern about amos and mccoy working on the tank because he knew that they might be exposed to caustic soda.according to amos,carr informed him and mccoy that there had been caustic soda in the tank.amos shared concern about potential exposure to caustic soda while working on the tank,as he expected there to be some liquid in the gusset of the tank.after amos went into the tank and observed a defect in the tank seal,he figured there would probably be some caustic soda.amos had worked with caustic soda before and was aware of its hazardous nature.when amos had gotten the caustic soda on him in the past,he simply washed it off and continued working.
mccoy gave conflicting testimony on whether carr,or any other lion oil employee,advised him and amos that the tank at one time contained caustic soda prior to them beginning work on the tank but mccoy maintained that when he and amos first viewed the tank,he could tell by looking at the flange that it was leaking because it had a white,chalky substance all over it.the substance had traveled down the tank and had dried.mccoy testified that when caustic soda dries,it turns white and chalky.
after carr showed mccoy and amos the tank,lion oil administered a safety course and safety test to mccoy and amos.amos passed the test,but mccoy did not.according to mccoy,he had difficulty understanding the test questions.mccoy had only completed the ninth grade,taking special education classes.while in school,mccoy had difficulty reading.after completing the ninth grade,he attended vocational technical school for four years but never received a general educational development ged certificate.a vocational rehabilitation expert testified that she administered an intelligence test to mccoy,which revealed his intelligence quotient iq to be,placing him in the borderline to mildly mentally handicapped range of intelligence.after mccoy failed the written safety test,a lion oil employee verbally reviewed the questions with mccoy.
at,mccoy and amos started working on the tank according to mccoy,no one instructed him to wear rubber boots while working on the tank,and the rubber boots in the company work truck were not his size.amos supervised mccoy while mccoy was cutting into the tank.before mccoy cut into the gusset,amos corrected mccoy on which way to turn the cutting wheel,as amos thought that there might be liquid in the gusset.when mccoy made the initial cut,he noticed about a half of a coffee cup of a substance spill from the gusset.amos also saw the liquid come out of the gusset,but he did not see any of the liquid come into contact with mccoy.at amos direction,mccoy washed his foot and sock with a water hose.he then put the wet sock and his leather boot back on and returned to work.about to minutes later,mccoy noticed that his foot was burning.he informed amos and carr.carr sent mccoy to the nurses station,where his foot was cleansed,a cream was applied,and his foot was bandaged.mccoy signed a lion oil accident report that stated that the accident occurred as a result of mccoy walking in caustic water.mccoy sat in the company truck and did not work the rest of the day.after completing work on the tank,mccoy drove them home.that night,mccoy sought medical treatment for his foot.
mccoy and his wife sued lion oil and others,alleging that mccoy burned his foot on lion oil premises when caustic soda escaped from a tank on which he was working.lion oil then filed complaints against augusta,s b,and mccoy employer,custom.the district court permitted custom workers compensation carrier,mutual insurance company mutual,to intervene in the lawsuit.augusta answered the complaint,requesting that the negligence or fault of all parties found responsible be apportioned pursuant to arkansas code annotated.
thereafter,s b was dismissed without prejudice from the lawsuit.lion oil then filed a notice of nonparty liability pursuant to arkansas code annotated against custom,augusta,and s custom then filed its against augusta.augusta answered the,requesting that the negligence or fault of all parties found responsible be apportioned pursuant to.additionally,augusta against custom and lion oil,pleading entitlement to contribution and indemnity under.
after a settlement conference,the mccoys settled with lion oil and mutual.as a result,augusta moved to adopt lion oil notice of nonparty liability as to custom and s b and filed a notice of nonparty liability as to lion oil.the mccoys moved to strike augusta notice of nonparty liability as to lion oil and objected to augusta motion to adopt by reference lion oil notice of nonparty liability as to custom and s 
the district court then entered orders dismissing lion oil from the suit with prejudice and striking the notice of nonparty liability as to custom because it was an immune employer under arkansas law.according to the court,custom fault could not be apportioned by the jury,but its fault could be considered as a superseding proximate cause of mccoy damages.the court also found that lion oil fault could be apportioned by the jury.subsequently,the district court ordered the dismissal of the following claims lion oil claims against custom the by augusta against custom and lion oil complaint against augusta.the remaining claims were the mccoys claims against augusta and augusta against lion oil.mutual remained as an intervener.
at trial,the district court did not permit the jury to apportion any fault to custom instead,the jury could only apportion fault to mccoy,augusta,and lion oil.also,the district court instructed the jury with regard to proximate cause as follows 
defendant contends and has the burden of proving that following any act or omission on its part,an event,such as the conduct of lion oil,intervened that in itself caused damage completely independent of defendant conduct.if you so find,then defendant act or omission was not a proximate cause of any damage resulting from the intervening event because that event supercedes defendant conduct.
the fact that another cause,such as lion oil conduct,intervened between any act or omission on the part of the defendant,and the damage for which claim is made,would not relieve the defendant of liability if the damage is reasonably foreseeable as a natural and probable result of any act or omission on the part of the defendant.
emphasis added.the district court declined to give augusta requested instruction,which stated that 
following any act or omission on the defendant part,an event,such as the conduct of lion oil or plaintiff employer,intervened that in itself caused damage completely independent of defendant conduct.
emphasis added.
the jury found in favor of the mccoys.the jury determined by a preponderance of the evidence that augusta manufactured the tank in a defective condition,rendering it unreasonably dangerous,which was a proximate cause of the mccoys damages.the jury apportioned fault between the parties as follows ten percent fault of mccoy,percent fault of augusta,and percent fault of lion oil.
after the district court entered judgment,augusta moved for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial,and the district court denied the motion.in its denial order,the district court noted that in its pretrial order it had ruled that the jury would not be permitted to apportion fault to custom because it was an immune employer.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,augusta asserts that the district court erred in refusing to allow the jury to apportion fault to custom in accordance with arkansas code annotated abused its discretion in refusing to instruct the jury that custom fault could be a superseding proximate cause of mccoy injuries and abused its discretion in refusing to admit into evidence an occupational therapist report.
apportionment of fault to custom 
a recent arkansas supreme court decision has mooted augusta first argument that the district court should have permitted the jury to apportion fault to mccoy employer,custom,under arkansas code annotated.see johnson rockwell automation.in johnson,the filed a notice of nonparty fault pursuant to,designating the plaintiff employer as a nonparty at fault.in response,the plaintiff argued that the provision of violated the arkansas constitution.id.the arkansas supreme court agreed,holding that the provision invades the powers granted to the judiciary by the arkansas constitution in violation of article,and amendment,by adding to or varying the arkansas rules of civil procedure.id.
when a provision is struck down as unconstitutional,it is treated as if it had never been passed.newton clinical reference,cir quoting land,pledger.thus,the law reverts back to what it was prior to the passage of the civil justice reform act,under which the jury could not apportion the fault of nonparties.see,cameron constr,a jury should not be permitted to assign a percentage of fault to a person who is not a party to the suit.
therefore,the district court appropriately declined to allow the jury to assign a percentage of fault to custom,a nonparty to the suit.
jury instructions 
augusta next argues that,although the district court previously ruled that the jury could consider any fault of custom as an intervening proximate cause of the mccoys damages at trial,it failed to give augusta proffered jury instruction,which would have allowed the jury to consider the negligence of lion oil and custom as an intervening proximate cause.augusta asserts that ample evidence exists to show that following any act or omission on its part,custom negligence caused mccoy damage completely independent of augusta manufacturing defect.it also points out that intervening proximate cause is normally a question of fact for the jury to determine.
in response,the mccoys maintain that the district court correctly denied augusta jury instruction on intervening proximate cause because an intervening proximate cause is an event that occurs after the defendant act or omission that,in itself,causes damage completely independent of the defendant conduct.according to the mccoys,it is undisputed that the gussets on the tank did not have weep holes,as required by the specifications.the testimony also shows that if augusta had drilled weep holes in the gusset,the caustic soda would have escaped prior to mccoy servicing the tank therefore,there is no other conclusion but that augusta provided a product in a defective condition and that this defective condition was the proximate cause of mccoy injury.
we review a district court jury instructions for an abuse of discretion.brown sandals resorts int,cir.a district court possesses broad discretion in instructing the jury,and jury instructions do not need to be technically perfect or even a model of clarity.id.internal quotations and citation omitted.our review is limited to whether the jury instructions,taken as a whole,fairly and adequately represent the evidence and applicable law in light of the issues presented to the jury in a particular case.id.internal quotations and citation omitted.when sitting in diversity,a district court jury instructions must fairly and adequately represent the law of the forum state.id.the jury should receive instructions on issues supported by competent evidence in the record the trial court is not required to instruct on issues that do not find support in the record.id.and,even if we find that a district court erroneously instructed the jury,we will reverse only where the error affects the substantial rights of the parties.id.
as an initial matter,we observe that the district court jury instruction did not prohibit the jury from considering whether any fault of custom constituted an intervening proximate cause,thereby absolving augusta of liability.the district court instruction advised the jury that augusta had the burden to prove that,following any act or omission on its part,an event,such as the conduct of lion oil,intervened that in itself caused damage completely independent of defendant conduct.emphasis added.the instruction then advised the jury that if it such an intervening event occurred,then augusta act or omission was not a proximate cause of any damage resulting from the intervening event because that event supercedes augusta conduct.
an objective reader would interpret the phrase such as to mean for example.orion financial of american foods group,cir.therefore,the conduct of lion oil was only one example of a potential intervening event.the jury instruction did not foreclose the jury from considering custom conduct as an intervening event.thus,the district court jury instructions were not erroneous.
occupational therapist report 
finally,augusta contends that the district court erred in excluding the report of bruce,an occupational therapist to whom mccoy was referred by one of his treating physicians.the mccoys objected to the introduction of the report into evidence,asserting that had not been disclosed as an expert pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure and that his report contained conclusions.according to augusta,the disclosure requirements of rule a were inapplicable because it did not retain as an expert.augusta argues that the mccoys knew of and possessed a copy of report at least four months before the scheduled trial date.augusta contends that rule a b requires disclosure of an expert written report only if the witness is one retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony in the case and that was neither retained nor specially employed by augusta.
additionally,augusta asserts that,during the mccoys of,the mccoys attorney repeatedly read from and referred to specific portions of the report and,at that time,the entirety of the report became admissible under federal rule of evidence.as a result,augusta argues that the district court erroneously continued its refusal to allow the entire report admitted into evidence.
in response,the mccoys maintain that the district court correctly excluded report because the report contained numerous hearsay statements that did not fall under any exception to the hearsay rule.the mccoys note that is not mccoy treating physician and was not disclosed to them as an expert witness.additionally,report was not disclosed during discovery.therefore,the mccoys argue that the district court correctly allowed to testify about his examination of mccoy but not about the opinions contained in the report.finally,the mccoys argue that their attorney did not introduce the report or read from
