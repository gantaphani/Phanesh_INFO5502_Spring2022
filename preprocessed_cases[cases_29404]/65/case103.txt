appellant jose pineda is an automobile technician who was injured when the rear liftgate glass of a ford explorer shattered.he filed a products liability action against appellee ford motor company in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania and retained an expert to support his claims.after extensive discovery and a daubert hearing the district court ruled that pineda proffered expert witness was not qualified to testify and that his methodology was not reliable.the district court then granted ford motion to exclude the testimony of pineda expert and its motion for summary judgment.for the reasons set forth below,we will reverse both decisions and remand for further proceedings.
pineda was employed as an automobile technician by murphy in west chester,pennsylvania.on july,he worked to replace several components of the rear liftgate on a ford explorer.pineda initially examined the explorer on july,when the owner brought the vehicle to the dealership for repair because the rear liftgate would not close properly.pineda determined that one of the hinges that connected the liftgate glass to the body of the explorer was damaged.he also knew that,in april of,ford issued a special service instruction for repair of the liftgate brackets on explorers built between february and march,the brackets connected the lift cylinders,which supported the rear liftgate in the open position,to each side of the liftgate glass.pineda told the owner of the vehicle to refrain from using the rear liftgate until it could be repaired.he then ordered replacement lift cylinders,liftgate brackets,and liftgate hinges,all of which were available for installation on july.
that morning,pineda replaced the lift cylinders and liftgate brackets without incident.later in the afternoon,he began to replace the liftgate hinges.during his deposition,pineda described what happened next 
it was right after lunch,somewhere around,when i finished to install the hinge on the left side and moved to the right side.i got the book because there was no information related to the torque specs on the hinge,so i got the book,torqued the hinge on the glass side to the specs of the book,then put the nut on the body side.when i finished torquing the nut on the body side,i hear a click and felt like the glass was exploding.i closed my eyes and i felt something hit my leg.
i stepped back with my eyes closed,two steps.i was in so much pain on my leg that i have to open my eyes,and i saw my calf wide open.
pineda filed a complaint against ford on july,in the eastern district of pennsylvania.the complaint alleged that the liftgate glass and hinges on the ford explorer were defective in design and that ford failed to adequately warn of the dangerous condition 
in order to satisfy his burden of proof on the products liability claims,pineda retained craig clauser,as an expert.clauser produced a report on september.it concluded that the liftgate glass shattered because its design was defective in that it was only marginally able to resist fracture in its intended service and the pertinent manual and bulletins lacked adequate instructions and warnings.clauser report noted that n o improper action by pineda caused this incident to occur.
ford deposed clauser on march.he stated at the deposition that his design defect opinion was based on his comparison of warranty claims for and model year ford explorers.specifically,his analysis of performance reviews based on the warranty claims led him to conclude that models had a design defect related to the liftgate glass and hinges.his opinion was also based on opinions he found on the internet at 
as to his failure to warn opinion,clauser testified that the explorer service manual did not provide specific,instructions for replacing the liftgate brackets and hinges and reconnecting them to the liftgate glass.he further testified that the service manual failed to warn that the need for following such instructions was a safety issue.clauser admitted that,in reaching his conclusions,he did not perform any objective testing of his own,stress analysis or other experiments on the liftgate glass of the vehicle at issue or on explorers generally.
after the deposition,ford filed motions to exclude clauser testimony and for summary judgment.alternatively,it moved for a pretrial daubert hearing.the bases for these motions were that clauser was unqualified to provide expert testimony and that,even if he were qualified,clauser testimony was unreliable under federal rule of evidence and daubert the district court granted the motion for a daubert hearing,which was held on september.prior to the hearing,on july,clauser provided a supplemental report,in which his opinions from the first report remained unchanged.nonetheless,at the start of the hearing,pineda voluntarily withdrew his design defect claim and proceeded only on his failure to warn claim.
clauser was the only witness to testify at the daubert hearing.pineda counsel first asked clauser to discuss his credentials as a professional engineer with experience in materials analysis and systems failure analysis.clauser admitted that he was not a warnings expert,except to the extent that a warning and instructions are solution s to an engineering problem.he also testified about ford safety recall instruction the sri,which described the procedure for replacing the liftgate brackets and hinges on the ford explorer.clauser stated that the sri,unlike the service manual used by pineda,provided adequate warnings and proper,detailed instructions for the replacement of the liftgate brackets and hinges 
by opinion and order dated november,the district court granted ford motion to exclude clauser testimony in its entirety because clauser admitted that he was not qualified as a warnings expert when discussing alternative warnings,clauser could not compare the service manual to the sri pursuant to federal rule of evidence and clauser testimony was not based on an accepted methodology,his testimony was unreliable.the district court held ford motion for summary judgment in abeyance pending pineda response to the issue of whether he could withstand summary judgment without expert testimony.
pineda did not file the requested response by the district court imposed deadline of november.he sought an extension of time until december,which the district court granted,but pineda failed to meet that deadline as well.on december,the district court granted ford motion for summary judgment and incorporated its november decision by reference.pineda filed a timely notice of appeal on january.his appeal does not challenge the district court conclusion that in the absence of expert testimony,a jury could not render a just and proper decision on his failure to warn claim.thus,the only issue before us is whether the district court erred in its decision to exclude clauser proffered expert testimony 
the district court had jurisdiction based upon the diversity of the parties under.we have jurisdiction over the district court final order granting ford motion for summary judgment pursuant to.under the merger rule,prior interlocutory orders such as the order excluding the testimony of clauser merge with the final judgment in a case,and the interlocutory orders to the extent that they affect the final judgment may be reviewed on appeal from the final order.in re westinghouse sec,cir.
we apply an standard when reviewing a district court decision to admit or exclude expert testimony.see kumho tire carmichael,d see also in re tmi,cir.an abuse of discretion arises when the district court decision rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact,an errant conclusion of law or an improper application of law to fact.tmi,at internal quotation marks omitted.we will not interfere with the district court decision unless there is a definite and firm conviction that the court below committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.id.internal quotation marks omitted.to the extent that the district court decision involved a legal interpretation of the federal rules of evidence,our review is plenary.see id.
under the federal rules of evidence,a trial judge acts as a gatekeeper to ensure that any and all expert testimony or evidence is not only relevant,but also reliable.kannankeril terminix int l,cir citing daubert merrell dow,d.the rules of evidence embody a strong preference for admitting any evidence that may assist the trier of fact.see also.defining relevant evidence,all of which is generally admissible,to mean evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence emphases added.rule,which governs the admissibility of expert testimony,has a liberal policy of admissibility.kannankeril,at.
rule has three major requirements the proffered witness must be an expert,must be qualified the expert must testify about matters requiring scientific,technical or specialized knowledge and the expert testimony must assist the trier of fact.id.citing in re paoli yard pcb,cir.we have interpreted the second requirement to mean that an expert testimony is admissible so long as the process or technique the expert used in formulating the opinion is reliable.id.quoting paoli,at.
the district court found that clauser failed to meet the first requirement of rule because he was not qualified as an expert on warnings.it also found that clauser did not satisfy the second requirement because his methodology was not reliable.when the district court considered whether clauser methodology was reliable,it ruled that he could not compare the service manual to the sri pursuant to federal rule of evidence.
we will first address the district court finding that clauser was not qualified as an expert.then we will discuss the district court legal interpretation of the federal rules of evidence.finally,we will address the district court finding that clauser methodology was not reliable.
qualification 
in its november opinion and order,the district court stated,clauser has freely admitted that he is not qualified as a warnings expert,and that he does not purport to be one.primarily on this basis the district court found that clauser was not qualified as an expert as required by rule.without more,we disagree with such a finding.
qualification requires that the witness possess specialized expertise.schneider ex rel.estate of schneider fried,cir.we have interpreted rule qualification requirement liberally.see see also paoli,at.we have held that a broad range of knowledge,skills,and training qualify an expert.paoli,at.
this liberal policy of admissibility extends to the substantive as well as the formal qualifications of experts.id i t is an abuse of discretion to exclude testimony simply because the trial court does not deem the proposed expert to be the best qualified or because the proposed expert does not have the specialization that the court considers most appropriate.holbrook lykes,cir accepting more general qualifications in holding that a treating physician did not have to practice a particular specialty in order to testify concerning certain matters.
after pineda withdrew his design defect claim,the district court determined that the only permissible expert was a warnings expert.the court found that clauser was not qualified to testify by primarily relying on clauser own statement at the daubert hearing that he did not offer himself as a warnings expert.
looking beyond this single statement,we find that clauser formal qualifications are unassailable.he received a bachelor of science and a master of science in metallurgical engineering and material science,and he spent considerable time studying fracture mechanics and modeling materials such as glass.upon graduation,clauser worked at westinghouse electric in its materials engineering lab and then phoenix steel corporation as the manager of quality control.he eventually joined consulting engineers in,where he has consulted with the legal profession on over two hundred cases involving the failure of glass or other ceramics.given clauser extensive formal qualifications,particularly in relation to glass,it appears that the district court was not satisfied with his substantive qualifications since he was not a warnings expert.we now turn to that inquiry.
pineda proffered clauser as an expert to establish two points.first,clauser testified that a specific,procedure was required in order to reduce the likelihood that the rear liftgate glass would fail when replacing the liftgate brackets and hinges on a ford explorer.more specifically,he opined that such a procedure should have been embodied in an instruction in the explorer service manual but was not.clauser testified during the daubert hearing that,while he was not proposing what the instruction precise language should be,he was asserting that a proper instruction was a solution to an engineering problem under the safeguarding hierarchy.to meet rule liberal qualification requirement,clauser did not need to be substantively qualified in the design of automobile rear liftgates or the drafting of service manual instructions.clauser expertise in the stresses and other forces that might cause a material such as glass to fail was more than sufficient to satisfy rule substantive qualification requirement.
additionally,clauser was proffered to establish that the service manual should have contained an explicit warning that following the necessary instruction was a safety issue.again,as an engineer,clauser did not purport to opine on how the warning should be worded or how it should appear in order to effectively convey its message to an automobile technician.he only testified that neglecting to follow the steps of an instruction when replacing the explorer liftgate brackets and hinges might result in failure of the liftgate glass,and that a warning was necessary to alert a technician to the potential problem clauser was substantively qualified to testify on this point because a proper warning is also a solution to an engineering problem.
therefore,we hold that clauser should have been qualified as an expert even though he may not have been the best qualified expert or did not have the specialization that the district court deemed necessary.
federal rules of evidence and 
at the daubert hearing,clauser addressed the issue of alternative instructions and warnings for the safe replacement of the rear liftgate brackets and hinges on ford explorers.without opining on the precise language,he asserted that the sri issued by ford in was an appropriate alternative to the service manual language.in its november opinion and order,the district court summarily ruled that federal rule of evidence precluded such a comparison.
pineda argues that he only sought to admit the sri as an example of effective language for an alternative instruction and warning,and not to prove ford culpable conduct or the need for a warning or instruction.according to pineda,any concern of unfair prejudice can be addressed by either a limiting instruction from the district court or by admitting the language of the sri without attributing it to ford.ford counters that a plain reading of rule supports the district court ruling.we hold that the court erred because it focused exclusively on rule and failed to consider rule,which governs the bases of opinion testimony by experts.that rule provides 
the facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by or made known to the expert at or before the hearing.if of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject,the facts or data need not be admissible in evidence in order for the opinion or inference to be admitted.facts or data that are otherwise inadmissible shall not be disclosed to the jury by the proponent of the opinion or inference unless the court determines that their probative value in assisting the jury to evaluate the expert opinion substantially outweighs their prejudicial effect.
the district court and the parties conflate the separate issues of whether the sri itself can be admitted into evidenc
