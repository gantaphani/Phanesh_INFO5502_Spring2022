the san francisco county superior court has a general order applicable to asbestos injury cases that provides for expedited summary judgment on days notice and without supporting papers except for an attorney certification that plaintiff discovery responses fail to identify evidence showing exposure to asbestos for which the defendant is responsible.we conclude that the trial court general order conflicts with the statewide statute governing summary judgment motions,which requires days notice and supporting evidence,and is thus invalid.code civ.we reverse the summary judgment granted under the expedited procedure.

on june,certainteed served and filed notice of its intent to request expedited summary judgment pursuant to san francisco county superior court general order general order.hearing was set for august,in days.the request was supported by the declaration of certainteed attorney,who declared that she reviewed all the discovery exchanged between the parties that certainteed provided all the information it was required to produce in discovery and that p laintiffs discovery responses and deposition testimony have not identified any competent evidence showing that decedent charles boyle was exposed to asbestos for which certainteed is responsible.certainteed did not submit any other supporting papers.plaintiffs opposed the motion.plaintiffs filed an opposition brief in which they claimed that the expedited summary judgment procedure under general order violated code of civil procedure section,and also deprived them of due process.plaintiffs also addressed the merits at length and submitted deposition transcripts,interrogatory responses,and documents as evidence allegedly showing decedent longshoreman exposure to asbestos fibers imported by certainteed.alternatively,plaintiffs requested a continuance to permit additional discovery.code civ,subd.h.
the trial court heard the expedited motion for summary judgment on august,and granted it.the court found that plaintiffs produced no evidence of exposure to asbestos or asbestos products manufactured,distributed,sold,or purchased by certainteed,and denied the requested continuance upon concluding that plaintiffs failed to state with specificity how additional discovery would establish exposure.the court entered judgment in certainteed favor on august.plaintiffs unsuccessfully moved for a new trial,and then filed this appeal.
discussiona.introduction 
there are several sources of authority for local judicial rulemaking.rutherford,cal th,d.those sources of authority include express legislative grants of power to adopt local rules for the judicial management of cases,standards of judicial administration recommended by the judicial council,and the inherent power of courts to control litigation before them.ibid.the judicial council has recognized that complex civil litigation requires specialized management to avoid placing unnecessary burdens on the trial courts or litigants,citing cal.standards jud,former.the san francisco superior court has designated cases involving death and injury from asbestos exposure as complex litigation under judicial council standards,and has established a procedure for the issuance of general orders applicable to asbestos cases filed in that court.rutherford,supra,cal th at,d.the san francisco superior court authority to issue those general orders in asbestos cases is not questioned on this appeal.it is the validity of one of those general orders that is challenged by plaintiffs.
plaintiffs argue that general order,allowing expedited summary judgment,conflicts with code of civil procedure section.it is well established that,whatever the source of authority for a local judicial rule,trial judges have no authority to issue courtroom local rules which conflict with any statute or are inconsistent with law.rutherford,supra,cal th at,d.if general order conflicts with a statewide statute,then it is an inappropriate exercise of that court rulemaking powers.id.
plaintiffs did not waive their challenge to general order 
certainteed does not defend general order as consistent with code of civil procedure section.instead,certainteed insists that plaintiffs waived their challenge to general order by failing to raise the matter adequately in the trial court.certainteed concedes that plaintiffs did state in their summary judgment opposition brief that the general order violates code of civil procedure section and due process protections,but maintains that the challenge to the general order was nevertheless waived because plaintiffs did not support their claim with reasoned argument and citations to authority and also proceeded to address the motion on the merits.
certainteed misunderstands the concept of implied waiver,or forfeiture of a claim.a reviewing court ordinarily will not consider a challenge to a ruling if an objection could have been but was not made in the trial court.citation.the purpose of this rule is to encourage parties to bring errors to the attention of the trial court,so that they may be corrected.in re cal th,d.the critical point for preservation of claims on appeal is that the asserted error must have been brought to the attention of the trial court.see,subd.a evidentiary objection must be timely made and articulate specific ground for objection.there is no requirement that a trial court objection be supported by extensive argumentation to avoid forfeiture.if an appeal is pursued,the party asserting trial court error may not then rest on the bare assertion of error but must present argument and legal authority on each point raised.people stanley cal th,d.this latter rule is founded on the principle that an appealed judgment is presumed correct,and appellant bears the burden of overcoming the presumption of correctness.kurinij hanna morton th,d.
certainteed argues that the rule on appeal requiring claims of error to be supported by reasoned argument and legal citations extends to the trial court,and that a party forfeits a claim presented to the trial court unless the claim is supported by argumentation and citations to authority.the argument is untenable.in the appellate court,a party challenge to a ruling must affirmatively prove error,which necessitates argumentation and citation of authority.but in the trial court,a party challenge to a procedure is sufficient to preserve the issue on appeal if the challenge alerts the court to the alleged error,even without elaboration through argumentation and citation of authority.
here,plaintiffs summary judgment brief stated at the outset that t he expedited summary judgment procedure provided by san francisco county general orders and violates the california code of civil procedure ccp that provides the only method for a defendant to attempt to obtain summary judgment under california law.plaintiffs also subsequently argued that general order violates constitutional guarantees of due process,citing relevant authority.plaintiffs challenge to general order thus fully stated the nature and specific grounds for the challenge,and was sufficient to bring the matter to the trial court attention.further argumentation and citation of authority was not necessary to avoid forfeiture of the issue on appeal.
nor did plaintiffs waive their challenge to general order by proceeding to argue the summary judgment motion on the merits.no waiver may be implied where,as here,a party alleging error has made its objection and then acted defensively to lessen the impact of the error.electronic equipment express,donald seiler d.a party participation in a hearing after the party objection to the hearing as unauthorized does not constitute waiver by acquiescence.see woolls superior court th,fn,d no waiver implied from participation in arbitration after arbitrator overruled objection to the proceeding.
