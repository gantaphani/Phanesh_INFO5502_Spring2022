dave barrett and clean harbors environmental services,brought this action against rhodia,alleging that barrett had suffered permanent injury while working with a chemical manufactured by rhodia.after granting a motion to exclude the causation evidence offered by plaintiffs expert witnesses,the district granted rhodia motion for summary judgment.barrett and clean harbors appeal,protesting the exclusion of some of their expert testimony and the adverse summary judgment.we affirm.
clean harbors is the country largest provider of hazardous waste material disposal.barrett worked as an ash technician for clean harbors at its kimball,nebraska plant.in that position barrett participated in ash fixation,a process by which waste materials are rendered stable so they can be safely disposed of in landfills.the chemical phosphorus pentasulfide is used during ash fixation to accelerate the stabilization of the waste material.the used by clean harbors was manufactured and supplied by rhodia.
is a hazardous chemical.it is manufactured in solid form,but it reacts with water and water vapor to form toxic hydrogen sulfide gas.airborne dust is irritating to the eyes,nose,throat,and skin.if dust is inhaled,it reacts with moisture in the lungs to form hydrogen sulfide gas.high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide gas,in the range of to parts per million ppm,can cause unconsciousness and possible death.given the dangers of,the occupational safety and health administration advises persons using the chemical to wear full protective clothing and a self contained breathing apparatus.
on june,four clean harbors employees,including barrett,were participating in the ash fixation process.the process took place inside a building at the clean harbors kimball plant.the building contains three floors,with each floor consisting of an open steel grating platform.drums of are located on the top platform.during ash fixation one employee loads a drum of into a chute located on the top floor.an employee on the second floor then opens a chute on that level,which allows the to travel to the bottom floor,where the waste materials sit.
clean harbors employee craig wheeland was working on the top platform with the drums on june.he was wearing a self contained breathing apparatus.the remaining three employees,including barrett,were situated on the second level,about twelve to fourteen feet below wheeland.none of the employees on the second level were wearing protective masks or clothing.wheeland opened a drum of and loaded it into the chute.barrett was tasked with opening the chute on the second level.as he started to open the chute,he went down and became unresponsive.another employee on the second level felt something take his breath.he and the third colleague helped evacuate barrett from the building.wheeland was later found dead on the top floor.
barrett was taken immediately to the hospital where he was unable to talk and unresponsive to questions.barrett wife testified that during his two weeks of missed work following the incident,he remained quiet and unresponsive.barrett coworkers reported that his speech slowed substantially,that he could not track in conversations or understand simple sentences,and that he could not handle even the simplest tasks,such as pushing a broom.he has since been diagnosed with dementia resulting from an anoxic brain injury,or lack of oxygen to the brain.
clean harbors hired terracon,an independent environmental company,to investigate the june incident.terracon inspected and tested the drum wheeland had opened,as well as other previously unopened drums stored at the kimball plant.terracon found hydrogen sulfide gas in the headspaces of the previously unopened drums and in the subject drum.based on those findings,the company concluded that the drum opened by wheeland may have had a maximum hydrogen sulfide concentration of ppm.because terracon found the opened drum to have been airtight,it tested possible exposure levels based on a single,rather than continuous,release of hydrogen sulfide gas.terracon then prepared a table of exposure concentrations for hydrogen sulfide gas dispersed from the opened drum at different distances,which showed a range of ppm to ppm at a distance of twelve feet from the drum.
barrett and clean harbors sued rhodia,asserting that the chemical manufacturer was strictly liable for barrett injuries.they premised the strict liability claim on two theories product defect and failure to warn.they alleged that defects in the drum had allowed condensation to form inside the drum,resulting in the creation of hydrogen sulfide gas.barrett and clean harbors asserted that when wheeland opened the drum on june,the hydrogen sulfide gas dispersed in a sufficient concentration to cause serious injury to barrett.they also alleged that the drums were sold without a warning about the risk relating to the possible formation of hydrogen sulfide gas.
barrett and clean harbors retained four expert witnesses to testify on their behalf.gerti janss has been a physician for years.she works primarily as an allergist,but is board certified in toxicology and has worked with patients who have toxicology related problems.janss examined barrett in march and was prepared to testify that barrett had suffered a brain injury resulting from exposure to hydrogen sulfide gas,that the hydrogen gas came from the drum opened by wheeland,and that barrett was exposed to a high concentration of the toxic gas,to ppm.
terry himes has been barrett treating physician since august.he is a doctor of osteopathic medicine specializing in neurology and has been board certified as a neurologist for over years.based on his treatment of barrett,himes concluded that he had suffered from a brain injury resulting from exposure to hydrogen sulfide gas.
appellants final medical expert was anne talbot,a licensed clinical psychologist with training in neuropsychology.she has practiced in the areas of psychotherapy and neuropsychotherapy for over years.talbot was prepared to testify that barrett specific brain injury,dementia,was consistent with hydrogen sulfide gas poisoning.she also intended to testify that barrett had been exposed to hydrogen sulfide gas in a concentration of to ppm.
appellants also retained edward ziegler,a safety engineer with a degree in petroleum and natural gas engineering.ziegler visited the ash fixation building at clean harbors kimball plant and observed the drums housed there,but did not conduct any testing of the drums or the chemicals involved.based on his visit to the ash fixation building and his review of the physicians findings,ziegler was prepared to testify that defects existed in the drums supplied by rhodia,that hydrogen sulfide gas had formed in the drum opened by wheeland,and that the released gas had caused barrett injury.
rhodia presented an alternative explanation for barrett injuries through its own expert,michael fox.fox has a in physical chemistry and specializes in chemical accident reconstruction.he conducted drum opening experiments in clean harbors ash fixation building,including gas dispersion calculations,to determine the potential hydrogen sulfide gas exposure to a person twelve to fourteen feet below the drum.based on the gas dispersion and drum opening tests,fox concluded that the drum opened by wheeland could not have exposed barrett to a sufficient concentrationof hydrogen sulfide,to ppm,to cause serious injury.once the hydrogen sulfide gas reached the second level,its concentration was too weak to cause injury.based on his findings,fox concluded that barrett,who had not been wearing a protective breathing apparatus at the time of the incident,had inhaled dust when he attempted to open the chute.the dust then converted into hydrogen sulfide gas when it reached barrett lungs,causing his injuries.
prior to trial rhodia filed a motion in limine challenging the qualifications of the expert witnesses retained by barrett and clean harbors.rhodia asserted that the proffered experts lacked the experience and scientific foundation to testify about the cause or concentration of barrett toxic exposure.the district court granted rhodia motion in part.it concluded that janss,himes,talbot,and edward ziegler were not qualified through their education,experience,or otherwise to render an opinion about the dispersal of hydrogen sulfide gas,the concentration level of barrett exposure to the gas,or whether his injuries were caused by hydrogen sulfide gas released from the opened drum.see.daubert merrell dow.
the district court did rule,however,that janss was qualified to testify about barrett symptoms and whether his symptoms were consistent with exposure to particular levels of hydrogen sulfide gas.the court concluded that himes was qualified to testify about barrett symptoms and injury.talbot was permitted to testify about barrett condition and whether it was consistent with exposure to hydrogen sulfide gas.appellants safety expert,ziegler,was qualified to testify about clean harbors monitoring and safety practices as they related to the june incident.
rhodia subsequently moved for summary judgment,asserting that the court exclusion of this expert testimony left barrett and clean harbors unable to prove causation,a required element for a prima facie case of strict liability.the district court agreed and granted summary judgment to rhodia.barrett and clean harbors appeal,challenging both the district court ruling limiting their expert testimony and the court adverse grant of summary judgment.
we review a district court ruling regarding the admissibility of expert testimony under daubert for an abuse of discretion.hickerson pride mobility prod,cir citing daubert,at.we will not reverse a district court ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony absent a clear and prejudicial abuse of discretion.ahlberg chrysler,cir.federal rule of evidence provides 
if scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise,if the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data,the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods,and the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.
when considering expert testimony,a district court must ensure that all scientific testimony is both reliable and relevant.marmo tyson fresh meats,cir.to satisfy the reliability requirement,the party offering the expert testimony must show by a preponderance of the evidence both that the expert is qualified to render the opinion and that the methodology underlying his conclusions is scientifically valid.daubert,at.to satisfy the relevance requirement,the proponent must show that the expert reasoning or methodology was applied properly to the facts at issue.marmo,at.
the plaintiff in a toxic tort strict liability case needs to establish causation through expert testimony.bonner isp,cir.in this case,barrett and clean harbors were required to present expert testimony showing that hydrogen sulfide gas exposure was capable of causing barrett injuries,and that barrett was exposed to hydrogen sulfide gas which dispersed from the drum manufactured by rhodia in a sufficient concentration to cause his injuries.id.
barrett and clean harbors engaged experts in various fields to testify on their behalf.janss,an allergist board certified in toxicology,was retained to testify about injury and causation.she examined barrett in march,nearly two years after the incident.during the exam janss consulted a standard toxicology textbook and reviewed a medical article for symptoms of hydrogen sulfide exposure.based on the symptoms disclosed by barrett and his wife and her review of medical literature,janss concluded that barrett had suffered an anoxic brain injury as a result of exposure to hydrogen sulfide gas.she also concluded that hydrogen sulfide gas had dispersed from the drum opened by wheeland and had filtered twelve to fourteen feet down to barrett in a high concentration of to ppm.
rhodia sought to limit janss testimony,arguing that she had provided no scientific support for her conclusion that hydrogen sulfide gas had dispersed downward from the opened drum in a sufficient concentration to cause barrett injuries.the district court agreed,concluding that janss lacked the education and experience to testify about whether hydrogen sulfide gas had dispersed from the opened drum or the concentration level of barrett exposure to hydrogen sulfide.the court noted that janss had conceded that she did not know how hydrogen sulfide disperses,the distance between barrett and the drum alleged to be the source of the gas,or the concentration of hydrogen sulfide gas,if any,in the drum.in respect to her opinion that barrett was exposed to hydrogen sulfide gas in a concentration of to ppm,janss explained that she had assumed the gas had reached barrett at a sufficient concentration to cause him to pass out.
appellants argue that janss medical credentials and her reliance on medical literature provide a sufficient foundation for her expert testimony about the cause of barrett injury and concentration of his toxic exposure.they assert that the deficiencies in the foundation for her opinions should go to the weight of her expert testimony,rather than its admissibility.a district court functions as a gatekeeper by excluding unreliable expert testimony.kumho tire,carmichael.here appellants seek to have janss testify that barrett was injured by hydrogen sulfide gas dispersed from the drum opened by wheeland.janss has conceded,however,that she lacks significant scientific knowledge underpinning this opinion and that she did not rule out alternative causes of barrett injury,such as inhalation of dust,prior to forming her opinion.her opinion concerning the concentration of barrett toxic exposure was admittedly based on assumption,without any scientific testing or exposure analysis.expert testimony is inadmissible where,as here,it is excessively speculative or unsupported by sufficient facts.concord boat brunswick,cir.the district court did not abuse its discretion by limiting janss testimony.
barrett and clean harbors retained talbot to offer an expert opinion on causation and injury.talbot is a clinical psychologist with over years experience in psychotherapy and neuropsychotherapy.based on her meeting with barrett and her review of janss findings,talbot diagnosed barrett as having suffered from cerebral anoxia,lack of oxygen to the brain,followed by toxic encephalopothy or permanent brain damage caused by chemical exposure.she intended to testify that barrett injury was caused by exposure to hydrogen sulfide gas in the range of to ppm.
rhodia moved to preclude talbot from testifying about the concentration of barrett exposure to hydrogen sulfide and the source of his exposure.the district court concluded that talbot was qualified through her education and experience to testify about barrett injuries and whether they were consistent with hydrogen sulfide exposure.the court concluded that she was not qualified,however,to testify about the source and concentration of barrett toxic exposure.the court emphasized that talbot had no training in toxicology and that she had never before evaluated a patient exposed to hydrogen sulfide gas or.the court also noted that her opinion about the source and concentration of barrett hydrogen sulfide exposure relied entirely on janss opinion,which was itself too speculative to be admissible.talbot had done no independent research or analysis concerning the concentration level of barrett exposure,since she believed that she had been engaged to assess barrett functional capacity.
we conclude that the district court decision to limit talbot testimony was not an abuse of discretion.her opinions about the source and concentration of barrett hydrogen sulfide exposure were based entirely on the opinion of janss,which had been deemed excessively speculative.without evidence of any independent investigation or scientific foundation underlying talbot opinion,barrett and clean harbors have failed to show that she was qualified to testify on the subjects excluded b
