this appeal arises out of a civil case in which the plaintiff two lawyers did nothing to prosecute the plaintiff claims within generous deadlines,received a second chance,and then failed to oppose a pending motion for summary judgment.on such a record,we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to grant yet another reprieve.
todd mckeague suffered injuries to his hand while using a table saw.in late,he sued the three defendants,claiming that they were responsible for a defect in the design of the saw that proximately caused his injuries.defendants removed the suit to federal court.in april of,the parties filed a discovery plan that the district court approved and adopted as an order under federal rule of civil procedure b.the plan required the parties to complete fact discovery by december.it further required plaintiff to serve expert disclosures by january,and it required defendants to serve expert disclosures by march.expert depositions were to be taken by april.after the case was assigned to a new judge,the court modified the order slightly to require that all discovery requests be served by december,with fact discovery to be completed within days.the court also set may,as the deadline for filing summary judgment motions,and june,as the response date.trial was scheduled for september.all in all,this was plenty of time within which to conduct pretrial proceedings in ordinary course.
defendants thereupon propounded discovery,serving interrogatories and document requests and deposing plaintiff,all well within the deadlines.inexplicably,plaintiff served no discovery before the december,deadline.instead,in early february of,and without leave of the court,plaintiff belatedly served written discovery requests.plaintiff counsel prevailed upon defendants to assent to a motion to extend the discovery deadline nunc pro tunc,but then never filed the motion.
worse yet,apparently plaintiff counsel did not at the outset retain an expert in this case in which plaintiff concedes an expert is required in order to get to trial.see triangle dress,bay state,esturban.bay transp.app.but see smith ariens,i n cases in which a jury can find of their own lay knowledge that there exists a design defect which exposes users of a product to unreasonable risks of injury,expert testimony that a product is negligently designed is not required.in his initial disclosures under federal rule of civil procedure a filed on june,plaintiff identified stephen gass,david fanning,and david fulmer the cofounders of a table saw manufacturer in oregon and darry robert holt a mechanical engineer as possible expert witnesses who could testify about the safe design of table saws and the likelihood that defendants knew of safer alternative designs for the saw that plaintiff alleged injured him,but plaintiff noted in his disclosure that he had not retained any expert witness as of the date of this filing.in an interrogatory answer served four months later on october,plaintiff added another name to the list,stating that he might call as an expert witness an engineer named richard montifusco.plaintiff counsel,however,did not retain montifusco or any of the other four possible experts at that time.the final expert disclosure deadline under the scheduling order came and went with no expert designation by plaintiff.even when defendants subsequently and timely designated their own expert,plaintiff lawyers were nowhere to be found,seemingly content to make no effort at a.nor was this merely a problem of not filing something plaintiff lawyers had retained no expert to designate.
plaintiff counsel cumulative neglect came to a head when defendants timely and predictably filed a motion for summary judgment on may.citing enrich windmere,and a handful of other cases,defendants argued in their motion,among other things,that the absence of any expert testimony was fatal to plaintiff case given that the table saw functioned properly and suffered from no defect obvious to any layperson.
plaintiff counsel thereupon threw themselves or,rather,threw plaintiff on the mercy of the court,asking that instead of granting the motion for summary judgment,the court reopen discovery,set a new deadline for the plaintiff,order defendants to respond to plaintiff untimely discovery,and push back the date by which plaintiff needed to oppose the summary judgment motion.to the likely annoyance of the diligent defendants,the district court granted the delinquents all they sought.the net effect was to swap the order of production,allowing plaintiff to designate an expert after defendants had already done so,and after reviewing defendants summary judgment motion.in other words,plaintiff received both mercy and some arguable advantage.presumably,the district court decided that any prejudice to defendants was minimal,enough so to favor an outcome driven by the merits rather than by plaintiff counsel neglect.in its words,the district court was reluctant to excuse plaintiff counsel neglect,but was unwilling to effectively prevent plaintiff from pursuing his case solely because of it.the indulgence was complete,granting plaintiff all the time requested,and more,and without any sanction.having evaded the potential consequences of their remarkable inattention to their client case,plaintiff lawyers unfortunately stayed their irresponsible course.the new,extended deadline for filing an opposition to the motion for summary judgment came and went without anything even a new motion for extension being filed on plaintiff behalf.on august,two days after the new deadline passed,the district court dismissed the case for failure to prosecute and failure to comply with scheduling orders.
twelve days after the case was dismissed yes,twelve,not one or two plaintiff moved for reconsideration.he argued he had timely retained an expert,but that the expert needed more time to review a large number of documents received from defendants on august,and that the documents should have been delivered by defendants on august.unimpressed,the district court denied the motion for reconsideration.this appeal followed.
confronted with repeated failures to comply with its scheduling orders,the district court had considerable discretion in deciding what to do.freeman package mach,cir.perhaps it could have granted yet another extension,although that might have caused one to wonder if the court orders meant anything at all.vélez awning windows,cir.t he judicial process depends heavily on the judge credibility.if he or she sets a reasonable due date,parties should not be allowed casually to flout it or painlessly to escape the foreseeable consequences of noncompliance.quoting méndez banco popular,cir.the district court certainly could have imposed a monetary sanction on plaintiff or counsel.see jones winnepesaukee realty,cir.approving monetary sanctions levied pursuant to rule f of the federal rules of civil procedure,where sanctioned litigants repeatedly defied court orders.the question posed by this appeal is whether the district court also had the discretion to dismiss the case.for the following reasons,we hold that it did.
we have previously held that when a litigant fails to comply with court deadlines after having already been once granted a reprieve from such a failure,and in the absence of a good excuse,a district court discretion in setting a sanction is broad enough to include dismissal.tower ventures,city of westford,cir.but see hosp.metropolitano,cir.per curiam vacating dismissal where district court contributed to case extremely lethargic pace and did not clearly communicate deadlines to litigants who failed to meet them.here,plaintiff counsel tried to excuse the ultimate failure by claiming that his expert did not have enough time to review documents and form an opinion.plaintiff counsel,however,provided zero support for this bald assertion.moreover,the record shows that it took until august,for defendants to produce the full complement of documents only because plaintiff counsel repeatedly neglected to send back a protective order,and that plaintiff counsel did not even send the documents produced on august and to plaint
