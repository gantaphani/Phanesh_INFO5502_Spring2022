in this opinion we discuss the test for a strict liability manufacturing defect as applied to the production of latex gloves.barker lull engineering cal d,barker.this products liability action filed by plaintiff christine mcginnis was the first to go to trial in a group of cases in coordinated proceedings involving allegations against various defendants who manufactured or distributed latex gloves,used by the plaintiffs at their work,that contained natural or artificial substances that were alleged to be causative factors in the development of the plaintiffs serious latex allergies.mcginnis individual action against baxter healthcare corporation baxter went to jury trial on her manufacturing defect strict liability theory,as well as negligence and failure to warn.a defense verdict was obtained on failure to warn and negligence,but the jury found a manufacturing defect had been proven and awarded mcginnis compensatory damages.
however,in posttrial proceedings,baxter moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict jnov and for new trial on the manufacturing defect issue,and both motions were granted by the trial court.code of civ.mcginnis appeals the ensuing judgment,arguing the trial court applied an incorrect legal standard in ruling on the motions,such that under a proper analysis,there was substantial evidence that baxter latex gloves were defective,either as a defective product that differed from the manufacturer intended result or that differed from other ostensibly identical units of the same product line.barker,supra,cal d at.
mcginnis also makes a last ditch claim that the court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on her design defect theory,based on a consumer expectations approach.see morson superior court th,d morson,a prior mandamus proceeding in these consolidated cases,originating in this mcginnis case,in which this court rejected the application of that same consumer expectations theory to latex gloves in the health care context.
our examination of the record and the applicable legal principles persuades us that the trial court correctly granted jnov under the test for a manufacturing defect and that no new trial on that theory is warranted in light of that determination.nor was there any reversible instructional error regarding design defect.we need not reach the alternative grounds on which the trial court denied baxter new trial motion lack of causation evidence and inconsistent verdicts.we affirm the judgment in favor of baxter.
factual and procedural background 
apleadings and background 
on review of this order granting jnov,we state the facts in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.hansen sunnyside products,th,d.as this court outlined the background facts in morson,supra,th,d,the plaintiffs in these coordinated cases pursue a theory of product liability that the latex gloves supplied to them caused a serious,disabling,and potentially allergy to all forms of natural rubber latex referred to as nrl to develop,even though they did not have this condition prior to their extensive use of latex gloves.they accordingly claim improperly designed and manufactured nrl gloves caused this allergy by allowing excessive levels of allergenic agents,latex proteins,to remain present on the surface of the gloves during manufacture.it is not disputed that such agents may be greatly reduced or eliminated through washing and chlorinating procedures in the design and manufacture of these gloves.the issue is whether,as plaintiff complains here in the context of her manufacturing defect claim,baxter took too long to make that its standard practice,in light of its knowledge and research.
mcginnis sometimes referred to as plaintiff was employed as a respiratory technician by various hospitals and care facilities for a number of years between and,and used thousands of pairs of baxter nrl gloves during her career.the brands she used over percent of the time,flexam powdered exam gloves and triflex powdered surgical gloves,were manufactured at baxter plants in the united states and malaysia.in addition,baxter purchased gloves from other manufacturers to sell under its brand names gloves.baxter began to receive reports around that some health care workers commonly exposed to nrl products were developing severe latex allergies.it began a research and development effort in its glove production and purchases around that time,as we later describe.
both through her own use of nrl products and the use by others around her,mcginnis became sensitized to that substance to the point of developing a serious type i latex allergy,which caused her in to experience symptoms going beyond mild symptoms of itching and skin irritation,to a anaphylactic reaction respiratory distress,hives and other symptoms.she was forced to leave health care work,has undergone emergency medical treatment for such reactions,and must carry medication to treat them at all times,as her allergy is a lifelong condition.
mcginnis sued baxter and other defendants who were no longer involved in the case by the time of trial and this appeal on various products liability and negligence theories.the matter went to jury trial on strict liability theories of manufacturing defect and failure to warn of a defective product,and well as negligence through manufacture and failure to warn.
jury trial evidence 
extensive testimony and documentary evidence was presented at trial about the manufacturing process of nrl gloves.the critical qualities provided by rubber gloves to the health care profession include barrier protection and tactile sensitivity.the market for gloves grew tenfold from to after the fda recommended and then in adopted universal precautions for health care workers to prevent the spread of aids and hepatitis,requiring expanded use of gloves and other barrier protection equipment.by,baxter was manufacturing and distributing approximately four billion gloves per year,which represented approximately half of the american medical glove market.most of these gloves were made of nrl.
the multistep manufacturing process begins with the tapping of rubber trees and centrifuging and mixing of raw rubber,the preparation of glove molds to be positioned on a continuous conveyor line,the dipping of the mold in coagulant and rubber compounds,the leaching in water of the molds,curing,rinsing,powdering,chlorination and sterilization,and packaging of the gloves.morson,supra,th at,d.plaintiff presented evidence that additional washing and chlorination of the gloves would reduce allergenic protein levels,while baxter presented evidence that these steps might lead to defects in barrier protection such as pinholes,tearing,or a change in texture.id.at,d.baxter continued its defense additionally,each of these steps may differ from line to line,glove to glove,and plant to plant depending on line speed,temperature,plant configuration and other conditions.id.at,d.accordingly,e ach of the steps must be performed with an acute awareness of barrier protection issues,with an eye toward ensuring that the function of this medical device will not be compromised.id.at,d.
baxter witnesses testified about the company efforts to reduce the protein levels in their products,in response to consumer complaints received as part of the process of federal regulatory monitoring of the production of gloves.from through,baxter sold over billion gloves,and received a total of user complaints describing type i severe allergic reactions to nrl gloves.wava truscott,baxter manager of laboratories for the applicable division,was assigned to head the investigation of the glove protein allergy problem,beginning in.the task included assessing many different production lines and dealing with many different aspects of production,and it appears that truscott efforts were at first an uphill battle.she was concerned that during these years,baxter was perceived as dragging its corporate feet on the matter.by,her research had proposed a target or threshold level of protein for gloves,and she worked with product engineer charles gosnell to test her research.complaints had been received about both high and low protein level gloves.
in response to the problem,by,baxter had implemented protein reduction techniques on all its production lines.by,baxter was requiring all its gloves to undergo a rinse to reduce surface protein levels.later,a protein leach procedure was added.baxter also made educational efforts about nrl allergies for health care workers,presenting traveling seminars as part of its marketing efforts.around,it was advertising its gloves as the right choice,due to baxter research and improvements in its manufacturing processes regarding allergens.
plaintiff presented evidence from a manufacturing expert,broutman,about the methods for and the feasibility of reducing protein levels,and his opinion that baxter did not make desirable changes as quickly as possible.extensive protein level evidence was offered by plaintiff of baxter research and manufacturing changes for different glove types at different production facilities.for example,documents were introduced about tests run at different baxter plants in the early,its internal memoranda among scientific and manufacturing staff to propose methods to reduce protein levels,including data on different gloves tested,and its dealings with the makers of its gloves on the subject.
with respect to the line of gloves that baxter bought from others and distributed,mainly after,baxter was not requiring the other manufacturers to use the techniques it was developing to reduce protein levels in the gloves during the time that mcginnis was using them.the gloves were labeled the same as gloves,so that a user could not tell whether a particular pair was manufactured by baxter or another company.beginning in,baxter tested every lot of these gloves for protein levels.
another line of evidence presented had to do with the sufficiency of the warnings provided by baxter on its products regarding potential allergic reactions to nrl.baxter began to label its latex gloves for latex content in.in march,the fda announced its plans to issue regulations requiring manufacturers to state the latex content of medical devices such as gloves.although the fda was conducting research in the area of latex allergies,it did not require warning labels on that subject until.until,due to concerns about the success of the aids,universal precautions requirement of glove usage,the fda prohibited glove manufacturers from making comparisons about protein levels of their product.also until,there were no fda protein level requirements or standards,such as had been established for strength and barrier protection qualities of the gloves.specifically,these fda protein level requirements or standards were implemented only for a low protein line of gloves.
further,extensive testimony from various health care professionals was presented regarding the genesis of allergic conditions in the human body,specifically with reference to nrl allergies.morson,supra,th at,d.mcginnis presented testimony about her health condition and her claimed damages.
jury trial instructions and argument 
at the outset of trial,the jury was preinstructed on the elements of claims for both manufacturing defects and design defects.however,by the conclusion of the evidence,mcginnis claims no longer included a strict liability design defect cause of action,due in part to the ruling that we reviewed in the prior mandamus proceeding,morson,supra,th at page,d,that precluded her from presenting a design defect theory based on consumer expectations.mcginnis did not present any alternative design defect theory under a analysis.id.at,d.in accordance with that ruling,the trial court declined to instruct the jury on the consumer expectation test for a design defect.mcginnis contends this amounted to a nonsuit on design defect,while baxter argues she simply did not pursue this claim further.
thus,at trial,mcginnis went to the jury on her manufacturing defect claim,failure to warn of a defect through negligence,and negligent manufacture design.she stated during the in limine motion hearings that it was never her theory that the gloves were defective simply because they were made of latex as opposed to some other material,but rather that there were manufacturing defect problems,as well as failure to warn problems.
on the manufacturing defect claim,the jury was instructed in the language of baji as follows 
the essential elements of a claim based upon an alleged manufacturing defect are 
the defendant,baxter healthcare corporation,was the manufacturer and supplier of a product,namely natural rubber latex gloves.the product possessed a defect in its manufacture.the defect in manufacture existed when the product left the defendant possession.the defect in manufacture was a cause of injury to the plaintiff,and plaintiff injury resulted from the use of the product that was reasonably foreseeable to the defendant.a defect in the manufacture of a product exists if the product differs from the manufacturer intended result,or if the product differs from apparently identical products from the same manufacturer.
the jury also received instructions about the failure to warn and negligence theories.
plaintiff counsel presented closing argument that focused upon the instruction about the manufacturing defect claim,baji a defect exists if the product differs from the intended result.he argued that the baxter witnesses testified they had the intent,starting in,to produce a low protein glove,but that although their intentions were good,their execution was bad.and that creates a defect.they did execute their intent.also,plaintiff counsel argued that the product could also be defective under the test if the product differs from apparently identical products from the same manufacturer.he compared the gloves manufactured in malaysia by baxter,the gloves,and the united gloves,and argued that these apparently similar products were actually different,so the test was satisfied.
in contrast,baxter argued that the protein level evidence offered by plaintiff had not been placed in context with any applicable government requirements,and that at the time truscott was investigating the problem,complaints had been received about both high protein and low protein gloves,which made analysis at that point inconclusive.before and after,baxter was constantly tinkering with the system to get the best protein testing system in place.this protein testing system had to be implemented while keeping production up,due to the health care profession need for universal precautions equipment.baxter position was that its personnel were at the top of the heap in the production field,and although they were not perfect,they acted reasonably.
jury verdict 
the jury returned a verdict finding that a manufacturing defect had been proven and awarded mcginnis net compensatory damages of.the jury also found baxter had been negligent but there had been no causation of her injuries through negligence.a finding was made assessing percent of the negligence to baxter,percent to mcginnis,and percent to her previous hospital employer not a party to the action.the jury also rejected mcginnis claim that a warning defect was present.
baxter motions for jnov and new trial 
following trial,baxter filed its motions for jnov and new trial.it argued that with respect to the manufacturing defect finding,no substantial evidence supported the verdict.it also argued the causation findings were inconsistent and lacked support in the evidence,and excessive damages had been awarded.
after briefing and argument,the trial court granted the baxter motion for jnov on the single cause of action on which mcginnis had prevailed,manufacturing defect under a strict products liability theory.the court noted that no cause of action for design defect was submitted to the jury.the court found that the jury verdict on manufacturing defect was not supported by the evidence,stating its reasoning as follows 
a manufacturing defect occurs when a product deviated from its intended design.plaintiff had the burden of demonstrating there was a flaw in the manufacturing process whereby the product or products deviated from the manufacturer design or specification and thus was manufactured differently from the prototype.no evidence was introduced at trial that any of the gloves involved in the contributing sic to plaintiff injuries,in any manner deviated from the design for said gloves.plaintiff evidence tended to show that the gloves were defective in their design,since the design did not require the elimination or substantial reduction of protein that collected on the glove surface during its manufacture.the issue of design defect was not submitted to the jury for its determination,although a substantial portion of the evidence adduced at trial related to that issue.
in the alternative,the trial court granted the motion for new trial on the same grounds,with respect to the manufacturing defect theory.although the order does not reflect the details of the new trial ruling,the transcript of the hearing shows that the trial court denied the new trial motion insofar as it argued insufficient evidence of causation inconsistent special verdicts on causation.the excessive damages claim was also rejected.
mcginnis appealed the posttrial orders and the judgment,and her appeals were consolidated.
discussion 
mcginnis appeal raises the same basic concerns about the trial court order with respect to both the baxter motion for jnov and its motion for new trial.she argues the trial court incorrectly applied both the alternative tests for a manufacturing defect as set forth in barker,supra,cal d.there,the supreme court opined optimistically,in hindsight that defining the concept of a product defect raises considerably more difficulties in the design defect context than it does in the manufacturing or production defect context.in general,a manufacturing or production defect is readily identifiable because a defective product is one that differs from the manufacturer intended result or from other ostensibly identical units of the same product line.id.at.these concepts form the basis of baji,defining a manufacturing defect,which was given to the jury here 
mcginnis initial criticism is that the trial court mistakenly evaluated the evidentiary record only in light of the intended result test,by first requiring evidence that the high protein gloves that mcginnis used departed from baxter formal product design,prototype,or specifications,and secondly,by finding there was no such evidence.mcginnis next argues that the trial court failed to recognize that the alternative formulation of the test applied and was satisfied here,because there is substantial evidence that the high protein gloves she used differed from apparently identical gloves that baxter also produced or distributed,due to the different sources from which baxter obtained its gloves and its varying production techniques over time.we will discuss these arguments in terms of the two procedural contexts in which the order was made,with attention to the separate standards for each ruling.
judgment notwithstanding the verdict 
the standards to apply in reviewing a ruling on a motion for jnov are well established.the trial court discretion in granting a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is severely limited.citation.the trial judge power to grant a judgment notwithstanding the verdict is identical to his power to grant a directed verdict citations.the trial judge can not reweigh the evidence citation,or judge the credibility of witnesses.citation.if the evidence is conflicting or if several reasonable inferences may be drawn,the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict should be denied.citations.a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict of a jury may properly be granted only if it appears from the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the party securing the verdict,that there is no substantial evidence to support the verdict.if there is any substantial evidence,or reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom,in support of the verdict,the motion should be denied.citation.citation.the trial court can not consider witness credibility.citation.hansen sunnyside products,supra,th at,d.
when an appellate court reviews an order granting jnov,it will resolve any conflict in the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in favor of the jury verdict.hansen sunnyside products,supra,th at,d.
comparison of definitions of product defects 
as explained by the supreme court in brown superior court cal d,brown,under barker strict products liability analysis,there are three types of product defects first,there may be a flaw in the manufacturing process,resulting in a product that differs from the manufacturer intended result.the archetypal example of such a defect was involved in escola coca cola bottling of fresno cal d,a coca cola bottle that exploded second,there are products which are perfectly manufactured but are unsafe because of the absence of a safety device,a defect in design.this was the defect alleged in barker.it held that a product is defectively designed if it failed to perform as safely as an ordinary consumer would expect when used as intended or reasonably foreseeable,or if,on balance,the risk of danger inherent in the challenged design outweighs the benefits of the design.citation.brown,supra,cal d at.the third type of defect is a product that is dangerous because it lacks adequate warnings or instructions.ibid.
as a further illustration of the development of the concept of a defect in the strict liability field,we may turn to jiminez sears,roebuck cal d,where the court reviewed prior case law to say that a defective product is viewed as one which fails to match the quality of most like products,and the manufacturer is then liable for injuries resulting from deviations from the norm the lathe did not like other lathes have a proper fastening device,the brakes of the automobile went on unexpectedly,the drive shaft of a new car became disconnected.
here,mcginnis case relied on the first and third types of product defects listed in barker,supra,cal d,and the jury rejected the third failure to warn of a defect.only the first type,manufacturing defect,is squarely presented as an issue in this appeal.see pt.iii,post,where we reject her effort to revive a direct design defect theory under a consumer expectations rubric,and where we note she did not effectively pursue the remaining design defect theory.hence,our task is to see if,as mcginnis contends,substantial evidence was presented to support a manufacturing defect theory under either of the barker formulations.we do this in tandem with evaluating the baxter argument that mcginnis actually tried this case under a design defect approach,and her appellate argument on the manufacturing defect theory does not fit the facts like a glove.
in morson,supra,th,d,this court relied on dierks mitsubishi motors d.as a statement of the difference between a defect in manufacture and a defect in design the latter focuses upon whether the product was designed to perform as safely as an ordinary consumer would expect or whether the risk of danger inherent in the design outweighed the benefits of the design.citations.the former focuses on whether the particular product involved in the accident was manufactured in conformity with the manufacturer design.citations.morson,supra,th at,d.there,we also cited to a treatise writer for the concept that the line between design and manufacturing defects is not necessarily a sharp one.this is clear when one considers that the choice of quality control techniques may determine the rate of metallurgical flaws,which ordinarily would be characterized as manufacturing defects rather than design defects.one may note,moreover,that those kinds of entrepreneurial decisions are quite analogous to the sorts of choices that are made in selecting one product configuration or another on the basis of cost considerations.id.at,d,citing shapo,the law of products liability ed,to.
also in morson,supra,th,d,we noted that in general,the plaintiffs in these coordinated latex glove cases are alleging a theory of injury that appears to have aspects common to both the design defect and manufacturing defect theories id.at,d,in that the materials from which the latex gloves were made contained excessive amounts of latex rubber proteins close to the surface of the gloves,causing the plaintiffs to become sensitized to them and to develop or to exacerbate an existing allergy.ibid.we discussed the particular nature of this product as having primarily a protective or barrier function,leading to the choice of latex as an appropriate material,but also noting that the effect of this material and the manufacturing processes used may well be to create in their users many degrees of allergic reactions.understanding and assessing responsibility for such allergic reactions is a matter that is driven by the science of the manufacturing and preparation procedures,as well as the medical aspects of an individual allergic reactions to various substances.id.at,d.
from these observations,we are led to a further conclusion,that it is useless to focus on a distinction between a raw material of which a product is made nrl,and the format or construction of the product itself glove,for purposes of deciding if a strict liability defect is one of design or manufacture.here,mcginnis stated during the hearings on the in limine motions that it was never her theory that the gloves were defective simply because they were made of latex as opposed to some other material,but rather she claimed there were manufacturing defect problems,as well as failure to warn problems.it is appropriate to view the product as a whole,composed of different components,including latex.
in other factual contexts,similar difficulties have arisen in analyzing the component parts of a whole product for purposes of applying the manufacturing defect test.in pierce pacific gas electric d,the appellate court concluded that a commercial supplier of electricity is subject to strict liability in tort for personal injuries caused by delivery of electricity at dangerously high voltage resulting from defects in a transformer.the facts were that due to a transformer malfunction,the defendant utility electricity arrived at the plaintiff home at nearly times its intended voltage,ultimately causing the plaintiff to suffer bodily injury.id.at.however,the court noted that the utility defendant pg e was not the manufacturer of the defective transformer,which some other electric company had made,such that the defendant pg e never placed the transformer on the market or in the stream of commerce.pg e was,in essence,a consumer rather than a manufacturer of the transformer,and can not be held strictly liable in tort for the transformer defects per se.citation.id.at.however,the appellate court concluded that since the product,electricity,was delivered to the plaintiff home by way of the defective transformer,and arrived at a harmful level of voltage and injured the plaintiff,it was error to grant a nonsuit in favor of the defendant utility,as a cause of action for strict liability in tort existed and personal injuries were shown.it did not make any difference that the utility could not be held strictly liable in tort for the transformer defects per se,as the subject product,electricity,harmed plaintiff anyway.id.at.however,the court did not directly identify whether a manufacturing or design defect was shown,as to the electricity itself.
one explanation for this blending of theories was alluded to in artiglio superior court th,d artiglio,in which this court noted authorities lumped together the concepts of proper manufacture,lack of design defect and adequate warning.however,in artiglio we further stated that in brown,supra,cal d,which rejected the theory of design defect for pharmaceuticals,the supreme court very clearly distinguished among the three concepts of fault,in the prescription drug context liability for defective design could not be premised on strict liability,but would require proof of negligence.citation.strict liability would continue applicable for manufacturing defects and liability for failure to warn of known or reasonably knowable risks in the use of the product remains viable under general principles of negligence.citation.artiglio,supra,th at,d.artiglio similarly concluded,based on the public policies identified in brown,that the entire category of medical implants available only by resort to the services of a physician are immune from design defect strict liability.artiglio,supra,th at,d.
of course,latex gloves,even as used in the health care field as this plaintiff did,are not prescription drugs,nor are they available only by resort to the services of a physician,as in artiglio,supra,th,d,and brown,supra,cal d.nor was this case pursued or instructed as a design defect case,as in artiglio and brown.nevertheless,many of the same policy concerns apply,due to the closely related nature of these strict liability theories in this factual context,as we next explain.
public policy and doctrinal concerns 
the supreme court holding in brown,supra,cal d,was that a manufacturer is not strictly liable for injuries caused by a prescription drug so long as the drug was properly prepared and accompanied by warnings of its dangerous propensities that were either known or reasonably scientifically knowable at the time of distribution.id.at.an important public policy considered by the court in reaching that decision was stated as follows in the cases in which the subject product is used to make work easier or to provide pleasure,construction machinery,a lawnmower,or perfume it is not unreasonable to impose strict liability for design defects.however,more protection for a manufacturer is justified where the product is created to alleviate pain and suffering or to sustain life.id.at.along these same lines,the court also referred to other important medical products wheelchairs,for example,apparently to illustrate that harm to some users can be avoided for some medical products,which would allow liability to be more freely imposed on a manufacturer.id.at.however,the court stated that harm to some users from prescription drugs is unavoidable,and continued because of these distinctions,the broader public interest in the availability of drugs at an affordable price must be considered in deciding the appropriate standard of liability for injuries resulting from their use.ibid.this led the court to reject a design defect theory of liability against a drug manufacturer for injuries caused by the defective design of a prescription drug,and also to reject an assertion that a drug manufacturer should be held strictly liable for failure to warn of risks inherent in a drug even though it neither knew nor could have known by the application of scientific knowledge available at the time of distribution that the drug could produce the undesirable side effects suffered by the plaintiff.id.at.
another important policy concern in the field of strict liability is that the doctrine was never intended to make the manufacturer or distributor of a product its insurer.from its inception,strict liability has never been,and is not now,absolute liability u nder strict liability the manufacturer does not thereby become the insurer of the safety of the product user.citations.citation.anderson fiberglas cal d.
from these policy statements we are led to believe that the courts may take into account,in evaluating manufacturer liability for a product that seriously implicates concerns of alleviating pain and suffering or sustaining life,whether the product was properly prepared and accompanied by warnings of its dangerous propensities that were either known or reasonably scientifically knowable at the time of distribution.brown,supra,cal d at.in cases involving products that create significant scientific concerns with respect to research and innovation,more protection for a manufacturer is justified than in cases of other important medical products wheelchairs,for example,in which harm to some users can more readily be avoided,due apparently to their more mechanical nature.id.at.this has led to the rejection of design defect immunity for the more complex products.
moreover,in reviewing this record for substantial evidence in support of a manufacturing or production defect theory,we must keep in mind the two formulations of the test a defective product is one t
