in this products injury suit,the defendants,depuy orthopaedics,depuy,and johnson johnson contend that north carolina law applies and that the case must be dismissed under its statute of repose.the plaintiffs,mitch klein and annie rice her derivative claim is only for loss of consortium so we refer only to klein as we move through our opinion,maintain that indiana law applies and that the suit is timely under its more generous statute of repose.alternatively,klein contends that,if he is stuck with north carolina law,an exception should be applied to permit his suit to be viewed as timely.according to depuy,no such exception exists.
district judge theresa springmann thought that depuy had the better of the argument,so she granted its motion for summary judgment.klein depuy,d.the case is now before us on klein appeal.as only questions of law are presented,our review is de novo.tanner jupiter realty,cir.summary judgment is proper if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
in september,klein underwent a left total hip replacement surgery in his home state of north carolina.the prosthesis used in the surgery was manufactured by depuy orthopaedics,an indiana corporation with its principal place of business in indiana.some time later,klein experienced severe pain in his left hip,which he reported to his orthopedic surgeon,jack bowling.bowling told klein that his hip replacement was failing due to among other things osteolysis,a progressive disease commonly seen in conjunction with artificial joint replacement and caused by an inflammatory reaction to particulate debris from an artificial joint.
on june,bowling performed revision surgery on klein hip,removing various components of the prosthesis and confirming his diagnosis of osteolysis.bowling believed that the hylamer cup liner used in klein hip replacement wore at a faster rate than predicted,causing excessive amounts of polyethylene debris to cascade down into klein proximal femur area.the excessive debris,bowling said,resulted in osteolysis,which,in turn,caused klein pain and the failure of his prosthesis.significantly for our purposes,klein received and continues to receive all of his medical care in north carolina.
on august,klein filed suit in the northern district of indiana,maintaining that the hip prosthesis was defective and that it caused his injuries.klein alleged ten counts of misconduct,including products liability,failure to warn,negligence,negligent and fraudulent misrepresentation,breach of warranties,and negligent infliction of emotional distress.as we noted,rice,klein wife at the time of the suit,brought a claim for loss of consortium.
on january,depuy moved for summary judgment on the basis of north carolina statute of repose.on january,judge springmann granted depuy motion in a comprehensive opinion and order.this appeal followed.
the first issue is whether judge springmann correctly concluded that indiana would apply north carolina law statute of repose,as opposed to indiana law statute of repose,to klein claims.in tort cases,where a conflict exists indiana presumes that the traditional loci.simon united states.under the rule,the district court applies the substantive law of the state where the last event necessary to make an actor liable for the alleged wrong takes place.hubbard greeson.if,and only if,that location bears little connection to the legal action,the presumption in favor of the location of the tort may be overcome and additional factors may be considered.id.at.
judge springmann found that north carolina was the location of the tort and that it bore enough of a connection to the legal action for the traditional rule to apply.on appeal,klein asserts three arguments against this ruling the location of the tort was actually indiana because depuy designed,manufactured,marketed,and distributed the allegedly defective product there assuming arguendo that north carolina was the location of the tort,it bears so little significance to the legal action that the presumption is rebutted and policy considerations favor applying indiana law.each of these arguments fails 
klein first indiana was the location of the directly contradicted by case law.as we have previously stated,indiana lex loci delicti principle points to the location of the injury,not the defendant corporate headquarters,as the source of law.in re,cir.furthermore,in a recent case,alli eli lilly and,the indiana court of appeals found that the last event necessary to complete the alleged torts of strict products liability,misrepresentation,and negligence brought against the manufacturer of an antidepressant medication was the injury that occurred when the plaintiff husband committed suicide,not when the antidepressants were manufactured,see also simon,at finding that the last event necessary to make the defendant liable for wrongful death was the injury that occurred when the plane crashed and the decedents died,not when the prior negligent acts were committed.
in this case,the last event necessary to make depuy liable was the injury and physical harm that occurred when the prosthesis failed and klein developed osteolysis.this occurred in north carolina,making the tar heel state the location of the tort.
klein second north carolina bears little significance to the legal even less discussion.indiana law tells us that i n a large number of cases,the place of the tort will be significant and the place with the most contacts.hubbard,at.only in rare cases will the presumption in favor of the traditional rule be overcome.simon,at.in alli,the indiana court of appeals found that the location of the tort was significant where the plaintiff late husband lived,worked,and received his medical the antidepressant medication implicated in the that state.at.
here,klein resided,consulted with doctors,and decided to undergo hip replacement surgery in north carolina.he received his prosthesis,diagnosis of osteolysis,revision surgery,and all of his medical care there.we would be to conclude anything but that the location of the injury is significant to this action.
klein final policy considerations favor applying indiana comes up short.while indiana does have a public policy exception,it is reserved for cases where its sister state law is immoral,unnatural,unjust,or prejudicial to the general interests of the citizens of indiana.alli,at see also schaffert by schaffert jackson life ins,declining to use the doctrine where the sister state law was not immoral or against natural justice.
the difference between the north carolina and indiana statutes at issue in this case concerns the time frame during which consumers may sue a manufacturer for product defects.this issue does not implicate the general interests of indiana citizens,so we conclude that north carolina law would not offend the public policy of indiana.as a result,klein is stuck with north carolina statute of repose.and that makes his suit untimely.
we now turn to the second issue whether the north carolina supreme court would apply an exception to its statute of repose to permit this suit to be viewed as timely the parties agree that.a governs this case.section a says that n o action for the recovery of damages for personal injury based upon or arising out of any alleged defect or any failure in relation to a product shall be brought more than six years after the date of initial purchase for use or consumption.but is an exception lurking here that gives klein more time to sue 
at first blush,this seems like an easy issue to decide.as opposed to a statute of limitations,which begins running upon the accrual of some claim and permits equitable exceptions,a is a statute of repose,which serves as an unyielding and absolute barrier to a cause of action,regardless of whether that cause has accrued.black littlejohn.furthermore,the plain language of a creates no exceptions at all.indeed,the north carolina supreme court has already stated that i t is clear from this language that section excludes all actions brought after six years.tetterton long.however,one north carolina case,decided more than years
