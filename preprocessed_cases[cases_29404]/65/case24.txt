plaintiff,orlando rodríguez rodríguez brought this diversity action against suzuki motor corporation suzuki alleging that a manufacturing defect in his suzuki motorcycle caused the injuries he sustained in a motorcycle accident.the united states district court for the district of puerto rico granted suzuki motion for summary judgment on the ground that the complaint was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.rodríguez appeals the dismissal on the theory that under puerto rico law,his previously filed complaint against other entities that were jointly and severally liable with suzuki tolled the statute of limitations for the instant action against suzuki.after careful consideration,we reverse.
background 
as this is an appeal from a grant of summary judgment,we view the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the same.chadwick wellpoint,cir.
this action arises out of an accident that occurred on june.on that day,at approximately,rodríguez was driving his suzuki motorcycle along las américas express road in puerto rico,when he started to experience a shaking on the front fork of the motorcycle,the handlebars,and grips.suddenly,he fell off the motorcycle on to the road.rodríguez alleges that he was surprised as there was no reason for the fall to have occurred.when he looked at the motorcycle,he noticed that the frame had split in half and separated the front fork from the rest of the frame.rodríguez alleges that as a result of this motorcycle accident he suffered various injuries.
on june,rodríguez,who was at that time a citizen of florida,filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico the action against the retail seller of the suzuki motorcycle,rainbow motors rainbow,a puerto rico corporation.rodríguez amended the complaint on october,to include the distributor of the motorcycle,panorama motors panorama,also a puerto rico corporation.in his complaint,rodríguez alleged that the injuries he sustained were a direct and proximate result of the motorcycle defective design,a manufacturing defect,defendants negligent marketing,and defendants failure to adequately warn.rodríguez complaint in the action did not name the manufacturer of the motorcycle,suzuki,as a defendant.
on march,rainbow moved to file a complaint against suzuki,a japanese corporation.because suzuki is a foreign corporation,rainbow was required to follow the procedures established for service under the hague convention and these requirements caused some delay on march,rainbow filed a motion to stay the litigation until suzuki was joined as a party.on march,the district court denied this motion.on june,rainbow moved to voluntarily dismiss,without prejudice,its complaint against suzuki.the court granted this motion.on november,rodríguez moved to voluntarily dismiss the action without prejudice.the court granted this motion as well.
on may,rodríguez commenced a new action in the federal district court by filing a complaint against suzuki the action.the action did not name rainbow or panorama as defendants on february,the court dismissed the action without prejudice pursuant to.m because,despite various extensions,rodríguez had not completed service of process against suzuki.
on february,rodríguez,again in the federal district court,filed a new action against suzuki the action,from which this appeal arises.as was the case with the action,rainbow and panorama were not named as defendants in the action.suzuki moved for summary judgment on the ground that rodríguez had failed to file his suit within the applicable statute of limitations for tort actions under puerto rico law.rodríguez opposed summary judgment,relying on puerto rico solidarity doctrine to argue that his action against panorama and rainbow,with whom suzuki was jointly and severally liable,tolled the statute of limitations with respect to the actions against suzuki.the district court granted suzuki motion for summary judgment.rodríguez suzuki motor,slip op,opinion and order granting summary judgment.
the district court held that rodríguez failed to bring his suit within the applicable prescriptive period from the date that he was put on notice of his injury,the manufacturer defect,and the manufacturer identity.id.at.the district court further held that the action did not toll or reset the statute of limitations with respect to rodríguez claims against suzuki.id.at.finding that solidarity existed between suzuki,rainbow and panorama,the court noted that i nasmuch as the action was timely filed,the solidarity doctrine would have allowed rodríguez to amend his complaint to add suzuki,but rodríguez made an affirmative decision not to do this.id.at.rather,rodríguez chose to voluntarily dismiss the action and then file a subsequent complaint.the court explained that in order for a prior suit to toll and reset the statute of limitations with respect to a subsequent suit,puerto rico law requires identicality of claims,relief requested,and defendants.id.at quoting mun.of caguas,cir.noting that suzuki was not a party to the action,and neither rainbow nor panorama were sued in the action,the court concluded that the action did not continue to preserve or toll the statute of limitations against suzuki since the action was not identical.id.at.finding the action to be untimely,it held that the case at bar was likewise untimely.id.
rodríguez timely appealed from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of suzuki.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court decision to grant defendant motion for summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds de novo,construing the record in the light most favorable to the party.douglas york county,cir citing hadfield mcdonough,cir.we will affirm if,based on our independent review of the evidentiary record,there is no genuine issue of material fact and the undisputed facts indicate that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see also.c.
under the erie doctrine,federal courts sitting in diversity apply state substantive law and federal procedural law.gasperini ctr.for humanities,d.in puerto rico,the prescription of civil actions is a question of substantive rather than procedural law.see rodríguez narvaez nazario,cir garcía pérez corporación de servicios para la mujer y la familia,tspr,wl,at june.thus,as this case comes before us under our diversity jurisdiction,we must apply puerto rico substantive law to resolve the statute of limitations issue in dispute.
as a federal court sitting in diversity,our task is to interpret and apply as best we can the state rules of decision.norton mcosker,cir quoting catex vitol gas,wolfe,cir.we rely on pronouncements of the state supreme court and ultimately our task is to ascertain the rule the state court would most likely follow under the circumstances,even if our independent judgment on the question might differ.id.quoting wolfe,at.
statute of limitations 
rodríguez action was brought under puerto rico tort statute,article of the civil code,see laws ann.tit,to which a statute of limitations applies.see laws ann.tit.the statute of limitations or prescriptive period for such tort actions begins to run from the time the aggrieved person has knowledge thereof.laws ann.tit,see also,wl,at stating that the statute of limitations starts to run once the injured party knows both that he has suffered a harm and who is responsible for it.
rodríguez does not dispute the applicability of the prescription period to his action against suzuki.the accident giving rise to rodríguez injuries undisputedly took place on june,and rodríguez makes no contention that the action accrued at a later date.nor is there any dispute that the instant action was filed on february,well past one year from the accrual of the cause of action thus,unless the prescription period was effectively tolled,the instant action is.although prescription is an affirmative defense,once it has been raised,the burden of proving that prescription has been interrupted shifts to the plaintiff.see tokyo marine fire ins.pérez y,cir citing puerto rico cases.
rodríguez argues that because the statute of limitations was tolled as a matter of puerto rico law by his filing of intervening actions in and,the district court erred in finding that the instant tort action against suzuki was.rodríguez argument proceeds as follows.he argues that by filing the action against rainbow and panorama within of the accident,on june,rodríguez tolled the statute of limitations with respect to all parties jointly and severally liable with those companies,including suzuki,even though suzuki was never a party to the action.rodríguez further contends that when the action was dismissed without prejudice on november,the statute of limitations was reset and began to run anew,rendering his action against suzuki,filed six months later on may,timely as well.finally,rodríguez contends that when the action was dismissed without prejudice on february,he again had one year from that date to file a subsequent action.thus,rodríguez takes the position that when he filed the instant action within days from the dismissal of the action,on february,the action had not prescribed.we agree.
article of puerto rico civil code provides three mechanisms by which the prescription of actions can be interrupted or tolled b y their institution before the courts,by extrajudicial claim of the creditor,and by any act of acknowledgment of the debt by the debtor.laws ann.tit,see also tokyo marine,at.when a plaintiff tolls the statute of limitations by bringing an action before the courts,the mere filing of the complaint has a tolling effect,rather than service of the summons.see durán cepeda morales lebrón,offic.trans,wl april.moreover,the filing of an action tolls the statute of limitations even if plaintiffs voluntarily dismiss the action without prejudice before the defendants ha ve been summonsed.silva wiscovich weber dental,offic.trans,resolving question certified to it by this court see also weber dental,cir subsequent review after puerto rico supreme court addressed certification question.
under puerto rico tolling rules,which are based on the spanish civil law,the institution of an action in court is commonly held not only to interrupt the running of the applicable statute of limitations but,at least in the event of a voluntary or usual dismissal of the original action,to cause the entire limitations period to run anew from the date the previous action came to a definite end.mun.of comerío,cir citing,at an action comes to a definite end,inter alia,on the date upon which such action is voluntarily dismissed without prejudice.see,at quoting,at.
applying these tolling principles to the facts before us,we can conclude that if rodríguez had in fact interrupted the statute of limitations with respect to his products liability suit against suzuki when he instituted the action see infra,section,then this tolling effect persisted until that action came to a definite end on november,when it was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice.at that point,the statute of limitations was reset and began to run anew for another year.the filing of the action within that year was therefore timely.as the action was also dismissed without prejudice,then,by the same logic,the filing of the action within one year of its dismissal,was timely as well.
though not raised by the parties,we note one caveat to our interpretation of puerto rico tolling issue of due diligence.the usual rule under puerto rico law is that the filing of a judicial action tolls the statute of limitations and,if the action is dismissed without prejudice,the limitations period is reset and starts to run again from that date.see,offic.trans.at.although rodríguez action was dismissed by the district court as a result of rodríguez failure to complete service of process upon suzuki in a timely manner,it was nevertheless dismissed without prejudice.thus,under the usual puerto rico tolling rule,the statute of limitations would for the full period from the date of the dismissal.id.this approach,however,may be in tension with common law and equitable principles,under which an involuntary dismissal made without prejudice but as a sanction does not toll the statute of limitations.see,at emphasis added and citing cases see also hilton int l unión de trabajadores,cir stating that dismissal by the court for punitive or other reasons,even though labeled sic without prejudice,is,in fact,with prejudice if the statute of limitations has run,noting that any other result would be most unfair.
faced in with the question of applying these tolling principles to a federal action governed by puerto rico statute of limitations law we held that we could not say for sure whether similar considerations would lead a puerto rico court to follow the common law rule and make an exception to its civil law restart tolling principle,in the event dismissal was imposed as a sanction.at.nevertheless,we noted that in durán cepeda the puerto rico supreme court had suggested a possible exception to the restart rule f or cases where the tolling rule is abused or used in bad faith.id.quoting durán cepeda,offic.trans.at see also,silva wiscovich,offic.trans.at citing same footnote in durán cepeda.we concluded that w hatever the correct reading of puerto rico law,given the plaintiff flagrant and abusive delay,the application of puerto rico restart tolling principle to that case,would be inconsistent with federal policies underlying.id.thus we declined to apply puerto rico restart rule to the dismissed action,at.
applying the principles of to the case before us,we are cognizant of the possibility that the judgment dismissing rodríguez action,though labeled without prejudice,may have been intended as a sanction for rodríguez unjustifiably delaying service of process upon suzuki.in that case it would seem hardly equitable to reward rodríguez for his lack of due diligence by granting him another year within which to file his claim.nevertheless,the instant action,unlike the claim in is purely a question of puerto rico tort law.moreover,the district court was not explicit as to whether dismissal was intended as a sanction or as to whether rodríguez,in fact,acted in bad faith.under these circumstances,we feel that we are bound to adhere to the usual rule and apply puerto rico restart rule to the involuntary dismissal without prejudice of rodríguez action.thus,provided that the tolling effect extends to rodríguez suit against suzuki,the action,filed within one year of the dismissal of the action,will be considered timely.
identicality and solidarity 
suzuki argues that whatever tolling effect the filing of the action may have had,it does not save the instant action against suzuki,because this action is not identical to the action.suzuki is correct that does not toll the statute of limitations for all claims arising out of the same facts,at quoting fernández chardón,cir.rather,instituting an action before the courts pursuant to only tolls the statute of limitations with respect to identical subsequent actions.see id.citing cintrón estado libre asociado de,wl see also del valle vornado realty trust,d,explaining that in order for a prior judicial action to toll the statute of limitations as to a later filed complaint,it is necessary that the second complaint assert a cause of action identical to the one asserted in the first action.this rule is known as the identicality requirement,at.we have held that,in order to be identical under,the claims asserted in the subsequent action must seek the same form of relief as the first action must be based on the same substantive claims and provided that other puerto rico tolling statutes do not rescue the claims on other grounds must be asserted against the same defendants in the same capacities new defendants should not be added.id.at.this identicality requirement serves to prevent plaintiffs from circumventing the notice function of the statute of limitations by asserting different claims in belated federal court complaints.id.at.
suzuki relies on the identicality requirement to argue,as the district court held,that the action did not toll or reset the statute of limitations as it pertains to the claims against suzuki because there was no identicality of parties between the action and the subsequent suits.specifically,suzuki argues that because rodríguez never sued suzuki in the action and never sued rainbow or panorama in the action,the action was not identical to the action,and therefore the action did not toll the statute of limitations with respect to suzuki.because the action was untimely,suzuki reasons,it could not serve to toll the statute of limitations with respect to the instant action against suzuki,which was not filed until,and therefore,this action was properly dismissed.we disagree.as noted above,identicality has been read to include,inter alia,a requirement that for a prior suit to have a tolling effect upon a subsequent suit,it must be asserted against the same defendants,but only provided that other puerto rico tolling statutes do not rescue the claims on other grounds,at emphasis added.in this case,we find that another provision of puerto rico law known as the solidarity doctrine rescues this claim.
the solidarity doctrine,rooted in article of the puerto rico civil code is based on the theory that there is one obligation,shared by several debtors.tokyo marine,at in such situations,the interruption of prescription against one defendant also interrupts the prescription of claims against any other defendants who are solidarily liable with the first.tokyo marine,at citing laws ann.tit,and arroyo hosp.la concepción,june,see also laws ann.tit,interruption of prescription of actions in joint obligations equally benefits or injures all the creditors or debtors.thus,in situations where various defendants are held to be solidarily liable with each other,this doctrine has been interpreted to allow for the timely inclusion of a solidary tortfeasor not originally included in an action.see arroyo,at quoting official translation.the theory is that t he interruption of the prescription of the cause of action based on a unitary obligation need only be performed once.tokyo marine,at.relying on the solidarity doctrine,rodríguez argues that suzuki,the manufacturer of the motorcycle,is solidarily liable with rainbow,the retailer,and panorama,the distributor,and that therefore,by filing the action against rainbow and panorama,rodríguez tolled the statute of limitations against all joint tortfeasors including suzuki.
the threshold question is whether there is in fact solidarity between rainbow or panorama and suzuki such that the interruption of the statute of limitations as to the former prejudiced the latter.solidarity exists under puerto rico law when several people take part or cooperate in causing a wrong.arroyo,at.the puerto rico supreme court has held that joint tortfeasors are solidarily liable.tokyo marine,at citing arroyo,at see also id.at a rticle of the civil code applies to joint tortfeasors,so that the timely filing of a suit against one joint tortfeasor had interrupted the prescription of the suit against the other tortfeasors.under article,when the negligent acts of more than one person have adequately caused a harm,each such person is a joint tortfeasor who is liable in full to the plaintiff for the harm caused.id.at.the district court found it clear that solidarity exists in this case between panorama,rainbow and suzuki.we agree.as the district court explained 
plaintiff alleges that suzuki,rainbow and panorama sold a motorcycle that was amongst other things,negligently designed,tested,assembled,packaged,marketed,advertised and sold.based on these allegations,plaintiff seeks compensation for pain and suffering,as well as the cost of the motorcycle.since suzuki was the manufacturer of the motorcycle,and plaintiff claim is one for product liability,it is clear that solidarity amongst the defendants exists.
rodríguez,at.the district court finding of solidarity is further bolstered by puerto rico adherence to the theory of strict tort liability in cases involving products liability.aponte rivera sears roebuck de,official translation see also del caribe,d,noting that in a cause of action in products liability,as a matter of public policy,each and every entity involved in the chain of distribution is strictly liable to the consumer citing ferrer delgado motors,rev on other grounds sub nom.exxon mobil allapattah,d.thus,under puerto rico law,all those who take part in the manufacturing and distribution chain of a product are solidarily liable,along with the manufacturer,to the injured party.aponte rivera,at.
concluding that panorama,rainbow and suzuki are in fact solidarily liable,we must now address rodríguez argument that his action,filed against parties solidarily liable with suzuki,effectively tolled the statute as to his subsequent actions against suzuki.though no single case is entirely controlling,this argument has substantial support in the case law.for example,in tokyo marine,plaintiff,the subrogee for an imported automobile dealer mitsubishi,brought a tort action under article of the puerto rico civil code against pérez y,the owner of a storage facility where plaintiff automobiles were stored,for property damage to mitsubishi vehicles resulting from their storage in pérez y cía.facility.see at.the cause of action,which was filed more than one year after it had accrued,had been dismissed by the district court on grounds that it was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.id.at.the issue before us was whether the plaintiff interposed an extrajudicial claim that successfully interrupted the prescription of the cause of action before the original term expired.id.at.we held that it did.id.at.we reasoned that tokyo marine effectively tolled the statute of limitations pursuant to article by filing,within the limitations period,an extrajudicial claim letter against pérez y cía.liability insurer,uac.id.we further reasoned that because pérez y cía.was solidarily liable with its insurer,under article,the timely interruption of prescription as to uac had a like effect as to its insured.id.at.thus,we reversed the district court conclusion that the challenged claim was time barred,and amended the judgment accordingly.id.at.
a similar result was reached by the puerto rico supreme court in sánchez montalvo.in that case,the plaintiff,who was injured in an airport terminal,filed an extrajudicial claim letter against the port authority on the day of the accident.id.at.no extrajudicial letter or other tolling mechanism,however,was timely filed against american airlines,which controlled the area where the accident took place,even though plaintiff was on notice that american could be liable.id.at.two years later plaintiff filed an action under article against the port authority and american airlines.id.the trial court dismissed the action against american as,reasoning that plaintiff failed to interrupt the statute of limitations as to american.id.at.nevertheless,the puerto rico supreme court reversed the dismissal.id.the supreme court held that t he cause of action in regards to the port authority not being time barred,and joint liability between the port authority and american having been alleged,the interruption of the prescriptive term with regards to the port authority interrupted the term equally for american.id.citing martínez díaz,see also garcía colón garcía rinaldi,d,holding that by sending extrajudicial claim letter to one physician,malpractice plaintiff effectively tolled the statute of limitations as to the other joint tortfeasors including another physician and the hospital,thereby rendering suit against the others,outside the limitations period,timely.
suzuki acknowledges that these cases support the proposition that the filing of an extrajudicial claim letter toll s the running of the statute of limitations,even against those parties to whom a tolling letter had not been sent,but attempts to distinguish them on the ground that rodríguez did not file an extrajudicial claim,but rather,instituted a judicial action.we find this distinction unpersuasive.as noted above,article provides three mechanisms which can be employed to toll the statute of limitations,and these include,inter alia,filing an extrajudicial claim and instituti ng an action before the courts.laws ann.tit.neither the statute nor the case law provide a basis for differentiating among these mechanisms with respect to the consequences of solidarity upon their operation,nor does suzuki provide us such a basis.in fact,the case law suggests the contrary.for example,in tokyo marine,when discussing the tolling mechanism in the context of the solidarity doctrine,we stated as follows 
t he interruption of prescription against one defendant also tolls the statute against any other defendants who are solidarily liable with the first.regardless of the method used,when the prescriptive period is successfully interrupted,the full period begins to run again.
at emphasis added and footnote and citation omitted.although in tokyo marine the statute of limitations was tolled via the filing of an extrajudicial claim letter,we stated that the result would be no different in the event of a prior suit tolling the statute of limitations for a subsequent suit.see id.at noting that the interruption of prescription as to one solidary debtor affects the other solidary debtors,so that a suit against one joint tortfeasor may be filed up to one year after judgment is entered in a suit against another joint tortfeasor citation omitted see also garcía pérez,wl,at noting that filing a judicial or extrajudicial claim against a tortfeasor interrupts the prescription period in question as to the rest of the solidary tortfeasors.this reading is also the one most consistent with other provisions of puerto rico law,including article of the civil code,which provides that a creditor may sue any of the joint debtors or all of them simultaneously and that t he actions instituted against one shall not be an obstacle for those that may be brought subsequently against the others,as long as it does not appear that the debt has been collected in full.laws ann.tit,emphasis added.
moreover,there are other cases on point in which the timely filing of a judicial action has been found to toll the statute of limitations as to new defendants who are solidarily liable with those against whom the action was initially filed.for example,in garcía molina gobierno de la capital,the plaintiff sued the municipality of san juan and its insurer for injuries sustained in a car accident while plaintiff was a passenger,but failed to sue either the owner or the driver of the vehicle,official translation see also hernández moreno serrano marrero.discussing garcía molina.codefendants,the municipality and its insurer,then moved to file a complaint against the owner of the vehicle outside the limitations period.garcía molina,at.addressing the timeliness issue,the puerto rico supreme court noted,citing sections and of the civil code,that actions instituted against any one of the joint debtors shall prejudice all of them and that i nterruption of prescription of actions in joint obligations equally benefits or injures all the creditors or debtors id.at.applying the solidarity doctrine,the puerto rico supreme court thus concluded that t he original complaint against the plaintiffs the municipality and its insurer having been filed within one year,prescription against the defendants the owner and driver of the vehicle had been interrupted and the complaint was therefore timely filed.id.at.
similarly,in torres vázquez commercial union ins,longshoreman brought a tort action under puerto rico law against a marine terminal,but did not file a complaint against the marine terminal liability insurer until four years after the incident.d.the insurer sought to dismiss the complaint as barred by the applicable statute of limitations,but the district court denied the motion.id.at.the court,relying on our interpretation of puerto rico law in tokyo marine,held that because the original complaint against the marine terminal had been filed in a timely fashion,there is no doubt that the statute of limitations for all tortfeasors jointly liable,as is the insurer,was stalled for the interruption against one tortfeasor benefits all others.d at.thus,the amended complaint adding the marine terminal insurer as a defendant four years after the incident was held to be timely.id.
suzuki attempts to distinguish this line of cases on the ground that in these cases the plaintiffs took advantage of the tolling effect of the previously filed judicial complaint to file a complaint against additional solidarily liable tortfeasors in the same action rather than in a subsequent suit.in contrast,rodríguez seeks to rely on the tolling effect of the action in a subsequent action against the alleged joint tortfeasor.however,we see no basis for regarding this distinction as dispositive.if initiating a judicial action against a tortfeasor tolls the statute of limitations as to all other tortfeasors jointly and severally liable with the first,as the solidarity doctrine provides,and that action is dismissed without prejudice thereby permitting its before the courts,there is no basis for concluding that the tolling effect of the initial action somehow ceases as a result of the dismissal,especially given that puerto rico provides for the reset of the statute of limitations upon dismissal.
to be sure,we are not holding that identicality is inapplicable when tolling the statute of limitations in suits involving solidarily liable tortfeasors.rather,for a prior judicial or claim to toll the limitations period for a suit against a solidary tortfeasor,the later suit must nevertheless contain the same substantive claims and seek the same relief.as we stated in rodríguez narvaez,tolling the statute as to one jointly and severally liable defendant tolls it as to all,but the tolling is effective with regard only to identical causes of action.at citation omitted.in this case,we conclude that the causes of action stated in the,and actions were identical,in that each was a products liability action seeking damages resulting from the same alleged defects in rodríguez suzuki motorcycle.
the requirement of identicality of parties,however,can not apply where the parties against whom the statute of limitations was tolled and those parties ultimately sued are solidarily liable for the same obligation.we find this interpretation to be the clearest way of reconciling the identicality requirement with the solidarity doctrine as those concepts are applied in puerto rico law.to hold otherwise and allow the identicality requirement to preclude additional defendants from being later sued,where the prescription period has been effectively tolled against other defendants solidarily liable with those defendants,would directly violate the principle that the interruption of prescription of actions in joint obligations equally benefits or injures all the creditors or debtors.see laws ann.tit.in other words,mandating identicality of parties between a prior and subsequent suit as a prerequisite to tolling,where the solidarity doctrine allows a prior suit against one solidary tortfeasor to toll the statute of limitations with respect to a subsequent lawsuit against other tortfeasors solidarily liable with the first,would render the solidarity doctrine meaningless.
thus we read the solidarity doctrine as requiring that,with respect to identical causes of action,the filing of a judicial action against one solidarily liable defendant tolls the statute as to all defendants solidarily liable with the first.this is the case regardless of whether the tortfeasors are brought into the initial action that created the tolling effect or they are sued in a subsequent action.these principles compel a result in rodríguez favor.
accordingly,we conclude that rodríguez effectively tolled the statute of limitations as to his actions against suzuki,pursuant to sections and of title of the puerto rico civil code,by timely bringing before the court an identical cause of action against parties solidarily liable with suzuki.the instant action having been filed within the limitations period,which reset after the dismissal of those prior actions,the district court erred in holding rodrígue
