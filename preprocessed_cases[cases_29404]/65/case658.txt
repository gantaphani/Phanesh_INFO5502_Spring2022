the five plaintiffs in these three consolidated actions are the special administrators,as well as surviving family members,of individuals who were killed in the city of chicago in crimes involving illegal firearms.in each case,the killer was either a minor or a young adult who had obtained the weapon from a minor.in three instances plaintiffs young,smith,and ceriale,the illegal weapons were recovered and traced to specific defendants.in the two remaining instances plaintiffs macias and bowman,the guns used in the fatal shootings were never recovered.plaintiffs theories of liability included negligence and public nuisance.
each plaintiff named manufacturers and distributors of firearms as defendants.this group of defendants included the manufacturers of the three recovered weapons and two distributors who handled one of the recovered weapons.in addition,plaintiffs young and ceriale named the retail gun dealers who sold the weapons used in the shootings of their sons.plaintiff smith named the gang member who shot and killed her pregnant daughter.thus,the named defendants included who had been involved in the manufacture,distribution,sale,or use of the specific guns used in the shootings of andrew young,salada smith,and michael ceriale,as well as other manufacturers,distributors,and dealers.these others are the unrelated defendants,who,plaintiffs claim,are members of a core group of irresponsible businesses that significantly contribute to the creation and maintenance of the alleged public nuisance.
the negligence counts counts v and vi of all three complaints were dismissed by the circuit court of cook county and are no longer at issue.the circuit court denied defendants various motions to dismiss the public nuisance counts,but certified for immediate interlocutory appeal the question of whether the plaintiffs had stated a cause of action for public nuisance.
the appellate court held that the two plaintiffs who could not identify the defendants who manufactured,distributed,or sold the specific firearms used in the killings of their loved ones lacked standing altogether because their injury was not fairly traceable to any named defendant.d at,quoting glisson city of marion.these plaintiffs,macias and bowman,did not seek leave to appeal.
the appellate court also held that the three plaintiffs who could identify the specific firearms used in the shootings of their decedents had stated a cause of action for public nuisance in count i of each of their complaints d at.because count i of each complaint was directed at only the manufacturer of an identified weapon,this holding does not apply to the distributor defendants.as a result,none of the distributor defendants are parties to this appeal.
count ii of each complaint alleged that the unrelated defendants participated in the creation and perpetuation of a public nuisance.the appellate court held that all five plaintiffs lacked standing to press their claims against those defendants who did not manufacture,distribute,or sell the three recovered firearms.d at.plaintiffs young,smith,and ceriale did not seek leave to appeal the dismissal of their claims against the unrelated defendants.
in counts iii and iv,plaintiffs,as representatives of a class of similarly situated individuals,sought to impose liability for the alleged public nuisance upon all named gun industry defendants.count iii sought damages count iv sought injunctive relief.the appellate court did not address counts iii and iv or the question of class certification.however,because the appellate court held that plaintiffs lack individual standing to press their claims against the unrelated gun industry defendants,it necessarily follows that they lack standing to sue as representatives of a class.plaintiffs young,smith,and ceriale did not seek leave to appeal the dismissal of their individual claims against the unrelated defendants.thus,the question of class certification is moot.
finally,the appellate court held that plaintiffs young and ceriale,in count vii of their complaints,had stated a claim for public nuisance against the dealer defendants who sold the guns used to kill their sons.
pursuant to rule a a,we granted leave to appeal to two of the manufacturer defendants,bryco arms,and smith wessoncorporation,and two of the dealer defendants,breit johnson sporting goods,and chuck gun shop.
we have permitted the national association of manufacturers and the product liability advisory council to file briefs amici curiae on behalf of the defendants.we have also permitted the attorney general of the state of illinois and the illinois trial lawyers association to file briefs amici curiae on behalf of the plaintiffs.
background 
state law prohibits minors from owning firearms ilcs west,and municipal ordinances generally prohibit possession of handguns within the city of chicago.nevertheless,numerous violent crimes are committed each year in the city of chicago by juveniles armed with illegal weapons.
on june,andrew young,son of plaintiff stephen young,was shot and killed by latin kings gang member,mario ramos.ramos obtained the semiautomatic bryco handgun used in the shooting from a juvenile gang member.the weapon was manufactured by defendant bryco arms and shipped to distributor jennings,and then to distributor riley,in september,defendant dealer breit johnson sporting goods,sold the gun to mariano divittorio.previously,divittorio had purchased over guns from breit johnson.plaintiff young asserts that breit johnson had reason to know that divittorio was engaging in straw purchases for the benefit of daniel escobedo,a convicted felon with ties to the latin kings street gang.escobedo then allegedly made the gun available to other latin kings,including at least one juvenile gang member.
michael ceriale,a police officer and the son of plaintiff anthony ceriale,was killed while conducting narcotics surveillance in chicago.jonathan tolliver,the gang member who shot ceriale,used a magnum revolver manufactured by defendant smith wesson.this gun,after passing through the hands of a distributor,a retail dealer,and at least two owners,was purchased from a private party by chuck gun shop and later resold.thereafter,the gun changed hands at least twice,in illegal transactions,before it was used by tolliver to kill michael ceriale.
the complaints do not allege that bryco,smith wesson,breit johnson,or chuck gun shop violated any applicable state or federal law or municipal ordinance governing the manufacture or sale of firearms.rather,plaintiffs young and ceriale allege that these four remaining defendants have substantially contributed to the creation of a public nuisance in the city of chicago by designing,manufacturing,marketing,and selling guns that are intended to appeal to criminals in general and to juvenile gang members in particular.
interlocutory appeal was taken to the appellate court pursuant rule.in the certified question,the appellate court was asked to determine whether plaintiffs had stated a cause of action for public nuisance.thus,the certified question was similar in nature to a motion to dismiss under section of the code of civil procedure ilcs west,which challenges the legal sufficiency of a complaint by alleging defects on its face.we review de novo an order granting or denying a section motion wakulich mraz,and,therefore,we apply the same standard of review to the appellate court answer to the certified question in the present case.
in reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint,we accept as true all facts and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from those facts.jarvis south oak dodge.in addition,we construe the allegations in the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.wakulich,at.when the plaintiff theory of liability is public nuisance,the pleading requirements are not exacting because the concept of common law public nuisance elude s precise definition.city of chicago festival theatre.the existence of a nuisance depends on the peculiar facts presented by each case.donaldson central illinois public service,quoting city of chicago commonwealth edison,d.a sufficient pleading in a cause of action for public nuisance will allege a right common to the general public,the transgression of that right by the defendants,and resulting injury.feder perry coal.because the element of resulting injury requires two separate injury and a cause creating this complaint must allege four distinct elements of a public nuisance claim the existence of a public right,defendants substantial and unreasonable interference with that right,proximate cause,and injury.
section of the restatement second of torts addresses the issue of standing to bring an action for public nuisance and states that an individual,as opposed to a governmental entity,may recover damages in an action for public nuisance only if he or she has suffered harm of a kind different from that suffered by other members of the public exercising the right common to the general public that was the subject of interference.restatement second of torts.this statement is consistent with law in illinois.see,chicago general ry.chicago,burlington quincy,an individual may seek an injunction against an obstruction of a public highway only when he has shown that he will suffer special damage,different in degree and kind from that suffered by the public at large mcdonald english,a plaintiff must show special injury to maintain an action for an obstruction to the streets.
we need not,however,determine whether the tragic personal losses suffered by plaintiffs constitute the type of special injury necessary to confer standing because we conclude that,as a matter of law,they can not state a claim in public nuisance against these defendants.
public right 
as alleged in the allegations of fact portion of the ceriale and young complaints,defendants substantially and unreasonably interfere with the right of the plaintiffs class to use the public spaces of the city of chicago without undue risk of injury to themselves and to their families.as authority for the existence of such a right,plaintiffs rely on village of des plaines poyer,in which this court stated,in dicta,that the right of the people to be free from disturbance and reasonable apprehension of danger to person and property is to be respected and jealously guarded.
the issue in poyer,however,was whether the village exceeded its authority by declaring public picnics and dances to be nuisances per se.poyer,at.this court held that although the village was empowered by statute to declare what would be deemed a nuisance within its borders,it did not have the power to declare a nuisance where no nuisance,in fact,existed.poyer,at.the language quoted by plaintiffs does not support their claim of a public right because,if every sort of conduct that caused a public disturbance or the reasonable apprehension of danger to person or property were to be considered a nuisance,the law of nuisance would swallow the entire law of torts and most of the criminal law.
defendant breit johnson suggests that the public right claimed by plaintiffs is merely a generalized assertion of the individual right not to be assaulted.see,restatement second of torts,comment g a public right is not like the individual right that everyone has not to be assaulted.breit johnson argues,further,that even if such a public right were to be recognized,plaintiffs are not seeking redress for a violation of the public right.rather,as evinced by their prayers for relief seeking damages pursuant to the wrongful death act ilcs et west,they seek a remedy in tort for injuries to specific individuals.
in city of chicago beretta,we expressed reservations regarding the existence of a public right to use the public space without undue risk of injury.although we continue to doubt the wisdom of recognizing such a broad and public right,we assume without deciding that plaintiffs have properly pleaded the existence of a public right that is affected by the alleged nuisance and turn to our consideration of the elements of unreasonable interference and proximate cause.
unreasonable interference 
we held in city of chicago that when a commercial enterprise is highly regulated by state or federal law,the operators of the enterprise may not be held liable in public nuisance for a resulting interference with a public right unless the defendant conduct is not in compliance with the law the defendant was otherwise negligent or the law permitting the conduct is itself invalid for allowing a nuisance.city of chicago,at,citing gilmore stanmar,d.in addition,it is implicit in our adoption of the gilmore rule that intentional conduct,if nonnegligent and allowed by the statutes and regulations governing a highly regulated industry,can not give rise to liability for public nuisance.
both the manufacturer and dealer defendants are engaged in businesses that are highly regulated by state and federal law.see,et gun control act ilcs et west firearm owners identification card act.plaintiffs have not alleged that any defendant has violated an applicable statute or ordinance governing the manufacture or sale of firearms or that the laws permitting defendants to engage in the businesses of manufacturing or selling firearms are themselves invalid.plaintiffs do allege that defendants have intentionally engaged in conduct designed to increase their sales of certain types of firearms that,while legal,are particularly appealing to the criminal element.as noted above,such intentional conduct can not be the basis for public nuisance liability in this case.thus,the viability of plaintiffs nuisance claims depends on whether plaintiffs have properly pleaded that defendants are otherwise negligent in the conduct of their businesses.city of chicago,at,citing gilmore,d at.
a claim based on negligence,whether the theory of liability is nuisance,malpractice,or any other species of tort,may not lie in the absence of a duty owed by the defendant.washington city of chicago.according to the complaints,defendants duty arises from section of the criminal code of ilcs west,which makes it a felony to sell or give a handgun to a minor,and from certain provisions of the chicago municipal code,which generally forbid the possession and use of firearms in the city.the complaints do not describe the nature of the claimed duty,its scope,or precisely to whom it is owed.
if the claimed duty is merely the duty to follow the law,plaintiffs claim must fail under the gilmore rule because,as noted above,plaintiffs do not allege that defendants have violated section of the criminal code.with regard to the municipal ordinances,plaintiffs offer no authority for imposing a duty arising from the existence of a municipal ordinance on parties doing business outside the municipality.if the mere enactment of a municipal ordinance were to give rise to a duty on those outside the municipality,there would be no end to liability.
the complaints,however,allege that these defendants have a duty to go beyond mere compliance with applicable law.the claimed duty appears to be a duty to implement business practices designed to minimize the risk of the type of harm that the statutes and municipal code provisions were designed to address.in essence,plaintiffs claim is that because section and the municipal code are ineffective in keeping handguns away from juveniles in the city,these defendants must have breached a duty owed to the residents of the city.
because the briefs and arguments of the parties focus almost entirely on the element of proximate cause and direct so little attention to the question of duty,we decline to resolve this case on this basis.we note,however,that in city of chicago we held that the manufacturer and distributor defendants owed no duty to the plaintiff city or its residents to prevent the illegal possession and use of their products within the city.city of chicago,at.our judgment is not altered by the present plaintiffs reliance on section of the criminal code and the municipal code of the city of chicago as the source of such a duty.
proximate cause 
the term proximate cause encompasses two distinct requirements cause in fact and legal cause.lee chicago transit authority.the first requirement,cause in fact,is present when there is a reasonable certainty that a defendant acts caused the injury or damage.lee,at.in deciding this question,we first ask whether the injury would have occurred absent the defendant conduct.lee,at.in addition,when,as here,there are multiple factors that may have combined to cause the injury,we ask whether defendant conduct was a material element and a substantial factor in bringing about the injury.lee,at.
the second requirement,legal cause,is established only if the defendant conduct is so closely tied to the plaintiff injury that he should be held legally responsible for it.simmons garces,quoting mccraw cegielski,d.the question is one of public far should a defendant legal responsibility extend for conduct that did,in fact,cause the harm simmons,at.see keeton,prosser keeton on torts,at ed.as a practical matter,legal responsibility must be limited to those causes which are so closely connected with the result and of such significance that the law is justified in imposing liability.some boundary must be set to liability for the consequences of any act,upon the basis of some social idea of justice or policy.the proper inquiry regarding legal cause involves an assessment of foreseeability,in which we ask whether the injury is of a type that a reasonable person would see as a likely result of his conduct.lee,at.
although proximate cause is generally a question of fact lee,at,the lack of proximate cause may be determined by the court as a matter of law where the facts alleged do not sufficiently demonstrate both cause in fact and legal cause harrison hardin county community unit school district.
with regard to the element of proximate cause,the appellate court concluded that a reasonable trier of fact could find that the criminal misuse of guns killing persons were occurrences that defendants know would result or were substantially certain to result from the defendants alleged conduct.d at.in reaching this conclusion,the appellate court relied on a comment accompanying section of the restatement and rejected defendants reliance on martin harrington richardson,cir concluding that illinois would likely follow the weight of authority,which holds that criminal misuse of a handgun is not a foreseeable consequence of gun manufacturing.
because the existence of cause in fact is a question of fact for the jury,we agree with the appellate court that,in the present case,a reasonable jury could find that the manufacture of a certain magnum by smith wesson,its subsequent sale by chuck gun shop,along with at least three transfers of ownership in between and one or more transfers after were causes in fact of the shooting of michael ceriale.that is,if the gun had never been made,or if any of the intervening possessors of the gun had destroyed it,it would not have been used by a gang member to murder a police officer.the same can be said of the bryco that killed andrew young we acknowledge the point raised by defendant breit johnson that the killers of these two young adults would likely have obtained other guns if these particular weapons had not been available to them,but conclude that this observation is more relevant to the legal cause inquiry than to the cause in fact inquiry.
as for the question of legal cause,the appellate court reliance on section of the restatement,and comment b thereto,is misplaced.this section does not address the element of proximate cause.instead,it deals with the type of conduct essential to liability for public or private nuisance.an actor will be held liable for a nuisance if his conduct consists of a an act or b a failure to act under circumstances in which the actor is under a duty to take positive action to prevent or abate the interference that constitutes the nuisance.restatement second of torts.in the ordinary case,comment b instructs,liability for nuisance arises because one person acts set in motion a force or chain of events resulting in the invasion.restatement second of torts,comment b.further,s o far as the actor liability is concerned,it is immaterial whether he does the acts solely in the pursuit of his own interests or whether he is acting for another,gratuitously,under contract or as the other servant or agent.it is enough that his acts are a legal cause of the invasion.emphasis added.restatement second of torts,comment b.
thus,section and comment b do not provide the answer to the question of whether the alleged conduct of defendants constitutes a legal cause of the claimed nuisance.rather,comment b merely poses the the conduct of these defendants a legal cause of the alleged interference with a public right the answer to this question must be found elsewhere.
the appellate court properly stated the relevant rule regarding the question of legal cause in the subset of cases involving injuries that are caused directly by the intervening acts of third parties 
in the special case where plaintiff injuries result not from defendant direct actions,but from the subsequent,independent act of a third person,the issue of legal causation becomes the following whether the intervening cause is of the type that a reasonable person would see as a likely result of his conduct.d at,citing first springfield bank trust galman.
in galman,however,we further explained that if the defendant conduct merely furnishes a condition by which injury is made possible,and a third person,acting independently,subsequently causes the injury,the defendant creation of the condition is not a proximate cause of the injury.galman,at.more recently,in abrams city of chicago,we reiterated that the analysis applies to cases in which injury is caused by the intervening acts of third parties.
defendants argue that their lawful manufacture and sale of nondefective handguns is not the legal cause of any resulting harm,either wrongful death or public nuisance,brought about by the independent,intervening,criminal acts of third parties over whom they have no control.instead,they assert,their conduct merely furnished a condition that made the injuries possible,citing galman,at.cases cited in support of this position include hartnett boston store of chicago,store sale of rifle and cartridges to minor,although illegal,was not the proximate cause of his negligent injury of the plaintiff because the store negligence merely furnished a condition that made the injury possible riordan international armament,d,manufacturers and distributors of guns used in fatal shootings were not liable for wrongful deaths of victims because they owed no duty to the victims of crimes committed by third parties linton smith wesson,d,manufacturer of firearm owed no duty to plaintiff who was shot by third party martin harrington richardson,noting,in products liability case,that every illinois court considering the issue has determined that the criminal misuse of firearms is not reasonably foreseeable to the manufacturer.
plaintiffs accurately point out that these cases come from negligence and products liability law,not from the law of nuisance.riordan and linton,in particular,are not helpful in our inquiry,because both cases were decided on the threshold issue of duty.
plaintiffs offer numerous cases,dating from to,in which defendants have been held liable for a public nuisance created by the criminal or disorderly conduct of third parties,only one of which,bucks strawn,wl,was decided by an illinois court.the plaintiffs in bucks were residents of the neighborhood surrounding several houses of ill fame who sought injunctive relief to abate the nuisance caused by unruly patrons.the patrons made loud noises,used obscene and blasphemous language,and generally conducted themselves in a lewd and riotous manner,even making indecent exposures of their persons at the windows of the establishments.bucks.the requested relief was granted.
bucks and the other ancient cases cited by plaintiffs offer little support for their claim that defendants conduct should be deemed a legal cause of a public nuisance created by the subsequent,independent,criminal acts of third parties.in bucks,and in each of the other cited cases,the criminal or disorderly conduct at issue was inextricably tied to the defendant use of land in a manner that unreasonably interfer
