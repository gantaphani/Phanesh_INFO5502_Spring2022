the trial court granted summary judgment to respondent perini corporation perini resulting in the dismissal of an asbestos action filed against it by appellant patricia casey and her late husband john casey plaintiffs on appeal,plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred by failing to find that perini did not meet its initial burden of production of evidence in support of its summary judgment motion,by improperly excluding from evidence their expert witness declaration,and by disregarding their evidence that perini exposed casey to asbestos.we affirm.
between to,casey worked as a plumber and pipefitter.he performed this work at countless jobsites.casey was diagnosed with mesothelioma in january.on march,plaintiffs filed a complaint for personal injury and loss of consortium against numerous defendants,including perini,alleging that casey developed mesothelioma through his occupational exposure to asbestos.
plaintiffs identified perini as having been the general contractor at three jobsites in san francisco where casey had worked the civic auditorium auditorium,the alcoa building building,and the hyatt regency hotel hotel.perini role as general contractor at these sites was to hire subcontractors such as casey employer,coordinate the timing and scope of their work,and keep the projects within budget.
during discovery,plaintiffs asserted that casey was exposed to asbestos by working in close proximity to trades employed by perini handling and disturbing products at the auditorium,building,and hotel jobsites.other than naming casey,plaintiffs were unable to identify any lay witness with knowledge of facts supporting their claims against perini.
at his deposition,casey testified that he had worked at the building as an apprentice plumber for approximately six months in the mid.he did not know if any of the products he had used,or used by others in his presence,contained asbestos.he was also unable to identify the brand name,manufacturer or supplier of any of the materials that had generated the dust later swept up or disturbed by perini workers.casey did not know if the dust and debris contained asbestos.as to the auditorium jobsite,casey recalled that perini was involved in carpentry and framing.to the extent perini activities created dust and debris,casey thought there was probably asbestos in whatever the perini workers were cleaning up.casey,however,did not know the brand name or manufacturer of any of the materials used at the auditorium jobsite.he also could not differentiate between products that allegedly contained asbestos and those that did not.finally,as to the hotel jobsite,casey did not know whether perini was even the general contractor at that site.
relying on casey deposition testimony and plaintiffs discovery responses,perini moved for summary judgment,arguing inter alia that plaintiffs had no evidence indicating casey was actually exposed to asbestos as a result of any perini activity.plaintiffs opposed the motion,arguing both that perini did not meet its threshold burden of showing that plaintiffs could not establish all elements of their causes of action and that even if it did,they demonstrated triable issues of material fact about casey exposure to asbestos.
prior to the summary judgment hearing,plaintiffs served new interrogatory responses claiming for the first time that casey had been exposed to surfacing materials at the auditorium,building,and hotel jobsites.plaintiffs,however,never identified the brand name,or the suppliers,of any surfacing materials used at the jobsites.they also failed to provide any evidence regarding the contents of the construction materials used at the jobsites and failed to identify anyone who had knowledge of the contents of such materials.
plaintiffs submitted an expert witness declaration from kenneth cohen.in his declaration,cohen opined that all surfacing materials,particularly fireproofing,used in the construction of office buildings prior to contained asbestos.he based his opinion on a set of assumed facts and two federal occupational safety and health administration osha regulations that presumed all surfacing materials present in buildings constructed before contained asbestos.see general industry asbestos standard,construction asbestos standard.cohen also relied on records from the bay area air quality management district baaqmd regarding the building,which revealed that asbestos abatement activities had occurred at this site from to.according to cohen,these records constituted evidence of asbestos in the original structural fireproofing material 
perini objected to cohen declaration,challenging,among other things,its foundation,as well as the expert reliance on the osha regulations and the baaqmd records.plaintiffs argued that their expert properly relied on the regulations and records.
the trial court heard the summary judgment motion over the course of three hearings in november.at the end of the first of these hearings,the trial court denied perini motion for summary judgment on all issues other than asbestos content.it invited plaintiffs to submit further opposition on two issues the relevance of the osha regulations and the effect of the upcoming deposition testimony of perini person most knowledgeable pmk.perini was permitted to respond to any opposition before the next hearing.
in their supplemental opposition,plaintiffs asserted that the osha regulations established a legal presumption of materials and that the trial court was required to consider the reasonable inferences of asbestos exposure stemming from this presumption.plaintiffs also pointed out that the witness perini had provided as its pmk had no knowledge of the facts regarding the jobsites where casey had worked he also had no information concerning the asbestos content of any product used at those jobsites.the pmk further testified that perini had no information to challenge the osha presumption that materials used in the pre construction of the building were.
plaintiffs also provided the uncertified deposition testimony of robert sawyer,defendant occupational medicine expert,whose deposition had been taken only the day before.sawyer testified that casey history of occupational exposure to asbestos was sufficient in its aggregate form to cause mesothelioma.sawyer further testified that fireproofing retardant used on structural steel prior to more likely than not contained asbestos.
in its supplemental reply,perini argued that the osha regulations were not relevant in the instant case,asserting that the regulations at most created a regulatory presumption against building owners and not against tort defendants.perini noted that the presumptions were part of a scheme that enables osha to force owners of buildings constructed before to test for the presence of asbestos using osha testing procedures and reporting guidelines.perini added that osha enforces these regulations by monetary fines.perini reasoned that the osha presumption should not apply to nonbuilding owners,because the only method for rebutting the presumption is to conduct testing of the buildings,yet there is no evidence that perini would have the ability or right to conduct such testing.
following an additional round of supplemental briefing,the trial court held the third and final hearing on perini summary judgment motion.at the start of the hearing,the trial court announced that it had determined that the osha presumption is not something that to be carried forward as a presumption under evidence code section the trial court further questioned whether the presumption could provide the foundation for cohen opinion.
in december,the trial court granted perini summary judgment motion.in so ruling,the trial court sustained perini objections to the cohen declaration.it found that perini had satisfied its burden of producing evidence that plaintiffs did not possess and could not reasonably obtain evidence that the materials attributable to perini to which casey was exposed actually contained asbestos.the trial court also found that plaintiffs did not produce admissible evidence creating a triable issue of fact on the question of actual exposure to asbestos.in april,the trial court entered judgment for perini on all causes of action.plaintiffs timely appealed from the judgment.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review a trial court grant of summary judgment de novo.scheiding dinwiddie construction th.t he party moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact if he carries his burden of production,he causes a shift,and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th.california law requires that a defendant moving for summary judgment present evidence,and not simply point out that the plaintiff does not possess,and can not reasonably obtain,needed evidence.id.at,fn.omitted.
perini met its initial burden of production 
we first examine plaintiffs contention that perini,as the defendant below,did not meet its initial burden of producing evidence sufficient to make a prima facie showing that plaintiffs can not establish causation.perini motion for summary judgment focused on plaintiffs negligence claim,as plaintiffs were no longer pursuing the other causes of action products liability and premises liability against perini.
perini based its summary judgment motion on plaintiffs minimal discovery responses,contending that its discovery,in the form of casey deposition and special interrogatories,was comprehensive and that plaintiffs factually devoid responses indicated that they could not prove causation.on appeal,plaintiffs contend that their discovery responses provided facts sufficient to require denial of summary judgment and that perini did not meet its burden of production by merely asserting that plaintiffs had no evidence to support their claims.
casey deposition testimony 
casey deposition testimony established that he worked at various jobsites where perini was allegedly the general contractor.according to casey,perini workers swept up or disturbed debris at the jobsites in casey presence.however,when asked about the asbestos materials that would have been cleaned up by perini workers,casey admitted that he did not know what materials contained asbestos and what materials did not.rather,he assumed there was probably asbestos in whatever they were cleaning up.he was unable to recall the name of any products used at the jobsites.
casey deposition made clear that he had no knowledge about whether any of the products that others used or disturbed in his presence contained asbestos.specifically,he was unable to give a definitive answer when asked if he had any information or knowledge that he was exposed to asbestos through the activities or inaction of perini.his answer was as follows well,i got what i got.i got it someplace and i got it from dust so if it was on this job,it was on one of the jobs.you know,was it in that dust,i not an expert.
plaintiffs interrogatory answers 
perini propounded a series of standard asbestos interrogatories,as well as special interrogatories.in response to standard interrogatories sets one and two,requesting information about casey employment history,plaintiffs responded that casey worked alongside or in close proximity to laborers sweeping and cleaning up debris,whom he believed were employed by perini at the following jobsites the auditorium while employed by scott company for eight to months in to the building while employed by scott company for six months in to on various commercial building jobs while employed by rodoni becker in to and the hotel for six to eight months while employed by rodoni becker.plaintiffs answers did not establish any specific evidence regarding casey exposure to asbestos due to perini conduct.
perini special interrogatory asked plaintiffs to identify each fact in support of their contention that perini was liable to them for exposing casey to asbestos or products.in response,plaintiffs referred to their response to special interrogatory,which asked plaintiffs to identify each location where they claimed that casey was exposed to asbestos or products by perini.after listing the auditorium,building,and hotel jobsites,plaintiffs stated as follows casey worked throughout these buildings installing new plumbing and water lines during new construction.perini corporation was the general contractor at casey worksites.casey identified these perini contractors through their hard hats and signs on the jobsites indicating perini corporation was the general contractor.casey worked next to carpenters and laborers employed by perini corporation.these perini carpenters performed framing,installed tracks on ceilings,laid forms,performed finishing,poured concrete including reinforcing the existing structural sic with concrete,and laid out partitions throughout the building.when these perini carpenters installed the tracks for the ceilings they would first shoot into the concrete ceiling and then run a wire through the ceiling.this work would disturb the overspray on the ceiling and cause it to fall down on everyone in proximity and also to fall down all over the floor.casey also worked next to laborers employed by perini.these perini laborers would clean up and sweep up the dust and debris in casey presence.the laborers would use brooms and shovels when they swept up the dust and debris and then would place this debris into a wheelbarrow.this dust and debris consisted of the materials used by the plasterers when they performed work to sic the interior of the buildings.when these perini laborers swept this dust and debris it created a lot of dust that casey necessarily breathed.casey never work sic a mask at any of these jobsites.these jobsites where perini corporation was the general contractor were the filthiest and dirtiest jobsites casey worked at during his career.casey expert will testify that sweeping plastering materials caused dust to become airborne.casey expert will also testify that disturbing overspray caused dust to become airborne.as a direct result of defendant conduct,casey necessarily breathed in dust.italics added.
this answer was insufficient to support a claim.it contains little more than general allegations against perini and does not state specific facts showing that casey was actually exposed to asbestos products due to perini activities.rather,this answer assumes,without any evidentiary support,that the dust and debris allegedly disturbed by perini workers contained asbestos.
perini propounded other special interrogatories in its effort to obtain all of the facts known to plaintiffs regarding casey exposure to asbestos due to perini conduct.plaintiffs provided little,if any,substantive reply.for example,perini asked plaintiffs to identify any and all asbestos or products by trade name,generic name or,or any slang or nickname used in casey occupation for which they claimed casey had been exposed to as a result of perini activities.rather than provide any identifying facts about the asbestos and products,plaintiffs referred to their answer to special interrogatory.
perini also asked plaintiffs to identify with specificity the amount or extent of casey exposure to asbestos or products at each location and also asked plaintiffs to state every fact supporting their determination regarding the amount or extent of casey exposure at each location.in responding to these questions,plaintiffs again relied on their answer to special interrogatory.
perini also asked plaintiffs to identify each person having knowledge of the amount or extent of asbestos exposure.the only person identified by plaintiffs was casey himself.
as can be seen by this review,plaintiffs answered comprehensive interrogatories by stating in effect that they had no specific facts supporting their claims against perini.in sum,perini discovery was sufficiently comprehensive,and plaintiffs responses so devoid of facts,as to lead to the inference that plaintiffs could not prove causation upon a stringent review of the direct,circumstantial and inferential evidence contained in their interrogatory answers and deposition testimony.andrews foster wheeler llc th,andrews,citing scheiding dinwiddie construction,supra,th at.perini met its initial burden of presenting evidence sufficient to make a prima facie case showing that triable issues of fact did not exist regarding causation.andrews,supra,th at.therefore,the burden shifted to plaintiffs to establish a triable issue of fact regarding causation.
plaintiffs expert evidence amounted to speculation 
plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred in excluding the declaration of their expert for lack of foundation.they argue that any questions going to foundation pertain to the weight and not the admissibility of the expert opinion.as we shall explain,we find no abuse of discretion.
background 
cohen,a retired industrial hygienist,had been previously employed by california osha.cohen declared that he had extensive experience consulting on workplace asbestos exposure levels and abatement procedures within the industry including commercial buildings,office buildings and industrial facilities.he declared,based on his training,experience,and study,that casey was near to the manipulation of asbestos containing building products presumed to contain asbestos during the period of through,including residue from the manipulation of firespray which invariably contained asbestos,dust from mixing asbestos containing powder used in materials applied to pipes,fittings and surfacing materials sprayed or or otherwise applied to surfaces and casey was working alongside laborers employed by perini corporation sweeping and shoveling asbestos containing materials into the air he breathed.
cohen declared that his opinion that the building materials contained asbestos was based on his training,study,experience,and testing,and reflected the accepted position of the profession of industrial hygiene which is incorporated into osha standards.he further explained that he relied on two osha regulations the general industry asbestos standard and the construction asbestos standard that presumed that all surfacing materials,including or fireproofing materials,present in buildings constructed before contained asbestos.
cohen also reviewed the baaqmd records regarding the building.he opined that asbestos abatement records in connection with work done at the building in,through,and through constitute evidence of asbestos in original structural fireproofing material 
the trial court sustained perini objection to the declaration,finding cohen conclusion that perini exposed casey to materials was implicitly without foundation,as the osha regulations upon which cohen relied were irrelevant.in so ruling,the trial court explained as follows the issue is whether there was or was not asbestos in this debris.the osha regulations are designed not to say whether there is or is not asbestos in any particular instance,but to set forth an efficient regulation as to warnings this is a factual inquiry.osha does make the decision whether perini was sweeping up material.this is a factual inquiry.
cases dismissing expert declarations in connection with summary judgment motions do so on the basis that the declarations established that the opinions were either speculative,lacked foundation,or were stated without sufficient certainty.citations.it is sufficient,if an expert declaration establishes the matters relied upon in expressing the opinion,that the opinion rests on matters of a type reasonably relied upon,and the bases for the opinion.citation.citation.powell kleinman th.
citing evidence code section,subdivision b,plaintiffs argue that it was entirely reasonable for cohen to rely on the osha regulations regarding presumed materials,as the regulations are exactly the type of things an industrial hygienist would consider and rely on in forming opinions in his work.plaintiffs insist that any questions regarding the foundation for cohen reliance on the osha regulations go to the weight and not the admissibility of his opinion.the reasonableness of an expert opinion,however,is a question of degree,and may well vary with the circumstances.buckwalter airline training center d.for example,an expert opinion,may not be based on assumptions of fact that are without evidentiary support or based on factors that are speculative or conjectural,for then the opinion has no evidentiary value and does not assist the trier of fact.citation.moreover,an expert opinion rendered without a reasoned explanation of why the underlying facts lead to the ultimate conclusion has no evidentiary value because an expert opinion is worth no more than the reasons and facts on which it is based.citations.citation.powell kleinman,supra,th at.
here,cohen opinion that casey was exposed to materials is based on two osha regulations providing that buildings constructed before were built with presumed materials.notably absent is any factual support for the proposition that the challenged jobsites contained asbestos during the relevant time period.the instant case is analogous to andrews,supra,th.there,the court determined that a similar declaration by cohen lacked a sufficient factual basis to create a triable issue of fact.the court was specifically troubled with cohen ment theory that the plaintiff may have been exposed to asbestos fibers released into the air of an active naval ship almost two decades before he was aboard the ship because the asbestos fibers earlier released continually contaminate the surrounding air by reentrainment and circulation throughout the various ship compartments.id.at.in andrews,the plaintiff produced no evidence that the defendant product gaskets were removed during an overhaul,and he admitted in his deposition testimony that he had no knowledge that he was exposed to one of the defendant products.id.at.the court concluded that the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant because the plaintiff could not prove causation.id.at.
here,as well,plaintiffs did not produce any evidence that the dust and debris casey allegedly was exposed to by perini workers contained asbestos.indeed,at his deposition,casey admitted that he did not know whether the dust and debris contained asbestos.rather,he assumed there was probably asbestos in whatever the perini workers were cleaning up.moreover,casey was unable to recall the name of any products used at the jobsites.casey also was unable to give a definitive answer when asked if he had any information or knowledge that he was exposed to asbestos through the activities or inaction of perini,responding with the following answer i got what i got.i got it someplace and i got it from dust so if it was on this job,it was on one of the jobs.you know,was it in that dust,i not an expert.
cohen declaration,in turn,relied on casey assertions that he worked alongside perini workers,who were sweeping and cleaning dust and debris.in his declaration,cohen concluded that casey was near the manipulation of asbestos containing building products presumed to contain asbestos during the period of through,including residue from manipulation of firespray which invariably contained asbestos and surfacing materials,and working alongside laborers employed by perini corporation sweeping and shoveling asbestos containing materials which would have entrained asbestos fi b ers into the air he breathed.
here,as in andrews,cohen conclusions are speculative and lack a sufficient foundation.his conclusions are based,in part,on casey speculation that the dust and debris contained asbestos,an assertion lacking a sufficient factual basis.cohen conclusion also rests on two regulatory presumptions that are similarly lacking any factual basis in the instant case.without knowledge of certain foundational facts,an expert opinion is simply too tenuous to create a triable issue regarding causation.saelzler advanced group cal th.here,cohen declaration does nothing more than suggest the possibility of exposure without any basis in fact.
relying on buckwalter airline training center,supra,d,plaintiffs contend that the court should have accorded cohen more latitude in his opinion because there was no direct evidence of casey exposure to asbestos.plai
