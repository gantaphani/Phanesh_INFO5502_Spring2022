background 
appellant kimberly smith suffered severe injuries in a car accident while driving her bmw.she lost control of the vehicle which then left the road,struck an embankment,and rolled several times.her injuries resulted in quadriplegia.she brought a product liability lawsuit against bmw,alleging that the air bag in her car was faulty and that,had her air bag deployed,it would have reduced or prevented her injuries.
smith intended to offer at trial the testimony of larry williams,a certified accident reconstructionist,and stephen erickson,a forensic pathologist.williams was to testify regarding his calculations of the barrier equivalent velocity of smith vehicle when it struck the embankment.williams testimony would have established that the barrier equivalent velocity was great enough that a properly functioning air bag would have deployed upon impact erickson was to testify regarding his opinion that smith injuries would have been prevented or reduced had the air bag properly deployed.
bmw moved for the exclusion of erickson testimony and for summary judgment.the district court set a daubert hearing for june.one week before the hearing,bmw moved to exclude the proposed testimony of williams as well.bmw informed the district court that it would be calling john bentley,an accident reconstruction expert,to testify at the daubert hearing in opposition of williams.
at the daubert hearing,williams testified regarding his calculations of the principal direction of force and measurements of vehicle deformation,or crush,which he entered into the edcrash computer program to calculate the barrier equivalent velocity of smith vehicle when it struck the embankment williams concluded that the barrier equivalent velocity was to.
regarding the principal direction of force,williams testified that he visited the scene of the accident with the state trooper who viewed the accident scene in the immediate aftermath of the crash.he also visited the auto salvage yard with that trooper.this permitted williams to incorporate the trooper firsthand observations with my work.he stated that the trooper statements about the evidence of the debris and path of travel of the vehicle helped him significantly.the trooper statements that the vehicle climbed the embankment led williams to conclude that the vehicle ha d to be going into the mountain.williams also consulted the driver who removed the damaged vehicle,read deposition testimony and the police report of the accident,and viewed various photographs of the vehicle.based upon the entirety of this evidence,williams concluded that the principal direction of force was no more than degrees into the front of the vehicle.he used as the principal direction of force input into the edcrash computer program when asked to explain how such an impact could account for the existence of side direction of crash damage and displacement of the front end of the vehicle,williams opined that the car sustained that damage when it rotated counterclockwise at impact.
as to his deformation measurements,williams testified that he began with a scale drawing of the vehicle around which he superimposed a rectangle fitted to the dimensions of the undamaged car.he used the rectangle to represent the vehicle in its undamaged state.from six different points along the edge of the rectangle corresponding to the front of the vehicle,he measured the perpendicular displacement from the rectangle to the damaged vehicle.it is from these displacement measurements,the principal direction of force,and data pertaining to the vehicle structure,that the edcrash computer program calculates the barrier equivalent velocity.
bmw then offers the expert testimony of bentley.bentley testified that williams incorrectly measured the displacement of the car front end caused by the accident.bentley also testified that williams estimate of the principal direction of force could not generate the counterclockwise rotation he said accounted for the side displacement of the front end.according to bentley,these mistakes in the data entered into the edcrash computer program led to an incorrect calculation of the barrier equivalent velocity.
bentley stated that williams use of a rectangle to represent the vehicle in its undamaged state led to incorrect displacement measurements.bentley testified that using a rectangular representation of the vehicle overmeasures displacement because such measurements from the rectangle to the deformed vehicle include air gaps,particularly at the corners of the vehicle.he stated that williams,rather than employ a rectangular model,should have used an exemplar representation of the vehicle,one that uses the actual parameters of the vehicle in an undamaged state.bentley asserted that use of an exemplar representation of the vehicle is necessary under a protocol for displacement measurement as set out by the tumbas papers 
williams testified that he had been trained to use a rectangular representation of the vehicle in order to account for the restitution,the amount the vehicle rebounds from the maximum engagement of the crush.restitution occurs nearly instantaneously in an accident it is immeasurable from an examination of the vehicle.according to williams,measurements will underestimate the actual deformation the vehicle sustained at its maximum engagement because they do not include restitution.williams commented that measurement of restitution is one of the real controversies currently in the literature.
smith also attempted to introduce the testimony of erickson,a forensic pathologist,to address the causation element of her claim.erickson based his opinions on his observations of the accident scene,discussions with the investigating trooper and treating neurosurgeon,his review of their depositions,his examination of smith vehicle,his interview with a witness to the crash scene,his review of smith medical records,the opinions of williams,and his experience as a forensic pathologist.
erickson assumed that smith was injured either when the car struck the embankment or during the subsequent rollover he determined that,to a reasonable degree of medical certainty,smith neck was broken at the initial impact of her vehicle with the embankment,rather than in the rollover.he based this opinion on the following factors according to her neurosurgeon,smith neck injury was a wedge fracture,more likely produced by neck flexion as the car quickly decelerated than by a rollover in which a compression or burst fracture would be more typical there was no medical evidence of trauma to smith head smith was wearing her seat belt at the time of the accident.
erickson further opined that,to a reasonable degree of medical certainty,the air bag would have prevented smith neck flexion and prevented or reduced her neck injuries had it deployed.erickson reached this conclusion based upon his understanding of how air bags operate,which he gained from personal observations and films,from attending a national conference for forensic pathologists on air bag operation,and from reading articles on what air bags are designed to do.
by order dated july,and pursuant to.and daubert merrell dow,d,the district court excluded the testimony of both williams and erickson,having determined that their opinions were unreliable and would not be helpful to the jury.the district court then granted summary judgment in favor of bmw because,without the testimony of her experts,smith could not succeed on her products liability claim.
smith moved the district court to vacate this final judgment pursuant to.b or b smith argued that in granting summary judgment to bmw,the district court relied on bentley false and misleading testimony.the district court denied the b motions in an order issued on december.smith now appeals both the summary judgment order and the order denying her b motion.we determine that the district court grant of summary judgment of dismissal to bmw be vacated and we remand for further proceedings.we dismiss smith appeal on the b issue.
ii.discussion 
smith argues that the district court erred in excluding the testimony of her experts,williams and erickson.
federal rule of evidence governs admissibility of expert testimony.rule explains 
if scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education,may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise,if the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data,the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods,and the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.
we review the exclusion of expert testimony for abuse of discretion.general joiner,d.we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.netland hess clark,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if,after viewing the facts and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,the record demonstrates that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see also.c celotex catrett,d.
under weisgram marley,d,an appellate court may direct entry of judgment as a matter of law when it determines evidence was erroneously admitted at trial and that the remaining,properly admitted,evidence is insufficient to constitute a submissible case.in a like manner,an appellate court may vacate a summary judgment on the ground that evidence that should have been admitted or is shown to be available creates a genuine issue of material fact requiring further proceedings.
exclusion of erickson proposed testimony 
erickson testified that,to a reasonable degree of medical certainty,smith neck was broken at the initial impact of her vehicle with the embankment,rather than in the rollover.he also testified that to a reasonable degree of medical certainty the air bag would have prevented or reduced her neck injuries,had it deployed.
the district court concluded that erickson opinions about the cause of smith neck injuries were not scientifically or medically reliable and therefore could not assist a jury.the district court offered seven reasons for concluding that erickson testimony was not scientifically or medically reliable his experience as a forensic pathologist was inapplicable to determining whether smith sustained a broken neck due to pure forces because,as a forensic pathologist,he has never seen or read about a car accident where a person neck was broken in this manner he did not know and could not estimate how much force occurred on the initial impact of the accident or how much force would have been required to break smith neck he relied on medical knowledge as opposed to scientific knowledge he did not perform a biomechanical evaluation using engineering or physics he could not use engineering principles to calculate possible accelerations upward in smith accident he based his opinion,in part,on williams opinion as to the barrier equivalent velocity of smith car at impact and his logically flawed conclusion that the forces,the ones that occurred at impact with the embankment acting on smith neck were more likely to have caused smith injuries than the forces incurred during the rollover portion of the accident because smith had no head wounds,there was no indication in the car that she hit her head on the roof,and she was wearing her seat belt.
the first five reasons offered by the district court all stem from what appears to be the court ultimate reason for excluding erickson testimony he is not an expert in biomechanics,physics,or engineering.the district court excluded erickson testimony because he did not know how much force smith neck could withstand,nor could he quantify the forces on smith body during the accident.however,erickson was not called to offer expert testimony on those issues.erickson offered his opinion that smith was injured when her vehicle struck the embankment rather than during the rollover.he based this opinion on information that fell within his field the injuries smith sustained,wedge fracture in neck and the injuries smith did not sustain,no trauma to her head.he applied his medical knowledge and his experience to the physical evidence and came to a conclusion as to the cause of smith neck injury.the fact that experts in other fields might also be able to form opinions regarding the cause of smith neck injury and would base those opinions on factors other than those used by erickson does not disqualify erickson from offering testimony that would be helpful to the jury.see smith ford motor,cir stating that an expert testimony need not relate directly to the ultimate issue that is to be resolved by the trier of fact,it only need be relevant to evaluating a factual matter clark by through clark heidrick,cir stating that experts who can offer a global understanding of the possible causes of an injury are useful to a jury.the district court abused its discretion in excluding erickson testimony about when and how smith suffered her neck injury.
the district court also abused its discretion in excluding erickson proposed testimony about whether a properly deployed air bag would have reduced or prevented smith injuries.erickson based his opinion on his knowledge of the basic operation of air bags and his knowledge of how injuries of the type sustained by smith occur and can be prevented.that is a sufficient basis for him to render an opinion on whether a properly deployed air bag would have reduced or prevented smith injuries.that erickson was unable to quantify how much of smith assumed forward neck flexion occurred before a properly functioning air bag would have deployed,or by how much smith forward neck flexion would have been reduced by an air bag,is not grounds to exclude his opinion,based upon factors within his expertise,that to a reasonable degree of medical certainty a properly deploying air bag would have reduced smith injuries.
exclusion of williams proposed testimony 
the district court determined that the method used by williams to put information into the edcrash program was fundamentally flawed.his opinions based upon those edcrash results are,therefore,inherently unreliable.in particular,the court found fault with williams estimates of principal direction of force and his displacement measurements.the court excluded williams proposed testimony in its entirety.
principal direction of force 
the district court concluded that williams estimate of the principal direction of force no more than twenty degrees into the hill was contradicted by the visible damage on the car and the principles of physics.the court determined that a principal direction of force would not cause the side displacement observed in photographs of the car.the court was dubious of williams explanation that counterclockwise rotation of the car as it struck and climbed the embankment caused the side displacement observable in photographs of the car.williams attempted to demonstrate his theory using a tablet and his hand,but this courtroom
