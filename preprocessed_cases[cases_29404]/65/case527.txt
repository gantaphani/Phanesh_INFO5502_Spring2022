this appeal comes to us after an action was dismissed under code of civil procedure sections hereafter,section and hereafter,section for failure to bring the matter to trial within three years of commencement of the action.the case presents an issue of federal law about which the federal courts,as well as state courts that have examined the issue,conflict.that issue concerns when a state court reassumes jurisdiction over a matter that has been removed to federal court and then remanded under title,section of the united states code hereafter,section.based upon the language and history of section,we hold that jurisdiction is not transferred back to the state court until the clerk of the federal district court mails a certified copy of the order of remand to the clerk of the superior court.
having concluded that the superior court did not have jurisdiction over the matter during the period from the removal of the action to federal court until the district court clerk mailed a certified copy of the remand order to the superior court clerk,we next address an issue of state law.we must determine whether that time period must be excluded when determining if the action may be dismissed under section,regardless of the plaintiffs diligence,or lack thereof,to ensure that the district court clerk mails the certified remand order to the superior court clerk.once again,we are bound by the language of the relevant statute,in this instance code of civil procedure section section.that statute provides,without qualification,that the time during which the jurisdiction of the trial court was suspended shall be excluded when computing the time within which an action must be brought to trial.therefore,we hold that the trial court erred by dismissing this matter for delay in prosecution,because the court jurisdiction was suspended for all but seven months of the period between the filing of the complaint and entry of the dismissal order.
background 
foreign air carrier and several insurers filed this action on may,alleging causes of action against numerous defendants for product liability,strict liability,and equitable indemnity arising out of an incident in which the landing gear on an aircraft collapsed upon landing in.two of the defendants,mcdonnell douglas corporation mdc and the boeing company boeing filed a notice of removal in federal court on august.all of the defendants who had been served at that corporation lockheed martin corporation honeywell international,and k f joinders to the notice of removal.mdc and boeing filed copies of the notice of removal and joinders in the state court on august.
plaintiffs moved in federal court to remand the action back to state court on august.the federal district court granted plaintiffs motion on december,and its order was entered on december.apparently,the district court clerk neglected to send a certified copy of the remand order to the superior court clerk.
although some of the parties engaged in minimal discovery shortly after the remand order was filed in federal court,no notice of the remand was given to the superior court until september,when plaintiffs made an ex parte application for an order the action on the court active docket and setting a case management conference.at the hearing on the ex parte application,plaintiffs attorney explained that the case had been in limbo for more than two years due to the district court clerk failure to send a certified copy of the remand order,and he was not certain what needed to be done to reactivate the case in state court.the trial court denied the ex parte application on the ground that plaintiffs had not shown good cause as to why the matter should be heard on an ex parte basis.
after the hearing,plaintiffs counsel called the district court clerk to inquire about the status of the case.this call apparently prompted the clerk to send a certified copy of the remand order to the superior court,which received it on september.on october,all of the served defendants which then also included aircraft braking systems corporation filed a joint motion to dismiss the action under sections and.
in their joint motion,defendants argued that the state court reassumed jurisdiction over the action as soon as the remand order was entered by the district court in december,and that dismissal was appropriate because plaintiffs had not exercised reasonable diligence in bringing their action to trial in the almost three years that had passed since the remand.in opposition to the motion,plaintiffs noted that a majority of federal courts that have considered the question of when jurisdiction is transferred back to the state court upon remand have held that jurisdiction is transferred only when the district court clerk mails a certified copy of the remand order to the state court clerk.therefore,plaintiffs contended that the state court jurisdiction over the present action was suspended for all but a few months since the filing of the complaint,and dismissal for failure to prosecute would be improper.
the trial court granted defendants joint motion.the court noted the split of federal authorities regarding the jurisdiction issue,and found the reasoning of one of the minority view cases,van ryn korean air lines.van ryn,to be most germane to this case.in that case,the district court held it was divested of jurisdiction upon entry of the order of remand because substance should prevail over form,and the action of a court entering an order of remand rather than the action of a clerk mailing a certified copy of the order should determine the vesting of jurisdiction.id.at.applying that holding to the present case,the court concluded that jurisdiction was returned to it upon entry of the district court order in december,and therefore more than three years had elapsed since the filing of the case.the court then considered several factors,including plaintiffs diligence,in determining whether to exercise its discretion to dismiss the action under sections and.finding that plaintiffs did nothing in three years to pursue their case,the court dismissed the case with prejudice.
plaintiffs appeal from the order dismissing their action.
discussion 
section,subdivision a provides that a court may in its discretion dismiss an action for delay in prosecution pursuant to this article on its own motion or on motion of the defendant if to do so appears to the court appropriate under the circumstances of the case.there are limits,however,to the court discretion to dismiss for delay in prosecution.under section,subdivision a,the court may not dismiss an action under section unless one of several conditions has occurred.the condition at issue in the present case is found in section,subdivision a a failure to bring the case to trial within three years after the action is commenced 
subdivision b of section provides that the times set forth in subdivision a are to be computed in accordance with various other statutes,including section.section provides in computing the time within which an action must be brought to trial pursuant to this article,there shall be excluded the time during which any of the following conditions existed a the jurisdiction of the court to try the action was suspended.b prosecution or trial of the action was stayed or enjoined.c bringing the action to trial,for any other reason,was impossible,impracticable,or futile.
plaintiffs argue that the trial court was required to exclude from its computation of the period the time that elapsed from defendants filing of their notice of removal on august,until the district court clerk mailed the certified copy of the remand order on september,because the state court was without jurisdiction during that time.in making this argument,plaintiffs rely upon the language of section and the majority of federal cases that have addressed when a federal court loses jurisdiction over a case that is remanded to state court.
defendants urge this court to follow the minority of federal courts that have held that the entry of a remand order terminates the federal court jurisdiction,because to hold otherwise would elevate form over substance.they also argue that plaint
