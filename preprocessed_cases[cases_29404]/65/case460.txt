here we consider what action is required of an attorney who receives privileged documents through inadvertence and whether the remedy of disqualification is appropriate.we conclude that,under the authority of state comp.ins.fund wps,th,d state fund,an attorney in these circumstances may not read a document any more closely than is necessary to ascertain that it is privileged.once it becomes apparent that the content is privileged,counsel must immediately notify opposing counsel and try to resolve the situation.we affirm the disqualification order under the circumstances presented here.
factual background 
two mitsubishi corporations collectively mitsubishi or defendants,and the california department of transportation caltrans,were sued by various plaintiffs after a mitsubishi montero rolled over while being driven on a freeway.subsequently,mitsubishi representatives met with their lawyers,james yukevich and alexander calfo,and two designated defense experts to discuss their litigation strategy and vulnerabilities.mitsubishi case manager,jerome rowley,also attended the meeting.rowley and yukevich had worked together over a few years.yukevich asked rowley to take notes at the meeting and indicated specific areas to be summarized.the trial court later found that rowley,who had typed the notes on yukevich computer,had acted as yukevich paralegal.at the end of the session,rowley returned the computer and never saw a printed version of the notes.yukevich printed only one copy of the notes,which he later edited and annotated.yukevich never intentionally showed the notes to anyone,and the court determined that the sole purpose of the document was to help yukevich defend the case.
the notes are written in a dialogue style and summarize conversations among yukevich,calfo,and the experts.they are dated,but not labeled as confidential or work product.the printed copy of these compiled and annotated notes is the document at issue here 
less than two weeks after the strategy session,yukevich deposed plaintiffs expert witness,anthony sances,at the offices of plaintiffs counsel,raymond johnson.yukevich,court reporter karen kay,and caltrans counsel darin flagg were told that johnson and sances would be late for the deposition.after waiting in the conference room for some time,yukevich went to the restroom,leaving his briefcase,computer,and case file in the room.the printed document from the strategy session was in the case file.while yukevich was away,johnson and sances arrived.johnson asked kay and flagg to leave the conference room.kay and flagg departure left only the plaintiffs representatives and counsel in the conference room.yukevich returned to find kay and flagg standing outside.yukevich waited approximately minutes,then knocked and asked to retrieve his briefcase,computer,and file.after a brief delay,he was allowed to do so.
somehow,johnson acquired yukevich notes.johnson maintained that they were accidentally given to him by the court reporter.yukevich insisted that they were taken from his file while only johnson and plaintiffs team were in the conference room.as a result,mitsubishi moved to disqualify plaintiffs attorneys and experts.the trial court ordered an evidentiary hearing to determine how johnson obtained the document.
the court reporter was deposed and denied any specific recollection of the sances deposition.she could not testify what she had done with the deposition exhibits that night and could only relate her general practice.she said she generally collects exhibits and puts them in a plastic covering.she did not remember ever having given exhibits to an attorney.she also testified that she had never seen the document in question.if documents other than exhibits remain on a conference table,she leaves them there.the trial court found that the sances deposition took place over approximately eight hours.it was a session and documents were placed on the conference table.
another member of plaintiffs legal team submitted a declaration supporting johnson assertion that he received the document from the reporter.the court ultimately concluded that the defense had failed to establish that johnson had taken the notes from yukevich file.it thus ruled that johnson came into the document possession through inadvertence.
the court found the document was dated,but not otherwise labeled.it contained notations by yukevich.johnson admitted that he knew within a minute or two that the document related to the defendants case.he knew that yukevich did not intend to produce it and that it would be a powerful impeachment document.nevertheless,johnson made a copy of the document.he scrutinized and made his own notes on it.he gave copies to his cocounsel and his experts,all of whom studied the document.johnson specifically discussed the contents of the document with each of his experts.
a week after he acquired yukevich notes,johnson used them during the deposition of defense expert geoffrey germane the notes purportedly indicate that the defense experts made statements at the strategy session that were inconsistent with their deposition testimony.johnson used the document while questioning germane,asking about germane participation in the strategy session.
defense counsel calfo defended the germane deposition.yukevich did not attend.calfo had never seen the document and was not given a copy during the deposition.when he asked about the document source,johnson vaguely replied that,it was put in sances file.calfo repeatedly objected to the whole line of inquiry with respect to an unknown document.he specifically said that,i do even know where this exhibit came from.
only after the deposition did johnson give a copy of the document to calfo,who contacted yukevich.when yukevich realized that johnson had his only copy of the strategy session notes and had used it at the deposition,he and calfo wrote to johnson demanding the return of all duplicates.the letter was faxed the day after germane deposition.the next day,defendants moved to disqualify plaintiffs legal team and their experts on the ground that they had become privy to and had used yukevich work product.as a result,they complained,johnson unethical use of the notes and his revelation of them to cocounsel and their experts irremediably prejudiced defendants.
the trial court concluded that the notes were absolutely privileged by the work product rule the court also held that johnson had acted unethically by examining the document more closely than was necessary to determine that its contents were confidential,by failing to notify yukevich that he had a copy of the document,and by surreptitiously using it to gain maximum adversarial value from it.the court determined that johnson violation of the work product rule had prejudiced the defense and the bell can not be unrung by use of in limine orders.accordingly,the court ordered plaintiffs attorneys and experts disqualified 
plaintiffs appealed the disqualification order.the court of appeal affirmed.
discussion 
attorney work product 
plaintiffs contend that the court of appeal erred by holding that the entire document was protected as attorney work product.we reject that contention.
the legislature has protected attorney work product under california code of civil procedure section which provides,a a writing that reflects an attorney impressions,conclusions,opinions,or legal research or theories is not discoverable under any circumstances.b the work product of an attorney,other than a writing described in subdivision a,is not discoverable unless the court determines that denial of discovery will unfairly prejudice the party seeking discovery in preparing that party claim or defense or will result in an injustice.
the legislature has declared that it is state policy to p reserve the rights of attorneys to prepare cases for trial with that degree of privacy necessary to encourage them to prepare their cases thoroughly and to investigate not only the favorable but the unfavorable aspects of those cases,subd.a.in addition,the legislature declared its intent to p revent attorneys from taking undue advantage of their adversary industry and efforts.code civ,subd.b.
thus,the codified work product doctrine absolutely protects from discovery writings that contain an attorney impressions,conclusions,opinions,or legal research or theories,subd.a see wellpoint health networks,superior court th,d.the protection extends to an attorney written notes about a witness statements.see rodriguez mcdonnell douglas d.rodriguez see also dowden superior court th,d.a ny such notes or recorded statements taken by defendants counsel would be protected by the absolute work product privilege because they would reveal counsel impressions,conclusions,opinions,or legal research or theories within the meaning of the work product doctrine.nacht lewis architects,superior court th,d.when a witness statement and the attorney impressions are inextricably intertwined,the work product doctrine provides that absolute protection is afforded to all of the attorney notes.rodriguez,supra,d at.
plaintiffs urge that the document is not work product because it reflects the statements of declared experts.they are incorrect.the document is not a transcript of the august,strategy session,nor is it a verbatim record of the experts own statements.it contains rowley summaries of points from the strategy session,made at yukevich direction.yukevich also edited the document in order to add his own thoughts and comments,further inextricably intertwining his personal impressions with the summary.see rodriguez,supra,d at.in this regard,the trial court found as to the content of the document,although it does contain overt statements setting forth the lawyer conclusions,its very existence is owed to the lawyer thought process.the document reflects not only the strategy,but also the attorney opinion as to the important issues in the case.directions were provided by yukevich as to the key pieces of information to be recorded,and yukevich also added his own input as to the important details,by inserting other words in the notes.the attorney impressions of the case were the filter through which all the discussions at the conference were passed through on the way to the page.the court concluded,t his court determines that the attorney directions to record only portions of the conference specific to the attorney concerns in the litigation are sufficient to support the finding that the notes are covered by the absolute work product doctrine,as the choices in statements to record show the thought process and are too intertwined with the document.
although the notes were written in dialogue format and contain information attributed to mitsubishi experts,the document does not qualify as an expert report,writing,declaration,or testimony.the notes reflect the paralegal summary along with counsel thoughts and impressions about the case.the document was absolutely protected work product because it contained the ideas of yukevich and his legal team about the case,subd.a.
ethical duty owed upon receipt of attorney work product 
because the document is work product we consider what ethical duty johnson owed once he received it.plaintiffs rely on transport indemnity insurance th,d aerojet,to argue that because the document was inadvertently received,johnson was duty bound to use the nonprivileged portions of it to his clients advantage.this argument fails.aerojet is distinguishable because there are no unprivileged portions of the document.
a review of aerojet,supra,th,d,demonstrates that it does not assist plaintiffs.aerojet insurance brokers had sent a package of materials to aerojet risk manager.the risk manager sent them on to aerojet attorney,devries.among these documents was a memo from an attorney at an opposing law firm.it was never ascertained how opposing counsel memo found its way into the package of documents.the memo revealed the existence of a witness whom devries ultimately deposed.when opposing counsel learned that devries had received the memo and thus discovered the witness,counsel sought sanctions.the trial court imposed monetary sanctions under section,subdivision a.aerojet,at,d.the court of appeal reversed the sanctions order.
the aerojet court first noted that devries was free of any wrongdoing in his initial receipt of the document.the court also observed that the existence and identification of the witness was not privileged.nor can the identity and location of persons having knowledge of relevant facts be concealed under the attorney work product rule citations.aerojet,supra,th at,d.defendants claimed no prejudice to their case as a result of the witness disclosure.indeed,they prevailed at trial.ibid.because counsel was blameless in his acquisition of the document and because the information complained of was not privileged,devries was free to use it.id.at,d.plaintiffs reliance on aerojet founders on the facts that distinguish it.here,yukevich notes were absolutely protected by the work product rule.thus,johnson reliance on aerojet is unavailing,particularly in light of the clear standard set out in state fund,supra,th,d.
in state fund,supra,th,d,the plaintiff sent defendant attorney telanoff three boxes of documents that were identical to the documents provided during discovery.inadvertently,plaintiff also sent pages of forms entitled,civil litigation claims summary,marked as work product,and with the warning,do not circulate or duplicate.id.at,d.in addition,t he word confidential was repeatedly printed around the perimeter of the first page of the form.ibid.when counsel discovered the mistake and demanded return of the documents,telanoff refused.the trial court,relying on american bar association aba formal ethics opinion,imposed monetary sanctions.
the court of appeal framed the issue as follows w hat is a lawyer to do when he or she receives through the inadvertence of opposing counsel documents plainly subject to the privilege state fund,supra,th at,d.after determining that the documents were privileged and that inadvertent disclosure did not waive the privilege,the court discussed an attorney obligation.the court of appeal disagreed that the aba opinion should regulate telanoff conduct.the court noted that the aba model rules on which the opinion was based do not establish ethical standards in california,as they have not been adopted in california and have no legal force of their own.citations.id.at,d.likewise,the court held that an aba formal opinion does not establish an obligatory standard of conduct imposed on california lawyers id.at,d.thus,under the circumstances telanoff should not have been sanctioned for engaging in conduct which has been condemned by an aba formal opinion,but which has not been condemned by any decision,statute or rule of professional conduct applicable in this state.ibid.
the state fund court went on to articulate the standard to be applied prospectively when a lawyer who receives materials that obviously appear to be subject to an privilege or otherwise clearly appear to be confidential and privileged and where it is reasonably apparent that the materials were provided or made available through inadvertence,the lawyer receiving such materials should refrain from examining the materials any more than is essential to ascertain if the materials are privileged,and shall immediately notify the sender that he or she possesses material that appears to be privileged.the parties may then proceed to resolve the situation by agreement or may resort to the court for guidance with the benefit of protective orders and other judicial intervention as may be justified.state fund,supra,th at,d.to ensure that its decision was clear in setting forth the applicable standard in these cases,the court explicitly stated that it declared the standard governing the conduct of california lawyers in such instances.id.at,d.
the existing state fund rule is a fair and reasonable approach the rule supports the work product doctrine,and is consistent with the state policy to p reserve the rights of attorneys to prepare cases for trial with that degree of privacy necessary to encourage them to prepare their cases thoroughly and to investigate not only the favorable but the unfavorable aspects of those cases and to p revent attorneys from
