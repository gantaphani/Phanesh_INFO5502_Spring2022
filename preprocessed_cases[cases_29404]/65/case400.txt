crown equipment corporation and north west handling systems,collectively crown appeal the district court ruling excluding the introduction of evidence in a product liability suit initiated by plaintiff william mceuin mceuin.mceuin was injured while operating a forklift manufactured by crown.at trial,mceuin claimed that the forklift was defectively designed because the operator cabin was not enclosed with a door and because crown did not provide an adequate warning concerning the risks associated with the forklift.the jury awarded mceuin compensatory and punitive damages.crown contends that the district court erred in not permitting the introduction of military forklift design specifications and reports of independent engineers consulted by crown.the district court had diversity jurisdiction to hear this action.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we affirm.
crown equipment corporation began designing forklifts in.crown eventually developed and produced for sale the.the is operated from a standing position,with the operator facing sideways so that by turning his head degrees he can shift his gaze from the front to the back end of the vehicle.although crown has manufactured and sold doors for the,the does not have a door enclosing the operator cabin as a standard feature.
in,price requested crown to install doors on the forklifts it purchased from crown to prevent or minimize injuries.crown discouraged price from ordering the doors,and as a result,price did not order doors.in march,north west handling systems,a distributor of crown equipment corporation forklifts,ordered a from crown equipment corporation,which it sold and delivered to price costco.
in,mceuin injured his left foot while operating the in the course of his employment with.mceuin injury occurred while he was operating the in a,or reverse,direction.mceuin diverted his attention in order to check on the position of the cargo,extending his left leg outside the operator cabin as he leaned toward the front of the forklift.his foot was crushed as the rear of the forklift collided with a steel post.
mceuin sued crown in federal district court under oregon tort law,or.stat,alleging that crown is strictly liable for designing,manufacturing,distributing,and selling the in an unreasonably dangerous condition because it failed to supply a door that would have reduced or eliminated the risk of injury to the operator left leg,and the was sold without adequate warnings of the severity of the risk of serious injury to the operator left leg caused by the lack of a door.mceuin sought both compensatory and punitive damages.
the warning posted by crown on the recommends that the operator s tay within the operator area and stop truck completely before getting off because legs outside the operator area can be pinned or crushed whenever the truck is moving.mceuin testified that he never knowingly extended his foot outside the operator cabin,but that his action in extending his leg was involuntary.mceuin presented evidence at trial,through the testimony of his experts,that the inadvertent extension of his foot to maintain his balance and the resulting injury were foreseeable due to the openness of the design and the position of the operator within the cabin.
according to mceuin theory of liability,the should have included a door in order to prevent accidents such as his from occurring.mceuin supported his claim for punitive damages by arguing that crown ignored applicable safety standards,lied to james perry,the price supervisor in charge of purchasing industrial equipment,and refused either to retrofit its forklifts with doors or to equip new models with them as part of a litigation strategy intended to prevent potential plaintiffs from inferring that crown conceded that the absence of a door was a design defect.
the district court excluded evidence considered by crown to be crucial to its defense.in particular,the court precluded crown from introducing evidence of military specifications requiring that forklifts be built without doors enclosing the operator cabin.those specifications direct that,for forklifts purchased by the military,the operator cabin shall permit unobstructed egress from the rear of the truck.crown sought to introduce this evidence in order to show that the military specifications preceded and influenced the design of its forklifts.
in addition,the court precluded crown from introducing reports generated by independent engineers and allegedly relied upon by crown in the design of its forklifts.in,crown requested universal energy systems to analyze accident reports involving forklifts operated,like the,from a standing position.crown claims that the results of the analysis showed that prompt exit provided the best operator protection in excursions and accidents and that remaining within the operator cabin provided the best protection in collisions of the kind that caused mceuin injury.in,crown hired romualdi,davidson and associates romualdi to perform a similar analysis of accidents involving crown forklifts producing similar results.romualdi concluded that the installation of a door or other type of closure to the operator compartment would not be advisable because the addition of a door would likely cause not only more injuries,but more severe injuries to operators of these lift trucks.
crown had intended to introduce both the military and independent engineering evidence in support of its position that forklifts with doors are more dangerous than forklifts without because of the resulting impairment of the operator egress during potentially fatal accidents in which a forklift is tipped over.the district court did not allow the introduction of the reports or of the military specifications.the court did,however,allow crown to introduce evidence that it had solicited and relied upon engineering reports and that it may have relied on military specifications in designing the.
at the close of mceuin case and then again at the conclusion of the evidence,crown moved for judgment as a matter of law on mceuin punitive damages claim.the district court denied both motions.
the jury found that crown warning was adequate,but it found that the design of the was dangerously defective.it divided fault for mceuin injury equally between plaintiff and defendants.the jury also determined that mceuin was entitled to punitive damages.the district court awarded mceuin half of his claimed compensatory damages and the jury full recommendation of punitive damages.crown renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law as to punitive damages under fed.civ.rule and,alternatively,moved for a new trial under fed.civ.rule.the district court denied crown motion,and crown appeals.

evidentiary.military specifications 
the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting mceuin pretrial motion to exclude the introduction of military specifications as irrelevant,thus inadmissable under rule of the federal rules of evidence,to prove that the lack of a door on a forklift is not unreasonably dangerous.crown sought to introduce the military specifications to demonstrate that the conformed with military standards,influenced the design of the,and supported its contention that a door is unreasonably dangerous.mceuin correctly argued that the military design specifications should be excluded because the has no application in any military setting and because military standards have no relevance in a strict liability claim where the focus is on the question of whether the product was in unreasonably dangerous condition at the time of sale.see or.stat.
the district court also considered whether the military specifications should be admitted for the limited purpose of their relevance to the punitive damages claim.although the military specifications may be relevant to prove the state of mind of crown in designing the,the district court properly performed the balancing test in determining not to admit the military specifications.see fed.evid.stating that relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion,or undue delay.the court stated that excluding the military specifications would not preclude the designer from testifying that he was aware of and may have relied on a military standard,without going into what the military standard is or was.crown design engineer,dan dunlap,was permitted to and did in fact testify to this effect.
crown argues that the specifications should have been admitted because mceuin took advantage of their exclusion to argue before the jury that no standards required crown to manufacture its forklifts without doors.however,neither the american national standards institute ansi nor the occupational safety and health administration osha require that forklifts be designed and manufactured without doors.see powered industrial truck operator training.codified at,and.ansi,acting through subcommittee,promulgates standards for industrial vehicles operated in the private sector.the relevant ansi standards provide 
operator protection shall be designed so as not to interfere with the normal operation of the controls,to allow getting on and off the truck easily,and to permit rapid exit in an emergency.
ansi safety standards.moreover,o perator enclosures may be provided in conjunction with the platform.if provided,they shall permit easy ingress and egress from the platform.id.thus,ansi regulations specifically note that doors may enclose the operator cabin.the military specifications at issue,not having the force of law,could not have required crown to manufacture its forklifts to any particular specification.
crown argues on appeal that the military specifications themselves are directly relevant to crown state of mind and,therefore,should have been admitted for the purpose of challenging mceuin claim for punitive damages.under oregon law,a claim for punitive damages must be proved by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has acted with malice or has shown a reckless and outrageous indifference to a highly unreasonable risk of harm and has acted with a conscious indifference to the health,safety and welfare of others.or.stat.punitive damages are interpreted by the oregon supreme court as a penalty for conduct that is culpable by reason of motive,intent or extraordinary disregard of or indifference to known or highly probable risks to others.andor united air lines,or,see also demendoza huffman,or.
the court qualification to its ruling,that defense witnesses would be permitted to testify to defendant awareness of and reliance upon military specifications,speaks directly to the state of mind consideration.the court stated that it would permit crown design engineers to testify as to their state of mind in considering military specifications while developing the without allowing them to introduce the contents of those specifications.although the court did not explicitly refer to fed.evid.rule,it seems likely that the court was concerned about the prejudicial effect of introducing the specifications themselves.military specifications would appear to carry the imprimatur of government sanction,and might therefore resemble in the jury mind something akin to an actual regulation.in addition,both the legal effect and the genesis of these specifications might have been put at issue by introducing the specifications themselves,resulting in confusion of the issues for the jury as well as in an unnecessary waste of the court time.
because the court had discretion to exclude the specifications under rule,it committed no error by doing so.see,longenecker motors,cir stating that t rial judges are better able to sense the dynamics of a trial than we can ever be,and broad discretion must be accorded them in balancing probative value against prejudice.however,even if the court erred by excluding relevant evidence without relying upon rule,crown has failed to prove prejudice.crown engineer dunlap was permitted to provide state of mind testimony in which he referred to the military specifications.it is not clear that knowledge of their content would have influenced the jury decision,as the specifications do not report the government independent investigation into the safety considerations at issue in this case.in other words,the jury could have concluded that the military specifications were motivated by price rather than safety concerns.if the jury so concluded,the fact that crown followed those specifications would do nothing to refute mceuin theory that crown was motivated by profit,rather than by safety concerns.
independent engineering reports 
the district court did not err in granting mceuin pretrial motion to exclude independent engineering reports as inadmissable hearsay.see fed.evid.crown engineers allegedly solicited and relied upon reports by outside engineers.these engineers,however,were not provided as expert witnesses,and therefore,the reports could not be authenticated under fed.evid.crown suggested that the court receive the evidence with a limiting instruction to the jury,stating that the reports could not be used to resolve the issue of defect but could be used to determine dunlap state of mind when designing the.although crown indicated that it was inclined to agree with the court analysis that the reports were inadmissible as to the strict liability claims,crown continues to claim on appeal that the reports are admissible as to both the strict liability and punitive damages claim.
the district court decided to exclude the reports on two grounds.first,the court ruled that the reports were hearsay.second,the court stated that those documents and reports would come in,albeit for the state of mind of crown however,the actual impact,as viewed by the jury,would be such that i do believe they could,in fact,limit the use of those reports for consideration with respect to possible punitive damages.
federal rule of evidence provides that hearsay evidence is not admissible.hearsay is offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.fed.evid.c see also bergene salt river project agric.improvement power,cir.the district court hearsay ruling properly applies to crown attempt to use independent reports as evidence that the design of the was not defective,against plaintiff liability claim.however,the hearsay ruling does not apply to mceuin punitive damages claim,because,as the court recognized,the reports would be relevant to reveal crown state of mind.rule provides for a state of mind exception to the hearsay rule,and crown attempted limited use of the independent engineering reports clearly satisfies that exception.
a district court decision to exclude or admit evidence under fre is reviewed with considerable deference.united states hankey,cir citing united states cordoba,cir united states easter,cir quoting united states fagan,cir,for the proposition that t he district judge is given wide latitude in determining the admissibility of evidence under this standard.rule provides that relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.fed.evid.in order to exclude the independent reports from use to refute plaintiff punitive damages claim,the court had to determine that their probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice as provided by rule.crown requested the district court to admit the independent safety reports with a limiting instruction admonishing the jury to consider them only within the context of crown state of mind
