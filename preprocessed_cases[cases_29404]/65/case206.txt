in this products liability case,plaintiff michael gilfeather,who was severely injured in a workplace accident involving a crane manufactured by defendant manitowoc boom trucks,appeals from the magistrate judge grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant.plaintiff also appeals the magistrate judge decision to exclude his primary expert witness for failure to meet the reliability factors outlined in daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d.we now affirm.
on october,michael gilfeather was working on a job site near cookeville,tennessee.he and two other workers,delayne williams and bruce williams,were installing a new cell phone tower with the aid of a boom truck crane manufactured by manitowoc.this crane,also known as the manitowoc after its model number,is basically a flatbed truck with a crane mounted on the bed.the crane sits on a large turret,and thus can swivel a full degrees.the boom of the crane then extends hydraulically,from a length of feet in its fully retracted position to a length of feet when fully extended.the manitowoc is capable of hoisting and moving very large materials and equipment at a construction site,up to a maximum weight of pounds tons.when the crane is in operation,the truck is secured by two front outriggers and two rear stabilizers.the rear stabilizers extend down and meet the ground at a angle,whereas the front outriggers extend out from the frame of the truck at a angle,much like the legs of a spider 
delayne williams,who had been operating the crane for much of the day,had to leave the job site early but could not do so because one of the front outriggers was blocking his vehicle.at the suggestion of gilfeather,he partially retracted this outrigger,such that it was no longer in contact with the ground.delayne williams drove out,but at this precise moment bruce williams attempted to use the crane to move some heavy materials.without its fourth outrigger on the ground,the manitowoc fell over,severely injuring gilfeather.
the accident left gilfeather physically and mentally incapacitated to the extent that he was unable to bring the present diversity suit against manitowoc on his own behalf.rather,he now proceeds through his legal guardian,shirley johnson.gilfeather primary allegation was that the manitowoc was defective unreasonably dangerous,both because of an unsafe design and because of inadequate warnings.gilfeather proposed only one expert witness,gary friend,to support his claims.friend is a registered professional engineer in the states of illinois and missouri.after receiving his master degree in engineering in,he taught engineering at a community college in kansas city,missouri,for ten years.since approximately,however,he has been employed exclusively as an engineering consultant and has testified in a wide range of design defect cases.as the magistrate judge noted,he has rendered opinions on the design of almost any machine,including a wheelchair,a deep fat fryer,a passenger elevator,an antique replica shotgun,a hay baler,a meat tenderizer,a forklift,a manure spreader,a lawn mower,a seat belt assembly,a log skidder,a concrete saw,a trampoline,and a tree stand.johnson manitowoc boom trucks,d.
friend preparation for the instant case consisted primarily of document review deposition testimony,discovery responses,brochures and owners and operators manuals for a variety of truck cranes,american national standards institute ansi standards for different kinds of mobile boom trucks,statements of persons in the area of the accident,and the tennessee occupational safety and health administration tosha report of the accident with accompanying photos.he also personally inspected and photographed the subject truck crane.based on this research,friend prepared a report in which he opined that the manitowoc was defectively designed because its outriggers were not electronically linked to the crane operation via an interlocking system.by means of such an interlocking system,if any one outrigger were not in contact with the ground as measured by pressure asserted on the foot of the outrigger,the boom crane would lock and become inoperable until such time as the outrigger was put back down onto firm ground.an interlocking outrigger system,according to friend,would have prevented gilfeather accident,because bruce williams would not have been able to operate the crane with the front outrigger retracted,and thus the boom truck would not have tipped over onto gilfeather.
friend focused in particular on brochures and manuals for the asplundh line lift bucket truck,a machine that has had an interlocking outrigger system since.the asplundh truck is significantly smaller than the manitowoc.such trucks are generally only rated to carry people,in a bucket mounted on the end of the crane arm.they are typically used for jobs such as telephone repair work or tree trimming and removal.they are not rated to carry nearly the amount of weight that the manitowoc can lift.at the same time,however,the asplundh truck is by no means a small machine,and the weight of the crane alone not to mention the torque placed on the truck when the crane extends outward is sufficient to require outriggers on the asplundh when the crane is in operation.after reviewing the mechanics and electronics of the asplundh,friend presented a detailed schematic,joint app x at,in which he attempted to diagram how the asplundh interlocking system could be fitted to the manitowoc.he did not actually test his schematic,other words,he conducted no empirical research to determine just how functional his proposed retrofit of the manitowoc might be.friend also opined that the manitowoc should have included a specific warning to operators about the possibility that the crane might tip over with the outriggers in the up position while rotating the boom with no load on it.
manitowoc moved to exclude friend proposed testimony,arguing for a variety of reasons that it was unreliable.the magistrate judge,whom the parties had consented to conduct all proceedings,granted manitowoc motion to exclude.having stricken friend testimony,the magistrate judge then granted manitowoc motion for summary judgment on grounds that under tennessee law,expert testimony is absolutely required for a products liability action to proceed.gilfeather now appeals.
tennessee products liability law,which both parties agree applies to this diversity case,recognizes two different tests for determining whether a product is unreasonably dangerous.the first,the test,is used where a product is dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it.ray ex rel.holman bic,see also brown raymond,cir.the second,the test,imputes knowledge of the dangerous condition to the manufacturer,and then asks whether,given that knowledge,a prudent manufacturer would market the product.ray,at.as the tennessee supreme court has articulated,t he consumer expectation test is,by definition,buyer oriented the prudent manufacturer test,seller oriented.id.at.
both parties recognize that the test is best applied to this case because it involves establishing the unreasonable dangerousness of a complex product about which an ordinary consumer has no reasonable expectation.id.and where the test applies,expert testimony about the prudence of the decision to market becomes essential to a plaintiff case in chief.see also brown,at.thus,although gilfeather raises two issues for review,the exclusion of his expert is really the whole ballgame without the expert,he stands little chance of overcoming summary judgment.
which deals with the testimony of experts,provides 
if scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education,may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise,if the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data,the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods,and the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.
this rule,amended in,reflects the supreme court decisions in daubert and kumho tire company carmichael,d.in daubert the court charged trial judges with the responsibility of acting as gatekeepers to exclude unreliable expert testimony,and the court in kumho clarified that this gatekeeper function applies to all expert testimony,not just testimony based in science.advis.comm.notes to.as gatekeeper,the trial judge is imbued with discretion in determining whether or not a proposed expert testimony is admissible,based on whether it is both relevant and reliable.kumho,at.relevance is not at issue in this case.the magistrate judge found that friend proposed testimony was clearly relevant,and neither party disputes this finding on appeal.the only contested issue is reliability.
in daubert,the supreme court provided a nonexhaustive list of factors which may,in any given case,bear on a trial judge gatekeeping determination.these factors include whether a theory or technique can be and has been tested whether the theory has been subjected to peer review and publication whether,with respect to a particular technique,there is a high known or potential rate of error and whether there are standards controlling the technique operation and whether the theory or technique enjoys general acceptance within a relevant scientific community.at.six years after issuing daubert,the court made clear in kumho that these same factors are as applicable in the context of engineering testimony as in scientific testimony.the whole point of kumho,after all,was that the distinction between scientific knowledge at issue in daubert and technical or other specialized knowledge at issue in kumho,as here is fuzzy at best.at.
the kumho court also made clear that in the engineering context especially,the factors listed above do not constitute a definitive checklist or test.id.at.quoting daubert,at.rather,the gatekeeping inquiry must be tied to the facts of a particular case,depending on the nature of the issue,the expert particular expertise,and the subject of his testimony.id.this very flexible inquiry requires a reviewing court to be highly deferential when assessing not just a trial court analysis of each factor,but also the trial court initial selection of which factors are relevant to the case at hand.as justice breyer noted,t he trial court must have the same kind of latitude in deciding how to test an expert reliability,and to decide whether or when special briefing or other proceedings are needed to investigate reliability,as it enjoys when it decides whether or not that expert relevant testimony is reliable.id.at.emphasis in original see also brown,at noting that because our review in such cases is for abuse of discretion,we must grant the judge broad latitude in determining the reliability or relevance of the testimony internal quotation marks omitted.
in the instant case,the magistrate judge looked at the four factors listed above and determined that only three of them were relevant the extent to which the opinions of gary friend had been tested the extent to which his opinions had been subjected to peer review or publication and the extent to which his theory regarding interlocking outriggers had gained general acceptance within the community.onto these three factors,however,the magistrate judge grafted a fourth,one which had not been mentioned by the supreme court in either daubert or kumho.that fourth factor,as the magistrate judge put it,was the extent to which friend opinions were prepared in the context of litigation.
we now review,under an standard,the magistrate judge decision using the reliability factors she selected.we note at the outset that the second factor identified by the magistrate judge is largely insignificant in this case,because both parties concede that there is little in the way of published or least in the sense contemplated by daubert or interlocking outrigger systems for truck cranes.see johnson,d at.we therefore decline to discuss this factor in greater detail,focusing below on a the testing factor b the factor and c the factor.
a.the testing factor 
the magistrate judge made clear that her decision to exclude friend rested largely on the fact that while he had drawn up a schematic for how asplundh interlocking outrigger system might be integrated into the manitowoc,he had entirely failed to test his theory.as the following deposition testimony reveals,friend admitted that no testing had occurred 
q have you ever actually implemented this kind of design concept that you have on exhibit on any machine 
q you certainly have implemented it or tested it with regard to the manitowoc machine,have you 
a that correct.
q and it would be true that you never implemented or tested this concept on any other machine,correct 
a that correct.
q and when you were back doing design work,before you would release some new design or modification of the design to the field,you would normally do testing,correct 
a depending on what it is.normally i would say you test,but not all the time,but generally you do,yes.
q with this system,you would want to test it,would you 
a i would,certainly.well,certainly,yeah.
friend dep.at.
given the difference in size small truck versus large truck,lifting capacity a few people versus tons,and function tree trimming or electrical work versus heavy construction between the asplundh and manitowoc crane systems,the magistrate judge concluded that at least a modicum of empirical testing should have been performed in order to determine how easily an interlocking outrigger system could be installed onto the manitowoc,as well as whether such a system would bring with it any downsides in safety function.after all,the design of industrial equipment is a complex process and changes to prevent one problem could create other problems,thus increasing the overall danger of using a product.brown,at quotations omitted see also dhillon crown controls,cir noting that many alternative design considerations are product and and can not be reliably determined without testing.
when further questioned about why he did not conduct any tests of his proposed alternative design,friend responded as follows 
q as a design engineer,you certainly would want to add a system that included or added some downside risks,would you 
q and that something you would want to analyze as you went along in your concept development and your testing and then eventually release to production.
a certainly.
q and you did do that in this case,specifically by putting it on a product and testing it and looking at it and considering the downsides,did you 
a well,just did do the testing part.i really do see a downside to this system.
q is it your testimony that you see absolutely no downsides or negatives to the system that you have set forth on friend exhibit for use on this particular truck crane 
a other than if you want to call adding cost into the machine,certainly that would be a going to cost a little more from a safety standpoint the use of your equipment,it it all pluses.
friend dep.at.with this testimony in front of us,we must ask whether or not a trial judge abuses her discretion by choosing not to rely solely on the of a proposed expert witness.see,dhillon,at noting that testing is not an absolute prerequisite to the admission of expert testimony,but where a theory easily lends itself to testing and substantiation,conclusions based only on personal opinion and experience do not suffice.
one way to overcome the testing requirement might be to show that the expert has significant technical expertise in the specific area in which he is suggesting an alternative design.for this proposition,gilfeather relies on bah nordson corporation,wl.in bah,the district judge admitted the testimony of an expert who suggested that an interlock switch on a hot glue dissimilar from the interlocking outrigger concept have prevented an accident to the plaintiff.id.at.the proposed expert did not create prototypes or drawings of any of his proposed safety devices,nor did he test or review others tests of any of these devices.id.at.however,he had for over twenty years been involved with designing safety interlocks in machines very simi
