car crash victims survivors sued the tire manufacturer and other defendants in state court.after defendants removed to federal court,the district court dismissed on grounds of forum non conveniens,finding mexico to be the more convenient forum.the court also enjoined plaintiffs from pursuing any claim against defendants in texas state court or federal court.we vacate the dismissal so that a return jurisdiction clause may be added,and we order that the injunction be modified to conform to the act.the dismissal and injunction are otherwise free of error.
this action arises from an automobile accident in the state of nuevo leon,mexico,that killed six passengers,all mexican citizens.plaintiffs and intervenors,who are family members of the decedents,allege that the vehicle and one of its tires were defective,that the vehicle was improperly maintained,and that the driver was careless.plaintiffs first filed wrongful death and survival claims against defendants,bridgestone,general motors corporation general motors,lucent technologies,and lucent technologies maquiladoras,in federal district court in brownsville,texas vasquez i.that suit was dismissed for lack of diversity jurisdiction.
the instant case vasquez ii was filed in orange county,texas,and removed to federal district court in beaumont,texas.that court dismissed on grounds of,concluding that the dispute should be heard in mexico.the location of the accident,the sources of proof,plaintiffs home,and the lack of local interest were factors that the court found favored mexico.the court also determined that mexican law would govern.the court dismissed with prejudice,noting in its memorandum opinion that a judgment of dismissal under forum non conveniens here should act to preclude a future lawsuit brought elsewhere in this country.
before the court dismissed vasquez ii,plaintiffs filed a separate state court suit in cameron county,texas vasquez iii.they initially were represented by different counsel before the dismissal of vasquez ii at that time,counsel of record filed an amended petition and a petition in intervention on plaintiffs behalf.vasquez iii was removed to federal court and ultimately dismissed by stipulation 
following the dismissal in vasquez ii,plaintiffs also sued in webb county,texas.this suit,vasquez iv,named five defendants not named in the three previous suits bridgestone corporation,de mexico,rudolph miles and sons,dicex international,and the driver of the vehicle,villanueva.vasquez iv also included two new plaintiffs,the parents of one of the deceased crash victims,ivonne juarez.after defendants removed vasquez iv to federal court,the vasquez ii court sua sponte issued a temporary restraining order barring plaintiffs and their attorneys from arguing their pending motion to remand and from prosecuting any new suits.
the vasquez ii court later issued a permanent injunction that prohibited 
plaintiffs,their attorneys,their agents,and all persons acting on behalf of plaintiffs,or in concert with any and all of the plaintiffs or their attorneys from prosecuting,filing,or pursuing any suit or case or cause of action against the defendants herein in any district court of the state of texas,and any united states district court in the state of texas against the said movants.
the court reasoned that the all writs act,a,permitted it to protect the finality of its dismissal.plaintiffs argue that the injunction violates the act,specifically that it does not fall under the act relitigation exception.this appeal consolidates plaintiffs challenge to the vasquez ii court dismissal and the permanent injunction.
federal courts apply the federal version of in resolving a motion to dismiss where the alternative forum is a foreign tribunal.de aguilar boeing,cir.we review an dismissal for abuse of discretion.gonzalez chrysler,cir,petition for cert.filed.to obtain an dismissal,a party must demonstrate the existence of an available and adequate alternative forum and that the balance of relevant private and public interest factors favor dismissal.alpine view atlas copco ab,cir.under federal principles,the court properly found that mexico is the more convenient forum.
an alternative forum is considered available if the entire case and all parties can come within its jurisdiction the district court found that defendants stipulation to submit to a mexican court jurisdiction in the state of nuevo leon made mexico an available forum.plaintiffs now argue that because mexican federal law provides greater damages than does the law of nuevo leon,defendants should have been required to submit to the jurisdiction of a mexican federal court in mexico city.forum availability and adequacy are separate inquiries,however,so we reject plaintiffs attempt to bootstrap the two.indeed,plaintiffs do not dispute that an available mexican forum exists in the courts of nuevo leon.
an alternative forum is adequate if the parties will not be deprived of all remedies or treated unfairly,even though they may not enjoy the same benefits as they might receive in an american court.gonzalez,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.in gonzalez,we rejected the plaintiffs contention that a foreign jurisdiction decision to limit damages and limit the availability of strict to the point at which the lawsuit ceases to become economically renders that jurisdiction inadequate.id.at.importantly,gonzalez also involved mexican plaintiffs suing an american vehicle manufacturer over a car accident in mexico.id.at.the fact that mexico provides a wrongful death cause of action,albeit with severe damage caps makes the country an adequate forum.piper aircraft reyno,d.
once a court determines that there is an adequate alternative forum,it must balance the relevant private and public interest factors.id.at.private interest factors include 
the relative ease of access to sources of proof the availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling,and the cost of obtaining attendance of willing,witnesses the possibility of view of premises,if view would be appropriate to the action and all other practical problems that make trial of a case easy,expeditious and inexpensive.
mclennan am.eurocopter,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in piper,the court stated that there is ordinarily a strong presumption in favor of the plaintiff choice of forum,which may be overcome only when the private and public factors clearly point towards trial in the alternative forum.at.still,the district court determined,consistently with piper,that because plaintiffs are residents of a foreign country,their forum choice should be accorded less deference.id.at.
plaintiffs contend the court erred,because a treaty between the united states and mexico,the international covenant of civil and political rights,entitles mexican plaintiffs to the same deference as american citizens,only with the understanding that suing in the united states may be less convenient article of the treaty states,inter alia all persons shall be equal before the courts and tribunals.in the determination of rights and obligations in a suit at law,everyone shall be entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent,independent,and impartial tribunal.we need not decide this issue,however,because the private and public factors clearly point towards trial in mexico piper,at.
analyzing the private factors,the court correctly determined that trial should be held in mexico.the court emphasized that plaintiffs,the driver of the vehicle,and all decedents are mexican citizens.in addition,the vehicle and tires were manufactured,purchased,and maintained in mexico.the vehicle had a mexican owner,and the trip took place entirely in mexico.all the physical evidence and medical reports are in mexico conducting trial in the united states would require the translation of numerous reports and witness testimony.federal courts have no power of compulsory process over mexican citizens,including the surviving driver and passenger,police,and mechanics who serviced and maintained the vehicle.
plaintiffs point out that documents relating to the design and manufacture of the vehicle tires are located in the united states and must be translated into spanish.they also aver that the court refusal to permit additional discovery prevented them from demonstrating the exact role of general motors and bridgestone in designing and fabricating their products yet,even without the aid of additional discovery,plaintiffs argued in the district court that the design information is located in the united states,so we do not see how they have been prejudiced 
assuming arguendo that all information relating to the design and manufacture of the tires and vehicle is located in the united states,we still find the court analysis correct.the tires and vehicle were manufactured and sold in mexico the vehicle servicing records and the driver vital to plaintiffs alternative theories of also located there.
plaintiffs maintain that the court erred in applying the relevant public factors,which are 
administrative difficulties flowing from court congestion the local interest in having localized controversies decided at home the interest in having the trial of a diversity case in a forum that is at home with the law that must govern the action the avoidance of unnecessary problems in conflict of laws,or in the application of foreign law and the unfairness of burdening citizens in an unrelated forum with jury duty.
mclennan,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the court determined these factors favor trial in mexico,because the case would overburden its already overcrowded docket,texas has little local interest in the outcome,and mexican law should govern the controversy.
plaintiffs assert the location of bridgestone main plant in orange county,texas,refutes the court conclusion that there is little local interest.in fact,the plant that plaintiffs reference is not the company principal place of business,nor does it even produce tires.conversely,mexico has an interest in protecting its own citizens from defective products acquired in mexico and causing injury there 
the linchpin of plaintiff the alleged wrongful act was the original design of the vehicle and back too far in the accident causal chain.identifying the situs of the wrongful conduct as an american designer drawing board ignores the production,sale,and alleged failure of the product,which all occurred in mexico.if accepted,plaintiffs argument would curtail the rights of foreign governments to regulate their internal economies and threaten to engulf american courts with foreign claims,gulf oil gilbert.in addition,plaintiffs attempt to place the alleged wrongful conduct in the united states ignores their own alternative liability theories that improper maintenance and careless driving caused the accident.
plaintiffs are permitted to plead in the alternative.e.for purposes of,however,they can not present only one of their multiple liability theories for the sole purpose of gaining a favorable forum.
for similar reasons,plaintiffs contention that the court erred in its determination is unavailing a federal court sitting in diversity applies the rules of the state in which it sits.klaxon stentor.texas applies the most significant relationship test,gutierrez collins,which considers various contacts the place where the injury occurred,the place where the injury causing conduct occurred,the parties residence,and the place where the relationship,if any,between the parties is centered 
even if the design of the tires and vehicles is characterized as the conduct causing injury,the aggregate of other specific contacts favors application of mexican law.as the court recognized,all the decedents and plaintiffs are citizens of mexico,the accident and subsequent investigation took place in mexico,and the vehicle and tires were manufactured and purchased there.
the most significant relationship test further requires that the specific contacts be evaluated in light of policy considerations.duncan cessna aircraft.these considerations are 
a the needs of the interstate and international systems b the relevant policies of the forum c the relevant policies of other interested states and the relative interests of those states in the determination of the particular issue d the protection of justified expectations e the basic policies underlying the particular field of law f certainty,predictability and uniformity of result and g ease in the determination and application of the law to be applied.
restatement second of conflict of laws.a proper achieve s the best possible accommodation of both nations policies.id.cmt.
we are mindful of the disparate levels of wrongful death damages provided under texas and mexican law and the incentive for plaintiffs to sue in the united states.given that all decedents and plaintiffs are mexican,however,there is little justification for applying texas law,which seeks to protect the rights of its citizens to adequate compensation.were we to apply texas law as a means of righting any perceived inequities of mexican law,we would be undercutting mexico right to create a hospitable climate for investment uniformity,predictability,and accommodation of the competing policies of the two nations favor applying mexican law.
there is no guarantee that nuevo leon will remain an available forum or that defendants will submit to its jurisdiction.a return jurisdiction clause remedies this concern by permitting parties to return to the dismissing court should the lawsuit become impossible in the foreign forum.the failure to include a return jurisdiction clause in an dismissal constitutes a per se abuse of discretion.robinson west communications,cir.as we said in in re air crash disaster,at 
if the district court decides that the public and private interest factors favor in a foreign forum,it must finally ensure that a plaintiff can reinstate his suit in the alternative forum without undue inconvenience or prejudice and that if the defendant obstructs such reinstatement in the alternative forum that the plaintiff may return to the american forum.
the court did not include a return jurisdiction clause in its dismissal order,so we vacate and remand with instructions that one be added.
the district court halted plaintiffs judicial hopscotch by invoking the all writs act,which authorizes federal courts to issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.this power dovetails with the relitigation exception to the act,which,although generally prohibiting federal courts from enjoining state proceedings,permits a court to enjoin a state court where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction,or to protect or effectuate its judgments.
the relitigation exception is grounded in principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel.chick kam choo exxon,d.the test for the relitigation exception is the same test used to determine claim preclusion or res judicata the parties in a later action must be identical to or at least in privity with the parties in a prior action the judgment in the prior action must have been rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction the prior action must have concluded with a final judgment on the merits and the same claim or cause of action must be involved in both suits.regions bank rivet,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted life ins.gillispie,cir.in next level communications lp dsc communications,cir,we recognized that the relitigation exception also applies where issue preclusion,or collateral estoppel,exists the district court sought to protect its we must decide whether it is res judicata for purposes of the relitigation exception.
the permanent injunction prohibited plaintiffs and counsel from pursuing any suit or cause of action against defendants in any texas state or federal court the district court determined that an dismissal is entitled to effect as a final judgment on the merits,finding also that texas state courts would apply the same rules and virtually the same test as a federal court.we conclude that an dismissal is not a decision on the merits,so we direct the court to modify its injunction to prevent plaintiffs from relitigating only the determination.
plaintiffs contend the injunction is inappropriate because defendants failed to demonstrate imminent harm or the lack of an adequate remedy.rondeau mosinee paper,d.plaintiffs argue that pleas of res judicata,where appropriate,are sufficient to protect the vasquez ii court dismissal.the court finding that vasquez iv was plaintiffs second attempt to relitigate its final judgment was sufficient,however,to enjoin further litigation.quintero klaveness ship lines,cir next level,at.
in quintero,at,we affirmed a decision to enforce the principles of res judicata in the first instance by enjoining state court relitigation of a determination.though we conclude that the injunction impermissibly prohibits plaintiffs from suing in state court,the district court did not err by invoking the relitigation exception,which seeks to prevent the wasteful and harassing revisiting of previously decided matters.
at least where there is claim preclusion,the relitigation exception applies only to the actual parties of the first proceeding and those in privity with them.rivet,at.the permanent injunction designated plaintiffs,their attorneys,their agents,and all persons acting on behalf of plaintiffs,or in concert with any and all of the plaintiffs or their attorneys,as well as the moving defendants.vasquez iv contains two new parents of decedent ivonne five new defendants not named in vasquez ii.
privity has been described as nothing more than a legal conclusion that the relationship between the one who is a party on the record and the is sufficiently close to afford application of the principle of preclusion.southwest airlines,texas int l airlines,cir citation omitted.privity exists where,for example,a party claim is derivative of the original party claim 
ivonne juarez estate representative,jessica juarez,is a party in vasquez ii,but her parents did not join the litigation until the advent of vasquez iv.given that both seek wrongful death claims on behalf of ivonne juarez and are represented by the same counsel,they are in privity with one another.
our conclusion is bolstered by the fact that plaintiffs counsel named juarez parents as parties in two motions filed in vasquez ii the parents also submitted a list of all companies sued previously to the vasquez ii court.the court reference to all parties acting on behalf of or in concert with plaintiffs means that juarez parents were among those properly enjoined.
the five new defendants,on the other hand,are not proper subjects of the injunction.the court enjoined suit against only the moving defendants and did not make any findings as to privity.quintero,at though it is arguable that plaintiffs could have sued these five defendants in the original action,the relitigation exception,as noted,requires that the claims actually be litigated in the first proceeding.hatcher,at.even if the injunction otherwise falls within the relitigation exception,its express terms prevent enjoining litigation against ii defendants.
an dismissal,based on a doctrine of procedure rather than of substance,am.dredging miller,d,does not resolve the substantive merits and therefore falls outside the relitigation exception in chick kam choo,at.a singapore resident brought maritime and texas state law claims in federal court.in granting defendant motion to dismiss on grounds of,the district court found that singapore law governed.the court enjoined the plaintiff after she refiled the texas state law claim and brought a new claim under singapore law in texas state court.
the supreme court vacated the injunction so far as it prohibited litigating the singapore law claim,noting that the dismissal did not resolve the merits of this claim.id.at.in other words,instead of the substantive merits,the only issue decided by the district court was that petitioner claims should be dismissed under the federal forum non conveniens doctrine.id.
rule b states that an order of dismissal operates as an adjudication on the merits unless the court states otherwise or the dismissal is for lack of jurisdiction,improper venue,or failure to join a party under rule.b because an dismissal involves the court declin ing to exercise its jurisdiction,even though the court has jurisdiction and venue,piper,at,it does fall under one of the three of jurisdiction,lack of venue or failure to join a party.nor did the district court state that the dismissal was involuntary the court instead stated that by dismissing with prejudice,it sought to preclude plaintiffs from relitigating their claims elsewhere in this country.
previously,rule b effect regarding claim preclusion was questioned because of the limited enumerated exceptions to its default rule that judgments generally be deemed on the merits.charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure,at ed.many types of dismissals do not seem to fall within the categories provided for in this rule and yet clearly should do as an adjudication that precludes a second action on the same claim.id.
in semtek int l,lockheed martin,d,the court reigned in rule b as a determinant of,recognizing that the meaning of judgment on the merits has changed over time and has come to be applied to some judgments like the instant district court dismissal that do not pass upon the merits of a claim and hence do not in many jurisdictions entail effect.id.at.the court determined that rule b primarily relates to the dismissing court itself.that is,an adjudication on the merits bars refiling of the same claim in the same court but does not establish claim preclusion.id.at.semtek held that when a diversity court dismisses a claim on state substantive law grounds,the preclusive effect of the judgment is measured not by rule b,but by the preclusion law of the state in which the court sits.
the district court,although exercising diversity jurisdiction,dismissed on federal procedural grounds,thus distinguishing semtek.and despite rule b enabling the court to prevent relitigation of federal principles in a texas federal court we can not,after semtek,look to the rule as a guide to the judgment effect elsewhere.semtek states that rule b would be a highly peculiar context in which to announce a federally prescribed rule on the complex question of claim preclusion,saying in effect,all federal dismissals with three specified exceptions preclude suit elsewhere,unless the court otherwise specifies.id.at.also,permitting a rule of civil procedure to control the effect given a federal judgment by a state court arguably violates the jurisdictional limitation of the rules enabling act id.
instead,we look to the longstanding rule that federal common law governs the effect of a dismissal by a federal court sitting in diversity.id.at.citation omitted.fortunately,chick kam choo,which makes no mention of rule,reveals that an dismissal is not a judgment.
chick kam choo characterizes a dismissal based on federal principles as one not resolving the underlying substantive issues.at.the principle of,as nothing more or less than a supervening venue provision,am.dredging,at,contemplates resolving the merits in another forum,negating the possibility of.although an dismissal designated on the merits may bar reconsideration of the claims in another texas federal court it can not forever bar the controversy from all american courts.to conclude otherwise would prevent states from deciding the openness of their courts 
defendants seek to distinguish chick kam choo because texas law has changed they argue that today texas would apply the same or even a less deferential standard than the federal standard,permitting application of the relitigation exception.in contrast to the situation in semtek,where the dismissal preclusive effect was dictated by state preclusion law,defendants seek to have the preclusive effect of the dismissal turn on differences between federal and state law.
this would have the undesirable effect of varying the preclusive effect accorded a federal dismissal based on the law of the interpreting state.instead,the type of federal common law applied to a federal procedural dismissal,unlike a dismissal based on state substantive law,does not incorporate state law.semtek,at.the threats of and inequitable admin
