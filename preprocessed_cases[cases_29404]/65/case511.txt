virginia robles and members of her family filed an action against their former attorneys and appellant purush chalilpoyil,alleging negligence and conspiracy to commit fraud.appellant moved to strike the complaint under the law,code of civil procedure section hereafter,section,but the superior court denied the motion.appellant seeks review,contending that the conduct on which the complaint is based consists of communications protected by section.we disagree and affirm the order.
background 
respondents are family members of john robles,who burned to death when his wheelchair ignited while he was occupying it.in december respondents initiated an action for wrongful death against golden state medical supply,pride mobility products corp,and others the robles gsms case.thomas wills and denise benoit collectively,the wills attorneys or the wills firm,represented respondents in that lawsuit.thomas wills retained appellant to provide expert consulting services and testimony.
according to the complaint in the present case,trial in robles gsms was scheduled for october.on november,thomas wills advised the court that a continuance would be necessary because of a conflict with appellant.wills represented that appellant had testified falsely in his deposition,claiming to have been present at a session material to his testimony.the trial court continued the trial to january,to allow wills to procure another expert witness.
before the new trial date,wills allegedly requested each plaintiff to sign a waiver of any interest in a device wills wanted to market to address the safety defects in the decedent wheelchair.wills indicated that the device would be designed and manufactured together with appellant,based on research and information appellant had gathered in preparing his expert testimony.according to the complaint,instead of retaining a new expert,wills decided to settle the robles gsms case,and he obtained the consent of some of the plaintiffs.other plaintiffs,including respondents in this case,were reluctant but wills coerced,forced,wrongly pressured the plaintiffs herein to tell the court that they agreed to settle that entire case for million.respondents thereafter refused to accept any of the settlement proceeds.
on january,the wills firm withdrew from the robles gsms case and filed a notice of lien for attorney fees.when the settling defendants moved to enforce the settlement,plaintiffs were unable to find counsel to represent them in opposing the motion,and it was granted.
respondents filed the instant action on january,against the wills attorneys and appellant.the claims against appellant were for negligence first cause of action and conspiracy to commit fraud fourth cause of action.respondents specifically alleged that appellant had failed to exercise reasonable care by falsely testifying in deposition that he had been present at the testing session and failing to continue to act as an independent expert disrupting the prosecution of the robles gsms case by entering into a business relationship,agreement,proposal with the wills attorneys to design,develop market a device or devices to improve the safety of the wheelchair in which john robles,was killed,while said defendants were still obligated to act as the plaintiffs expert in the robles gsms case.in the fourth cause of action respondents alleged that appellant and the wills attorneys had conspired to defraud,conceal facts,and engage in acts and omissions intended to deny the plaintiffs a full and fair prosecution of the robles gsms case.in addition,each of them willfully,fraudulently,and deliberately suppressed,concealed,and failed to provide plaintiffs the true facts concerning the defendants actual or proposed business relationship involving the improvements to the wheelchair.the defendants failure to disclose that information was intended to induce respondents to settle the underlying case for a sum that was not agreeable to them and thus to forgo a trial.had respondents been aware of the concealed facts,they would not have agreed to settle the underlying case and would have found new counsel to prosecute the action.
appellant moved to strike the first and fourth causes of action as a slapp strategic lawsuit against public participation under section.appellant contended that the first cause of action was based on false testimony that was made in the context of a legal proceeding and was therefore protected communication.the fourth cause of action,he argued,was based on a request from thomas wills to appellant soliciting appellant agreement to allow his work product to be provided to the underlying defendants in the event of a settlement.in appellant view,those discussions about a prospective business relationship fell comfortably within the express terms of code of civil procedure section e as well as within the litigation privilege described in civil code section,subdivision b.
after considering the parties briefs and hearing oral argument on the matter,the superior court articulately explained its view of the law as applied to the pleading at issue.the court ruled that respondents complaint did not fall within the protection of either the litigation privilege or the statute.accordingly,the court denied appellant motion to strike the complaint.this appeal followed.
discussion 
the statute 
both parties appear to understand the nature of slapp actions and the regulating statute,section.a slapp is a meritless suit filed primarily to chill the defendant exercise of first amendment rights.wilcox superior court th,fn,d briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,d,robertson rodriguez th,d.section was enacted in to address the disturbing increase in the frequency of these meritless harassing lawsuits,subd.a see navellier sletten cal th,fn,d.it was the legislature finding that it is in the public interest to encourage continued participation in matters of public significance,and that this participation should not be chilled through abuse of the judicial process.to this end,this section shall be construed broadly,subd.a.the statute was thus designed to deter meritless actions that deplete the defendant energy and drain his or her resources,citation,by ending them early and without great cost to the slapp target.citation.varian medical systems,delfino cal th,d,soukup law offices of herbert hafif cal th,d,chabak monroy th,d.a defendant who has been victimized by such meritless,retaliatory suits is entitled to relief in the form of attorney fees and costs.liu moore th,d kyle carmon th,d.
scope of review 
section expressly provides that a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim,subd.b.in evaluating a motion under the statute the trial court engages in a process.first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity.the moving defendant burden is to demonstrate that the act or acts of which the plaintiff complains were taken in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,as defined in the statute,subd.b.if the court finds such a showing has been made,it then determines whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d,equilon navellier sletten,supra,cal th,d,varian medical systems,delfino,supra,cal th,d.only a cause of action that satisfies both prongs of the,that arises from protected speech or petitioning and lacks even minimal a slapp,subject to being stricken under the statute.navellier sletten,supra,cal th at,d.
if the trial court decision is correct on any theory applicable to the case,we affirm the order regardless of the correctness of the grounds on which the lower court reached its conclusion.bernardo planned parenthood federation of america th,d.on appeal,however,we review the entire record de novo to decide whether the defendant has shown that section applies and,if so,whether the plaintiff has shown a probability of prevailing.computerxpress,jackson th,d monterey plaza hotel hotel employees restaurant employees th,d.accordingly,we independently determine whether the challenged cause of action arose from the defendant exercise of the constitutional right of petition or free if so,whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the merits of the claim.sylmar air conditioning pueblo contracting services,th,d computerxpress,jackson,supra,th at,d.we consider the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based,subd.b.however,we neither weigh credibility nor compare the weight of the evidence.rather,we accept as true the evidence favorable to the plaintiff citation and evaluate the defendant evidence only to determine if it has defeated that submitted by the plaintiff as a matter of law.soukup law offices of herbert hafif,supra,cal th at,fn,d,quoting hms capital,lawyers title th,d chabak monroy,supra,th,d.
the arising from requirement 
the first step of the court analysis is to determine whether the cause of action arose from protected speech or petitioning activity.california courts rightly have rejected the notion that a lawsuit is adequately shown to be one arising from an act in furtherance of the rights of petition or free speech as long as suit was brought after the defendant engaged in such an act,whether or not the purported basis for the suit is that act itself.city of cotati cashman cal th,d,quoting computerxpress,jackson,supra,th at,d.moreover,that a cause of action arguably may have been triggered by protected activity does not entail that it is one arising from such.navellier sletten,supra,cal th at,d.instead,the statutory phrase cause of action arising from means simply that the defendant act underlying the plaintiff cause of action must itself have been an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.citation.in the context,the critical point is whether the plaintiff cause of action itself was based on an act in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech.city of cotati cashman,supra,cal th at,d,navellier sletten,supra,cal th at,d,in re episcopal church cases cal th,d.
as courts applying the statute have recognized,the arising from requirement is not always easily met.equilon,supra,cal th at,d.the requirement can be satisfied only by showing that the defendant conduct falls within one of the four statutory categories described in section,subdivision e.equilon,supra,cal th at,d.this provision defines act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue to include any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.the supreme court has cautioned that the statute definitional focus is not the form of the plaintiff cause of action but,rather,the defendant activity that gives rise to his or her asserted whether that activity constitutes protected speech or petitioning.martinez metabolife,th,d,quoting navellier sletten,supra,cal th at,d.
application of section 
in this case appellant maintains that both the first and fourth causes of action fall comfortably within the reach of section.the first of respondents claims,appellant argues,is based on his false deposition testimony and thus unquestionably constitutes an oral statement made before a judicial proceeding,within the meaning of section,subdivision e.the fourth cause of action,according to appellant,is based on settlement discussions that were protected by the litigation privilege described in civil code section,subdivision b consequently,he argues,they must also be within the scope of section,subdivision e,though he does not identify the specific provision.
if applying the statute were as simple as identifying statements made in the course of litigation,appellant would have a successful argument.but t he statute does not accord protection to suits arising from any act having any connection,however remote,with an official proceeding.the statements or writings in question must occur in connection with an issue under consideration or review in the proceeding.paul friedman th,d.in other words,it is the principal thrust or gravamen of the plaintiff cause of action that determines whether the statute applies citation,and when the allegations referring to arguably protected activity are only incidental to a cause of action based essentially on nonprotected activity,collateral allusions to protected activity should not subject the cause of action to the statute.martinez metabolife,supra,th at,d wang real estate business trust th,d applicability of statute determined by principal thrust or predominant nature of the complaint.
closer examination of the conduct alleged in respondents complaint compels a different result from the one urged by appellant.in the first cause of action,appellant was accused of negligence by falsely testifying in his deposition regarding his presence at the product testing session and failing to continue to act as an independent expert disrupting the prosecution of the robles gsms case by entering into a business relationship,agreement,proposal with the wills defendants to design,develop market a device or devices to improve the safety of the wheelchair in which john robles,was killed,while said defendants were still obligated to act as the plaintiffs expert in the robles gsms case.the conduct described in the second allegation does not fall into any of the four categories of section,subdivision e,much less subdivision e,on which appellant relies it was not a written or oral statement,nor was it conduct in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e.
appellant disregards this second allegation and focuses instead on the first,the false deposition testimony.although this was a statement made in the course of a judicial proceeding,that description does not go far enough.it is true that the statute protects speech and petitioning activity undertaken on another behalf briggs eden council for hope opportunity,supra,cal th at,d,rusheen cohen cal th,d,but the statute should not be used to insulate those statements from recourse by the very client on whose behalf the statement was made.
jespersen th,d illustrates this point.there the plaintiffs sued their former attorneys for malpractice,claiming negligence in the handling of a civil lawsuit brought against them.the defendant attorneys invoked the law on the ground that the action arose from protected petitioning activity,including declarations they had filed during their representation of respondents.the second district,division four,rejected this view of the posture of the case.the essence of the respondents complaint was not the pleadings,declarations,or other statements the defendants had made during the litigation,but their failure to serve timely discovery responses and to comply with the court discovery orders.section was not available to the defendants as an avenue of escape in the malpractice lawsuit.
the same court subsequently extended its holding in jespersen to allegations of breach of an attorney duty of loyalty.in benasra mitchell silberberg knupp llp th,d benasra the defendant attorneys attempted to
