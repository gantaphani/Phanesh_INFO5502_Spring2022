terry winters hand was severed at the wrist while he was working at a food processing plant.he reached settlements with various defendants but proceeded with his claims against,the company that installed the equipment that injured him.winters appeals the exclusion of his experts testimony and the entry of judgment in favor.we affirm.
factual history 
in december,winters began working at lee centralia,illinois plant.gilster had recently agreed to produce cake mix and frosting for aurora foods,aurora would sell the cake mix and frosting under the duncan hines brand name.in support of its contract with gilster,aurora purchased four preexisting cake mix and frosting manufacturing lines from a proctor gamble plant in jackson,tennessee.the purchased production lines were disassembled,shipped to illinois,and installed in the centralia plant.aurora hired to perform all design,engineering and construction services necessary and appropriate for the relocation and installation of the cake mix and frosting lines at the centralia factory.at ex.subcontracted with logical systems,to update the computer programs operating the lines.
smoot company,manufactured the valve that injured winters.the valve was located at a junction of three tubes on one of the cake lines.the first tube brought cake mix to the junction point.the valve position determined whether cake mix flowed into the second or third tube from the first tube.the second tube connected the junction point to a large mixer.the third tube connected to a storage area that was used when cake mix was not needed at the mixer.the computer control program,when in automatic mode,determined whether to send cake mix to the mixer or the storage area and altered the valve position accordingly.air pressure was used to move the cake mix through the tubes and also to adjust the valve position.there is no evidence in the record that altered the design or structure of the tubes or diverter valve when it installed the equipment at the centralia plant.effectively transplanted the cake and frosting lines as is from the jackson,tennessee plant to the centralia,illinois plant.
the centralia plant was not yet producing cake mix or frosting when winters was hired in december.however,during this period winters received training from gilster in anticipation of his work on the production line.part of his training included viewing a videotape on lock out tag out safety procedures.a lock out tag out procedure is used by workers to allow them to safely clean and repair automated machinery.the worker wishing to work on machinery deactivates the machine power and then places a lock and tag on that location.the lock and accompanying tag informs other workers that the first worker intentionally turned the power off in order to work on the machine and consequently the other workers should not reactivate the machine without first checking with the original worker.there is no evidence in the record that winters received any training or instruction from.although employees were present at the centralia plant when the accident occurred in july,there is no indication in the record that winters had any contact with employees during the course of his employment.
winters began working on a cake line as a finish mix operator in spring.as a finish mix operator,winters was involved in the packaging of cake mix into boxes.winters used lock out tag out procedures when performing maintenance as a finish mix operator.he worked as a finish mix operator for five or six weeks and was then transferred to a control room operator position.as a control room operator,winters was responsible for working on a computer that controlled the movement of cake mix ingredients along the cake line.
during the initial months of operation,the cake mix would often clump and block the flow of ingredients in the tubes on the cake lines.control room operators,including winters,were responsible for unclogging the clumps of cake mix in the tubes.control room operators attempted to break up clogs by banging on the outside of the tubes or alternatively disassembling part of the cake line and reaching into the tubes.winters testified that the practice of control room operators was not to use lock out tag out procedures when working to unclog the cake line by hand.instead,the control room operators placed the computer program running the cake line into manual from automatic.the control room operator would then tell other control room operators in the control room that they had placed the computer program in manual.winters stated that he followed these alternative procedures instead of a lock out tag out procedure because this is what he observed the other control room operators doing when he started working as a control room operator.
winters used the alternative procedure of placing the computer on manual when the accident occurred on july.he disconnected one of the tubes and,through the opening,placed his arm past the smoot diverter valve to reach the cake mix clot in the second tube.while he was pulling his arm back,a gilster coworker,unaware that winters was working on the cake line,placed the computer program back to automatic.the diverter valve closed on winters hand at the wrist with sufficient force to sever it completely.winters was rushed to a local hospital where doctors were able to successfully reattach his hand but winters use of his hand has been severely limited.
procedural history 
in may,winters brought suit alleging product liability and negligence claims against,aurora,smoot and logical systems.winters was precluded from suing gilster directly because of workers compensation requirements.however,the defendants brought gilster into the case as a third party defendant alleging that gilster had been negligent in training and supervising winters.by july,all parties consented to the jurisdiction of a magistrate judge pursuant to c.the case was ultimately assigned to magistrate judge proud.the last party was added to the case in when aurora filed a third party declaratory action against federal insurance.federal initially did not file a consent to judge proud jurisdiction but did file a consent in march after we raised the issue in our november,order.
winters reached out of court settlements with aurora,smoot and logical systems but proceeded with his negligence and product liability claims against.three years into the case in,the magistrate judge refused winters leave to file a proposed amended complaint in which he sought to add a claim for punitive damages.the magistrate judge also barred testimony from winters two experts,edmond israelski and boulter kelsey.lacking an expert,the magistrate judge granted motion for summary judgment on winters product liability claim.the case proceeded to a jury trial on the negligence claim but the magistrate judge granted motion for judgment as a matter of law at the conclusion of winters.the magistrate judge also denied winters motion for a new trial.winters now seeks direct review of the judgment entered by the magistrate judge pursuant to c.
ii.analysis 
winters argues that magistrate judge proud lacked subject matter jurisdiction to proceed in the case because federal failed to file a timely consent.on the merits,winters argues that the magistrate judge erred by denying him leave to file his amended complaint,by barring his experts and by granting motions on his product liability and negligence claims.
a.the magistrate judge jurisdiction 
ensuring the existence of jurisdiction is the court first duty in every lawsuit.mccready white,cir citing steel citizens for a better env t,d.our initial review of the record in november revealed that federal had failed to file a consent to the magistrate judge jurisdiction.federal remedied this failure by filing a consent in march.this is sufficient to provide us with jurisdiction as it is clear to us that all parties,including winters,have always intended to consent to proceeding before the magistrate judge pursuant to c.federal inadvertent failure to file its consent was due to late entry into the case after the case had been reassigned to the magistrate judge and federal after the fact consent is sufficient to manifest its consent.see roell withrow,d holding that implied consent to the magistrate judge jurisdiction can be determined by a voluntary appearance before the magistrate judge after a party has been informed of the need for consent and the right to refuse king ionization int l,cir noting that after the fact consent to the magistrate judge jurisdiction is permissible if it is a manifestation of the parties preexisting desire to consent to the magistrate judge.
winters amended complaint 
we reject winters argument as to the magistrate judge refusal to allow him to amend his complaint for punitive damages three years into the litigation.winters erroneously argues that his ability to file his proposed pleading was limited by the illinois pleading rule that prohibits the pleading of punitive damages in the complaint until he has established in discovery facts that support claimed punitive damages.ilcs comp.stat.however,the district court,as a federal court sitting in diversity,properly applied rule of the federal rules of civil procedure instead of the illinois pleading rules because the federal rules of civil procedure apply to all cases filed in federal court,no matter what the basis of subject matter jurisdiction.hefferman bass,cir citing hanna plumer,d see,harper vigilant ins,cir as a federal court sitting in diversity by virtue of jurisdiction pursuant to,we apply state law to resolve substantive questions and federal law to resolve procedural and evidentiary issues.internal quotations and citations omitted.
thus,the issue for review is whether the district court properly denied winters proposed amended complaint pursuant to rule.rule allows amendment of a complaint after the filing of an answer upon leave of court and leave of court shall be freely given when justice so requires.a.a district court may deny leave to amend a complaint on the grounds of undue delay,bad faith,dilatory motive,prejudice or futility.guise bwm mortgage,llc,cir citing indiana funeral dirs.ins.trust.trustmark ins,cir.we review a denial of a motion to amend only for an abuse of discretion.perry first bank,cir quoting butts aurora health care,cir.a federal trial judge decision is an abuse of discretion only if no reasonable person could agree with the decision.butts,at citing cleveland porca,cir.
the magistrate judge decision was not an abuse of discretion.winters failure to bring a timely claim for punitive damages was due to his failure to understand that federal pleading rules controlled the issue.an amended complaint three years into the litigation affects the defendant discovery and trial strategy and therefore the magistrate judge was reasonable in rejecting winters proposed amendment.
barring of experts 
winters challenges the magistrate judge decision to exclude his two experts,israelski and kelsey.israelski proposed testimony focused on the design of the computer system operating the cake line that injured winters.kelsey proposed testimony was on the smoot valve.
israelski was tendered as an expert in human factors.human factors is a discipline that incorporates a study of human behaviors,limitations and capabilities into the design of products,systems and equipment.winters sought israelski testimony on the design of the computer system that operated the smoot valve.according to israelski proposed testimony,the computer system was not designed properly because it did not have a means of warning the operator that a second worker had taken the smoot valve offline for cleaning.
the magistrate judge rejected israelski as an expert witness.he determined that israelski work was not performed in accordance to the standards of intellectual rigor required for admissibility.thus,the proposed testimony was speculative and not the result of scientific procedure.simply put,it is not reliable.at.
kelsey was tendered as an expert in forensic engineering analysis in the area of mechanical systems.at.kelsey proposed opinion was that the smoot valve and its associated control system was defective and unreasonably dangerous because there was no manual guard or block that could stop the valve from shifting,there was no sensor or switch that deactivated the valve when the hose was disconnected,and there was no electrical circuit that stopped that valve from operating when the hose was disconnected from the line.he proposed several alternatives but he did not test the alternatives.additionally,kelsey criticized relying solely on a lock out tag out procedure.the magistrate judge determined that the failure to test kelsey suggestions doomed his proposed opinion and excluded him from testifying.
the admissibility of expert testimony is governed by federal rule of evidence as well as daubert merrell dow,naeem mckesson drug,cir citing,d.expert testimony is admissible if scientific,technical or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.kempner mobile,sw.bell mobile,cir citing.the district court is a who determines whether proffered expert testimony is reliable and relevant before accepting a witness as an expert.autotech tech,cir.we review de novo whether the district court applied the appropriate legal standard in making its decision to admit or exclude expert testimony,and we review for abuse of discretion the district court choice of factors to include within that framework as well as its ultimate conclusions regarding the admissibility of expert testimony.kempner mobile,at citing united states parra,cir.the district court identified and applied the appropriate legal standards therefore satisfying the de novo element of our review.see durkin equifax check,cir citing ammons aramark unif,cir.
turning to the second step in our review,the abuse of discretion component,the district court rejected the proposed expert testimony holding that it was not reliable because the proposed experts had failed to test their alternative designs.one of the purpose s of the daubert standard is to ensure that any admitted scientific evidence is reliable that is,in methods and procedures of science.the focus of the district court daubert inquiry must be solely on principles and methodology,not on the conclusions they generate.chapman maytag,cir citing bourelle crown equip,cir cummins lyle,cir.daubert offers a list of factors to aid judges in determining whether a particular expert opinion is grounded in reliable scientific methodology.among the factors articulated are whether the proffered theory can be and has been tested whether the theory has been subjected to peer review whether the theory has been evaluated in light of potential rates of error and whether the theory has been accepted in the relevant scientific community.dhillon crown controls,cir citing daubert,at.
in alternative design cases,we have consistently recognized the importance of testing the alternative design as a factor that the district court should consider in evaluating the reliability of the proposed expert testimony.dhillon,at citing bourelle,at cummins,at.testing an alternative design can assist a proposed expert in considering the alternative compatibility with existing systems,relative efficiency of the current versus alternative design,short and long term maintenance costs for the alternative design,ability of the proposed purchaser to service and maintain the alternative design,cost of installing the alternative design,and change in cost to the machine.dhillon,at citing cummins,at.many of these considerations are product and manufacturer specific and can not be reliably determined without testing of the alternative design.id.although testing an alternative design will likely be advantageous in demonstrating that the proposed expert testimony is reliable,we have not mandated alternative design testing as an absolute prerequisite to the admission of expert testimony because the daubert inquiry is a flexible inquiry.cummins,at.there could be situations where the district court determines the proposed expert testimony regarding an alternative design is reliable despite a lack of testing of the alternative design because t
