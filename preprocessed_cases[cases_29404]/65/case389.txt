factual and procedural background 
in early,appellee raytheon aircraft company raytheon manufactured a beech super king air aircraft in wichita,kansas.around april,raytheon sold the aircraft to the beechcraft organization for central europe.later that month,the aircraft was delivered to the republic of macedonia,which retained ownership of the plane until its eventual destruction.
on february,the aircraft departed skopje,macedonia,bound for mostar,bosnia,with the president of macedonia and his senior advisors aboard.in a thicket of rain and fog,the plane struck a tree while attempting to land.the accident killed all nine passengers,including the two.the aircraft accident report,prepared by the bosnia and herzegovina directorate of civil aviation,ultimately attributed the crash to pilot error.
on october,appellants filed a wrongful death action against raytheon.the complaint alleged three causes of action,all under macedonian law,claiming the aircraft was defective and not crashworthy.on november,raytheon filed its answer,denying the allegations and raising a number of affirmative defenses.raytheon contended that the action was barred by gara statute of repose.the parties agreed to proceed with limited discovery until the district court resolved the issue of whether gara applied.on february,raytheon filed a motion for summary judgment,again asserting that gara required a finding in its favor.on may,the district court issued an order granting raytheon motion for summary judgment,holding that gara precluded the plaintiffs claims.on that same day,the court entered judgment in favor of raytheon on all claims.

the statute bars suits stemming from accidents that occurred more than eighteen years after the initial transfer of an aircraft.lyon,at if the accident occurs on the day after the gara period runs,no action whatsoever is possible.the statute acts not just as an affirmative defense,but instead creates an explicit statutory right not to stand trial.estate of kennedy bell helicopter textron,cir.
the accident at issue here occurred in,more than eighteen years after appellee delivered the plane to the macedonian government in.accordingly,raytheon argues that gara bars appellants claims.appellants counter that,in accord with the presumption against extraterritoriality,gara time bar should not apply under the circumstances of this case.
ii.the presumption against extraterritoriality 
the supreme court and this court have adhered to the longstanding principle of american law that legislation is presumed to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states unless the contrary affirmative intention of congress is clearly expressed.arc ecology dep t of the air force,cir citing eeoc arabian american oil,d hereinafter aramco see also smith united states,d holding that the presumption applied to preclude application of the federal tort claims act ftca waiver of sovereign immunity for a claim arising in antarctica.
under this presumption,a law passed by congress is generally assumed to apply only to regulate conduct occurring within the boundaries of the united states.see pakootas teck cominco metals,cir envtl.def.fund,massey.the presumption serves to protect against unintended clashes between our laws and those of other nations which could result in international discord.aramco,at.internal quotation marks omitted.in order to overcome the presumption,a party must show a clear expression of congressional intent to apply a statute beyond american soil.id.at.
in aramco,the centerpiece of the supreme court recent jurisprudence on the presumption,the court held that title vii of the civil rights act of did not apply to a united states citizen working for an american company in a foreign country.id.at.despite administrative interpretations to the contrary,the court held that it must assume that congress legislates under the presumption that a statute is primarily concerned with domestic conditions.id.at.the court further held that the presumption was not overcome because congress did not make a clear statement suggesting that title vii should apply to conduct occurring in a foreign country.id.at.
iii.presumption against extraterritoriality does not apply to gara 
simply because a case factual background involves some conduct occurring abroad does not mean that every statute governing the matter is subject to the presumption against extraterritoriality a court must first inquire into whether applying a statute implicates any issue of extraterritoriality.massey,at.this requires considering the conduct the statute seeks to regulate.see see also pakootas,at the difference between a domestic application of united states law and a presumptively impermissible extraterritorial application of united states law becomes apparent when we consider the conduct that the law prohibits.appellants contend that the conduct at issue in this case is a tort injury suffered in macedonia.under their logic,the place where the tort claim arises determines whether the various federal statutes governing a case are being applied extraterritorially.appellants reasoning oversimplifies the analysis.
