plaintiffs,bryan flock,omy ray munsinger,patricia harris munsinger,and mickey britt,appeal the district court judgment granting summary judgment to defendants,corporation scripto and tokai corporation tokai collectively.the district court concluded that the plaintiffs could not establish that a defect in an aim flame utility lighter designed,manufactured,and distributed by caused the fire that destroyed a trailer and resulted in the deaths of shonda munsinger shonda and brandon flock brandon.we disagree and conclude that plaintiffs presented sufficient summary judgment evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact on whether the aim flame caused the fire that resulted in shonda and brandon deaths.we therefore vacate the district court judgment in part and remand for further proceedings.
in october,shonda and her four son,brandon,died of asphyxia after the trailer they shared with kenneth keith mann,shonda boyfriend,in conroe,texas,caught fire.that morning,mann left for work at shonda was still sleeping in the master bedroom on the north end of the trailer,but as he left,mann heard brandon awake and playing in his room located on the south end of the trailer.at approximately,neighbors noticed fire blazing out of the windows at the south end of the trailer and called for help.firefighters arrived shortly thereafter.after bringing the blaze under control,the firefighters found shonda and brandon dead in the master bedroom,which remained untouched by the fire.
montgomery county fire investigators determined that the fire started in brandon bedroom.the investigators found the metal tip of an aim flame utility lighter in the room.the plastic arm of the aim flame was melted in the fire making it impossible to determine when it was manufactured.the aim flame was the only incendiary device in this room,though matches and cigarette lighters were found elsewhere in the trailer.considering the point of origin of the fire and the proximity of the aim flame thereto,the investigators concluded that brandon started the fire by playing with the lighter in his bedroom.
brandon father,bryan flock,shonda parents,omy munsinger and patricia harris,and mickey britt,the owner of the trailer,filed suit against in federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.they sought compensatory and exemplary damages on the basis of products liability,negligence,breach of express and implied warranties,misrepresentation,and violations of the texas deceptive trade practices act.bus.et.in response to their complaint,the defendants filed a complaint against mann alleging he had a duty to install and maintain smoke detectors in the trailer.
moved for summary judgment seeking dismissal of all of the plaintiffs claims.the magistrate judge,to whom the case was referred for management,recommended that summary judgment be granted for some of the plaintiffs claims but denied as to others.the district court adopted this recommendation to the extent that the magistrate recommended dismissing the plaintiffs claims but issued its own opinion granting summary judgment for the remaining claims.the district court concluded that assuming there was a defect in the lighter they plaintiffs can not establish that the particular defect was connected to the fire.the plaintiffs have lodged a timely appeal.
we review the district court ruling on the defendants motion for summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standard as the district court.ramirez city of san antonio,cir.a summary judgment is only appropriate when,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,no genuine issue of material fact exists,and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.canova shell pipeline,cir.in determining whether there is a dispute as to any material fact,we consider all of the evidence in the record,but we do not make credibility determinations or weigh evidence.ramirez city of san antonio,at.instead,we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.id.
plaintiffs primary claim is that are liable under the theory of products liability based on the defective design of the defendants aim flame utility lighter.in texas,texas civil practice remedy code and section of the restatement second of torts govern products liability claims for design defects uniroyal goodrich tire martinez,american tobacco company,grinnell.under this schema,the plaintiff must show that because of its defective design the product is unreasonably dangerous,a safer alternative design exists,and the defective design was the producing cause of the plaintiffs injuries.
because the focus of the district court ruling was the lack of a causal link between the defendants lighter and the fire,we begin with a consideration of this issue.
under texas law,causation generally is a question of fact for the jury.gutierrez excel,cir.proof of causation requires more than conjecture or guess.mosley excel,cir.however,it need not be supported by direct evidence.tompkins cyr,cir.circumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom may form a sufficient basis for a finding of causation.id.establishing causation requires facts sufficient for a jury to reasonably infer that the defendants acts were a substantial factor in bringing about the injury.id.nevertheless,when circumstances are consistent with either of two factual scenarios and one is no more probable than the other,neither can be inferred.summers fort crockett hotel.houston dist citing litton industrial products gammage,marshall field stores,gardiner.houston dist.
in their motion for summary judgment,argued that,because cigarette lighters and matches were found in other areas of the trailer,it was just as likely that the fire could have been started with these incendiary devices rather than the aim flame.however,overlook the inference that can be drawn from the fact that the aim flame was the only incendiary device that was found in brandon room,where the fire started.the official fire report of the montgomery county fire marshall office and its supplements the fire report strongly support plaintiffs contention that the fire was started by brandon using an aim flame.
the fire report contains the findings of investigator darren hess.investigator hess found no evidence that a wire,gas line,or weather was the source of the fire.hess determined that the fire began in the south bedroom,brandon bedroom,near the bunk bed.investigator hess noted in the report that remains of a propane lighter were recovered from the area of origin.investigator williams,who investigated the scene of the fire with hess,likewise noted that the remains of a disposable lighter,of the type normally used to light fireplaces and bbq pits red plastic handle and squared off metal tip were found in the room without being informed that the metal tip of an aim flame was found in brandon bedroom,mann informed investigator williams that he and shonda had an aim flame in the trailer which they kept in the master bedroom on top of the tv.mann led investigator williams to the location where he believed the lighter was left the morning of the fire,but it was no longer there.
surmise other possible scenarios which could have caused the fire,brandon took a lighter from a drawer in the master bedroom,started the fire,and then returned the lighter to the drawer,or brandon started the fire with matches which were destroyed in the fire.they contend that these hypothetical scenarios were as likely as that contained in the fire report.we do not agree.the only evidence of an ignition source found in brandon bedroom,where the fire originated,was the remains of the aim flame lighter.this fact,together with other surrounding circumstances,creates a genuine issue of material fact on whether brandon started the fire using the lighter.thus,issues of fact preclude an award of summary judgment on this basis.
argue next that,even if an aim flame was used to start the blaze,the summary judgment evidence fails to establish that a design defect was the producing cause of the fire.in texas,producing cause is a statutorily required element for recovery in a products liability case.civ.prac.a.a producing cause is an efficient,exciting,or contributing cause,which in a natural sequence,produced injuries or damages complained of,if any.harper,citing union pump company allbritton,and rourke garza.producing cause is the of the harm,meaning that a defendant conduct must have been a substantial factor in bringing about the injury and that the injury would not have occurred but for the defendant conduct.id.at.
the crux of argument is that there is no way to determine whether a manufacturing defect caused the fire because there is no way to determine when the aim flame found in brandon room was manufactured because the plastic component was destroyed in the fire.
the plaintiffs have urged two potential design defect theories for which the time of manufacture plays a key role first,the plaintiffs contend that a problem with the safety switch on the aim flame may have caused the fire.the switch is designed so that the lighter will not ignite if the trigger is pulled when the switch is in the off position.both the model and a redesigned model of the aim flame have the safety switch.the plaintiffs produced evidence showing that the switch of the model gradually migrates to the on position after the trigger is pulled a number of times in repetition.this migration problem,however,was apparently corrected in the redesign.thus,plaintiffs can not rely on the migration problem as the design defect,unless they can produce evidence from which a jury could find that the lighter found in brandon bedroom was manufactured before.
the plaintiffs produced evidence that shonda and her former husband,bryan flock,purchased two or three aim flame lighters just after brandon was born in.however,shonda and bryan separated in,two years before the fire.he has no knowledge of what happened to these lighters after that time.while the plaintiffs contend that brandon used one of the lighters purchased in,shonda may have bought others after she and bryan separated.we agree with that it is impossible to determine from the summary judgment evidence whether the aim flame used to start the fire was a model or the redesign.further,even if the aim flame had a migration defect,there is no way to determine whether the switch migrated to the on position,whether it was left on by the last adult to use it,or whether brandon turned the switch to the on position himself.thus,to the extent that the plaintiffs urge that the fire was caused by the migration of the switch,summary judgment is appropriate.
however,independent of their migration theory,the plaintiffs also contend that the lack of child resistant features constitutes a design defect.prior to,did not offer a child resistant model of the aim flame in,redesigned the aim flame to incorporate child resistant features which require the use of the thumb to move a locking member at the same time the index finger is used to pull the trigger.according to expert testimony,a four child does not have the motor or cognitive capacity to master the specific,sequential motor tasks required to ignite the child resistant model and would abandon the aim flame after several minutes,thus,preventing child play fires.
in his deposition,mann stated that the only utility lighters in the trailer at the time of the fire were purchased by shonda before she moved into the trailer in march.though the date of manufacture of the aim flames in the trailer can not be pinpointed,from this evidence a jury could find that the aim flame which caused the fire was manufactured prior to the introduction of a child resistant model.a jury could find it unlikely that brandon,as a four child,would have been able to ignite the aim flame had it been equipped with the child resistant features.thus,the plaintiffs produced evidence from which a jury could find that the lack of an adequate child resistant mechanism was a substantial factor in starting the fire.
plaintiffs have produced substantial evidence from which a jury could find that the lighter without the child resistant features was defectively designed and was a substantial factor in starting the fire.because issues of fact are presented,summary judgment is inappropriate on this issue.
also contend that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the plaintiffs have no evidence that there was a safer alternative design.hernandez tokai.civ.prac.a.
a safer alternative design is both a statutorily required element of a design defect claim and a factor considered when conducting a analysis to determine whether a product is unreasonably dangerous.civ.prac.section b hernandez tokai.under texas civil practice remedy code section b,a safer alternative design is one that in reasonable probability would have prevented or significantly reduced the risk of the claimant personal injury,property damage,or death without substantially impairing the product utility and was economically and technologically feasible at the time the product left the control of the manufacturer or seller by the application of existing or reasonably achievable scientific knowledge.the summary judgment record is replete with evidence that a safer alternative design as defined by section b existed by october,the earliest purchase date of the aim flame that caused the fire.
as noted in section iv above,the plaintiffs produced substantial evidence that an adequate child resistant mechanism would have prevented the fire.the plaintiffs industrial engineering expert,professor tarald kvalseth,stated in his affidavit that existing child resistant technology would have made the aim flame nearly impossible for a child to ignite yet,at the same time,would not have substantially reduced the utility of the lighter for adult use.the plaintiffs also produced the affidavit of bruce perry,a board certified child psychiatrist,who averred that it would have been extremely difficult if not impossible for a four child,like brandon,to activate a child resistant aim flame.because a child of this age lacks the required motor skills and cognitive abilities to activate the child resistant mechanism,the child grows bored and abandons the aim flame after his efforts to ignite it are frustrated by the child resistant features.in contrast,only a brief exploration or manipulation by a child results in the production of a flame when the aim flame lacks child resistant features.based on this evidence,a jury could find that,had the aim flame possessed the child resistant mechanism,the risk of brandon starting a fire with it would have been prevented or significantly reduced.
regarding the availability of this technology,professor kvalseth stated that the technology was within the state of the art in when first introduced the aim flame in the united states.moreover,the history of the development of the child resistant model of the aim flame demonstrates that the technology was available at the time the product left the control of.
the child resistant model of the aim flame introduced by in was covered by a patent owned by tokai.in early,scripto directed tokai research and development staff to quickly develop plans to make the aim flame child resistant due to concerns regarding child play fires.three formal mock ups of a child resistant aim flame were presented to scripto management by tokai research and development staff in june.as a result,tokai filed four patents of child resistant devices for use in its utility lighters in october,noting in the patents that the current designs were not desirable from the perspective of safety.according to scripto former president,it would have taken only seven to nine months to manufacture and distribute this child resistant version of the aim flame.thus,it is clear that the child resistant technology was available by october,the earliest purchase date of the aim flame involved in this fire.
further,the plaintiffs produced evidence that producing a child resistant model was economically feasible.according to kvalseth,if child resistant features had been incorporated in the original design in,the cost would have been negligible.it is only when a product is modified that a manufacturer incurs additional expense.in internal memoranda a
