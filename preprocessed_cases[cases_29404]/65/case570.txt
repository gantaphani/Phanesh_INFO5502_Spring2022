in this negligence and strict products liability action,a child skier collided with a plainly visible aluminum snowmaking hydrant located on a ski run.the trial court granted summary judgment to the ski resort and the hydrant distributor,deeming the collision an inherent risk of skiing under the primary assumption of risk doctrine and finding no basis for the products liability claim.we affirm.the pertinent facts will be set forth in the discussion that follows.

background 
the summary judgment papers show the following undisputed facts.
on january,then plaintiff tatum souza souza,an intermediate skier,collided with a snowmaking hydrant on the mountain run ski trail at defendant squaw valley ski corporation resort squaw valley,injuring her mouth.the accident occurred when souza caught her ski edge and lost her balance,causing her to veer to the right and collide with the hydrant.
the snowmaking hydrant that souza collided with was plainly visible.at the time of the collision,souza was skiing with her family the weather was overcast,the wind was calm,and the surface condition was packed powder.no one saw what part of the hydrant souza hit given her injuries,it appeared to be the nozzle.
souza collided with the hydrant on her last run down the mountain run trail on january.she had skied this trail about previous times,including once before in.
the hydrant at issue was located feet from the left side of the mountain run trail and approximately feet to the left of a tree situated toward the right side of the trail there is also room for skiers to go to the right of this tree on the trail.on the day of the accident,the hydrant protruded above the snow level about five to six feet.the hydrant was padded but its nozzle apparently was not.
souza sued squaw valley for negligence and for willful failure to warn,alleging that the metal snow hydrant was inadequately padded and negligently located in a commonly congested area of the ski trail.souza also sued squaw valley and defendant york snow,the of the hydrant for strict products liability for a defective defectively padded and placed snow hydrant and nozzle,pointed uphill.
negligence and willful failure to warn 
negligence 
the doctrine of primary assumption of concept in negligence where a plaintiff voluntarily participates in an activity or sport involving certain inherent risks.knight jewett cal th,d,knight connelly,supra,th at,d.for example,an errantly thrown ball in baseball or a carelessly extended elbow in basketball are considered inherent risks of those respective sports.wattenbarger cincinnati reds,th,d wattenbarger.under this doctrine,no duty of care is owed as to such risks.knight,supra,cal th at,d,connelly,supra,th at,d.the rationale for the doctrine is to avoid imposing a duty which might chill vigorous participation in the sport and thereby alter its fundamental nature.wattenbarger,supra,th at,d.because a duty of care is one of the elements of a negligence cause of action,if there is no such duty,there is no such action.connelly,supra,th at,d see wattenbarger,supra,th at,d.
the issue of duty in the primary assumption of risk context is a legal question which depends on the nature of the sport or activity and on the parties general relationship to the activity,and is an issue to be decided by the court,rather than the jury.connelly,supra,th at,d,quoting knight,supra,cal th at,d.in deciding whether or not to impose a duty,a court must consider the inherent risks of the sport and whether imposing a duty might alter that sport fundamental nature.van dyke th,d van dyke.
as we noted in connelly,this court has listed the risks inherent in snow skiing on more than one occasion.each person who participates in the sport of snow skiing accepts the dangers that inhere in that sport insofar as the dangers are obvious and necessary.those dangers include,but are not limited to,injuries which can result from variations in terrain surface or subsurface snow or ice conditions bare spots rocks,trees and other forms of natural growth or debris collisions with ski lift towers and their components,with other skiers,or with properly marked or plainly visible or equipment.danieley goldmine ski associates,d,quoting from.stat.fn.omitted.wattenbarger cincinnati reds,supra,th at d ferrari grand canyon dories th,d,parallel citation omitted,italics added.connelly,supra,th at,d,italics omitted and second and third italics added.
connelly involved a skier collision with a ski lift tower.in that decision,we affirmed a summary judgment for the ski the doctrine of primary assumption of on this inherent risk.connelly plows the course of our analysis here.
similar to the plaintiff in connelly,souza indisputably collided with plainly visible snowmaking equipment while skiing.as noted,this risk is inherent in the sport.consequently,the trial court properly granted summary judgment on this point,concluding that squaw valley,under the doctrine of primary assumption of risk,owed no duty to protect souza against this inherent risk.
also similar to the plaintiff in connelly,souza argues that squaw valley breached what has been recognized as a duty in this realm the duty to use due care not to increase the risks to a participant over and above those inherent in the sport.connelly,supra,th at,d,quoting knight,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.squaw valley breached this duty,souza argues,by locating the snowmaking hydrant in the middle of a heavily congested,narrow ski run rather than on the side,by inadequately padding the hydrant and nozzle,and by concealing the nozzle and having it pointed uphill in the direction of oncoming skiers.
although the snowmaking equipment was located on the ski run,no one has disputed there was sufficient room on either side of the equipment for skiers to pass by it.although souza claims the equipment was inadequately padded,we are not aware of any relevant legal authority,and we have not been directed to any,requiring a ski area operator to pad its plainly visible snowmaking equipment.see connelly,supra,th at,d it would be anomalous to hold a ski operator more liable for inadequate padding if the operator can not be held liable for failing to pad.and although souza claims there was concealed equipment nozzle pointing nozzle was a very small,integral part of the large,padded,aluminum snowmaking hydrant which was plainly visible to oncoming skiers.it remains undisputed,then,that souza collided with plainly visible snowmaking equipment a padded,aluminum hydrant protruding about five to six feet above the snow level on the day of the accident.this is a risk that is inherent in the sport of snow skiing.
the undisputed plain visibility of the snowmaking hydrant distinguishes this case from one on which souza heavily relies,van dyke.in van dyke,the court reversed a summary judgment,finding a triable issue of fact as to whether the ski resort there had increased the risk of harm by placing a signpost in a ski run where it was virtually invisible to skiers crossing the run.van dyke,supra,th at,d.as van dyke remarked,the ski resort stresses directional signs are necessary to a ski area.we do not suggest otherwise.when a ski area puts signs in a ski run,however,it has a duty to mark the signs so they are plainly visible from all angles to skiers who are skiing on the run.otherwise,the ski area,by an affirmative act,significantly increases the risk of harm without enhancing the sport.id.at,d.van dyke additionally noted that signposts are not an inherent risk of
