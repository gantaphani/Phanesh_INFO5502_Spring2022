after loren collin was diagnosed with mesothelioma,he and his wife verna lee collin sued entities for negligence,strict liability,false representation,intentional to warn,alter ego,and loss of consortium,alleging loren was exposed to asbestos from the defendants products or activities when he worked in various construction trades 
plaintiff now appeals from the grant of summary judgment in favor of four defendants calportland company calportland,kaiser gypsum company,kaiser gypsum,j m manufacturing company,j mm,and formosa plastics corporation usa formosa,named as an alter ego of j mm.plaintiff contends those defendants did not show that plaintiff does not possess and can not reasonably obtain evidence of exposure to an product for which defendants are responsible but even if the burden shifted to plaintiff,the evidence is sufficient to support an inference of exposure.plaintiff also claims j mm and formosa did not establish that loren was a sophisticated user who knew or should have known of the potential risks and dangers of using j mm asbestos cement pipe.
our discussion is organized by defendant part i addresses calportland,part ii involves kaiser gypsum,and part iii pertains to j mm and its alleged alter ego formosa.we conclude summary judgment was properly granted in favor of calportland and kaiser gypsum,because they met their initial burdens on summary judgment and the evidence and reasonable inferences would preclude a reasonable trier of fact from finding without speculating that loren was exposed to one of their products.
regarding j mm and formosa,however,summary judgment was not proper.the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff,demonstrates a triable issue of fact as to whether loren was exposed to asbestos from a j mm product.in addition,j mm and formosa have not established that they are entitled to summary adjudication as a matter of law based on the sophisticated user defense.
we will affirm the judgments in favor of calportland and kaiser gypsum and reverse the judgments in favor of j mm and formosa.
background 
plaintiff brought a personal injury action against defendants,alleging that loren developed peritoneal mesothelioma because of occupational exposure to defendants products or activities from through and through the.calportland,kaiser gypsum,j mm and formosa are among the named defendants in plaintiff lawsuit.the complaint alleges counts for negligence,strict liability,false representation,intentional to warn,alter ego and loss of consortium.
calportland and kaiser gypsum separately moved for summary judgment,while j mm and formosa separately moved for summary judgment or summary adjudication.each defendant said plaintiff can not establish that loren was exposed to an product for which the defendant is responsible.
calportland argued that despite several opportunities to state facts supporting his claims,loren did not say he was exposed to colton gun plastic cement,which was the only cement calportland manufactured and sold.plaintiff responded that a trier of fact could infer from the similarities between the plastic cement product loren said he encountered on jobsites,and colton gun plastic cement,that loren was exposed to the calportland product.
according to kaiser gypsum,it stopped making or selling asbestos products after,and loren can not show he encountered a kaiser gypsum asbestos product because he can not say when he encountered their product.plaintiff countered that although loren can not pinpoint exactly when he was exposed to a joint compound manufactured by kaiser gypsum,he said he was exposed to dust from kaiser gypsum joint compound during his career in construction from the mid to,and kaiser gypsum manufactured a joint compound containing asbestos from the mid through.according to plaintiff,a reasonable inference of exposure can be drawn from the fact that during loren career in construction,kaiser gypsum manufactured a joint compound with asbestos for years,whereas it manufactured an joint compound for only two years.
j mm motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication asserted that plaintiff can not prove j mm caused the plaintiff injuries because j mm was not liable for asbestos cement pipes sold prior to its formation in,and plaintiff has no evidence of any exposure to asbestos cement pipe after.j mm also argued it had no duty to warn loren of the potential risks and dangers of working with asbestos cement pipe because loren was a sophisticated user of the product.
plaintiff named formosa as an alter ego of j mm.formosa motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication asserted the same arguments advanced by j mm.
in opposition to the motions by j mm and formosa,plaintiff pointed to loren discovery responses which stated that he was exposed to asbestos from transite asbestos cement pipe through the early.plaintiff also pointed to evidence that transite was a trade name for j mm asbestos cement pipe.regarding the sophisticated user defense,plaintiff said the defense did not apply to their design defect claims and there was no evidence loren was a sophisticated user of asbestos.
the trial court ruled that each defendant satisfied its initial burden on summary judgment by showing via loren factually insufficient discovery responses that the plaintiff does not possess and can not obtain evidence establishing an element of the causes of action,exposure to the defendant product.the trial court further determined that the plaintiff did not satisfy the burden of showing the existence of a triable factual issue with regard to exposure.accordingly,the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of calportland,kaiser gypsum,j mm and formosa.

discussion 
plaintiff contends calportland did not satisfy its threshold burden on summary judgment.plaintiff claims calportland failed to show that plaintiff does not have and could not reasonably obtain evidence of exposure to an calportland product.
a plaintiff claiming injuries must establish some exposure to the product or activity for which the defendant is responsible.rutherford owens illinois,cal th,rutherford.if there has been no exposure,the plaintiff can not demonstrate that the defendant caused his or her injuries.whitmire ingersoll rand th.
evidence that the defendant propounded sufficiently comprehensive discovery requests and that the plaintiff provided factually insufficient responses can raise an inference that the plaintiff can not prove causation.casey perini th,casey.in casey,the plaintiff accused the defendant,a general contractor,of exposing him to asbestos at jobsites where the plaintiff worked for a subcontractor.id.at.the plaintiff said he was the only person with knowledge of the amount and extent of the alleged asbestos exposure.id.at.in response to a special interrogatory asking him to state each fact supporting his claim against the defendant,the plaintiff said he worked alongside carpenters and laborers employed by the defendant in performing their work,the carpenters disturbed the overspray on the ceiling and caused it to fall on everyone in the area the defendant laborers swept the dust and debris in the plaintiff presence and the plaintiff breathed in this dust.id.at.when asked about the alleged asbestos materials to which he was exposed,the plaintiff admitted he only assumed that the dust and debris he encountered contained asbestos.id.at.
the appellate court said the plaintiff discovery responses failed to state specific facts showing that the plaintiff was actually exposed to asbestos because of the defendant activities.casey,supra,th at.instead,the plaintiff responses assumed,without evidentiary support,that the dust and debris he encountered contained asbestos.ibid.the appellate court held that the defendant sufficiently comprehensive discovery requests and the plaintiff responses devoid of facts led to an inference that the plaintiff could not prove causation.id.at.thus,the burden shifted to the plaintiff to establish a triable issue of material fact regarding exposure.ibid.
here,calportland presented evidence that it manufactured and sold only one cement product.that product was called colton gun plastic cement.at the same time that calportland manufactured colton gun plastic cement,it also manufactured a cement which did not contain any asbestos.that product was called plastic cement.plastic cement and colton gun plastic cement were two different products.all of these facts were undisputed.
calportland showed that plaintiff identified the product for which calportland is liable as calportland plastic cement.loren was the plaintiff sole product identification witness with regard to calportland.loren testified that he used calportland plastic cement and recalled seeing that product at the jobsites where he worked.loren did not recall ever seeing the colton gun plastic cement brand name.he never saw a bag of cement used for exterior plastering that had the word gun on it.he first heard of colton gun plastic cement when he was deposed in this lawsuit in may.in addition,loren could not say whether he had any information that he was ever on a job where anybody used colton gun plastic cement.he did not have any documents or witnesses that could help him determine whether he ever encountered colton gun plastic cement on a job.thus,this case is factually distinguishable from hernandez amcord,th hernandez,where there was evidence the decedent worked with the defendant product many times and dust from the defendant product got on his face and clothing when he worked with it.id.at.
calportland summary judgment motion also relied on loren responses to special interrogatories from calportland.in response to a special interrogatory requesting all facts supporting the contention that loren was exposed to an product for which he contends calportland is responsible,loren did not say he was exposed to colton gun plastic cement.instead,he allege d he was exposed to calportland plastic cement products on various jobsites throughout his work in different construction trades during the span of over years.referencing his deposition testimony,he said he personally used a calportland plastic cement product once and worked near others who used calportland plastic cement products.the cited deposition testimony related to calportland plastic cement and calportland cement.no reference was made in that deposition testimony to colton gun plastic cement or asbestos.
unlike the limited discovery conducted by the defendant in weber john crane,th,weber,a case plaintiff says is similar to this one,calportland discovery questions to loren are comprehensive and sought to elicit information about the bases for calportland alleged liability to plaintiff for exposure to asbestos.loren responses to calportland questions do not provide facts showing exposure to an asbestos product.loren had a statutory duty to provide complete and straightforward answers to calportland discovery questions.andrews foster wheeler llc,supra,th at the plaintiffs can not play hide the ball scheiding dinwiddie construction th.but unlike the plaintiff in weber,loren plaintiff only product identification witness did not say he encountered calportland asbestos product and he admitted having no documents and no knowledge of any person that could help him determine whether he ever encountered a calportland asbestos product.weber,supra,th at.
calportland discovery questions and loren responses raise an inference that plaintiff can not prove the element of causation.casey,supra,th at.calportland showing shifted the burden of production to plaintiff.andrews foster wheeler llc,supra,th at mcgonnell kaiser gypsum th,mcgonnell hunter pacific mechanical th,hunter,disapproved on another ground in aguilar,supra,cal th at,fn.smith acands,th,disapproved on another ground in camargo tjaarda dairy cal th.
nonetheless,plaintiff argues calportland did not satisfy its threshold burden because it did not set forth all the material evidence,particularly loren description of the calportland cement product he encountered.but the cases plaintiff cites rio linda unified school dist.superior court th and harbour vista,llc hsbc mortgage services th do not hold that the failure to set forth all material evidence necessarily defeats a threshold burden.we can not say that any omission by calportland was an attempt to mislead the trial court about the state of the discovery record,as plaintiff suggests.in any event,as we explain,loren deposition testimony would preclude a reasonable trier of fact from finding without speculating that loren was exposed to colton gun plastic cement.
in opposing calportland summary judgment motion,plaintiff produced evidence that the cement to which loren was exposed was similar in appearance,function,application and packaging to colton gun plastic cement.loren said the cement product he encountered was a gray powder that was mixed with sand and water and was packaged in pound,brown paper bags.the bags contained the words california portland,cal portland,plastic cement.the product was applied by hand or gun to the outside walls of a structure as an exterior plaster.
like the product loren described,colton gun plastic cement was gray in color and looked like dry cement.colton gun plastic cement had to be mixed with sand and water prior to use.it was sold in brown,pound bags in the early.in addition,it could be applied with a gun or a trowel.it was primarily used to plaster the outside of structures.
plaintiff argues the similarities between the product described by loren and colton gun plastic cement are sufficient to raise a triable issue as to whether loren was exposed to colton gun plastic cement.but on the evidence presented,guesswork is required for the trier of fact to conclude that the product loren encountered was colton gun plastic cement.loren admitted he never heard of colton gun plastic cement.whereas colton gun plastic cement was packaged in bags which were labeled colton gun plastic cement,loren never saw the word gun on a bag of cement.confronted with a s tate all facts interrogatory,loren did not state facts showing that the plastic cement which he encountered contained asbestos.plaintiff does not claim that further discovery may produce evidence of exposure to colton gun plastic cement,as opposed to the plastic cement.code civ,subd.h authorizing continuance to permit party opposing summary judgment to obtain affidavits or conduct discovery in order to present evidence.the allegations of exposure contained in loren special interrogatory response do not raise a triable issue of fact.code civ,subd.p.
although a party may rely on reasonable inferences drawn from direct and circumstantial evidence to satisfy its burden on summary judgment,we do not draw inferences from thin air.leslie perry associates th,leslie mcgonnell,supra,th at speculation about exposure to defendant asbestos product is insufficient.likewise,a mere possibility that loren was exposed to colton gun plastic cement is not enough to create a triable issue of fact.saelzler,supra,cal th at,casey,supra,th at.the evidence here could not reasonably permit a trier of fact to conclude that the product to which loren was exposed was more likely than not colton gun plastic cement.leslie,supra,th at,to resist summary judgment,the plaintiff must show that the inferences favorable to her were more reasonable or probable than those against her the plaintiff can not survive summary judgment simply because it was possible that her rapist might have entered through an allegedly negligently maintained gate.this case does not involve equally conflicting evidence or inferences.
plaintiff claims there is no evidence that the product loren described is consistent with the calportland plastic cement.not so.there was evidence that all colton cement products,which included the non plastic cement,were packaged in brown bags,like the cement product loren described.loren said the cement product he was exposed to was used for masonry and applied to outside walls as an exterior plaster.likewise,calportland plastic cement was used as stucco and for hand plastering and masonry.the product loren described could be applied by hand or a gun.calportland sold a hand plastic cement that could be applied by a gun.that product,like the product loren described,is mixed with sand.
even viewing all of the evidence submitted in the light most favorable to plaintiff,we conclude that summary judgment for calportland is proper.casey,supra,th at mcgonnell,supra,th at no triable issue of material fact regarding exposure where there was no evidence that the defendant product,which might have been used at the plaintiff workplace,contained asbestos garcia joseph vince d,nonsuit in favor of the defendant was proper where the jury would be required to speculate as to which entity manufactured the allegedly defective product lindstrom a c product liability trust cir,no triable issue of fact regarding causation where the defendant manufactured as well as products and the plaintiff witnesses could not tell whether any material the plaintiff handled contained asbestos.
plaintiff also argues that kaiser gypsum did not satisfy its threshold burden on summary judgment and,thus,the burden of production did not shift to plaintiff.
plaintiff alleges that loren was exposed to an,premixed kaiser gypsum joint compound during his career in the construction trades,which spanned from to.kaiser gypsum began manufacturing an,premixed joint compound called pre mix joint compound in it stopped manufacturing and selling any product that contained asbestos in early.and it ceased all manufacturing and sales operations in.plaintiff says it is reasonable to infer that loren could have encountered kaiser gypsum joint compound as late as because there was likely some inventory of kaiser gypsum joint compound in use after kaiser gypsum ceased operations.plaintiff deduces that loren potential period of exposure to kaiser gypsum joint compound is approximately years through.plaintiff further deduces that kaiser gypsum joint compound contained asbestos for of the approximately year potential exposure period.thus,plaintiff continues,there is a greater than percent chance that the kaiser gypsum joint compound loren encountered contained asbestos.plaintiff maintains the above facts raise an inference of exposure under a preponderance of the evidence standard,regardless of loren inability to recall the exact dates when he saw premixed kaiser gypsum joint compound at a jobsite.
we conclude kaiser gypsum met its initial burden of production by making a prima facie showing that plaintiff does not have,and can not obtain,evidence necessary to show exposure to an kaiser gypsum joint compound.
kaiser gypsum submitted loren deposition testimony and interrogatory responses and the declaration of george kirk in support of its summary judgment motion.kaiser gypsum evidence shows that it began selling an joint compound in by the end of it had removed asbestos from all but one joint compound product that it manufactured and sold and it stopped manufacturing and selling any product that contained asbestos in early.loren testified that he saw premixed kaiser gypsum joint compound at jobsites over the years.he said there were numerous times when he a worked around others who used or sanded kaiser gypsum joint compound,b performed cleanup work after the product was used,and c breathed in the dust created from such work.however,loren had no idea whether any of the kaiser gypsum joint compound that he encountered contained asbestos.of significance,loren could not identify any particular year when he saw kaiser gypsum joint compound on a jobsite.
plaintiff does not dispute that loren knew of no documents or witnesses which would show whether he was exposed to asbestos from a kaiser gypsum product.loren also could not remember the name of any person who employed him or who worked with him when he saw kaiser gypsum joint compound on a jobsite.
further,loren did not know the complete name of any kaiser gypsum joint compound product that he encountered.other than the word kaiser,he could not remember any logos,symbols or wording on any of the cartons of kaiser gypsum products he saw.in response to a special interrogatory asking him to describe each kaiser gypsum asbestos product to which he was exposed,loren did not state that any packaging of a kaiser gypsum product to which he was exposed referenced asbestos.
in response to a special interrogatory seeking all facts supporting the contention that he was exposed to asbestos from a product bearing the name kaiser gypsum,loren allege d he was exposed to asbestos from kaiser gypsum joint compound products during his years of working on various construction sites in and around sacramento or northern california.although he was required to provide a complete and straightforward answer to kaiser gypsum interrogatory andrews foster wheeler llc,supra,th at,loren did not specify when he encountered kaiser gypsum joint compound on a jobsite.the pages of his deposition testimony in the record do not set forth facts showing that any kaiser gypsum product loren encountered contained asbestos.loren admitted he had no idea whether any of the kaiser gypsum joint compound that may have been at any of his jobsites contained asbestos.another interrogatory specifically asked loren to identify the date and location of each alleged exposure to an kaiser gypsum product.loren responded to that interrogatory with mere allegations.
viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,the evidence kaiser gypsum presented shows that the kaiser gypsum product loren encountered was if loren encountered that product after early.however,loren could not pinpoint when he encountered kaiser gypsum joint compound.specifically,he did not say he encountered kaiser gypsum joint compound during the first years of his career in construction,through.loren incomplete responses to comprehensive discovery questions are sufficient to shift the burden on summary judgment on the issue of causation.andrews foster wheeler llc,supra,th at hunter,supra,th at.lineaweaver plant insulation th lineaweaver is not a factually similar case because there was no dispute in lineaweaver that the product contained asbestos and it was reasonable to infer from the evidence presented that plaintiff lineweaver encountered the defendant asbestos product.lineaweaver,supra,th at.hernandez,supra,th,a case where there was evidence of exposure to the defendant product,is also factually distinguishable.id.at.
plaintiff must prove the fact,not the date,of exposure to establish causation.even under the most lenient causation standards,however,plaintiff must present evidence that would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find more likely than not that loren encountered an kaiser gypsum product.smith acands,supra,th at.in opposing kaiser gypsum motion,plaintiff asserted that loren was exposed to kaiser gypsum joint compound numerous times from the mid to.but the pertinent question is not whether loren was exposed to kaiser gypsum joint compound.the pertinent question is whether loren encountered an kaiser gypsum joint compound.as to the latter question,plaintiff did not set forth any fact showing that loren encountered an premixed joint compound manufactured by kaiser gypsum.
loren inability to say when he encountered kaiser gypsum joint compound is significant because,as plaintiff acknowledges,the date of the encounter would tend to indicate whether the product loren saw contained asbestos.plaintiff did not ask for a continuance of the summary judgment motion or indicate in any way that it could obtain needed evidence.without any fact showing when loren was exposed to kaiser gypsum joint compound,the trier of fact could not reasonably infer that loren was more likely than not exposed to asbestos attributable to kaiser gypsum.aguilar,supra,cal th at in ruling on a summary judgment motion,we consider inferences reasonably drawn from the evidence.on this record,there is no triable issue of fact as to exposure.hunter,supra,th at lindstrom a c product liability trust,supra,at.
plaintiff nonetheless argues there is a reasonable probability,a greater than chance,that loren encountered an joint compound because kaiser gypsum manufactured or sold such product for years to and its joint compound was likely in use for only three years to.plaintiff cites simmons west covina medical clinic d simmons,jones ortho pharmaceutical d jones,and bromme pavitt th bromme for the proposition that there was a greater than percent chance that loren was exposed to a kaiser gypsum asbestos product evidence pertaining to reasonable medical probability of causation,as opposed to exposure,was presented in the cited cases.but those cases are inapposite because the kind of evidence presented in those cases was not presented here.in simmons,it was undisputed that a genetic test,which the plaintiffs claimed the defendants neglected to provide,would detect down syndrome in only percent of pregnant women under the age of.simmons,supra,d at.in jones,the plaintiff medical expert testified there was a less than chance the defendant drug contributed to the development of the plaintiff cancer.jones,supra,d at.in bromme,the expert witnesses agreed the decedent chance of surviving colon cancer was less than percent after a certain date.bromme,supra,th at.similar evidence is not present here.
plaintiff also complains that kaiser gypsum did not disclose in its papers that it manufactured and sold an premixed joint compound from through,that it ceased all manufacturing operations in,and that its product sales occurred between and.those facts,however,do not raise a triable issue of material fact regarding causation.as we have explained,kaiser gypsum made a prima facie showing that plaintiff does not have and can not obtain evidence of exposure to an kaiser gypsum joint compound.and plaintiff failed to present evidence showing that a triable issue of material fact existed as to whether loren was exposed to asbestos for which kaiser gypsum is responsible.summary judgment for kaiser gypsum was properly granted.
we do not separately address verna loss of consortium claim because plaintiff does not dispute that a decision in kaiser gypsum favor on loren personal injury claims requires summary judgment for kaiser gypsum.it is also unnecessary to consider kaiser gypsum alternate argument about whether exposure to asbestos from kaiser gypsum joint compound was a substantial factor in causing loren illness.
plaintiff next contends j mm and formosa did not satisfy their threshold burden to show that plaintiff can not prove exposure to an j mm product.plaintiff also asserts j mm and formosa failed to establish that j mm did not have to warn loren of the dangers and risks associated with j mm asbestos cement pipe because loren was a sophisticated user of asbestos.
we discuss the grant of summary judgment in favor of j mm and formosa in the same section because j mm and its alleged alter ego formosa moved for summary judgment or summary adjudication on the same grounds.formosa did not move for summary adjudication based on the lack of an alter ego relationship between formosa and j mm.
we begin with plaintiff argument that j mm and formosa did not meet their burden to show that plaintiff can not prove causation.
j mm and formosa asserted in their summary judgment motions that loren did not testify about any encounters with asbestos cement pipe after,and j mm is not liable for any claims relating to asbestos cement pipe prior to its formation in.j mm and formosa rely on loren deposition testimony and interrogatory responses and documents pertinent to j mm acquisition of the assets of johns manville pipe corporation johns manville to support their motions.
there is no dispute that j mm was formed on january,after j mm purchased the assets of johns manville.plaintiff also does not dispute that j mm is not liable for any product sold by johns manville prior to the asset purchase.
loren testified that over the course of his career he saw cement pipes that said johns manville and j m many times.in response to a special interrogatory from j mm asking for the date and location of each alleged exposure to an product manufactured,sold or supplied by j mm,loren recounted his prior deposition testimony that he worked in the vicinity of other workers who installed,cut or machined transite loren said he was exposed to the dust created when workers cut transite.he said transite was the trade name for johns manville asbestos cement pipe,and he assumed transite was also the trade name for j mm asbestos cement pipe because transite was a name used for asbestos cement pipe.loren recalled john mansville sic and then later on there was a j m on the products.he saw the words j m and transite on asbestos cement pipes.his special interrogatory response described his prior testimony about seeing transite at jobsites in the and.loren also testified that he saw workers use or install transite up into the early.
j mm and formosa contend loren testimony about seeing other workers use or install transite up into the early was vague and made in response to a leading question.but j mm and formosa did not object to loren special interrogatory answer or his deposition testimony in this regard in their summary judgment papers or at the hearing on their motions.as such,their evidentiary objections are forfeited.code civ,subds.b evidentiary objections not made at the hearing shall be deemed waived,c the court shall consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers,except that to which objections have been made and sustained by the court cal.rules of court,rules.
j mm and formosa also contend it is unclear whether loren referred to transite as a generic term for asbestos cement pipe,as opposed to an asbestos cement pipe supplied by j mm,when he testified about seeing transite up into the early.the record on this point,however,is not unclear.counsel asked loren to focus on transite as a trade name,before asking loren a series of questions,including whether he saw other workers use or install transite in the.
in moving for summary judgment,j mm argued that loren discovery responses indicated he was last exposed to asbestos cement pipe allegedly sold by j mm in.j mm and formosa suggest that pages and of loren deposition testimony support their contention.those pages are not in the record.we do not consider evidence that is not in the record in reviewing a motion for summary judgment.west sundown little league of stockton,th.
j mm and formosa maintain on appeal that loren could not recall a single jobsite where he worked with or around asbestos cement pipe after.but the evidence j mm presented indicates that loren observed other workers use or install transite up into the early and that loren associated transite with j mm.loren recalled seeing a j m on the products.there is no evidence that during his deposition,loren was asked to provide further information about product encounters that occurred in the and was unable to do so.
j mm and formosa argue that the transite loren encountered could have been sold or supplied by johns manville or any number of suppliers who supplied similar pipe to jobsites.but there is no evidence that both j mm and johns manville sold or supplied transite during the same time period or that there were multiple suppliers of transite in the early.as the parties moving for summary judgment,j mm and formosa bore the initial burden of showing that plaintiff did not possess and could not reasonably obtain needed evidence.code civ,subd.p aguilar,supra,cal th at.j mm and formosa did not meet that burden.
moreover,plaintiff presented evidence that j mm began selling asbestos cement pipe in.the pipes sold by j mm contained asbestos and were the same product manufactured and sold by johns manville prior to january,under the trade name transite.jim reichert testified that as of january,j mm sold the same transite asbestos cement pipe that johns manville sold prior to january.a trier of fact could reasonably infer from a document used as an exhibit at the deposition of jim reichert that j mm was also known as j m,which was a name loren said he saw on asbestos cement pipes 
j mm and formosa liken this case to hunter,supra,th and dumin owens corning fiberglas th dumin.there is no fair comparison.the plaintiff in hunter testified he was personally unaware of the defendant activities at any of the jobsites where he worked.hunter,supra,th at.similarly,the plaintiff in dumin could not identify kaylo,the product for which the defendant was a nonexclusive distributor,as one of the products to which he was exposed.dumin,supra,th at.he presented evidence that kaylo was customarily used at the shipyard where he worked as one of many asbestos insulation products around the early.id.at.but there was no evidence that kaylo supplied by the defendant was used aboard the ship where he worked in and.ibid.
unlike the plaintiffs in hunter and dumin,loren identified j mm and he identified transite as a product he worked around up into the early.j mm sold transite in the early.unlike dumin,where there were multiple suppliers for kaylo,there is no evidence in this case of multiple suppliers for transite in the early.
j mm and formosa further state,in a cursory manner,that plaintiff must prove substantial exposure to j mm product.a plaintiff claiming injuries must prove that exposure to the defendant asbestos product or activity was,in reasonable medical probability,a substantial factor in causing or contributing to the plaintiff injury.rutherford,supra,cal th at.to the extent j mm and formosa are raising the issue of whether exposure to j mm product was a substantial factor in causing plaintiff injuries,the contention is forfeited because j mm and formosa do not present this point under an appropriate heading and they do not support their contention with factual analysis.keyes bowen th.
viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff,all of the evidence presented demonstrates a triable issue of fact about whether loren was exposed to asbestos from transite after j mm began marketing and selling that product in the early.therefore,j mm and formosa are not entitled to summary judgment on the issue of exposure.
j mm and formosa also moved for summary judgment or,in the alternative,summary adjudication on the ground that j mm had no duty to warn loren of the dangers associated with using j mm product because he was a sophisticated user of asbestos cement pipe.plaintiff opposed the motion on that ground.the trial court did not rely on the sophisticated user defense in granting summary judgment to j mm and formosa.however,j mm and formosa rely on the sophisticated user defense on appeal.in addition,j mm and formosa contend loren could not have relied on any representations made by j mm concerning the character of its product because he had actual knowledge about the potential hazards of asbestos.we may consider j mm and formosa contentions because we review the trial court judgment if it is correct on any legal theory that was presented to the trial court.wri opportunity loans ii,llc cooper th,fn.gordon havasu palms,th.
j mm and formosa say they are entitled to summary adjudication on plaintiff failure to warn causes of action because loren was an experienced professional in the construction trades and he was well aware of the hazards associated with asbestos,obviating a duty on j mm part to warn loren of such hazards.
