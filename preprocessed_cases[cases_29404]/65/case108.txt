these appeals arise from the district court efforts to oversee the nationwide class action settlement agreement in the mdl litigation between wyeth and a class comprising former users of wyeth diet medications,fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine.this appeal is the consolidation of challenges by three different groups of appellants,all claiming that they should not be bound by the settlement agreement.for the reasons discussed,we find that all three groups of appellants are bound by the settlement agreement and we will affirm the district court decision.
i.the settlement agreement 
the history of this case is detailed in in re diet drugs prod.liab,cir and will only be briefly summarized here.in,wyeth reached a settlement that provided a variety of remedies for users and former users of its diet medications.the district court approved the plan in pretrial order and the accompanying memorandum.the remedies provided depended on whether the class members were ultimately diagnosed with one of several heart conditions.
each class member was placed into one of five groups.class consisted of class members who did not know whether they had a condition termed fda positive ventricular heart disease vhd and was further subdivided into class members who had used the diet drugs for more than days and class members who had used the drugs for less than days.class consisted of class members who knew they had fda positive vhd and was also subdivided based on diet drug usage of more or less than days.class was comprised of class members who did not know whether they had fda positive vhd at the time of settlement,but were diagnosed with a less serious condition called mild mitral regurgitation by the end of the settlement screening period.
the settlement provided funding for screening tests to determine whether class members had qualifying heart disease and for compensation for the cost of the drugs and medical treatment,depending on the ultimate diagnosis.the settlement agreement expressly barred participating class members from pursuing any settled claims against wyeth.
the settlement provided the option for class members to opt out at the time of settlement initial opt outs or to be bound by the settlement agreement.those class members diagnosed as having fda positive vhd by a specified date could either register for further benefits or exercise an intermediate opt out and sue wyeth in the state tort system.in addition,those class members diagnosed as having a lesser condition,mild mitral regurgitation,could either claim compensation under the settlement or exercise a back end opt out and sue wyeth in the tort system.the class members who exercised intermediate or back end opt outs are collectively referred to as downstream opt outs.in exchange for wyeth waiver of a statute of limitations defense,class members exercising downstream opt out rights can not sue for punitive damages.
the settlement agreement explicitly excluded those individuals with a more serious condition,primary pulmonary hypertension pph,allowing them to sue wyeth in the state tort system.the settlement did not include any recovery for plaintiffs alleging a variety of conditions,including neurotoxicity and elevated pulmonary hypertension ph,because the district court found that the evidence did not support a connection between the use of diet drugs and these conditions.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction over pretrial orders,and because they are all final orders of the district court within the meaning of.
the district court legal conclusions are subject to plenary review.in re prudential ins.of am.sales practice,cir.we review the district court determination of adequacy of representation as an exercise of its discretionary authority in class action proceedings for abuse of discretion.in re prudential ins.of am.sales practices,cir.all underlying factual issues are reviewed for clear error.id.
iii.due process protections for class members 
in all three appeals before us,appellants argue that they are not bound by the settlement agreement because their due process rights were not upheld,either because of inadequate notice or inadequate representation.a threshold question in all three of these appeals is whether these appellants are entitled to bring a collateral attack on the settlement agreement.
a class member must have certain due process protections in order to be bound by a class settlement agreement.the general principle is that there has been a failure of due process only in those cases where it can not be said that the procedure adopted,fairly insures the protection of the interests of absent parties who are to be bound by it.hansberry lee.in a class where opt out rights are afforded,these protections are adequate representation by the class representatives,notice of the class proceedings,and the opportunity to be heard and participate in the class proceedings.phillips petroleum shutts,d.the adequate representation requirement serves to uncover conflicts of interest between named parties and the class they seek to represent.amchem products,windsor,d.this requirement is codified in.a,which requires that the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.
there must be a process by which an individual class member or group of class members can challenge whether these due process protections were afforded to them.grimes vitalink comm ns,cir.this challenge can take the form of an appeal of the class certification itself,a collateral attack on an class,or a rule b motion.in re real estate title settlement servs.antitrust,cir.
class members are not,however,entitled to unlimited attacks on the class settlement.once a court has decided that the due process protections did occur for a particular class member or group of class members,the issue may not be relitigated.appellants understandably rely heavily on stephenson dow chemical,cir,aff by equally divided court,d,in support of their insistence that they have a right to collaterally attack the adequacy of representation determination of the class action court.while stephenson supports appellant position on this issue,it is inconsistent with circuit case law by which this panel is bound.in carlough amchem products,cir,we held that notice and failure to exercise an opportunity to opt out constitutes consent to the jurisdiction of the class action court by an absent member of a plaintiff class even when that member lacks minimum contact with the class action forum.then,in grimes vitalink communications,cir,we further held that,where the class action court has jurisdiction over an absent member of a plaintiff class and it litigates and determines the adequacy of the representation of that member,the member is foreclosed from later relitigating that issue.thus,it follows that challenges to the terms of a settlement agreement,itself,are not appropriate for collateral review.see in re orthopedic bone screw products liab,cir holding that a challenge to the propriety of the settlement agreement and its terms is foreclosed by the approval of the settlement agreement in a final,unappealable order.
iv.current challenges to the settlement agreement 
the appeals before this court are from three pretrial orders of the district court,all addressing variations on the same situation.pretrial order appeals docketed at and was the denial of a motion made after settlement by appellants,all of whom were downstream opt outs,arguing that their due process rights were violated by inadequate representation at settlement.pretrial order appeal docketed at was the denial of a motion made after settlement by appellants,all of whom had ph,a condition not covered by the settlement,arguing that their due process rights were violated by inadequate representation at settlement pretrial order appeal docketed at was the grant of a motion by wyeth to enjoin appellants,who were not diagnosed by the settlement deadline,from bringing suit in new york to challenge the adequacy of their notice and representation at settlement.
applying due process protections to the facts of each set of appellants,we find that they have
