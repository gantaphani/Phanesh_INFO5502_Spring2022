this is an appeal of a decision granting summary judgment in a product liability action arising out of a tragic swimming pool accident.jennifer sheehan is a resident of rhode island.the north american marketing namco and delair group,llc,are a seller and manufacturer,respectively,of swimming pools.jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship.
sheehan suffered a catastrophic injury in when she broke her neck attempting to dive into a shallow,pool.as a result of the accident,she was rendered a quadriplegic.she brought suit for negligence,strict liability,breach of express warranty,and breach of implied warranty,alleging in substance that the design of the pool was defective.the district court granted summary judgment on the grounds that sheehan assumed the risk of serious injury when she attempted the dive and that her proof of proximate cause was unduly speculative.while we are less certain as to the causation issue,we find that the assumption of risk defense applies as a matter of law.we accordingly affirm.
background 
events prior to the injury 
on august,at about,sheehan and marvin nadiger drove to the islander restaurant in warwick,rhode island.sheehan was then years old.at the restaurant,the two shared a scorpion bowl,a drink made with fruit juice and alcohol.after leaving the restaurant,they drove to the oakland beach club in warwick,where sheehan drank two or three beers and had one or two shots of tequila.they then drove to nadiger home in warwick,arriving at approximately not long after arriving,nadiger,sheehan,and nadiger three children decided to go swimming in the pool located in his backyard.
b.the structure of the pool 
the swimming pool was an johnny weismuller safari model manufactured by delair and sold by namco it was feet in diameter and four feet high.at the time of the incident,the pool was filled with about three and feet of water.a ladder over the edge of the pool was used for entry and exit.there was no decking or other platform next to the pool.
the top perimeter of the pool was covered by a piece known as a coping.the coping was made of flat extruded aluminum with ridges or grooves on its surface.it was approximately six and inches wide inches wide.its function was to connect the pieces of the pool wall and prevent damage to the top surface of the wall.
it is undisputed that the coping was not intended to be stood upon or used for diving.
c.the warning labels 
the pool contained at least four relevant warning labels.
first,there was a warning sign on the coping where the ladder entered the pool.that sign stated danger in bold red capital letters against a white background.that was followed by the words no may cause death or permanent injury.those words were in bold black capital letters.there was also a pictogram showing a person striking his head on the bottom of the pool,with red lines suggesting an injury to the neck the drawing was in a red circle with a red diagonal slash across it.
second,there was a sign stating water on the inside portion of the coping above the waterline,visible to persons within the pool.the warning faced the inside of the pool,approximately of the way around the circumference from the ladder.the sign on the coping was approximately inches high in bold red capital letters against a white background.
third,there was an identical sign stating water approximately of the way around the pool from the ladder.
fourth,on each of the three ladder treads on the outside of the pool,there was an embossed sign that stated not dive or jump in capital letters.
sheehan testified that she did not read the warnings,but even if she had,she would have dived anyway.
d.the injury 
sheehan used the ladder when she first entered the water,and several times after that to help the children out of the pool while playing with the children,but before attempting her first dive,sheehan noticed that the thin metal coping around the top edge of the pool was springy,but it was sturdy either.it was kind of loose.
after playing in the pool for about thirty minutes,sheehan hoisted herself up into a sitting position and then to a standing position on the coping.she stood on the coping for about twenty seconds and then performed a shallow dive,during which she intentionally aimed across the pool and not down.sheehan testified that she was aware that diving into shallow water could be dangerous because she could hit her head on the bottom of the pool.however,she also testified that the only danger she thought she was facing was that she could get scraped on the bottom of the pool,and that she had never heard of anyone getting hurt from diving into shallow water.
sheehan successfully executed her first dive without injury.she came up out of the water in front of nadiger,who was in the pool.according to nadiger,at that point he said,ca you read you ca dive,and pointed to the warning on the side of the pool.he testified that both of them then laughed 
sheehan then climbed onto the same part of the coping to attempt a second dive.she again pulled herself up into a sitting and then a standing position on the coping.after standing on the coping for about ten seconds,she attempted to perform a shallow dive.as she was attempting to dive,she lost her balance and entered the pool at a steep angle,described by witnesses as a jackknife.she struck her head on the bottom of the pool,which caused her to suffer a burst fracture of the vertebra.the injury rendered her a quadriplegic.
sheehan testified that she did not know what caused her to lose her balance or how she slipped during her second dive i do know.i just lost my balance and slipped.she does not know where her arms and feet were positioned before and during her second dive,nor does she know how she entered the pool during her second dive.she could only recall looking at her feet as she stood on the coping and then entering the water.
sheehan level,which was taken at the hospital when she arrived later that evening,was.according to the report of the toxicologist,her level at the time of the injury was likely even higher,between and.individuals with this level typically show outward signs of,a staggered gait,impaired vision,and decreased reaction sheehan herself denied feeling any impairment from the alcohol while diving.
expert evidence 
all parties submitted expert reports in support of their positions in the summary judgment proceedings.there is no dispute that sheehan injuries were caused by the top of her head striking the bottom of the pool.one of sheehan experts suggested that the injury could have been avoided if she had successfully performed her second dive in the same manner as the first dive sheehan also offered evidence to support her allegation that the coping was defective in its design and was the proximate cause of her injury.
her engineering expert,gaston raffaelli,opined that the coping was defective because it was unstable and narrow.he stated that it was foreseeable that pool users would use the narrow coping as a resting place and that swimmers would easily hoist themselves onto it because it was only a few inches above the water.he further opined that it was foreseeable that pool users would stand on the coping and the pool by either jumping or diving into it.he also stated that the presence of the narrow and unstable coping was a danger to pool users because they could lose their balance and topple into the pool in an uncontrolled manner.in raffaelli opinion,sheehan injury would have been avoided had the defendants designed the pool in a way to prevent pool users from standing on the coping.he suggested that this could have been accomplished by installing a design modification,such as a cap,that would prevent users from accessing the coping of the pool.
her aquatic safety expert,thomas ebro,expressed a similar opinion he opined that the narrow and unstable nature of the coping was inherently dangerous because pool users could easily stand on top of it,thereby subjecting them to the risk of losing their balance and falling into or out of the pool.he also suggested that the manufacturer should have incorporated a rounded cap over the coping to prevent pool users from standing on or obtaining access to it.he stated that,in his opinion,had the defendants incorporated such a design,sheehan injuries would have been avoided.
f.the district court ruling and the appeal 
on april,the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on all counts.it held that as a matter of law sheehan assumed the risk of her injury when she decided to dive from the coping into the shallow water of an pool.on that basis,the court dismissed the negligence and strict liability claims.
as to the breach of implied warranty claim,the court held that sheehan could not establish that the allegedly defective design of the pool was the proximate cause of her injury it concluded that because she could not recall how she entered the pool,her expert testimony was based upon speculation and conjecture 
sheehan now appeals that decision.she contends that the district court erroneously concluded that the expert evidence as to the proximate cause of her injuries was based on improper speculation failed to recognize that a legitimate question of fact existed as to whether she fully appreciated and understood the risk of sustaining a serious injury and failed to consider her intoxicated state as a relevant factor under the assumption of the risk doctrine.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see triangle trading,robroy indus,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.we view the record in the light most favorable to the party and resolve all reasonable inferences in its favor,without weighing the evidence or evaluating the credibility of the witnesses.see clifford barnhart,cir.the district court decision may be upheld even if we reject its rationale,provided that we find independently sufficient grounds in the record.id.
nature of the alleged design defects 
in a products liability action under rhode island law,the plaintiff must prove the following five elements that there was a defect in the design or construction of the product that the defect existed at the time the product left the hands of the defendant that the defect rendered the product unreasonably dangerous that the product was being used in a way in which it was intended at the time of the accident and that the defect was the proximate cause of the accident and the plaintiff injuries.jodoin toyota motor,cir citing raimbeault takeuchi,a d,
sheehan alleges three different types of design defects.first,she contends that the coping was too narrow,which caused her to lose her balance when she stood on it to dive.second,she contends that the coping was unstable,which also contributed to her loss of balance.third,she contends that the coping design tempted her to climb on it to dive,and that it should have been designed so that it would have been difficult or impossible to stand on it at all 
proximate causation 
the first issue is whether sheehan produced sufficient evidence of causation to survive summary judgment.as noted,under rhode island law,a plaintiff must prove,among other things,that any design defect was the proximate cause of her injuries.raimbeault,at thomas amway,causation may be shown by direct or circumstantial evidence,but inferences drawn from circumstantial evidence may not rely upon mere conjecture or speculation to establish essential elements of the claim.thomas,at.
the basic facts as to causation are undisputed,if somewhat incomplete.sheehan,who had been drinking,decided to dive from the coping of a shallow,pool into three and feet of water.after completing a successful shallow dive without injuring herself,she climbed back onto the coping for the purpose of executing a second dive.she stood on the coping for about ten seconds.she then lost her balance and slipped.sheehan said she was preparing to make a dive but can not testify as to whether she started the dive or not.she fell into the pool at an angle that witnesses described as a jackknife and hit her head on the bottom of the pool.both of sheehan experts opined that she lost her balance because the coping was narrow and unstable.
the district court reasoned that sheehan inability to recall how she entered the pool precluded her from establishing proximate causation.in the absence of any additional evidence,sheehan arguably can not show that had the coping been less narrow or unstable she would not have fallen.a number of other possible factors,alone or in combination,may have caused her to lose her balance even on a better coping,including intoxication,momentary clumsiness,or the fact that the coping was wet and slippery.
we think it is a close call whether sheehan causation evidence is sufficient to survive summary judgment.an alleged defect in a product need not be the only cause of harm to the plaintiff liability may be found where the defect is a substantial factor in bringing about the harm.see restatement second of torts see also hueston narragansett tennis club,holding that proximate cause need not be the sole and only cause.it is uncontested that sheehan lost her balance and that the coping was narrower than the length of a normal adult foot.common sense and ordinary experience would suggest that it is more difficult to maintain one balance on a narrow surface,or to regain balance on such a surface once it has been lost.similarly,although the evidence of the coping alleged unsteadiness was thin,perhaps a reasonable jury could infer from sheehan observation that the coping was kind of loose that instability was a substantial factor in causing her to fall into the pool.
even if we were confident that sheehan can not show that the coping instability or narrowness caused her fall,she has in any event pleaded an alternate theory of design defect the coping should have been designed to prevent anyone from standing on it.her engineering expert opined that the manufacturer should have considered an alternative design that included a curved cap,rather than a flat surface.sheehan argues that but for the tempting invitation to dive into the pool presented by the flat coping,she would not have been in a position to injure herself.this theory has the virtue of sidestepping the proximate cause issue raised by her inability to recall exactly how she came to enter the water.the jury would not need to speculate about the cause of the accident,as the lack of a rounded cap could be a substantial factor in causing sheehan injury regardless of how she fell.
but the tempting invitation theory is not without its own pitfalls.as noted above,sheehan claims of design defect are apparently inconsistent a rounded cap would be a narrower and perhaps more unstable diving platform than a flat coping.it might present less of a temptation to dive but render diving more dangerous for those who attempt it.to succeed on her claim of design defect,sheehan would need to show that the absence of a rounded cap rendered the pool unreasonably dangerous,see raimbeault,at we are skeptical,given the evidence she has so far produced,that she could succeed.
the proximate causation issue in this case is thus very close,especially when coupled with the tempting invitation theory.rather than deciding these difficult questions,we find that sheehan claim should be resolved on the grounds of assumption of the risk.
assumption of the risk 
assumption of the risk is an affirmative defense in a products liability action in rhode island.mignone fieldcrest mills,rickey boden,a plaintiff assumes the risk of injury when she knowingly accepts a dangerous situation.kennedy providence hockey club.in order to establish an defense,defendants must prove that the plaintiff knew of the existence of the danger,appreciated its unreasonable character,and voluntarily exposed herself to it.martins omega,drew,at rickey,at.the standard is ordinarily subjective,and is based upon what the particular individual in fact saw,knew,understood,and appreciated.id.the district court held that namco and
