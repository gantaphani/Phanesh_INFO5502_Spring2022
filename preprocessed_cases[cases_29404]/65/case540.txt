introduction 
in this appeal,the survivors of a railroad worker seek to overturn a judgment dismissing their state tort claims against locomotive manufacturer vapor corporation vapor for injuries.the dismissal followed the trial court sustaining vapor demurrer without leave to amend,on the grounds of federal preemption under the locomotive boiler inspection act et hereafter bia,as discussed in scheiding general motors cal th,d,cert.den,d scheiding.
in scheiding,supra,cal th at pages,d,the california supreme court,relying on the seminal case of napier atlantic coast line.napier,held the bia preempts railroad employees state law actions against manufacturers of locomotives containing asbestos materials,because congress intended the federal government to occupy the field of locomotive safety,including the design,the construction,and the material of every part of the locomotive and tender and of all appurtenances.napier,supra,at.scheiding,supra,cal th at,d.plaintiffs maintain that scheiding is not dispositive authority in the instant case because it did not address the preemptive scope of the bia with respect to asbestos exposure occurring during repairs,when the trains are not in use.
we conclude scheiding forecloses state tort claims against locomotive manufacturers for defective design of their product,regardless of whether a locomotive is in use or off line in roundhouses or repair shops.accordingly,we affirm the judgment.
ii.factual and procedural background 
decedent enio frastaci worked as a locomotive repairman for the wheeling and lake erie railroad from through.his father worked as a boilerman and a lineman for the nickel plate railroad,the predecessor of the wheeling and lake erie railroad,from approximately to.at some point,decedent was diagnosed with mesothelioma,an cancer of the outer lung lining.he died of the disease on september.on march,decedent wife and children brought a wrongful death and survival action against numerous defendants,seeking compensation for his asbestos injuries and his wife loss of consortium,as well as punitive damages.the plaintiffs allege that decedent sustained both direct and secondary exposure to asbestos.
the complaint categorizes the defendants in two classes defendants,which made or distributed the products and premises defendants,which include various railroad companies that controlled the property where decedent his father was exposed to products.the complaint alleges various causes of action against vapor,including negligence,strict liability,and false representation.additionally,the complaint alleges causes of action against the railroad companies for violations of the federal employers liability act et hereafter fela and the bia.
vapor filed a demurrer to the complaint on the grounds that the bia preempted the state tort claims and that the complaint failed to identify any product attributable to vapor.after several rounds of supplemental briefing and multiple hearings,the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,on preemption grounds.the trial court denied plaintiffs motion for a new trial and this appeal followed.
iii.discussion 
preemption principles 
one of the primary goals of preemption is uniformity.the supremacy clause,art.vi,empowers congress to create uniform national rules by supplanting state regulation.the doctrine of federal preemption is designed to prevent states from impinging on federal law and policy.cipollone liggett group,d law general motors cir,law.
federal preemption fundamentally is a question of congressional intent.english general electric,d.congress intent may be explicitly stated in the statute language or implicitly contained in its structure and purpose.citation.in the absence of an express congressional command,state law is if that law actually conflicts with federal law,citation,or if federal law so thoroughly occupies a legislative field as to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for the states to supplement it.citations.cipollone liggett group,supra,at.federal statutes that occupy a field serve to preempt both state statutory enactments and state common law torts remedies,as a damages award can act as a potent method of governing conduct and controlling policy.san diego unions garmon,d.
given the importance of federalism in our constitutional structure,however,we entertain a strong presumption that federal statutes do not preempt state laws particularly those laws directed at health and safety traditionally governed by the states.csx,easterwood,d thus,will not lie unless it is the clear and manifest purpose of congress.id.quoting rice santa fe elevator.law,supra,at.
it has long been settled that congress intended federal law to occupy the field of locomotive equipment and safety,particularly as it relates to injuries suffered by railroad workers in the course of their employment.law,supra,at.
b.the bia and fela 
the fela holds railroad employers liable for the injury or death of railroad employees that results,in whole or in part,from the railroad negligence or that of its agents.crane cedar rapids,d.enacted in,the bia,together with the related safety appliance acts et hereafter saa are regarded as amendments to the fela urie thompson.fontaine national passenger th,d fontaine.the bia supplements the fela to provide additional public protection and facilitate employee recovery.citations.the bia is to be considered together with other federal railroad safety laws,and is to be construed liberally to carry out their remedial and humanitarian purposes.citation.the fela and the bia further their humanitarian goals by imposing different types of liability.liability under the fela is premised on the railroad negligence,however small.citations.fontaine,supra,th at,d,quoting king southern pacific transp.cir,fn.in contrast,the bia imposes an absolute duty on railroad carriers to ensure their locomotives are properly maintained and safe to operate.fontaine,supra,th at,d see matson burlington northern santa fe cir.
the fela allows recovery in a broad range of situations,while liability under the bia only occurs under narrow circumstances citation.fontaine,supra,th at,d.specifically,the bia states a railroad carrier may use or allow to be used a locomotive or tender on its railroad line only when the locomotive or tender and its parts and appurtenances are in proper condition and safe to operate without unnecessary danger of personal injury have been inspected as required under this chapter and regulations prescribed by the secretary of transportation under this chapter and can withstand every test prescribed by the secretary under this chapter,italics added.a rail carrier can therefore be held liable under the bia by either failing to keep its locomotives and appurtenances in proper condition and safe to operate without unnecessary peril to life and limb or violating a federal railroad administration fra regulation.see mcginn burlington northern cir.however,claims that can not be maintained under the bia are often actionable under the fela.fontaine,supra,th at,d.
c.the bia preempts plaintiffs state tort claims 
over years ago,the united states supreme court,in napier,supra,specifically addressed the scope and effect of the bia,concluding it occupies the field of locomotive equipment,preempting all state claims within that field id.at.napier involved challenges to two state statutes that required all trains operating in the state to have an automatic fire door and a locomotive cab curtain.id.at.the supreme court invalidated the statutes,holding that the bia precluded states from imposing additional requirements for locomotive equipment.id.at.in so holding,the court noted that congress had not legislated,nor had the interstate commerce commission icc,which had been given the power to regulate the entire locomotive and tender and all parts and appurtenances thereof id.at,made any order requiring either a particular type of fire door or cab curtain id.at.the court further acknowledged that e ach device was prescribed by the state primarily to promote the health and comfort of engineers and firemen and therefore was a proper exercise of its police power id.at.nevertheless,the court reasoned that the power delegated to the icc by the bia as amended is a general one.it extends to the design,the construction,and the material of every part of the locomotive and tender and of all appurtenances.id.at.the federal and the state statutes are directed to the same equipment of locomotives.they operate upon the same object.the fact that the icc has not seen fit to exercise its authority to the full extent conferred,has no bearing upon the construction of the act delegating the power.id.at,italics added.
given the broad scope of the authority conferred upon the icc to regulate the design,construction,and material of every part of the locomotive,the napier court concluded the bia was intended to occupy the field and preempted the state laws.napier,supra,at.
the ninth circuit in law,supra,relying on napier,supra,articulated the reason for the bia broad preemptive reach.this broad preemptive sweep is necessary to maintain uniformity of railroad operating standards across state lines.locomotives are designed to travel long distances,with most railroad routes wending through interstate commerce.the virtue of uniform national regulation is locomotive companies need only concern themselves with one set of equipment regulations and need not be prepared to remove or add equipment as they travel from state to state.citations.law,supra,at.
law rejected the distinction that the bia speaks to railroad carriers and not to manufacturers.law,supra,at.the court reasoned that imposition of tort liability on manufacturers would affect the design,the construction,and the material of locomotives by forcing them to conform to design and construction standards imposed by the states.ibid.
law also rejected the contention that railroad workers would be without a remedy for their injuries were manufacturers held not liable for design defects.law,supra,at.the fela allows railroad workers to recover against their employers for all occupational injuries this remedy is strong medicine.fela authorizes recovery of compensatory pain and the employer negligence played any part,even the slightest,in producing the injury.citation,italics added.the unavailability of punitive damages under the fela does not permit states to supplement this exclusive remedy.citations.ibid.law further explains that disallowing tort actions against manufacturers would not decrease incentives on manufacturers to design and produce safe products as locomotive manufacturers already have every incentive to comply with federal standards.ibid.
in scheiding,supra,cal th,d,the california supreme court confirmed that the foregoing principles govern the viability of state law causes of action against locomotive manufacturers for the defective design of products containing asbestos.id.at,d.in affirming the judgment in favor of a defendant manufacturer on grounds of federal preemption,the supreme court quoted with approval the appellate court reasoning there is no doubt that the secretary of transportation has authority to regulate the design of the locomotive and could order the elimination of asbestos in locomotive components.imposing tort liability on railroad locomotive manufacturers clearly would affect the design,the construction,and the material of locomotives.law,supra,at,quoting napier,supra,at.this effect on interstate commerce would be both direct and substantial.english general electric,supra,at.as law explains,the imposition of tort liability on railroad equipment manufacturers would force them to conform to design and construction standards imposed by the states.this would transfer the regulatory locus from the secretary of transportation to the state result the bia was clearly intended to foreclose.citation.law,supra,at,fn.omitted.scheiding,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.
in discussing the continued vitality of napier as the controlling and dispositive authority on the preemptive scope of the bia,scheiding explains,t he bia can not remove the design,the construction,and the material of every part of the locomotive and tender and of all appurtenances from the purview of state regulation napier,supra,at.without concomitantly precluding tort actions premised on a defect in such design,construction,or material.any other result would place regulation of these requirements in the hands of state juries,thereby constraining the secretary of transportation regulatory authority and undermining the goal of uniformity.citations.scheiding,supra,cal th at,d.
questioning the premise that railroad workers health and safety are primarily concerns within the historic police powers of the state,scheiding declined to find the presumption against preemption applicable to the plaintiffs claims.scheiding,supra,cal th at,d.the court reasoned railroads have been subject to comprehensive federal regulation for nearly a century there is no comparable history of longstanding state regulation of the railroad industry.transportation union long island,d,fns.omitted.the statutory scheme,as construed by the courts and reaffirmed by congress,reflects that any historic state police powers must yield to this clear and manifest purpose.scheiding,supra,at,d.
scheiding also rejected the contention that the bia does not apply to locomotive manufacturers.this distinction between locomotive manufacturers and operators is without significance.the bia preempts any state action that would affect the design,the construction,and the material of locomotives.citation.imposing tort liability on railroad equipment manufacturers would do just that,by forcing them to conform to design and construction standards imposed by the states.this would transfer the regulatory locus from the secretary of transportation to the state result the bia clearly intended to foreclose.citation.citations.scheiding,supra,cal th at,d.
plaintiffs nevertheless argue that scheiding is not controlling and dispositive authority in the instant case because it specifically refrained from ruling on whether injuries that occurred while a locomotive is not in use are within the preemptive scope of the bia see scheiding,supra,cal th at,fn,d,refusing to consider argument not raised in appellate court.arguing against preemption,plaintiffs insist that the bia applies only to trains that are in use on the railroad lines and therefore does not govern redress for injuries that resulted from work on the equipment in roundhouses and repair shops.it is plaintiffs position that bia preemption should mirror its application and only apply when the locomotive is in use on the railroad line.
scant authority discussing the in use limitation the preemptive scope of the bia exists.what authority does exist suggests that the in use limitation is immaterial to a bia preemption analysis.for example,in seaman green industries,sup misc d,a new york trial court decision concerning multiple actions brought by railroad workers involving state torts claims for injuries,the court dismissed the actions as being preempted by the bia id.at.there,as here,the plaintiffs claimed the bia did not preempt their claims because the bia applied only to operating locomotives in use and not nonoperational locomotives being repaired or maintained.ibid.after discussing napier,the trial court concluded that it was irrelevant whether the plaintiff was exposed to asbestos from locomotives in use or,because a locomotive design,construction,parts and materials,which are regulated by the bia,are the same whether or not the locomotive is in use.id.at.likewise,in norfolk ry.bogle ohio app d,an appellate court decision from ohio,reversed on other grounds ohio,the court noted whether a locomotive is in a repair shop or moving interstate,the bia preempts state tort law quoting darby products,wl nonpub.opn.affd.ohio.
plaintiffs provide no authority to the contrary,but instead rely on cases brought under the fela,which require that a locomotive be in use at the time of the injury before the bia applies.see compton southern pacific d,compton see also pinkham maine cent.cir,angell chesapeake ry.cir,haworth burlington northern santa fe ry.d.however,courts have consistently recog
