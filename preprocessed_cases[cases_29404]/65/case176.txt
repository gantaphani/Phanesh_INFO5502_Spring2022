in this products liability action,plaintiffs and mississippi residents mabel and daryl mcdonal the mcdonals filed suit against various foreign and local manufacturers and distributors of thimerosal,the manufacturers of the vaccines which contained thimerosal,the doctors who administered the vaccines,and river oaks hospital.on appeal,the mcdonals challenge the district court denial of their motions for a remand to state court and the concomitant dismissal of their state law claims against both mississippi resident and nonresident defendants.at the outset,we consider the threshold inquiry of subject matter jurisdiction,on the basis of complete diversity of citizenship,in order to ascertain whether the district court erred in its application of the improper joinder doctrine we hold that the district court denial of the plaintiffs motion to remand was appropriate,consequently,for slightly different reasons than asserted by the district court,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
factual and procedural background 
the mcdonals,as the parents of jamielee hughes mcdonal jamielee,brought this action,on behalf of jamielee,who suffers from profound mercury poisoning.the mcdonals allege that jamielee poisoning was the result of her exposure to sizeable doses of mercury contained in a preservative,known as thimerosal,used in childhood vaccines.specifically,the mcdonals allege that through a normal regimen of early childhood vaccinations,jamielee built up a cumulative body burden of mercury nearly times the permissible limit authorized by the environmental protection agency.
on december,the mcdonals commenced an action in mississippi state trial court against various diverse and seeking to recover damages arising from jamielee poisoning.the complaint averred state law claims of strict liability,negligence,and breach of warranty against the manufacturers of vaccines collectively,the vaccine defendants and the manufacturers of thimerosal collectively,thimerosal defendants.the mcdonals also alleged a claim for medical malpractice,against the two mississippi physicians and the mississippi hospital collectively,healthcare defendants,predicated on a theory of failure to warn of the inherent dangers embedded in potential side effects stemming from vaccines and a failure to recommend vaccines.
on january,eli lilly and company eli lilly removed the action to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction pursuant to and federal question jurisdiction pursuant to.eli lilly removal petition contended that complete diversity existed on the basis that the resident healthcare defendants had been improperly joined.eli lilly also contended that a federal question existed because,under the national childhood vaccine act,et,vaccine act,the mcdonals were barred from bringing a action against the healthcare defendants until first filing a petition for relief in the united states court of federal claims vaccine court.
the mcdonals subsequently moved for a remand to state court asserting that the removal to federal court was procedurally defective based on the failure of all defendants to timely join in removal.the mcdonals also sought to remand on the grounds the vaccine act failed to present a sufficient federal question.eli lilly,opposing the remand motion,filed a motion to amend the removal petition to reflect consent to removal by two additional defendants,gdl international,gdl and spectrum chemical manufacturing spectrum 
on june,the district court granted eli lilly request to add gdl and spectrum to its petition for removal.nevertheless,the district court granted the mcdonals motion to remand on the grounds that neither diversity nor federal question jurisdiction existed.the district court rejected eli lilly improper joinder claim because,in the eyes of the district court,the mcdonals claims against the healthcare defendants possessed a reasonable probability of recovery.the district court also rejected eli lilly removal petition,under the complaint rule,on the grounds that an affirmative defense that raises a federal question is inadequate to confer federal jurisdiction.subsequently,based on relatively new legal developments which had not been squarely considered by the district court,the defendants filed a motion for reconsideration on the grounds that the vaccine court was the exclusive judicial venue charged with exercising jurisdiction over claims for alleged thimerosal related injuries.
on august,the district court granted the defendants reconsideration motion.the district court issued an order finding that the mcdonals claims are implicitly,and fall within the purview of the vaccine act hence,from the district court vantage point the resident healthcare defendants were improperly joined,and diversity jurisdiction existed,because no reasonable probability existed that the mcdonals claims against the resident healthcare defendants were cognizable without first exhausting those claims in the vaccine court prior to filing suit in state or federal court.
after finding subject matter jurisdiction proper,the district court then dismissed,sua sponte,the action as to all defendants on the same basis that it affirmatively exercised the vaccine act,the mcdonals claims against both the diverse and defendants must first be exhausted in the vaccine court prior to the mcdonals filing an action in state or federal court.on appeal,the mcdonals assert an error as to the propriety of the removal.
standard of review 
we review de novo both the district court order denying the mcdonals motion to remand and its decision that the parties were improperly joined.great plains trust morgan stanley dean witter,cir.
discussion 
on appeal,the mcdonals posit that the district court erred in failing to remand this action to state court because the failure of all defendants to timely consent to removal presented a clear procedural defect.in the alternative,the mcdonals contend that the district court erred in granting dismissal,pursuant to the vaccine act,for defendants that merely made preservatives instead of manufacturing or administering the vaccines themselves.at oral argument,the mcdonals presented for the first time a third and additional challenge,this time to the propriety of the removal.the mcdonals argued that under the common defense theory,a defense asserted by diverse and nondiverse defendants alike,prohibits a finding that the nondiverse party was improperly joined.our en banc court,has recently addressed the very issue of applying the doctrine of improper joinder in the context of when a common defense is mutually asserted by all of the defendants.see smallwood.cent,cir en banc.
we begin our analysis,as we must in a diversity case,by according priority to the requirement of subject matter jurisdiction.it matters not that the propriety of the diversity of citizenship was raised for the first time on appeal,because subject matter jurisdiction is and delimits the power of federal courts.ruhrgas ag marathon oil,d see also getty oil ins.of north america,cir stating that where a federal court proceeds in a matter without first establishing that the dispute is within the province of controversies assigned to it by the constitution and statute,the federal court poaches upon the territory of a coordinate judicial system,and its decisions,opinions,and orders are of no effect once a jurisdictional issue is raised,congress instructs a federal court that if at any time prior to final judgment,during a removal from state to federal court,it appears that the federal district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction,the case shall be remanded.c.as a threshold matter,therefore,we must first determine whether the district court had jurisdiction to consider this action,because if we find such power lacking,then the case must be remanded back to the state court from which it came.
the district court found that diversity jurisdiction existed here because the local healthcare defendants were improperly joined,and therefore,the district court refused to remand the action to state court.we recognize that the district court proceeded without the benefit of smallwood clarification of the improp
