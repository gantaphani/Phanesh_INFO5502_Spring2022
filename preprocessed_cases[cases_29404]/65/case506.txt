respondents edward and carol walton asserted claims for negligence and strict liability against appellant the william powell company powell,alleging that materials associated with valves made by powell injured edward walton.after the jury returned a verdict in the waltons favor,a judgment was entered awarding them in damages.we conclude that because edward walton injuries stemmed entirely from exposure to products for which powell is not liable,we must reverse.
relevant factual and procedural background 
pretrial proceedings 
beginning in the late,powell sold metal valves,together with asbestos gaskets and packing,to the united states navy.edward walton served in the united states navy from to.during two periods of his service walton repaired shipboard propulsion and heating systems,which used valves in conjunction with asbestos insulation and other items.after leaving the navy,walton operated a painting business that brought him into contact with products containing asbestos.in november,walton was diagnosed as suffering from lung cancer.
on november,the waltons filed their complaint for negligence and strict liability against powell and approximately other defendants the complaint alleged that edward walton lung cancer and related medical conditions resulted from his exposure to asbestos in connection with the defendants products.the waltons sought compensatory and punitive damages.
several defendants other than powell sought summary judgment on the waltons claims,contending that the pumps,valves,and other items they had provided to the navy did not,in fact,cause edward walton injuries.these motions relied in part on the component parts doctrine,which in some circumstances shields a component manufacturer from strict liability for a finished product that incorporates its component.taylor elliot turbomachinery.th,taylor.in addition,powell and other defendants joined in a motion in limine to exclude the waltons evidence on the basis of the doctrine.the trial court denied all but one of the motions for summary judgment and the in limine motion 
on february,at the commencement of jury selection,six defendants remained in the action,including powell.the next day,when the waltons made their opening statement to the jury,powell and a pump manufacturer were the only defendants in the action.by midtrial,powell was the sole defendant in the action.
at trial,evidence was presented that powell manufactured metal valves for a large number of military and nonmilitary applications.the valves were of many types,and employed a variety of gaskets,some of which contained no asbestos.although some of the valves used asbestos gaskets and packing,powell made only the valves.the navy was among powell customers for these valves.from the late to,powell provided asbestos gaskets and packing from other manufacturers with its valves in addition,powell sold replacement asbestos gaskets and packing,but received relatively few orders because the end users preferred to order directly from gasket and packing manufacturers,who sold the same items at lower prices.no warnings about asbestos were placed on the valves.according to powell,it first became aware of the hazards of asbestos in the,and began phasing out the use of asbestos in its products in.
edward walton testified as follows he enlisted in the navy in,and served as deckhand prior to,when he began working as a welder and metal smith.from to,and from to,walton repaired shipboard heating and propulsion systems.during these periods,he served aboard destroyer tenders,vessels that provided maintenance services for destroyers.the shipboard systems on the destroyers that he serviced used asbestos insulation and other items.among his tasks was the maintenance of valves and pumps below deck in the engine and fire rooms,where the boilers and turbines were located.the valves and pumps were supplied by several manufacturers.he first encountered a powell valve after june.
in working on a valve,walton removed asbestos insulation from the valve exterior,removed the asbestos gaskets if any that sealed the valve to adjoining pipes,extracted asbestos packing from the valve interior,and installed new asbestos packing and gaskets,as needed.the gaskets were often cut from sheets of asbestos,and the packing was fashioned from rolls of replacement packing.walton also encountered asbestos insulation and gaskets when he worked on pumps.during these activities,the air that walton breathed became dirty and dusty.he removed asbestos insulation from powell valves numerous times,many,many times,but saw no warnings about asbestos on the valves.
walton attributed none of the asbestos products he contacted to powell.he testified that he often serviced valves in destroyers built during or before world war ii,and worked only on old valves with many coats of paint.walton believed that the valves original gaskets and packing had been replaced before he worked on them according to walton,most of the replacement packing and gaskets came from a source other than powell,and he otherwise could not specify their sources.he knew neither the manufacturer of the valves insulation nor the number of times that the insulation had been replaced.
walton left the navy in and operated a painting company until.as a painter,he worked with sheetrock,textured ceilings,and taping mud.in late,he was diagnosed as suffering from lung cancer.
edwin crosby holstein,a specialist in diseases,and arnold brody,a cell biologist and experimental pathologist,testified regarding edward walton medical condition and its causes.holstein opined that walton exposure to asbestos in connection with powell valves was a significant contributing cause of walton lung cancer brody testified that walton history of and medical conditions were sufficient to establish that asbestos caused his lung cancer 
verdict and judgment 
the jury found that edward walton had suffered in economic damages and in noneconomic damages,and allocated powell a percent share of the responsibility for the causation of these damages in addition,the jury found that powell had acted with malice,oppression,or fraud,but awarded no punitive damages.on march,a judgment was entered in favor of the waltons awarding damages totaling the trial court later denied powell motions for a new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict.this appeal followed.
discussion 
powell contends that the waltons claims for strict liability and negligence fail because its valves were not defective and caused no injury to edward walton we agree.as explained below,powell supplied none of the asbestos products to which edward walton was exposed,and its valves had no defect rendering powell liable for the injuries that walton may have sustained through exposure to asbestos products from other sources.
generally,in a products liability case,a plaintiff may seek recovery on theories of strict liability and negligence.merrill navegar,cal th.u nder either a negligence or a strict liability theory of products liability,to recover from a manufacturer,a plaintiff must prove that a defect caused injury.citations.under a negligence theory,a plaintiff must also prove an additional element,namely,that the defect in the product was due to negligence of the defendant.id.at,quoting prosser,strict liability to the consumer hastings.here,the waltons sought recovery on theories of strict liability and negligence,asserting that powell valves lacked adequate warnings about the hazards of asbestos and were otherwise defective in their design.
strict liability 
governing principles 
we begin with the waltons claims based on strict liability.california law provides generally that manufacturers,retailers,and others in the marketing chain of a product are strictly liable in tort for personal injuries caused by a defective product.peterson superior court cal th.however,strict liability is not imposed on parties that are not a part of the manufacturing or marketing enterprise of the allegedly defective product that caused the injury in question.ibid.the burden falls upon the plaintiff to produce adequate evidence linking the product with a particular entity in the stream of commerce of that product.taylor,supra,th at.recovery is permitted in strict liability for three kinds of defects manufacturing defects,design defects,and warning defects,inadequate warnings or failures to warn.anderson fiberglas cal d.
pertinent to our inquiry is the component parts doctrine,which in some circumstances exempts a manufacturer from liability arising from a finished product that incorporates a component supplied by the manufacturer.taylor,supra,th at.generally,a component manufacturer is subject to liability only when the component itself has a defect that results in injury,or the manufacturer plays a material role in integrating the component into the finished product,whose defects cause injury.rest d torts,products liability,
two policy considerations underlie the component parts doctrine.first,requiring suppliers of component parts to ensure the safety of their materials as used in other entities finished products would require suppliers to retain an expert in the client field of business to determine whether the client intends to develop a safe product.citation.suppliers of products that have multiple industrial uses should not be forced to retain experts in a huge variety of areas in order to determine the possible risks associated with each potential use.citation.a second,related rationale is that finished product manufacturers know exactly what they intend to do with a component or raw material and therefore are in a better position to guarantee that the component or raw material is suitable for their particular applications.citations.taylor,supra,th at,quoting springmeyer ford moter th.
no strict liability 
the waltons strict liability claim relies on allegations that powell valves suffered from warning and design defects.for the reasons explained below,the claim fails under each theory.
no duty to warn 
at trial,the waltons asserted that powell valves were defective because they incorporated no warning regarding the hazards of asbestos packing,gaskets,and insulation.generally speaking,manufacturers have a duty to warn consumers about the hazards inherent in their products.citation.the requirement purpose is to inform consumers about a product hazards and faults of which they are unaware,so that they can refrain from using the product altogether or evade the danger by careful use.johnson american standard,cal th.a product that is otherwise flawless in its design and manufacture may nevertheless possess such risks to the user without a suitable warning that it becomes defective simply by the absence of a warning.finn searle cal d.
in taylor,on facts materially similar to those before us,the appellate court held that a strict liability claim predicated on a warning defect failed as a matter of law.taylor,supra,at.there,the widow of a navy seaman sued several valve and pump manufacturers,alleging that they were responsible for her husband injuries.id.at.the defendants had supplied valves and pumps,along with asbestos gaskets and packing,to the navy in the.ibid.the plaintiff asserted negligence and strict liability claims based on the theory that the defendants had a duty to issue a warning regarding the hazards of asbestos.id.at.in seeking summary judgment on the claims,the defendants established that they had manufactured only the valves and pumps they had supplied the navy that the husband enlisted in and that he had repaired valves and pumps whose original packing and gaskets had been replaced by items from other manufacturers.id.at.
the appellate court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in the defendants favor,concluding that the plaintiff duty to warn strict liability claim failed for three reasons.taylor,supra,at.first,as the court noted,the defendants were not part of the chain of distribution of the products,as the husband had no contact with any products that the defendants had provided.id.at.second,following an examination of california law,the court determined that the defendants had no duty to issue warnings regarding the hazards of asbestos released from products made or supplied by other manufacturers and used in conjunction with the defendants equipment.id.at.third,the court concluded that the component parts doctrine shielded the defendants from liability,as there was no evidence that their valves and pumps were themselves defective or that the defendants played a material role in the design of the shipboard systems.id.at.although the defendants had provided valves and pumps in accordance with the navy specifications,the court reasoned that this conduct was insufficient to support strict liability,pointing to the restatement third of torts,which states a component seller who simply designs a component to its buyer specifications,and does not substantially participate in the integration of the component into the design of the product,is not liable rest d torts,products liability,com.
we conclude that the waltons strict liability claim based on the duty to warn fails for the same reasons.to begin,the waltons did not establish that powell was part of the chain of distribution of the asbestos products that contributed to edward walton injuries.nothing before us supports the inference that edward walton had any contact with asbestos products supplied by powell 
there is no evidence that powell ever provided the type of insulation covering the valves that walton repaired.nor does the record support a reasonable inference that powell supplied either the packing and gaskets that walton removed from the valves or their replacements.on these matters,walton testified that he first worked on a powell valve no earlier than june that many of the ships whose valves he serviced were built during or before world war ii that all the valves he encountered were old,as evidenced by their many coats of paint and that the original packing and gaskets had probably been many he worked on the valves.he also stated that a manufacturer other than powell provided most of the new packing,and that he did not know whether powell had supplied any of the replacement gaskets or packing.there is no evidence that the navy ever bought replacements from powell the only evidence suggested that the navy did not,as powell received relatively few orders for replacements due to its high prices.
on this record,any inference that walton was exposed to asbestos from products supplied by powell is speculation.because the waltons failed to link the product with powell in the stream of commerce of that product,powell original provision of asbestos packing and gaskets to the navy did not render it strictly liable for walton injuries.taylor,supra,th at cadlo,th,former supplier of asbestos insulation to navy was not strictly liable for seaman injuries from exposure to asbestos insulation,as there was no evidence that former supplier had role in the design and marketing of asbestos insulation to which seaman was actually exposed.
nor was powell subject to a duty to warn because its valves were used in combination with the products to which walton was exposed.as explained in taylor,the employment of a nondefective component in an shipboard propulsion or heating system is not,by itself,sufficient to trigger the duty to warn the plaintiff must show that component manufacturer participated in the integration of the component into the design of the system.taylor,supra,th at.the waltons made no such showing.the record discloses only that the navy,in ordering the valves from powell,specified that the valves must have a certain type of flange or fitting for gaskets that powell provided valves with the specified flange and that powell also supplied the navy with technical documents and instruction manuals regarding the valves they provided.as these facts do not show that powell participated in the design of the navy systems or the system components provided by other manufacturers,they do not establish a duty to warn.id.at see also blackwell phelps dodge d,acid manufacturer had no duty to warn about dangers of pressure formation from acid when manufacturer lacked control over shipping arrangements,and placed the acid as ordered in defective tank cars provide
