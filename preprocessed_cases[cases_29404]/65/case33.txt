in,frank gillespie was working as a locksmith after many years in various building trades.in september of that year,he asked his employer to let him keep its table saw at his house for work and personal use,and his employer agreed.the saw,which he received from coworker michael kane,had been designed and manufactured by emerson electric and sold by sears,roebuck under the craftsman brand.kane did not give gillespie the saw owner manual or its blade guard.
a standard table saw of the type used by gillespie has a flat rectangular metal surface through which a rotary saw blade protrudes the blade height and angle can be adjusted for different kinds of cuts.the wood to be cut is fed into the blade by sliding the wood over the saw table surface away from the user.for some cuts,the wood is kept in alignment by a metal guide called a rip fence on the saw surface to one side of the blade.behind the blade,there may also be affixed to the saw a spreader and blade guard as will be more fully described below.
on november,gillespie used the table saw to trim an inch off each side of a door.after finishing the cut,he shut off the saw and set the door down.six seconds after shutting off the saw gillespie turned and his hand came into contact with the blade before it had stopped.the blade lacerated several of his fingers his badly damaged right ring finger had to be amputated after several unsuccessful surgeries.
gillespie and his wife,deborah,brought suit in state court against emerson and sears collectively,emerson,who removed the case to district court.gillespie complaint,alleging that the accident was caused by defects in the saw design,asserted claims of negligence and breach of implied warranty of merchantability under massachusetts law his theories of defect concerned the design of the blade guard,lack of a brake for the wheel,and inadequate warning.gillespie wife claimed for loss of consortium.
trial was held in june,denying emerson motion for judgment as a matter of judge sent the case to the jury with a special interrogatory form asking seven questions whether emerson had breached the warranty of merchantability and this breach caused the accident whether emerson had been negligent and this negligence caused the accident whether gillespie was also negligent and if so the degree of fault attributable to each side the amount of damages due to gillespie and two questions pertaining to deborah loss of consortium and damages due to her.
during deliberations,the jury sent two notes asking the purpose of the comparative negligence allocation.the judge responded so far as is pertinent here that the allocation of a percentage of negligence to gillespie would reduce his recovery on the negligence claim by that percentage unless his share of negligence exceeded percent,in which case his recovery would be barred entirely.the response also noted that no deduction will be made on the breach of warranty claim.
shortly thereafter,the jury found that emerson breached its warranty of merchantability that emerson was negligent but that gillespie was percent contributorily negligent that gillespie had suffered in damages and his wife.following the verdict,emerson renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law,and in the alternative sought a new trial.the district court denied both requests,and entered judgment for the full.
emerson now appeals,asserting that there was insufficient evidence on the three defect theories to support the jury verdict.emerson also claims that the district court erred by refusing to instruct the jury on an unreasonable use defense to the breach of warranty claim.finally,emerson says that the district court erred in imposing sanctions on emerson and that these sanctions tainted the trial.
sufficiency of the evidence.in assessing the sufficiency of the evidence,the question for the court is whether,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,a rational jury could find in favor of the party who prevailed.dasilva am.brands,cir see also santos sunrise medical,cir in so doing,we do not consider the credibility of witnesses,resolve conflicts in testimony,or evaluate the weight of the evidence internal quotation marks omitted.our review of the district court denial of emerson motion for judgment as a matter of law is de novo.santos,at.
whether there was enough evidence depends upon what gillespie was required to prove.gillespie first claim was for negligence.massachusetts law,which controls this case,requires manufacturers to design and produce products with reasonable care to eliminate avoidable dangers arising from reasonably foreseeable uses of the product.cigna ins.oy saunatec,cir.manufacturers must guard against such dangers,colter,taking account of foreseeable carelessness on the part of the user,demedeiros koehring,cir.
in judging the adequacy of a product design,pertinent factors include 
the gravity of the danger posed by the challenged design,the likelihood that such danger would occur,the mechanical feasibility of a safer alternative design,the financial cost of an improved design,and the adverse consequences to the product and to the consumer that would result from an alternative design.
colter,at quoting back wickes,internal quotation marks omitted.an essential element of such a design flaw claim is that there be a safer alternative design.see kotler am.tobacco,cir,vacated on other grounds,d,and judgment reissued,cir see also uloth city tank.
massachusetts law also treats manufacturers and sellers as warranting that their products are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used.laws ch.c.in most substantive respects,unreasonably dangerous design,reasonably foreseeable dangers,alternative design feasibility,the negligence and warranty inquiries are congruent.oy saunatec,at back,at see also allen chance,
gillespie first theory of design defect focused on the design of the blade guard.on gillespie craftsman saw,as with most of the comparable table saws on the market,the kind of elongated plastic cap fitting over the top of the mounted on the spreader,a vertical metal plate directly behind the blade.the spreader is to be used for through cuts in which the blade cuts all the way through the wood thickness to cut it into two keeps the cut open after the wood passes behind the blade so that the two separated sides do not clamp back together onto the blade.
for certain cuts,the blade is partly lowered to cut only a groove in the wood,rather than cutting all the way through the wood thickness to produce two separate pieces.for such spreader must be removed because it would otherwise block the wood as it passed over the blade.gillespie main expert john orlowski testified that to conjoin the guard with the was removable and sometimes had to be users to take both off and then leave them off.orlowksi said that the safer alternative design was to attach the blade guard to a cantilevered arm mounted by a bracket attached to the edge of the table,thus allowing the guard to be used with or without the spreader.
at trial emerson introduced into evidence a cantilevered guard called the uniguard which emerson expert jack hyde,described as the standard example of that type of design.gillespie expert admitted that the cantilevered guard could not be used for all cuts.more important,former emerson that the uniguard could not have been used for the particular cut that gillespie was doing when he was injured,because the door could not have fit between the uniguard arm and the saw rip fence that keeps the wood aligned as it is being sawed.
hyde testimony on this point was not contradicted and it is fatal to gillespie theory of design defect.even if it were negligent or a breach of warranty to supply the guard rather than the less common cantilevered guard,gillespie can not prevail,as to this theory,without showing that the better design would have prevented his injury.see,solimene grauel,fidalgo columbus mckinnon.the cantilevered guard might be better much of the time but,if it could not have been used for the cut that injured gillespie,its omission was not the cause in fact of his injury.
hyde testimony was not quite conclusive.he said that the cut gillespie made could not have been done with the uniguard in place but he said nothing about other brands on the market.but the uniguard was dubbed standard and gillespie presented no other product to depict the better cantilevered guard.and absent rebuttal testimony,it would have been pure speculation for the jury to have supposed that some other model of cantilevered offered in evidence or have been used for the cut in question.see hyundai motor,cir 
hyde also said that emerson had previously tested cantilevered guards and found them less satisfactory than guards each type was compatible with some cuts but not all and,according to hyde,the cantilevered guard was more prone to block wood unexpectedly and so to cause unexpected twisting of the wood and possible injury.gillespie expert gave no direct answer to this testimony.given the lack of causation,however,we need not decide whether the jury could reasonably find the cantilevered guard superior.
gillespie second theory of defect was that the saw blade should have had a brake that would decrease its coasting time once the power was shut off.here,gillespie had two experts the thrust of their testimony was that the normal coasting time for the saw at to seconds after power be reduced to a couple of seconds by an automatic brake available for use on power equipment.this coasting time,gillespie claimed,constituted a foreseeable and unreasonable hazard that was compounded by the risks of removal of the guard and user inattention after the machine was switched off.
hyde said that he had tested such a brake for emerson in but found that the braking effect tended to loosen the arbor nut holding the blade to the shaft,creating separate dangers of its own also,hyde said that in he had tested for litigation purposes three brands of table saw equipped with brakes.the brakes did stop the blades in to seconds but one saw nut spun loose after nearly a thousand power cycles over the course of three hours.over a longer period,the other two saws nuts actually tightened.
much of the testimony of the dueling experts concerned the likelihood that the brakes would loosen the nuts and the consequences that would ensue if a nut did loosen.there was also conflicting testimony as to whether the emerson saw,lacking a brake,met relatively issued by american national standards institute as well as similar osha regulations.it appears that such brakes were once rarely sold with table saws but are becoming somewhat more common.
in principle,it appears that the braking action can increase the risk of loosening the nut,especially where the braking is severe but,as we read the testimony in this case,a jury could have concluded that a brake of moderate force should have been employed.such a brake could arguably have halted the saw in the to second range while leaving the torque which tightens the nut sufficiently great compared to the braking torque which loosens the nut to ensure an overall tightening effect and minimal risk of loosening.even in the to second range,gillespie expert said that the single failure in hyde test could have been caused by machine vibration or other causes unrelated to the brake.
emerson says on appeal that the brake was not needed if its guard was used,but the jury had adequate evidence that guards were often detached and that this was foreseeable.nor is there a causation problem the jury could also have found that gillespie turned back to the still spinning blade only six seconds after he switched the machine off.gillespie earlier versions of the accident timing might have made the brake causally irrelevant,but his final version,if believed,brought the accident into the time window where a potentially safe brake would have mattered.
the claim of design flaw was debatable.the use of a brake for table saws was relatively rare even at the time of trial.a brake lessened but did not eliminate coasting,and it could loosen the arbor nut,creating additional dangers.emerson had considered the balance of risks and benefits and consciously decided against adopting the brake for table saws.many would think this a defensible judgment.
nevertheless,gillespie offered two experts,one of whom made such brakes,both saying the judgment was wrong.at emerson behest we have reviewed their credentials and testimony and we can not say that they were unqualified to give their testimony.admittedly,hyde was peculiarly qualified to testify to the had been involved in emerson safety engineering and had done the testing in and he no less than the experts for gillespie had his own kind of in the outcome.the theory was for the jury to resolve.
gillespie final theory rested on the duty to warn adequately of foreseeable dangers,which is a legitimate theory for liability under both negligence,see slate bethlehem steel,and breach of warranty,see vassallo baxter healthcare,bavuso caterpillar.here,gillespie evidence was thin as to both causation and supposed inadequacy of the warning but it was perhaps just barely possible for a rational jury to find in gillespie favor on both points.
gillespie main theory appears to have been that the warning labels on the side of the machine should have been placed on the saw top surface and had better contrast and larger lettering.these warnings did advise users that the saw was dangerous and referred to the coasting danger at least indirectly by warning users to wait for the blade to stop before adjusting or servicing.hyde answered that a warning on the surface would be covered by the wood and eventually rubbed off.however,based on the testimony and depictions in the user manual,we think the jury could have concluded that the label coloring,contrast,size,and perhaps explicitness were inadequate.
causation would be lacking if the danger was obvious or otherwise known to the plaintiff.see bavuso,at colter,at.gillespie admitted that the blade was visible and audible,and that he understood that blades coasted,as any experienced user would assuredly know,see bavuso,at.the jury might have concluded from gillespie further he did consider the coasting he was not fully aware,morrell precise eng g,of the duration of the danger and that a more explicit or conspicuous warning would have heightened his awareness and prevented the accident.this is enough,although just barely so,to take the claim to the jury.
nevertheless,a new trial is required because the theory fails.in this circuit,the rule in civil cases is that a new trial is usually warranted if evidence is insufficient with respect to any one of multiple claims covered by a general verdict.kerkhof mci worldcom,cir see lattimore polaroid,cir.this rule applies not only to general verdicts encompassing multiple causes of action,but to special verdicts where a single verdict question encompasses multiple theories,one of which is defective.lattimore,at.
although not all circuits follow our practice it does accord with the supreme court precedents that require remand in civil cases when one of several claims or theories encompassed in a general verdict was flawed,because of a mistaken jury instruction.the only supreme court case squarely dealing with insufficient evidence on one theory,however,is a hundred years old,see wilmington star mining fulton,and the court follows the opposite rule in criminal cases where the evidence is adequate on one theory but not another the reality is that the degree of confidence that the jury picked a theory with adequate evidentiary support varies along a spectrum of situations.
our own approach is by no means rigid.recognizing that a jury is likely to prefer a better supported theory to one less supported,we have generously applied the harmless error concept to rescue verdicts where we could be reasonably sure that the jury in fact relied upon a theory with adequate evidentiary support.see davis rennie,cir,cert.denied,d brochu ortho pharm,cir.but in this case,none of the theories was strongly supported by the evidence this,indeed,illustrates the danger in automatically presuming that the jury adopted the stronger ground.
the uncertainty in this case could have been avoided if either side had pressed,and the district court had agreed,to have the jury decide specifically which theories succeeded and which failed.defendants may have an incentive not to ask for special verdicts,thus saving a ground for appeal if any theory was defective.but it is a mystery why the plaintiff would not request,or the judge insist upon,a breakdown by where one or more of the theories is at best a close call.
a few circuits have held,although inconstantly,that an appellant who did not request such special verdict has waived a claim of error that such a verdict form could have isolated this court has never adopted such a rule and has regularly vacated general verdicts where the award might have been rescued if either side had sought and obtained an adequate special verdict,see,lattimore,at levinsky,stores,cir fleet bank anchor media television,cir but recently we took note of several cases applying a waiver theory and said that we might consider adopting such a requirement,davis,at.
on balance,we conclude that we should not adopt a waiver rule.the term waiver is misleading either side in this case could have asked for the special verdict to further break down the negligence and warranty claims by theory of defect.the issue is one of policy,whether the court should create a rule that forfeits claims by an appellant that could have been isolated if either side had requested a better breakdown.the efficiency argument for such a rule is obvious but the objections are also real.
at first blush,it looks like mandating a special verdict would be easy but,as this case illustrates,there are multiple levels of detail.here,dividing by causes of action alone did not solve the problem a further division by theories of defect was required.and theories,unlike causes of action,are not formal categories derived from statutes or common law but are endlessly variable,depending upon the facts of the case.gillespie warning theory alone could itself have been subdivided in several ways content,placement,size and color.
in some cases special verdicts make sense but there may be others where using them,to a sufficient level of detail,is infeasible or otherwise undesirable.where feasible and desirable,one of the parties ordinarily has an incentive to ask for such a special verdict and,if no one does,the judge can insist.in sum,we think that a uniform obligation to ask for a special verdict,or have relevant claims of error forfeit by appellant,is not warranted.
some courts have treated the appellate consequences of general verdicts encompassing multiple claims or theories as a procedural issue to be determined by federal law even in a diversity case others have assumed usually without discussion that state law controlled our own tentative view is the former,see levinsky,at implicitly so assuming but anyway massachusetts follows the first circuit practice on this issue.see slate,at insufficient evidence on one claim.
accordingly,as the verdict may have rested solely on the blade guard theory,a new trial is required.because the evidence on the blade guard theory was inadequate on causation grounds and emerson was entitled to judgment on that issue,gillespie defect theories at the new trial are confined to the blade brake and inadequate warning claims of defect.see lattimore,at.
unreasonable use instruction.under massachusetts law,there is a comparative fault defense for negligence claims for warranty claims,the closest analogue is an unreasonable use defense.oy saunatec,at.unreasonable use provides a complete defense to warranty claims the plaintiff might still recover for negligence.see id.at.emerson sought an unreasonable use instruction but the district court declined to give it.emerson now claims that this was error.
a party is entitled to an instruction on a legally available defense if sufficient evidence is present to permit a jury to find in favor of the defense.sullivan football league,cir,cert.denied,d.under massachusetts law,the unreasonable use defense required emerson to prove that gillespie knew of the product defect and its danger,that he proceeded voluntarily and unreasonably to use the product and that,as a result,he was injured.allen,at see also correia firestone tire rubber.
there was surely enough evidence on the objective element of the defense,namely,unreasonable use.see allen,at.gillespie admittedly knew that table saws came with guards and knew that this machine had no guard attached.yet he made no effort to obtain and employ the guard the evidence showed that the guard for this saw had been taken off and remained with the coworker who transferred the saw to gillespie.the existing guard would apparently have worked for the cut that gillespie was attempting at the time of the accident and so would have prevented the accident.
whether the failure to use the guard was unreasonable under all the circumstances is perhaps a matter on which a jury could take different views,given that no guard was readily available to gillespie.the fact that the jury found gillespie percent negligent does not prove that it would have found the failure to use the guard unreasonable use no one knows what act the jury found negligent it could have been gillespie inattention.but a jury could rationally have found objectively unreasonable use if it wanted to do so.
the more difficult element of the defense concerns gillespie knowledge.under massachusetts law,it is not enough that the plaintiff be aware that the machine is dangerous rather,he must have a reasonably specific awareness both that the product is defective,velleca uniroyal tire,and the extent of the harm to which this exposes him.allen chance,cir see also goulet whitin mach.works.when the alleged unreasonable use is the failure to use a safety device,
plaintiff must at least have perceived that the safety device is standard equipment or regarded as necessary to safe operation,so that removing it or using the equipment without the device is dangerous.
downs gulf,quoted in allen,at.
here,gillespie admitted that he knew saws were sold in stores with blade guards on them and that he had seen one used with a blade guard on a home repair television show.based on these admissions,we think the jury could permissibly have inferred that he knew that guards were standard safety equipment,that their absence meant that something was wrong in a way that increased the risk of injury,and that as a matter of common sense working with a cutting tool with an unguarded blade could cause serious injury up to and beyond what gillespie suffered.
there is a.gillespie testified in detail that he never considered a blade guard on a blade and what it will do,had not seen one used except on television,did think he was taking a risk by using the blade without the guard,and even continued using the saw without the blade after the accident.such a view might,if actually held,negate the subjective awareness element of the defense as prescribed by massachusetts case law.
it can sometimes be irrational for a jury to reject uncontradicted testimony,at,especially about the witness state of mind but a jury may disbelieve uncontradicted testimony if it is improbable.see id.at see also eeoc,cir.the jury might have concluded that it is improbable that around power equipment and knowing that saws were sold with not have appreciated that the lack of a guard meant that something was wrong with the saw and that the absence of the guard increased the risk of serious injury.that gillespie chose to take the risk does not preclude knowledge of it.
further,gillespie had a strong financial interest in negating the unreasonable use defense in this case doing so doubled gillespie damages because his recovery on negligence alone would have been reduced by percent.the jury was free to consider gillespie and also that gillespie somewhat improbable testimony dovetailed rather neatly with the counter to a rather technical his lawyer may well have discussed with him.the jury surely did not have to accept gillespie gloss on his own thinking.
thus,the unreasonable use instruction should have been given.although the blade guard theory is not to be retried,we see no reason why
