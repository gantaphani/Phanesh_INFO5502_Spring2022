factual and procedural background 
pretrial and trial phases 
the whitlocks filed their complaint on february,naming foster wheeler as well as a host of other manufacturers and distributors of asbestos as defendant in their suit for damages arising from paul whitlock exposure to asbestos.in the complaint,paul states he is dying from mesothelioma,a lung disease related to exposure to asbestos.opening statements in the trial against foster wheeler and two other defendants were delivered on november.
the following facts were adduced at trial and on these the parties are not in dispute the kitty hawk was commissioned in april as the world first attack aircraft carrier.foster wheeler constructed the boilers for the ship.two of the components used in the construction of the boilers contained thermal block that was used as an insulating material and the high temperature gaskets used in the boiler pipes.in september,a major overhaul of the kitty hawk began at puget sound naval shipyard at bremerton,washington.paul whitlock joined the navy when he was years old and after attending boot camp he reported for duty aboard the uss kitty hawk on january,when it was still undergoing the overhaul in bremerton.he served as a boiler technician in boiler room of the kitty hawk until discharged from the navy in october.in december,paul was diagnosed with mesothelioma,a fatal cancer of the lining of the lungs,which is almost always attributable to exposure to asbestos.
the key fact on which the parties disagreed,however,was whether paul whitlock was exposed to any of the original foster wheeler asbestos in the boilers during his tour of service on the kitty hawk.the whitlock theory of the case against foster wheeler was that paul whitlock was exposed on three separate occasions to respirable asbestos fibers in the air during boiler repairs to the kitty hawk.these were during the kitty hawk overhaul at the bremerton naval shipyard in when the kitty hawk was docked at the naval air station at north island in san diego between june and november and after the kitty hawk returned from a tour of duty off vietnam in and returned for repairs to the long beach naval shipyard in california.foster wheeler theory of the case was that in the course of his duties aboard the kitty hawk paul whitlock may have moved asbestos insulation and cleaned up insulation and packing debris on a daily basis,but it was not insulation manufactured or supplied by foster wheeler in its boilers.
the whitlocks rested their case on december,on day of the jury trial.after moving some documents into evidence,foster wheeler,by then the sole remaining defendant,also rested without presentation of further evidence.foster wheeler then moved for nonsuit on several grounds,including that the evidence was insufficient to show that paul whitlock was exposed to an product which foster wheeler supplied to the kitty hawk.on the basis of evidence showing that the boilers had to be cleaned and repaired every hours of use,foster wheeler asserted that the whitlocks failed to show that the original insulation in the boilers was still in place when paul whitlock boarded the kitty hawk in.
the trial court denied the motion for nonsuit,stating i think there sufficient testimony and evidence for the case to go to the jury,and for me not to take it away from the jury on the issue of both the block insulation and the gaskets.the jury can decide whether to believe or not to believe the testimony.the evidence is that the block insulation was provided with the foster wheeler boilers.there is some evidence that there were variations of overhauls and repairs done to the ship.but i think it up to the jury to determine whether or not those were to such an extent that there was no original block insulation in there.the same applies to the gaskets,although i think that a much more difficult case for the plaintiffs.there was testimony that the gaskets were replaced when there was a need to open or adjust the areas,some,as i recall,every hours.i think it up to the jury to accept that or not to accept that,and not for the c ourt to take this away from the jury.therefore,the defendant foster wheeler motion for nonsuit is denied on those grounds 
the parties again took up this issue in their closing arguments to the jury.the whitlocks counsel stated he expected foster wheeler to argue that all the asbestos insulation they sold was removed from their boilers before whitlock joined the ship.counsel asserted such a conclusion was contrary to the evidence.specifically,counsel noted that schroppe,foster wheeler vice president and chief engineer,testified there was no evidence in the repair file suggesting that the original insulation supplied with the boilers had been removed prior to.regarding exposure to block insulation in the boilers,counsel pointed to the testimony of paul whitlock shipmate elmquist,who served on the kitty hawk beginning in april,and who testified that repairs to the boilers involving removal of brick and insulation was ongoing between september and may.counsel also reviewed paul whitlock testimony,in which paul described climbing in and out of the boiler during the repair work in order to haul buckets of debris from the boiler out of the ship.counsel also referred to the videotaped testimony of another shipmate,morley clapp,who testified that the kitty hawk overhaul in san diego in june of following its tour of duty to vietnam involved tearing out and replacing at least percent of the brick and insulation in all the boilers.turning to asbestos exposure from gaskets,counsel reviewed evidence and testimony showing foster wheeler supplied asbestos gaskets to the kitty hawk that the gaskets had to be changed every hours and that the ones being replaced had to be removed using wire brushes and scrapers,creating a considerable amount of asbestos dust.
on the other hand,foster wheeler argued that it did not cause paul whitlock mesothelioma,and its counsel asserted plaintiffs had failed to prove it did so.counsel noted that although elmquist testimony related to his time with the kitty hawk beginning in april,the whitlocks presented no evidence of what happened to the original insulation and gaskets in the ship boilers between when the keel was laid in the kitty hawk and.further,counsel asserted that elmquist had testified that when he arrived back on the kitty hawk in december before whitlock arrived in january,he noticed the super heaters to the boilers were exposed.elmquist stated that meant that whatever materials had been ripped out of the boilers in order to expose the super heaters had been ripped out while he was away at boiler school between september and december.counsel also attacked whitlock credibility,and the accuracy of his memory of events,based on differences between his deposition and his trial testimonies.
the trial court instructed the jury on the morning of friday,december,and the jury retired to deliberations armed with a verdict form containing nine questions.the first question on the form stated.was paul whitlock exposed to insulating block gaskets sold or distributed by foster wheeler if your answer to question is yes,then answer question.if you answered no,stop here,answer no further questions,and have the presiding juror sign and date this form and ring for the bailiff.on december,during the third day of deliberations,the jury answered no to the first question and thereby returned a verdict in favor of foster wheeler.judgment on the special verdict was entered on december.
posttrial phase 
on january,the whitlocks filed a notice of intention to move for a new trial on grounds of juror misconduct.the whitlocks provided declarations by three jurors in support of their motion for a new trial.barbara who sat as juror during the trial,stated she was one of the three jurors who voted yes on question.she indicated that all three days of deliberations were devoted to a discussion of question.at the end of the first day,jurors voted by show of hands on the question.four jurors voted yes,four voted no,and four were undecided.at the end of the second day,four jurors voted yes and eight jurors voted no.she further stated during the deliberations,i heard j uror,express certain opinions to the other jurors based on his personal experiences in the navy.during the deliberations,we continuously discussed whether the block insulation that was inside the foster wheeler boilers during the period that whitlock served aboard the kitty hawk was the same block insulation that had been sold to the navy by foster wheeler i raised the fact that schroppe,the foster wheeler engineer,testified that insulating block in the interior of the boiler could be left undisturbed for as long as years unless there was a specific reason to take it out stated to the other jurors that based on his own experience in the navy,all of the original block insulation would have been replaced during previous repairs to the boilers before whitlock came aboard the ship.stated that his experience in the navy was that when the navy performs repairs,it tears apart and replaces everything,even when the manufacturer recommendations or guidelines do call for replacement.by way of example,described to the other jurors his own experiences repairing circuit boards while in the navy,and described how the navy always took everything completely apart,and always replaced all components of the circuit boards,whether they needed to be replaced or not.t here was also a discussion of plaintiffs expert,william longo,wherein longo had explained how microscopic asbestos fibers from the foster wheeler block and gaskets could remain in the environment long after block and gaskets were removed.informed the other jurors that based upon his own experience in the navy,asbestos fibers would still be there,as the navy would always clean up thoroughly.at the conclusion of all these discussions,we took our final vote which resulted in a verdict in favor of defendant foster wheeler on question.three jurors voted yes,and nine jurors voted no.
michael,who acted as jury foreman,made a similar statement attesting to how the voting progressed to a defense verdict after juror,expressed personal opinions that,based on his naval experiences,the navy would have removed all the block insulation before paul whitlock came on board,and all the asbestos fibers would have been cleaned up before whitlock came on board because the navy constantly and thoroughly cleaned up every day.greg,who sat as juror,also stated that the voting progressed to a defense verdict after told other jurors that,based on his experience working on navy ships,even if only part of a piece of equipment needed to be repaired it was standard practice to go ahead and replace everything.as an example,described work he had done repairing circuit boards aboard naval ships.he described how all of the components of the circuit boards were replaced even when that was really necessary.thereafter,on the third day of deliberations,we took our final vote on question of the verdict form which resulted in a verdict in favor of defendant foster wheeler.three jurors,including myself,voted yes,and nine jurors voted no.
a hearing was held on the whitlocks motion for a new trial on march.on march,the trial court entered its order granting plaintiffs motion for a new trial.in its order,the trial court set forth the grounds and reasons for granting the motion for a new trial as follows plaintiffs motion for new trial is based upon juror misconduct.in support of the motion,plaintiffs submitted declarations of three jurors.the three jurors describe statements made by j uror during deliberations.one juror declared that stated all of the original block insulation would have been replaced during previous repairs to the boilers before whitlock came aboard the ship.stated that his experience in the navy was that when the navy performs repairs,it tears apart and replaces everything,even when the manufacturer recommendations or guidelines do call for replacement.went on to describe his own experiences repairing circuit boards while in the navy,and described how the navy always took everything completely apart,and always replaced all components of the circuit boards,whether they needed to be replaced or not.two other juror declarations were consistent with this declaration.no declarations disputing the statements were submitted.
these statements constitute juror misconduct.the issue of whitlock exposure to asbestos was hotly contested throughout the trial.the critical question for the jury was whether the original foster wheeler block insulation inside the ship boiler had been completely removed by the time whitlock was aboard the ship.there was no testimony on the subject matter of navy practices to take things apart and replace everything.nor was there testimony what the navy did when the manufacturer recommendations or guidelines do not call for replacement.thus,statements constituted external information in the form of a juror own claim to expertise or specialized knowledge for which there was no evidence.
in the c ourt view there was significant conflicting evidence concerning exposure for the jury to evaluate.all three days of jury deliberation were devoted to a discussion of the first question regarding whitlock exposure.and,the votes taken during deliberations demonstrate that the jury had difficulty with this issue.the first vote was four for plaintiffs,four for defendant,and four undecided.the second vote was four for plaintiffs and eight for defendant.the final vote on december,resulted in three for plaintiffs and nine for defendant.
the c ourt instructed the jury in accordance with the following instructions which are quoted in part caci nothing that you see,hear,or learn outside th is courtroom is evidence unless i specifically tell you it is.caci you must decide what the facts are in this case from the evidence you have seen or heard during the trial.caci you should use your common sense,but do not use or consider any special training or unique personal experience that any of you have in matters involved in this case.such training or experience is not a part of the evidence received in this case.
in evaluating a motion for new trial based upon juror misconduct,the c ourt evaluates whether juror misconduct occurred.if misconduct occurred,a presumption of prejudice arises which may be rebutted by proof that no prejudice actually resulted.citation.here,the court finds that juror statements constituted misconduct creating a presumption of prejudice and further the presumption was not rebutted by defendant.
prejudice may be rebutted by showing that the prejudice does not exist.there was no such showing made.prejudice may also be rebutted by consideration of whether there is a reasonable probability of harm by examining such factors as the strength of the evidence that misconduct occurred,the nature and seriousness of the misconduct,and the probability that actual prejudice may have ensued.citation.here,the evidence that the statements were made has not been challenged by defendant.the misconduct was serious because it injected the unique personal experience of on a critical issue for which there was no evidence.his statements were not matters of common experience.that the jury vote was close demonstrates a substantial likelihood that at least one juror was impermissibly influenced.it is hereby ordered that p laintiffs motion for new trial is granted.italics added.
