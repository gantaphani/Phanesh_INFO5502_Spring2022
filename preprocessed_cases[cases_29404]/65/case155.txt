the issue in this diversity case is whether the district court abused its discretion in granting the plaintiff motion to dismiss voluntarily all his claims without prejudice.because the defendants would potentially be stripped of a defense based on a texas statute of repose we vacate and remand for further proceedings.
george hyde,a texas citizen,sued roche and roche laboratories,claiming he suffered physical and psychological injuries from ingesting the prescription drug accutane during the early.the defendants are,respectively,the manufacturer and distributor of accutane in the united states.the action was originally filed in texas state court,but was removed to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction.
shortly after removal,the roche defendants filed a motion for summary judgment asserting that hyde claims are barred by a texas statute of repose that provides a period for filing a products liability action,beginning on the date of the sale of the product by the defendant.the term products liability action is broadly defined to include 
any action against a manufacturer or seller for recovery of damages or other relief for harm allegedly caused by a defective product,whether the action is based in strict tort liability,strict products liability,negligence,misrepresentation,breach of express or implied warranty,or any other theory or combination of theories,and whether the relief sought is recovery of damages or any other legal or equitable relief,including a suit for a injury or damage to or loss of real or personal property b personal injury c wrongful death d economic loss or e declaratory,injunctive,or other equitable relief 
hyde admits that he last took accutane almost years before he filed suit,but he asserted in his response to the motion for summary judgment that the statute of repose would violate the texas constitution open courts if applied to his claims.he additionally asserted that his claims fall within an exception to the statute of repose for latent diseases hyde did not produce any evidence that he has actually satisfied the conditions of the latent disease exception he argued that it is sufficient under the statute provisions that he alleges facts that meet the elements of the exception 
before responding to the summary judgment motion,however,hyde filed a motion to dismiss all his claims without prejudice pursuant to.a stating that he no longer desire d to prosecute th e action.the roche defendants opposed dismissal and urged the court to rule on the pending motion for summary judgment,arguing that roche would be prejudiced if hyde refiled the lawsuit in a state without an applicable statute of repose.
at some point,hyde filed a virtually identical suit against the roche defendants in new jersey state court,and the roche defendants brought this to the attention of the federal district court in texas.they advised the court that new jersey does not have an applicable statute of repose and asserted it was unlikely that new jersey rules would result in that court applying the texas statute of repose,citing gantes kason,in which the new jersey supreme court refused to apply georgia statute of repose in a action arising from an industrial accident that occurred in georgia 
after the summary judgment motion and motion to dismiss had been pending for several months,hyde requested a continuance of the summary judgment proceedings to allow additional time for discovery as to whether the law of a forum other than texas should apply in this case,possibly new jersey in the same motion,hyde urged the court to grant his motion for dismissal without prejudice,deny the motion for summary judgment on the merits,or defer ruling on the summary judgment motion pending a decision on whether the case would be transferred to a florida litigation panel for accutane cases.
four days after hyde requested a continuance,the district court granted hyde motion for voluntary dismissal without prejudice.although dismissal of the case could have been subject to terms that the court considers proper,the district court dismissal order was unconditional.
the roche defendants appeal the dismissal order,seeking remand to the district court for consideration of its summary judgment motion.they argue that dismissal has deprived them of a favorable judgment on the merits and stripped them of an affirmative defense that is not available in the new jersey litigation.hyde principal is that his pursuit of the case in new jersey would not prejudice the roche defendants because new jersey law might apply even if the case proceeded in texas federal court.
as an initial matter,hyde contends that we should not view the instant appeal as one strictly involving the issue of whether the district court abused its discretion under rule a because,hyde asserts,the district court ruling is also referable to hyde motion for continuance and therefore the district court was entitled to enter any order that was just pursuant to rule f we reject this argument.the district court order specifically referenced hyde voluntary motion to dismiss without prejudice.the court did not rule on hyde motion for continuance.
rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure precludes a plaintiff from dismissing a lawsuit without the court permission if either an answer or a motion for summary judgment has been served on the plaintiff and the defendant does not consent to dismissal a district court decision to dismiss a lawsuit under rule a is reviewed for abuse of discretion dismissal without prejudice will generally be affirmed unless the defendant will suffer some plain legal prejudice other than the mere prospect of a second lawsuit.a defendant may be substantially prejudiced by dismissal of a lawsuit if dismissal effectively strips him of a defense that would otherwise be available.that the plaintiff may obtain some tactical advantage over the defendant in future litigation is not ordinarily a bar to dismissal.
in determining whether roche will suffer plain legal prejudice as a consequence of the dismissal,we are guided by prior decisions of this court including ikospentakis and elbaor tripath imaging,in ikospentakis,the defendants argued that the voluntary dismissal of jones act claims stripped the defendants of a forum non conveniens defense that was available in federal court but unavailable in louisiana state court we agreed there was prejudice because the courts of that state had unequivocally rejected the forum non conveniens doctrine in jones act and maritime cases in analyzing what constitutes legal prejudice,we emphasized that the availability of a defense need not be established to a certainty 
w hether the defendants can sustain this defense beyond the shadow of a doubt in federal court is not the point of the inquiry concerning legal prejudice,although that circumstance made the decision in phillips illinois central gulf railroad relatively easy.the point of the inquiry,rather is that appellants invocation of forum non conveniens is far from frivolous,and that if appellants are relegated to litigating in the louisiana state courts,they will not even have the opportunity to pursue a forum non conveniens dismissal 
because the forum non conveniens defense was not frivolous and because it was virtually certain that the defense would be unavailable in state court,we vacated the dismissal order and remanded the case to the district court with instructions to consider the merits of the defense before proceeding further 
in elbaor we further clarified that legal prejudice may exist even if it is not legally certain that the defense would be lost if the case were dismissed in elbaor,we agreed with the district court that dismissal would potentially strip the defendant of a viable statute of limitations defense under texas law,even though the plaintiffs asserted that the discovery rule applied and even though it was not known whether limitations would be unavailable as a defense in a forum in which the suit might be refiled.with regard to the merits of the limitations defense,we held that the plaintiffs potential ability to plead around the statute of limitations is irrelevant in lig
