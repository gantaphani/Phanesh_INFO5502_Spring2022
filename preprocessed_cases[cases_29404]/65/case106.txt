introduction 
this matter comes on before the court on an appeal by defendant liberty mutual insurance company liberty mutual from an order of the district court entered on june,granting partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiff usx corporation usx on its contract claims arising out of liberty mutual refusal to defend and indemnify usx in various actions brought against it under a workmen liability policy policy that liberty mutual had issued to usx liberty mutual also appeals from the final judgment entered in favor of usx on january.the case is also before us on a that usx filed from the portion of the district court order of june,granting liberty mutual partial summary judgment and the judgment entered on january,in favor of liberty mutual on usx claim charging bad faith denial of insurance coverage.for the reasons we set forth below,we will reverse the order of june,and the judgment of january,to the extent that they are in favor of usx and will affirm the order and judgment to the extent that they are in favor of liberty mutual.furthermore,we will remand the case to the district court to enter a final summary judgment in favor of liberty mutual on the portions of the summary judgment that we are reversing.
ii.factual and procedural background 
a.the parties and the relevant insurance contract 
usx is a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in pennsylvania,and liberty mutual is a mutual insurance company founded by an act of the massachusetts legislature with its principal place of business in that state in,liberty mutual issued to usx a standard form policy,which the parties annually renewed until january,although issued in pennsylvania,the policy provided coverage to usx for specified operations in identified states,including some usx operations in texas.
the policy had two parts coverage a workmen compensation coverage a provided coverage for usx statutory liability for workmen compensation claims and coverage b employers liability coverage b provided coverage for liability that the exclusivity provisions of the applicable workmen compensation statute did not bar.thus,ordinarily,at least,coverage b covered workmen claims that were not based on no fault workmen compensation statutory provisions the portion of the policy most germane to this appeal is coverage b,which covered all sums which usx shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury by accident or disease.at.the policy contained a single definitions section,applicable to both coverage a and coverage b,containing the following definition 
bodily injury by accident bodily injury by disease the contraction of disease is not an accident within the meaning of the word accident in the term bodily injury by accident and only such disease as results directly from a bodily injury by accident is included within the term bodily injury by accident.the term bodily injury by disease includes only such disease as is not within the term bodily injury by accident.
at the policy did not define accident or disease.
while coverage b insured usx for damages resulting from either bodily injury by accident or bodily injury by disease,there was a notable limitation on the latter coverage in that the policy did not cover a claim for bodily injury by disease unless prior to months after the end of the policy period written claim is made or suit is brought against the insured for damages.at.this claim limitation period,by its terms,applies only to claims for bodily injury by disease.at.
b.the underlying complaints and the claim for coverage 
beginning in,certain of usx former employees and their survivors filed hundreds of compensation actions against usx in texas,seeking damages for injuries sustained by the former employees while allegedly being exposed to asbestos products premises on june,seven years after the former employees and their survivors filed the initial lawsuits against usx,usx sought coverage for defenses and indemnification from liberty mutual in the underlying actions.by letter dated february,from its coverage counsel,liberty mutual denied usx claim for coverage,explaining that there was no potential coverage and citing,inter alia,the claim limitation provision.
c.the proceedings in the district court 
in response to the liberty mutual disclaimer,usx filed this diversity of citizenship action on may,against liberty mutual in the district court asserting a claim for breach of insurance contract count i,seeking a declaratory judgment that there was coverage count ii,claiming insurance bad faith under.const.stat.ann.west count iii,seeking indemnity count iv,and asking for contract reformation count v.in sum,usx alleged that the policy covers claims because they are for bodily injury by accident,to which the claim limitation provision does not apply,or,in the alternative,that the contract should be reformed as it defeated the reasonable expectations of usx and is thus contrary to public policy.see.the district court referred the case to a magistrate judge under b a and b.
on october,liberty mutual filed a motion for summary judgment.as with its initial denial of coverage,liberty mutual asserted that the policy did not cover the underlying claims because they were for bodily injury by disease and thus the claim limitation provision precluded coverage for them inasmuch as the plaintiffs did not file their actions within months following the end of the policy period on february,usx filed a for summary judgment as to counts.
the magistrate judge to whom the court referred the case issued a report and recommendation on may,recommending that the court grant summary judgment in favor of usx on its claims for breach of contract,declaratory relief and indemnity counts i,ii,and iv,respectively,but that the court grant summary judgment in favor of liberty mutual on the insurance bad faith claim count iii.the magistrate judge concluded with regard to counts i,ii and iv that the definition of bodily injury by accident was ambiguous and consequently recommended that the court construe it in favor of usx as the insured.
the magistrate judge in reaching her conclusion relied on the pennsylvania supreme court opinion in france refractories allstate insurance,for the proposition that exposure to asbestos causes immediate bodily injury under the terms of an insurance policy that offers coverage for bodily injury.at.in light of this immediate bodily injury,the magistrate judge reasoned that because no one intends to inhale asbestos fibers and develop asbestosis,the injury therefore occurs by an accident that later results in a disease.at.according to the report and recommendation,this circumstance raises at least a reasonable interpretation that the underlying claims were for bodily injury by accident and thus the liberty mutual policy covered usx against them.at.in view of the magistrate judge recommendation with respect to the meaning of the policy,she recommended that the court dismiss count v seeking reformation as moot.the magistrate judge,however,recommended that the court grant summary judgment in favor of liberty mutual on count iii because she believed that liberty mutual demonstrated a reasonable basis for its refusal to defend and indemnify usx,specifically its reliance on authority from another jurisdiction in the absence of applicable precedent from the courts of pennsylvania.
both parties filed timely objections to the magistrate judge report and recommendation,following which the district court,after a de novo review,issued an order on june,which adopted the report and recommendation as the opinion of the court and dismissed count v as moot subsequently,the parties agreed that liberty mutual as a result of the june,order,owed usx,subject to liberty mutual right to appeal,for attorneys fees,defense costs,and interest.the court then entered a final judgment on january,in favor of usx on counts i,ii,and iv and in favor of liberty mutual on count iii the january,judgment included an award of.thereafter both parties timely filed notices of appeal.
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court exercised diversity jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to,and we have jurisdiction over the appeal and under.we exercise plenary review of the order granting summary judgment.see dilworth metro.life ins,cir haugh allstate ins,cir.we will affirm an order granting summary judgment if our review reveals that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.we view the facts in the light most favorable to the party against whom summary judgment was entered.see dilworth,at haugh,at.the parties agree that pennsylvania law governs this action 
iv.discussion 
appeal by liberty mutual 
in asserting that the district court should have entered summary judgment in its favor on counts i,ii and iv,rather than in favor of usx,liberty mutual argues that the court erred in concluding that the policy language at issue was ambiguous.liberty mutual submits that,when viewed in the context in which the parties made the contract,the only reasonable interpretation of the policy is that the underlying claims are not claims for bodily injury by accident but instead are claims for bodily injury by disease,to which the claim limitation period applies.in particular,liberty mutual asserts that the district court analysis ignored a substantial body of pennsylvania workmen compensation law defining the term accident which necessarily informs the employers liability coverage at issue inasmuch as it was written in a single policy also providing workmen compensation coverage.of course,in light of the circumstance that the texas plaintiffs brought the underlying actions well beyond the expiration of the claim limitation period and did not make written claims within that period,if liberty mutual is correct it owes no duties to usx on the policy involved here.
usx counters that the meaning of the disputed policy language should be ascertained by reference to france refractories and that the workers compensation precedents upon which liberty mutual almost exclusively relies have no relevance.appellee br.at emphases in original.thus,in usx view,this case involves underlying claims for bodily injury by accident to which the claim limitation period does not apply.our review of the materials submitted and the relevant authorities leads us to agree with liberty mutual.
the district court was,of course,correct to the extent that it observed that in pennsylvania a court construes ambiguities in an insurance policy strictly against the insurer.see,selko home ins,cir citing standard venetian blind am.empire ins.nevertheless,in pennsylvania,and no doubt elsewhere,c lear policy language is to be given effect,and courts should not torture the language to create ambiguities but should read the policy provisions to avoid it.selko,at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.in construing policy language,courts should consider any special usage w here terms are used in a contract which are known and understood by a particular class of persons in a certain special or peculiar sense.sunbeam liberty mut.ins,
while the terms disease and accident do not appear alongside the definitions of bodily injury by disease and bodily injury by accident,liberty mutual correctly argues that the meaning of those terms with respect to employers liability under coverage b in the policy at issue is informed by their usage in the closely related context of workmen compensation claims.carriers write insurance for both types of claims to cover claims arising out of employee workplace injuries accordingly,as one leading treatise explains,
workers compensation is routinely written in combination with an employer liability policy to provide protection for those situations where worker compensation may not apply and thus avoid a gap in protection because employee claims subject to workers compensation law are generally excluded in other types of liability policies.
john allan applebaum,insurance law and practice,at berdal ed.courts of last resort in several states have observed,consistently with this explanation,that employers liability insurance is traditionally written in conjunction with workers compensation policies.producers dairy delivery sentry ins,cal d,see also travelers indem.pcr,so d,schmidt smith.such is the case here where the employers liability coverage at issue is part of a policy containing a single definitions section applicable to both coverage a and coverage accordingly,although to the best of our knowledge the supreme court of pennsylvania has not considered the precise issue before us,we predict that it would look to the substantial body of workmen compensation precedent to inform its construction of the terms disease and accident in a related employers liability policy,such as the one involved here after all,it is logical that the contracting parties would not use the term accident in a policy intending the term to have one meaning under coverage a and another under coverage b,when the coverages are written in conjunction and are set forth in a single document with one set of definitions.
at the time the parties entered into the policy at issue,the term accident had a special meaning based on its usage in the context of workmen compensation.inasmuch as the pennsylvania workmen compensation act wca,as the legislature originally enacted it in,provided benefits only for injury or death resulting from an accident in the course of employment but did not define accident,the courts fashioned a definition of that term.see pawlosky workmen comp.appeal bd.latrobe brewing.the courts defined the term accident as a sudden and unexpected event,with a sudden event impl ying a distinct happening or occurrence at a particular time.loudon shaull sons,internal citation and quotation marks omitted.loudon is instructive because it involved a claimant who sought compensation after contracting typhoid from contaminated drinking water.in differentiating between an accident and a disease,the court in loudon adopted the following language from matter of connelly hunt furniture,
germs may indeed be inhaled through the nose or mouth or absorbed into the system through the normal channels of entry.in such cases their inroads will seldom,if ever,be assignable to a determinate or single act,identified in space or time for this reason as well as for the reason that absorption is incidental to a bodily process both natural and normal,their action presents itself to the mind as a disease and not an accident.
id.at internal citation omitted see also ciabattoni birdsboro steel foundry mach,defining accident as a definite happening or occurrence or event of which the employee is almost invariably aware,as distinguished from an occupational disease,which is latent and insidious and the resultant disability is often difficult to determine.employing this contemporaneous industry usage of the terms accident and disease,we conclude that the only reasonable interpretation of the term bodily injury by accident excludes the underlying claims for diseases 
accordingly,we reject the district court contrary conclusion that the type of injuries involved in the underlying actions occur by an accident that later results in a disease because no one intends to inhale asbestos fibers and develop asbestosis.at.to us,at least,it is clear that the district court conclusion under the policy at issue contravenes the usage of the term accident,and renders certain policy provisions essentially meaningless.most notably,under the district court conclusion the term bodily injury by disease would be practically meaningless inasmuch as nearly every microscopic injury resulting from indeterminate,generalized exposure to an agent would be considered a bodily injury by accident because no one intends to be injured.see riverwood int l employers ins.of wausau,cir hubbs anco insulations,so d.
we also are of the view that the district court construction effectively would read out of the policy the definitions clause which recites that t he contraction of disease is not an accident within the meaning of the word accident in the term bodily injury by accident.see at.pennsylvania courts long have admonished that contract terms will no
