shelley jodoin was injured in a car accident and,with her husband and son,sued toyota motor corporation and toyota motor sales,toyota alleging a design defect in her vehicle.during trial,the district court excluded all evidence relating to testing done by plaintiffs expert.after this ruling,plaintiffs conceded that they would be unable to prove defect,an element of their prima facie case,and the district court granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of toyota.on appeal,plaintiffs challenge the district court exclusion of the testing evidence.we vacate the judgment in favor of toyota and remand for a new trial.
on october,shelley jodoin was hit from behind as she drove her toyota truck.the impact pushed her vehicle into a turn.she attempted to correct the course of her truck,but as she turned to the right,her truck flipped,rolling over several times.as a result of the accident,jodoin is permanently paralyzed.
jodoin,her husband,and her son brought suit against toyota alleging a design defect in jodoin truck which made it prone to rollover.at trial,plaintiffs relied on the testimony of their primary liability expert,robert loyd anderson,to prove this defect.they had employed anderson to perform an accident reconstruction and test another toyota truck to determine its rollover propensity.anderson was allowed to testify about his accident reconstruction conclusions.however,when plaintiffs attempted to introduce anderson testimony regarding the testing of the exemplar vehicle,the court refused to allow the testimony for lack of a proper foundation.the court reasoned as follows 
y ou got a big problem here that you ca remedy we not interested in the date of manufacture what these two vehicles were like.what we interested in is what they were like at the time of the accident,and whether the exemplar was the same.and we do know what condition the exemplar was or what it went through,what its history was.for example,whether it had been in an accident previously,which weakened some structures and other factors.and this witness ca testify to that.he knows nothing about the history of the vehicle.so you wasting your time.all of this is irrelevant until you establish that the exemplar was virtually identical in all respects with the subject vehicle.and only then can you get into the question of what tests were run you ca get there from here,i can tell you now,not with this witness.
the court suggested that plaintiffs could lay a proper foundation by introducing testimony from the people who purchased the car for anderson or the people from whom the exemplar vehicle was purchased.plaintiffs introduced no such testimony.therefore,anderson was not allowed to testify as to how the design of the exemplar vehicle compared with the design of jodoin vehicle.
plaintiffs did try to lay a foundation based on anderson testimony.first,anderson claimed to have checked the vehicle identification tags to verify that the load ratings and tires were the same.furthermore,the record reflects that the exemplar and jodoin vehicle had similar vehicle identification numbers vin.second,he testified to performing a structural examination of the steering components,suspension components,tires,and springs,including crawling under the truck to inspect the undercarriage.third,he said he had looked at the instrumentation and modifications made for the purposes of testing,which he documented.this examination included e verything anderson thought would be related to the vehicle dynamics and the issues that he was evaluating.he testified that he detected no evidence of any modifications or any parts that were not toyota original equipment.however,anderson had no personal knowledge of where the exemplar vehicle came from or how it was obtained,and he did not testify to that history.
when plaintiffs attempted to question anderson regarding the relationship between the design characteristics of jodoin vehicle and its rollover stability,the court upheld an objection to the testimony,stating,obviously anderson testimony is based on testing and the results of the testing is not admissible at this point,sic it never will be.when plaintiffs had previously attempted to introduce testimony on the general relationship between a vehicle design features and its propensity to rollover,the court excluded that testimony as irrelevant.therefore,plaintiffs were unable to introduce any testimony regarding design and rollover propensity.
the next day,outside the presence of the jury,plaintiffs addressed the court and asked it to reconsider its ruling.the court again pointed to the lack of information on the exemplar vehicle history and repeated that it would exclude any evidence relating to testing of that vehicle without such a history.the court said that plaintiffs needed to show where the exemplar vehicle was purchased and have some evidence as to whether that a legitimate vin number on the exemplar vehicle,and somebody who has the expertise to be able to tell us what the vin number means a nd whether there been any changes in the vehicle since its manufacture.
in response,plaintiffs made an offer of proof regarding what anderson would have testified to regarding the similarities between the exemplar vehicle and jodoin vehicle.this included,mainly,anderson conclusion,based on the vins of the two vehicles,that the vehicles were virtually identical.it also contained his conclusion that the exemplar vehicle was in good condition and reasonably similar to the kind of condition he would expect for a vehicle that had not been involved in any accidents,damaged or modified.
toyota opposed the offer of proof and contended that plaintiffs could never clear the substantial similarity hurdle in regard to the exemplar vehicle.in support,toyota cited information that the exemplar vehicle had been sent to a dealership for extensive repairs after it had been acquired for anderson tests yet anderson had no information on those repairs.
during the offer of proof,when plaintiffs attempted to introduce evidence relating to the testing,the court stopped them,maintaining the need for a daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d,hearing before the testing or test results could be entered on the record.plaintiffs declined to hold the hearing because the court iterated that the test results could not be admitted for lack of an adequate foundation,regardless of the outcome of the daubert hearing.therefore,the record contains no information on anderson findings.
after the district court reinforced its ruling relating to the inadmissibility of anderson testimony regarding the exemplar vehicle,plaintiffs acknowledged they would be unable to prove defect,an element of their prima facie case.the court then asked plaintiffs if they were going to dismiss the case.plaintiffs responded that they would not do so voluntarily.then,the court asked,are you going to rest your case so i can grant a motion for a directed verdict after taking a short recess,plaintiffs accepted the court suggestion and rested their case.toyota moved for judgment as a matter of law based on plaintiffs failure to produce evidence of defect,and the court granted the motion.this appeal followed.
on appeal,plaintiffs contend that the district court abused its discretion by excluding all testimony regarding the testing of the exemplar vehicle.however,before we can reach that question,we must resolve a threshold matter whether plaintiffs essentially abandoned their case when they rested before proving any of the elements of their claim.because the district court suggested,incorrectly,that plaintiffs needed to rest before the court could consider a rule motion,we find that,under these facts,plaintiffs did not abandon their case.
under rhode island law,plaintiffs must prove five elements,in addition to damages,to prevail in a strict liability claim based on design defect a defect the defect existed at the time the product left defendants hands the defect rendered the product unreasonably dangerous the product was being used as intended at the time of the accident and the defect was the proximate cause of plaintiffs injuries.raimbeault takeuchi.plaintiffs do not dispute
