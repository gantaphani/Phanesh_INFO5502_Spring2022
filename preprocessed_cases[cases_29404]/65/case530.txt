in appellant christopher jones action for negligence and products liability,summary judgment was granted in favor of respondents lloyd electric company,lloyd,and development company,comet electric comet.we affirm.
relevant procedural background 
on november,jones filed a complaint against invision technologies,invision,containing claims for negligence and products liability.the complaint alleged that jones,an employee of the transportation security administration tsa at los angeles international airport lax,had suffered injuries in the course of his duties as the result of a defect in an explosive detection system eds machine.according to the complaint,jones was injured on august,when he tripped over the mounting bolts that secured the eds machine.the complaint further alleged that invision had negligently or otherwise wrongfully manufactured,designed,maintained,supplied,distributed,installed,failed to warn,or handled the eds machine.jones later named several other parties as doe defendants,including respondents and the boeing company boeing.
on october,boeing filed a motion for summary judgment code civ,lloyd joined in this motion and asserted its own motion for summary judgment,or alternatively,summary adjudication on jones claims comet filed a motion for summary judgment on october.in december,boeing entered into a settlement with jones and filed a notice withdrawing its motion without affect ing any other summary judgment motion scheduled for hearing.following a hearing,the trial court granted lloyd and comet motions,and later denied jones motion for reconsideration.judgment was entered in respondents favor on march.
discussion 
jones contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment and denying his motion for reconsideration.we disagree.
summary judgment 
standard of review 
generally,a defendant is entitled to summary judgment if the record establishes as a matter of law that none of the plaintiff asserted causes of action can prevail.citation.molko holy spirit cal d.the defendant may carry this burden by showing that the plaintiff can not establish at least one element of the cause of example,that the plaintiff can not prove element aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,aguilar.the defendant need not conclusively negate the element all that is required is a showing that the plaintiff does not possess,and can not reasonably obtain,needed evidence.id.at,d.following a grant of summary judgment,we review the record de novo for the existence of triable issues,and consider the evidence submitted in connection with the motion,with the exception of evidence to which objections were made and sustained.guz bechtel national cal th,d.
in the present case,the parties raised numerous evidentiary objections to the showing proffered by their adversary,which the trial court sustained in part and overruled in part generally,the trial court evidentiary rulings on summary judgment are reviewed for an abuse of discretion.walker countrywide home loans,th,d see caloroso hathaway th,d.with the exception of the objections discussed below,jones does not challenge these rulings on appeal,and to that extent,has forfeited any contention of error regarding the rulings.
jones has also forfeited any contention that summary judgment was improper with respect to his claim for products liability against respondents.lloyd sought summary adjudication on the products liability claim on the ground that it had neither designed nor manufactured the eds machine or its mounting bolts although comet did not expressly request summary adjudication on the claim,its motion for summary judgment also argued that the claim against it failed for the same reason.in granting summary judgment,the trial court determined that neither lloyd nor comet had designed or manufactured the eds machine or its mounting bolts,and that jones had failed to oppose their motions on this issue.because jones does not address this ruling on appeal,we limit our inquiry to his claim for negligence.christoff union pacific railroad th,d although review of summary judgment is de novo,review is limited to issues adequately raised in the appellant brief.see yu signet th,d reyes kosha th,fn,d.
contractor liability after completion and acceptance of work 
the key issues before us concern the application of the completed and accepted doctrine,which in some circumstances shields contractors from liability for negligence.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.torts.in granting summary judgment,the trial court relied on this doctrine,as explained in sanchez swinerton walberg th,d sanchez.there,a general contractor hired a subcontractor to construct the entrance stairway and landing for a new building.id.at,d.two years after the building was completed,the plaintiff slipped on rainwater that had pooled on the landing,and initiated a negligence action against the general contractor and subcontractor.ibid.
following an examination of california case authority,the appellate court determined that when a contractor completes work that is accepted by the owner,the contractor is not liable to third parties injured as a result of the condition of the work,even if the contractor was negligent in performing the contract,unless the defect in the work was latent or concealed.sanchez,supra,th at,d.the rationale for this doctrine is that an owner has a duty to inspect the work and ascertain its safety,and thus the owner acceptance of the work shifts liability for its safety to the owner,provided that a reasonable inspection would disclose the defect.id.at,d.
applying this doctrine to the circumstances before it,the sanchez court concluded that the defendants were not liable for the plaintiff injuries because the owner and its employees had long been aware that rainwater pooled on the landing.sanchez,supra,th at,d.it reasoned in the context of a patent defect,the word patent refers to the patency of danger and not merely to exterior visibility.citation.here,the danger itself was patent as a matter of law it would be discovered by the inspection an owner would make in the exercise of ordinary care and prudence citations,for,as a matter of ordinary prudence,one would test whether water accumulated on the uncovered landings of stairways into buildings.the obvious nature of the defect would allow the owner and users to take steps to remedy the condition or to take precautions against injury.in fact,it is undisputed that the dangerous condition was observed by the owner agents,and the risk it entailed was appreciated,on several occasions preceding plaintiff accident.even if the defect initially could have been considered latent,once it was discovered,it became patent.citations.ibid.
parties showings 
in seeking summary judgment,lloyd and comet submitted evidence that their work on the pertinent eds machine had been completed and accepted prior to jones injuries.their evidence supported the following version of the underlying facts in june,tsa engaged boeing to provide architectural,mechanical,and electrical facilities to support the installation of eds machines manufactured by invision at more than domestic airports.boeing hired lloyd to perform electrical work on eds machines at lax,and install seismic anchors on them.in turn,lloyd hired comet to install the anchors.boeing also engaged a structural engineer to design the anchoring system for lax.after the structural engineer obtained approvals for its design drawings from tsa and the city of los angeles city,boeing issued the drawings to lloyd,which forwarded them to comet.
lloyd submitted a declaration from doug waldo,a former lloyd employee who supervised the project for lloyd from november to july.according to waldo,lloyd limited role in the installation of the anchors was completed prior to jones accident on august.lloyd neither designed the anchors nor provided them to comet.under the pertinent contracts,comet was responsible for obtaining the seismic anchors,installing them,and obtaining approvals from the city and any other governing body from which approval was necessary.waldo duties were limited to acting as a liaison between boeing and comet he passed information and paperwork between boeing and comet,and kept a log of comet activities for boeing.he did not supervise,inspect,or direct comet work,and was not expected to do so.after july,when lloyd work on the site was completed,lloyd had no access to or control over the eds machines.lloyd was never asked to return to the site to make changes or repairs to the anchors.
comet submitted evidence that its role in the project was limited to installing the specified anchors on eds machines at lax,and that its work on the machine that jones had identified as the source of his injuries was completed and accepted prior to his accident.in a deposition and elsewhere,jones identified the pertinent machine as number or in his work area within the tom bradley terminal.according to a declaration from keith berson,comet,comet completed the installation of anchor brackets and bolts on this machine in june,two months before jones accident.tsa accepted the machine and put it into full operation prior to the accident.
pointing to jones deposition testimony,comet also asserted that jones and tsa knew that the anchors on the machine posed a hazard before jones suffered his injuries.jones testified that a barrier shielded the machine from passengers,who were required to wait behind the barrier while tsa employees placed their luggage in the machine.prior to the accident,he noticed protruding bolts on the anchors,and tried to steer clear of the bolts as he walked around the machine.he discussed the hazard with his,and mentioned it to a lead in his chain of command.on the date of the accident,he tripped over a bolt as he carried a box around the eds machine.according to jones,he was aware of the bolt before he fell,but misjudged his distance from the bolt.
the bulk of jones evidentiary showing was directed at establishing triable issues regarding the completion and acceptance of comet work.he argued that comet began installing anchors on the machines in his work area after july,relying on deposition testimony from luis briones,comet job foreman,who stated that comet did not obtain anchor brackets until that date.in addition,jones cited deposition testimony from berson,who admitted that his declaration statement regarding the completion date of comet work on the pertinent machine could be off by a month or two.
moreover,jones contended that comet completed its work on the project no earlier than november,and that the work was not accepted until december.according to jones evidence,twining laboratories,an inspection company,examined the anchors on numerous eds machines at lax on or before august,and found that the bolts on some machines had failed.comet replaced the defective bolts,and maintained workers at lax through october.jones also submitted evidence that the department of building and safety of the city of los angeles department did not approve the electrical work on the eds machines until december.
regarding lloyd showing,jones contended that there were triable issues whether lloyd retained responsibility for comet work after july.he pointed to provisions in lloyd contract with boeing obliging lloyd to monitor its subcontractors,as well as the evidence regarding comet work between july and october,and the approval of the electrical work in december.
in granting summary judgment in respondents favor,the trial court concluded that the completed and accepted doctrine,as explained in sanchez,shielded lloyd and comet from liability.on appeal,jones does not dispute that the hazard posed to tsa employees was patent when jones was injured,in view of jones knowledge of the hazard and his communications with his lead.his central contentions are that sanchez misstates the governing legal principles,and that there are triable issues regarding the completion and acceptance of respondents work on the pertinent machine.
vitality of the completed and accepted doctrine 
jones contends that the completed and accepted doctrine was abrogated in stewart cox cal d,stewart,and thus sanchez misstates california law.he argues that stewart and its progeny,especially stonegate homeowners staben th,d stonegate,govern the issues presented in this case.we disagree.
in stewart,a subcontractor was negligent in applying concrete to a swimming pool.stewart,supra,cal d at.after the subcontractor finished his work,the owners noticed a crack in the pool,which the subcontractor covered with plaster.id.at.despite the repairs,water escaped from the pool,damaging the owners house.ibid.the owners initiated an action for negligence against the subcontractor and prevailed at trial.ibid.
in addressing whether the subcontractor had a duty of care to the owners in the absence of privity of contract,our supreme court noted the authority on the completed and accepted doctrine,and concluded that the subcontractor liability to the owner was properly determined by reference to the test stated in biakanja irving cal d.stewart,supra,cal d at.this test involves a balancing of various factors,among which are the extent to which the transaction was intended to affect the plaintiff,the foreseeability of harm to him,the degree of certainty that he suffered injury,the closeness of the connection between the defendant conduct and the injury suffered,and the policy of preventing future harm.id.at.applying this test,the court determined that the subcontractor was not exempt from liability to the owners if his negligence caused damage to them.ibid.in so concluding,the court rejected a contention that the subcontractor was shielded from liability by the owners acceptance of the pool,reasoning that the owners were not experts on pools,and thus could not recognize the hazards posed by the crack in the pool.id.at.
in stonegate,a general contractor hired a subcontractor to install waterproofing and drainage in a condominium project.stonegate,supra,th at,d.when seepage and drainage problems arose after the project completion,the owners association sued the general contractor and subcontractor for negligence.ibid.the trial court granted nonsuit in the subcontractor favor on the grounds that the general contractor had misinstructed it about the scope of the work to be performed.id.at,d.applying stewart,the appellate court reversed,concluding there were triable issues as to whether the subcontractor had complied with the standard of care governing its duties to the owners association.stonegate,supra,th at,d.
jones reliance on stewart and stonegate is misplaced,as they are distinguishable both cases address a subcontractor duty of care to owners who lacked a reasonable opportunity to cure a construction defect before it caused their damages.nor are we persuaded that stewart abrogated the completed and accepted doctrine.after stewart,our supreme court relied on case authority regarding the doctrine in chance lawry,cal d,chance.there,the court looked to this authority in determining the outcome of the test embraced in stewart.chance,at.in view of chance and subsequent cases,the court in sanchez concluded the case authority in question retains its vitality,and provides guidance on questions of contractor liability,unless the test dictates a departure from the doctrine.see sanchez,supra,th at,d.we agree with the sanchez court on this matter.moreover,jones offers no argument that the biakanja factors,when weighed in the specific circumstances of this case,mandate the displacement of the completed and accepted doctrine.
completion and acceptance 
we turn to jones remaining contention regarding the application of the doctrine.few cases have addressed the circumstances under which a contractor work has been deemed completed and accepted for purposes of the doctrine.in klingenstein miehle,klingenstein,a manufacturer sold a printing press,and hired a contractor to convey the press to the buyer,where an employee of the manufacturer was to install the press.under the contract between the manufacturer and the contractor,the manufacturer was entitled to hire the contractor workers to help in the installation of the press.id.at.after the contractor delivered the press to the buyer business floor,the manufacturer installer directed the contractor workers to assist him in setting up the press.id.at.in the course of this process,the press tipped over and killed a worker.ibid.after a jury found the manufacturer solely responsible for the death,the appellate court affirmed,reasoning that prior to the accident the contractor had discharged his contract,and the manufacturer installer had asserted control over the workers.id.at.
in hall barber door cal,hall,a subcontractor was engaged to install the doors in a new commercial building.a tenant took possession of space in the building with the knowledge that the subcontractor had not finished its work on the large door to the space the door had been hung,but some fittings and safety devices had not been installed.id.at.when the door fell and injured the tenant,the trial court granted nonsuit on the tenant claim for negligence against the subcontractor.id.at.our supreme court reversed,reasoning that the subcontractor had a duty of care to the tenant as long as the subcontractor retained control over the door.id.at.
in chance,supra,cal d at pages,a restaurant engaged a contractor to remodel its entrance.after the contractor finished installing a planter box in the foyer,his workers moved on to other work in the foyer.ibid.a patron visiting the restaurant fell into the planter box and asserted claims for negligence against the restaurant and the contractor.ibid.our supreme court affirmed jury verdicts against both defendants,reasoning that although the contractor had finished the planter box,he could have directed his were still engaged in work in the take precautions to eliminate the hazards it posed.ibid.
here,the evidence indisputably establishes that prior to jones accident,the anchors had been installed on the machine,and tsa had put the machine into service in an area reserved for tsa employees moreover,as we elaborate below see pt,post,none of the evidence brought to the trial court attention suggests that respondents performed work on the machine after the anchors had been installed.nonetheless,jones showing indicates that respondents had not fully discharged their contractual duties with respect to the entire project comet maintained workers in other tsa areas until october,and the department of building and safety did not approve the electrical work on the machines until december.
the case before us thus falls between klingenstein,on one hand,and hall and chance,on the other.like the contractor in klingenstein,respondents had completed their work on the machine in question,but unlike that contractor,they may have remained under contractual obligations regarding the larger project.in this respect,respondents resemble the contractors in hall and chance,but unlike those contractors,there is no evidence that respondents retained any control over the machine at the time of the accident.
in our view,the rationale underlying the completion and acceptance doctrine is dispositive of the question before us.as the court explained in sanchez,liability for the safety of a contractor work shifts to the owner upon acceptance of the work,that is,when the owner has had an opportunity to examine the work,and thereafter represents that it is safe by acceptance and subsequent use,the owners assume to the world the responsibility of its sufficiency,and to third parties,the liability of the contractors has ceased,and their own commenced.citation.in other words,having a duty to inspect the work and ascertain its safety before accepting it,the owner acceptance represents it to be safe and the owner becomes liable for its safety.sanchez,supra,th at,d,quoting boswell laird cal.here,there are no triable issues regarding these matters prior to jones accident,tsa had put the machine with the installed anchors into full operation,and jones,his,and a lead were,in fact,aware of the hazard.as there is no evidence that respondents retained control over the machine,we conclude that they are not liable for jones injuries.
jones contends that there are triable issues regarding lloyd contractual duties and the precise date that comet installed the anchors.we disagree.the completion and acceptance doctrine shields lloyd from liability for negligence in the discharge of its duties after tsa accepted comet installation of the anchors on the pertinent machine.as we have explained,there is no triable dispute whether tsa had accepted comet completed work before jones accident.
jones also contends that other conflicts in the evidence preclude summary judgment.he argues that there is no evidence that tsa was authorized to accept the machine until the city approved the work performed under its permits,which occurred on december.in our view,the record discloses no triable dispute about the owner or possessor of the machine.generally,the duty of care that underpins the completion and acceptance doctrine falls upon the owner or possessor of the thing in question.see witkin,summary of cal.law ed.torts.here,respondents showing that the machine and its anchors were installed pursuant to the contract between tsa and boeing is sufficient to establish that tsa owned the machine.indeed,jones does not contend otherwise.
by contrast,there is no evidence that the city also owned or possessed the machine.generally,a party can not avoid summary judgment based on mere speculation and conjecture citation,but instead must produce admissible evidence raising a triable issue of fact.citation.crouse brobeck,phleger harrison th,d.the city status as owner or possessor depends upon its relationship to the machine or the premises on which it was located.see alcaraz vece cal th,d,witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,torts.jones points to three items of evidence bearing on this relationship a declaration from stephen cassens,a boeing manager and engineer,who stated that the city approved the plans for the anchors that were forwarded to lloyd and comet the statement in doug waldo declaration that comet was obligated to obtain the final inspection of the anchors after it completed their installation from the city and any other governing bodies from whom final installation approval was required and the department approval of work done under electrical building permits on december.although this evidence shows that the city and the department scrutinized the project to ensure compliance with applicable building codes,nothing in it raises the reasonable inference that the city was,in fact,an owner or possessor of the machine or its premises for purposes of the applicable duty of care.
on a related matter,jones contends that there is a triable issue whether tsa acceptance of the machine was predicated on an inspection and approval by twining laboratories.again,we disagree.jones sole evidence for this contention is the following excerpt from the deposition of keith berson,comet 
by jones counsel.are there documents you are aware of that i could look at that would say when anyone accepted the seismic anchors on that particular machine,the,as properly done 
i think the inspection records you just got from twining were the ones who accepted the installation.
any other documents you are aware of 
not that i aware of.italics added.
this testimony,read in context,establishes that the only entity berson knew to have documented its acceptance was twining laboratories,not that tsa predicated its acceptance upon an approval from twining laboratories.
here,tsa acceptance is manifested by its conduct regarding the machine 
waldo declaration 
jones contends that the trial court considered inadmissible evidence in granting lloyd motion for summary judgment.under our summary judgment statute,supporting and opposing declarations shall be made on personal knowledge,and shall show affirmatively that the declarant is competent to testify to the matters stated in the affidavits or declarations.code civ,subd.d.jones argues that the trial court erred in overruling his objections that waldo declaration contained improper legal opinion,and vague and conclusory statements not supported by personal knowledge.
jones contends that waldo offered inadmissible opinions on questions of law,namely,lloyd duties under its contracts with boeing and comet.generally,even lawyers may not testify as to legal conclusions.california shoppers,royal globe ins.d.downer bramet d.nonetheless,in interpreting a contract,courts may properly consider the acts and conduct of the parties following the contract execution.city of atascadero merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,th,d.as witkin explains,t he conduct of the parties may be,in effect,a practical construction thereof,for they are probably least likely to be mistaken as to the intent.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts.here,waldo,who was lloyd supervisor,described his understanding of lloyd contractual duties in the context of his discharge of those duties.in our view,the trial court did not err in consulting waldo declaration to resolve jones contentions about lloyd duties under the contracts.
pointing to waldo statement that he was not on the project site after lloyd completed its work on july,jones contends that he lacked personal knowledge of events following that date.pertinent to the application of the completion and acceptance doctrine are waldo statements that upon lloyd completion of its work,it had no control over the eds machines,and that it was not asked to return to lax to repair the anchors.again,we see no error in the trial court ruling.aside from waldo statement that he had personal knowledge of the facts stated in the declaration,his status as lloyd project supervisor rendered him competent to testify that lloyd work ended at the site on july,and that he received no complaints about comet installation.see roy brothers drilling jones d.objection to declaration is properly overruled,despite declarant failure to make express assertion of personal knowledge,when declaration otherwise establishes such knowledge.
incident report 
jones also challenges summary judgment on other grounds arising from his receipt of tsa reports regarding his accident after respondents sought summary judgment.
underlying proceedings 
in seeking summary judgment,respondents relied upon jones deposition testimony,in which he referred to the pertinent machine as.jones original oppositions to the motions for summary judgment were filed on december.in the opposition to comet motion,jones applied for a continuance,asserting that his counsel,joseph andrews,saw some incident reports regarding jones accident and other documents in comet possession during a mediation on december.jones request for a continuance sought time to incorporate the documents into his o pposition,or leave to file any relevant documents obtained from comet as supplemental documents.according to the opposition,the incident reports identified the machine involved in the accident as,rather than.accompanying the opposition was a declaration from andrews,who stated that he was unable to file copies of the documents in question because the copies he had obtained by fax from comet were unreadable.
on december,jones filed supplemental pleadings in opposition to the summary judgment motions,as well as copies of the documents andrews had obtained from comet.among these documents are four tsa incident reports,including jones own report,which stated that his accident occurred at.comet reply responded that these reports failed to raise a triable issue of material fact because the pertinent machine designation code was irrelevant jones had testified that he and his lead knew about the hazard posed by the was involved in his accident.at the hearing on the motions,the trial court invited and heard argument on whether summary judgment was proper in light of the dispute over the designation code of the pertinent machine.in granting summary judgment,the trial court impliedly concluded that jones incident report did not raise a triable dispute about a material fact.
jones argues his incident report raised a triable issue of material fact regarding the identity of the machine involved in his accident the trial court denied him due process by permitting respondents to change their assertions regarding the identity of the pertinent machine in their moving papers and the trial court improperly denied his request for a continuance of the hearing on the motions.none of these contentions has merit.
the trial court properly determined that the incident reports did not preclude summary judgment.under the circumstances of this case,the precise designation code of the machine in question is irrelevant to the application of the completed and accepted doctrine.there is no dispute that the seismic anchors had been installed on the machine prior to jones accident 
moreover,the trial court properly granted summary judgment despite respondents initial designation of the pertinent machine as in their moving papers here,jones first submitted the incident reports in opposition to the motions for summary judgment,and the trial court accorded all the parties ample opportunity to address whether the reports raised a triable issue before it ruled on the summary judgment motions.there was no denial of due process 
finally,the trial court did not err in connection with jones request for a continuance.the summary judgment statute provides if it appears from the affidavits submitted in opposition to a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication or both that facts essential to justify opposition may exist but can not,for reasons stated,then be presented,the court shall deny the motion,or order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or discovery to be had or may make any other order as may be just.code civ,subd.h.we review the trial court ruling for abuse of discretion.scott ciba vision th,d.here,jones requested nothing more than an opportunity to submit the documents,including the incident reports,in opposition to the motions for summary judgment although the trial court did not expressly rule on this request,the record discloses that the trial court,in fact,permitted jones to submit the documents.there was no error.
motion for reconsideration 
jones contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for reconsideration.when,as here,a party files a motion under section for reconsideration of a ruling on a summary judgment motion,the trial court may not grant the motion unless it satisfies the requirements of section.le francois goel cal th,d,new york times superior court th,d new york times.as this court stated in new york times section,subdivision a requires that a motion for reconsideration be based on new or different facts,circumstances,or law.a party seeking reconsideration also must provide a satisfactory explanation for the failure to produce the evidence at an earlier time.citation.new york times,supra,th at,d.the trial court ruling on a motion for reconsideration under section is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.ibid.
in seeking reconsideration,jones contended that the trial court ruling on the summary judgment motions was based on multiple errors of law and a failure or refusal to consider the evidence presented in opposition to the motion s in addition,he contended that waldo deposition testimony,which was unavailable before the hearing on the motions,raised triable issues of fact.because jones first contention does not constitute a new fact or circumstance supporting reconsideration gilberd ac transit th,d,the focus of our inquiry is his second contention 
jones motion asserted that waldo,when deposed,testified that he had supervised and inspected comet work,that anchor bolts on some of the machines may have been too long,and that comet had been obliged to obtain the city final inspection and approval of the work on the building permit.the motion also argued that waldo had been unavailable for a deposition until january,after the hearing on the summary judgment motions.
in support of the motion,jones submitted evidence that he sought to depose lloyd person most knowledgeable in july,and noticed waldo deposition for november.jones also submitted a letter dated december,from his counsel,joseph andrews,to lloyd counsel,sandra montag.the letter stated after we noticed waldo deposition in,your office agreed to produce him for deposition,but requested that we defer the deposition until after the thanksgiving holiday.we hono
