when ball state student andrew bourne rushed onto a football field with a crowd that tore down a goalpost,the post fell on his back and rendered him paraplegic.he and his parents sued gilman gear,manufacturer of the post,in diversity under indiana law arguing that the post was defective and unreasonably dangerous because it was foreseeable that fans will tear down goalposts,the average fan would not understand the extent of the risk,and there are alternative designs that would reduce that risk.the district court granted summary judgment for gilman gear because the risk was obvious.we affirm.
we have taken the facts of this sad but straightforward case from the parties summary judgment papers,beginning with bourne testimony that,in october when he was old,he attended his tailgating party outside the game.near the end of the fourth quarter,he joined a crowd to storm the field in celebration of an imminent ball state victory.bourne himself did not rip down the post.he jumped and tried to grab it,missed,and walked away.with his back to the post,he heard a snap,and the post fell on his back,causing his injuries.although he knew that the post would collapse,he expected it to do so gradually.
as both parties agree,ball state itself encouraged the crowd to pull down goalposts with a flashing sign on the scoreboard that read,the goalpost looks lonely.indeed,the school had earlier resolved that controlling the crowd might prove even more dangerous than letting it tear down the goalposts.ball state is not a party now because it settled for a paltry,a limit imposed by state tort reform in the.
neil gilman,the president of gilman gear,testified that his company has known all along that fans sometimes tear down posts he also described his company posts.the posts,he explained,are about tall and weigh pounds.they are aluminum rather than steel because steel is heavier,harder to install,and tends to rust.and they are the slingshot style with one vertical support holding up the structure.this slingshot style was introduced in so as to minimize the danger posed to players in the end zone by the old goalposts with two vertical supports.notably,gilman gear did not design the posts itself instead,it bought the design in.to facilitate rolling of the metal in its newly assumed manufacturing process,gilman gear switched to a different,type of aluminum alloy than was used by the prior maker.when asked if his company had considered engineering controls to address hazards created by pulling down posts,gilman said no.
to avert summary judgment,the bournes submitted the affidavit of their expert,vaughn adams,a in safety engineering,who testified that reasonable manufacturers should foresee that goalposts will be torn down by fans.adams compiled numbers of football games in which students tore down posts in,in,in,in,and by october.adams also noted gilman testimony that he knew about some or all of those though not all were gilman gear posts.additionally,adams cited two newspaper articles reporting incidents of injury other than bourne,though he did not attempt to compile statistics.
in short,adams and the bournes theory is that,when fans try to pull them down,gilman gear aluminum posts will at first bend but then suddenly snap,abruptly falling on unwary fans whose lay knowledge of metallurgy lulls them into believing that goalposts fall gradually enough to permit a safe retreat.adams,however,did not testify to any science on which he based his opinion.for example,he offered only speculation to support his premise that social and cultural pressure misleads the average fan into believing that goalposts collapse slowly enough that ripping them down is safe.moreover,although he hinted that gilman gear change in aluminum alloy in rendered the posts more dangerous,he cited no evidence comparing the posts before and after the change.instead,his conclusions apparently rested on availability of alternative designs.the first of these alternative designs is the gooseneck,which reinforces the single vertical support with another support right next to it.second is a hinged goalpost,first introduced by the university of iowa in the,which permits the athletic facility to lower the posts immediately after a game.gilman gear itself began making and selling these posts after bourne injury at least one other company makes them,too.third,there is the or indestructible goalpost made by merchants environmental industries.this third kind is made out of steel,less likely to break than aluminum.but just as adams did not conduct tests on any posts manufactured by gilman gear,he did not test any other company posts or cite to any scientific data.instead,he presented just a few marketing materials distributed by makers of these alternative designs.while posts like the one that injured bourne cost per pair,the hinged posts cost and the indestructible posts between and.the cost of the rigs is not in the record.adams assumed that a analysis shows the pricier alternatives to be preferable in light of their greater safety and lower rate of replacement.he also opined that gilman gear was negligent for failing to test its posts to determine when they would break.
in granting summary judgment for gilman gear,the district court held that indiana law barred recovery for the bournes because it was obvious to a reasonable person that a collapsing goalpost poses a risk of serious injury.the court reasoned that andrew bourne subjective failure to appreciate the magnitude of the risk that a collapsing post might strike his back and take away the use of his legs did not alter the fact that the risk of injury was obvious as a matter of law and,consequently,that the post was not unreasonably dangerous.in so holding the district court acknowledged that in indiana the open and obvious rule is no longer an absolute bar to a claim under the products liability act against a manufacturer,but the court reasoned that the principle remains relevant and,in this case,was decisive.
ii.analysis 
on appeal the bournes maintain that the open and obvious rule can not bar a claim for defective design under the indiana products liability act.relying on mesman crane pro,cir,they insist that they can win despite the obviousness of the risk if they can nonetheless prove through the application of the classic formulation of negligence that gilman gear should have adopted a reasonable alternative design.
the relevant law is codified in the indiana products liability act.to.although the act originally applied only to strict liability for manufacturing defects and failure to warn,it was amended in to apply to claims of defective design,which traditionally sound in negligence.mesman,at.compare with id.the law was in,but without relevant change.compare to effective july,with to.
a plaintiff bringing an action under the act must establish that he or she was harmed by a product the product was sold in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to any user or consumer the plaintiff was a foreseeable user or consumer the defendant was in the business of selling the product and the product reached the consumer or user in the condition it was sold.see see also moss crosman,cir.
at the outset,we note that indiana is a state and contributory negligence is not a complete bar unless the plaintiff bears more than of the blame for his own injury,see also smith baxter.what is more,misuse is not a bar unless the misuse was not reasonably expected by the seller.see also morgen ford motor.likewise,the statute protects any bystander injured by the product who would reasonably be expected to be in the vicinity of the product during its reasonably expected use.see also stegemoller acands.mindful of these rules and neil gilman testimony that his company actually foresaw the fans vandalism,gilman gear does not argue that the claim should be barred on the basis of misuse or bourne fault.consequently,we need not pass on whether this is a case in which no reasonable jury could find that the plaintiff was less responsible for his own injury than others were,see,barnard saturn,a div.of motors.
the only question presented by the parties is whether the goalpost wa
