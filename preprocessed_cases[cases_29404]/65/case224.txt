plaintiff jocelyn tompkin sued the defendant tobacco companies,alleging that her husband,david tompkin,died as a result of smoking cigarettes sold by the defendants tompkin asserted statutory and common law products liability claims.after this court reversed the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants,the case proceeded to trial.a jury found for the defendants,and tompkin now appeals.
tompkin raises three issues on appeal.specifically,she claims that the district court erred by admitting surprise testimony from a defense expert that there was an association between tompkin asbestos exposure and an elevated risk of lung cancer,excluding certain evidence that she proffered in particular,evidence concerning research and groups associated with the tobacco industry,evidence concerning tobacco companies,evidence from prior proceedings,and evidence concerning the defendants conduct after the date that her husband quit smoking,and refusing to charge the jury on her consumer expectations claim under the ohio products liability act.because tompkin has not shown that she was prejudiced by any of these alleged errors,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
david tompkin history of smoking and lung cancer 
david tompkin began smoking in,at the age of sixteen,and he quit in,at the age of.his smoking history was as follows 
tompkin was exposed to asbestos and other pollutants in the course of his career.after graduating from high school in,he worked at stalwart rubber company in the curing room.from to,he worked as a bricklayer apprentice,and from to,he worked as a bricklayer.in,he started a construction company.during this work,he was heavily exposed to asbestos,and he was exposed to brick dust,cement dust,mortar,lime,and effluvia.finally,tompkin had a family history of cancer.
on june,tompkin was diagnosed with lung cancer.he died on february,at the age of.
tompkin lawsuit and the trial 
on june,tompkin and her husband,then still alive,filed suit against the defendants in the united states district court for the northern district of ohio.tompkin was substituted for her husband,as administratrix of his estate,after his death.in her amended complaint,tompkin asserted the following claims strict liability negligent,willful and wanton misconduct fraud and misrepresentation strict liability for misrepresentation express warranty implied warranty conspiracy and concerted action and derivative claims for wrongful death and loss of consortium.
on august,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.it held that tompkin first five claims were governed by the ohio product liabilities act opla and that opla common knowledge bars claims for damages from risks which are common knowledge applied to these claims.tompkin am.brands,d.it also held that opla preempted breach of implied warranty claims and that tompkin failed to establish that her husband relied on any statements by the defendants,as required to sustain her fraud and conspiracy claims.id.at.finally,it held that,by definition,tompkin derivative claims failed when the underlying claims failed.id.at.
on july,this court reversed,in part,the district court grant of summary judgment.we concluded that tompkin had established a genuine issue of material fact on the extent of common knowledge of the nexus between smoking and lung cancer,and we reversed the grant of summary judgment on her opla claims.tompkin am.brands,cir.additionally,we reversed the district court holding that opla preempted tompkin breach of implied warranty claim.id.at.however,we affirmed the district court holding that opla preempted her negligent,willful and wanton misconduct claim.id.at.
the trial commenced on september,and comprised approximately seven days of testimony.at trial,tompkin advanced a failure to warn claim under opla,a consumer expectations claim under opla,and a breach of implied warranty claim.however,the district court refused to instruct the jury on tompkin consumer expectations claim,reasoning that there was no testimony to support the claim.
at trial,tompkin presented fourteen witnesses,including family and close friends of her husband.tompkin and two of her daughters testified about their relationships with tompkin and about the effect of his cancer on him and his family.similarly,tompkin business partner,and coworker,testified about tompkin work and his smoking habits.finally,in a videotaped deposition,tompkin testified about his history of smoking,his lack of awareness of the dangers of smoking,his medical history,his history of employment,and the impact of his cancer on his personal and professional life.
tompkin also presented testimony from the physicians who treated her husband.tompkin family physician,his two oncologists,and his surgeon testified about the diagnosis and treatment of his lung cancer.additionally,his oncologist opined,as the treating physician,not as an expert witness,that cigarette smoking caused tompkin lung cancer.
tompkin also presented expert testimony on her failure to warn claim,the defendants common knowledge defense,and the cause of tompkin cancer.alan blum,a professor of family medicine at the university of alabama school of medicine,tuscaloosa branch,testified in support of tompkin failure to warn claim.a historian,he traced the history of medical literature on the connection between smoking and lung cancer.he concluded that by the case was closed that smoking was the leading cause of lung cancer.based on this conclusion,he opined that the defendants knew in,or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known in,about a risk that was associated with their cigarettes and lung cancer,and the defendants should have issued warnings or instructions in as to the risks of smoking tobacco,particularly cigarettes,and insofar as its causing lung cancer is concerned.
tom smith,the director of the general social survey at the national opinion research center at the university of chicago,testified in response to the defendants common knowledge defense.he reviewed polling conducted between and on the connection between smoking and lung cancer.in particular,he described six gallup polls which,averaged together,showed that only of the respondents believed that smoking caused lung cancer.based on this investigation,he opined that the ordinary person with ordinary knowledge common to the community did not recognize the nature and the extent of the link between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer between the years and.he explained that based on the particular data here from gallup as well as other data we looked at about what causes cancer and people beliefs about what harms come from smoking,the data clearly indicates that people did not make a strong link in that period between smoking and lung cancer.
joseph tomashefski,a pathologist,testified about the cause of tompkin cancer.he testified that,in connection with the autopsy of tompkin,he reviewed tompkin history of smoking and ordered an asbestos fiber burden test on tissue samples,which revealed a high load of asbestos fibers in tompkin lungs.based on this information,he concluded that tompkin cancer was due to the combined effect of his cigarette smoking and his exposure to asbestos.he explained that asbestos interacts with cigarette smoking by a process that we call synergy whereby they have an effect which is beyond an additive effect of each of their potencies.he also testified that asbestos was a relatively weak carcinogen,and that he had never seen a case of lung cancer involving asbestos alone without any history of smoking.
david sidransky,the director of head,neck,and cancer research at johns hopkins university,also testified about the cause of tompkin cancer.sidransky performed a loss of heterozygosity analysis an loh analysis on tissue samples from tompkin.he explained that chromosomal changes occur in cancerous cells including the loss of chromosomal arms that contain growth suppressing genes and that certain of these changes occur much more frequently in cancer victims who have smoked than in cancer victims who have not smoked.applying loh analysis,he determined that many of these chromosomal changes associated with smoking had occurred in cancer cells from tompkin.based on this finding,he opined that smoking was a major contribution to tompkin lung cancer.
finally,john burke,a retired professor of economics,testified about tompkin loss of future earning capacity.
the defendants presented four witnesses,all of whom were experts.joan hoff,a professor of history at ohio university,testified in support of the defendants common knowledge defense.at the request of defense counsel,she had researched discussions of smoking and lung cancer in national magazines,regional newspapers,legislative materials,and educational materials during the period from to to determine commonly held attitudes or common knowledge or common information available to the average person about the link between lung cancer and cigarette smoking.based on her research,she opined that the link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer was common knowledge in the united states and,in particular,in ohio between and.
the remaining defense witnesses concentrated on the proximate cause issue.david parkinson,a professor of medicine at the state university of new york at stony brook and director of the long island occupational and environmental health center,testified about tompkin exposure to various carcinogens.he asserted that a smoker can reduce his risk of lung cancer by quitting smoking,but that asbestos is very resistant to elimination by the body,and it is not possible to cut down the risk from cumulative asbestos exposure.based on his review of tompkin deposition and medical records,he opined that tompkin was likely exposed to asbestos and other carcinogens while working in the curing department at stallworth rubber company and while working as a bricklayer on certain construction sites.he further opined that the most significant exposure that induced tompkin lung cancer was his asbestos exposure and that,because of the small amount of cigarette smoking,and the length of time that passed after he had stopped smoking,smoking was not a proximate cause of his cancer.
edwin bradley,a biostatistician,testified about the epidemiological association between lung cancer and tompkin asbestos exposure and smoking.using data collected by the american cancer society,he compared the incidence of lung cancer in a cohort of individuals with smoking histories similar to tompkin to the incidence of lung cancer in a cohort of individuals with no history of smoking.using this same data,he also compared the incidence of lung cancer in a cohort of individuals with smoking histories and asbestos exposure similar to tompkin with a cohort of individuals with similar asbestos exposure but who never smoked.finally,using the same data,he compared the incidence of lung cancer in a cohort of individuals with smoking histories and asbestos exposure similar to tompkin with the incidence of lung cancer in a cohort of individuals with no asbestos exposure.
he then calculated the relative risk of lung cancer from tompkin level of smoking and asbestos exposure,meaning the ratio of the incidence of the disease in the cohorts with tompkin smoking history asbestos exposure to the incidence of the disease in the cohort and the cohort without asbestos exposure.bradley explained that a relative risk of is the is no increased,or decreased,risk from the that the relative risk must be at least to support a conclusion that the exposure is associated with the disease.he further explained that this method of analysis establishes only a statistical association it does not establish individual causation.
bradley concluded that tompkin cancer was not associated with smoking but was associated with asbestos exposure.he determined that the relative risk from smoking was,and,based on this figure,he opined that tompkin smoking history was not associated with an increased risk of developing lung cancer.similarly,he determined that the relative risk of smoking to individuals with asbestos exposure was,and,based on this figure,he opined that tompkin smoking did not add to his risk of developing lung cancer a bove that risk that he would have had from asbestos exposure alone.conversely,he determined that the relative risk from asbestos exposure was between and and he opined that there was an association between the exposure of the type to asbestos that tompkin had and an elevated risk of developing lung cancer.
tompkin objected to bradley testimony concerning the relative risk from asbestos exposure,and to the use of demonstrative exhibits in connection with this testimony,on the ground that bradley had not disclosed this information in his expert report.the district court overruled tompkin objection.
finally,peter mccue,the chief of anatomic pathology and a professor of pathology at thomas jefferson university hospital in philadelphia,testified about his examination of tissue samples from tompkin.he testified that he did not detect any of the normal changes,such as damage to the bronchial epithelium,macrophages,and mucous lining hyperplasia,in tompkin pathology specimens conversely,he testified that he did detect asbestos fibers,quartz dust,and mineral fibers,as well as disease process,in the specimens.based on this analysis,he opined that tompkin cancer most likely resulted from his occupational exposure to silicates and asbestos and that his examination revealed no pathological or biochemical evidence that showed that he had an effect from cigarette smoking.
the jury found for the defendants,and on october,judgment was entered in favor of the defendants.on october,tompkin moved for a new trial,arguing that the district court had erred by permitting surprise testimony from bradley,excluding evidence concerning organizations affiliated with the tobacco industry,excluding evidence concerning tobacco companies,excluding evidence from prior cases,excluding evidence concerning punitive damages and failing to charge the jury on punitive damages,excluding evidence concerning activities of the defendants,and failing to charge the jury on tompkin consumer expectations theory under opla.
on january,the district court denied tompkin motion for a new trial.the court concluded that it had erred by failing to sustain tompkin timely objections to bradley testimony that asbestos was associated with tompkin cancer because,the court determined,the testimony directly conflicted with bradley statement in his expert report that it is not possible to determine to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty which of the risk factors,smoking or asbestos exposure or other risk factors,contributed to tompkin lung cancer,and the introduction of,three bar graphs that illustrated bradley testimony concerning the relative risk of lung cancer associated with tompkin asbestos were not identified in bradley expert report and which contained information not disclosed in the expert report.however,the court concluded that its errors did not justify a new trial,reasoning that the errors were not prejudicial as mccue testimony was far more devastating than bradley testimony.the court memorandum opinion denying tompkin new trial motion did not discuss tompkin other arguments.
on march,tompkin filed a timely notice of appeal.

the district court admission of the surprise testimony of bradley 
the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying tompkin motion for a new trial based on surprise testimony by edwin bradley,a defense expert on the causation issue.the district court properly concluded that tompkin did not meet her burden of demonstrating prejudice from the admission of bradley testimony.
tompkin argues that bradley failed to disclose in his expert report his testimony that there was an association between level of asbestos exposure and lung cancer.in his expert report,bradley wrote,in relevant part,
epidemiology addresses whether a disease is statistically associated with an exposure in a population,not in individuals.the question of individual causation,sometimes referred to as specific causation,is beyond the domain of the science of epidemiology.even in populations,the existence of a statistical association does not necessarily mean that two events are causally related.epidemiology provides information relevant to reaching a conclusion regarding general association,but can not alone prove causation in an individual.
statistical associations between exposure and disease or mortality from epidemiologic studies are usually measure as relative risks rrs or odds ratios ors.a relative risk is defined as the ratio of the incidence of disease or mortality in the exposed group to the incidence of disease or mortality in the unexposed group.for example,if the incidence of cancer among the exposed group is in and the incidence among the unexposed group is in,then the relative risk is 
i regard relative risks below as too weak to support a conclusion that an exposure is associated with a disease.
i have performed generally accepted statistical analyses of the data in this file addressing the question of whether there is an increased risk of lung cancer in the group of males cohort enrolled in a large epidemiological study conducted by the american cancer society called cancer prevention study ii who had quit smoking between the ages of and,had remained abstinent for between and years,and had a smoking history of to before quitting.this smoking history is similar to that of tompkin,who smoked between and,at which time he quit.
the comparison group consisted of males in the study who had never smoked.
based on this analysis,i will testify that i could find no statistically significant association for the cohort described in paragraph above and an increased risk of lung cancer.i will also testify that the relative risk i calculated,in addition to not being statistically significant,was less than.consequently,an attributable risk calculation shows that more probably than not,smoking is not related to lung cancer for this cohort.further,i will testify that there is no statistical association between tompkin smoking from to and an increased risk of death from lung cancer in.it is a general scientific principle that when no statistically significant association is found between an exposure and a disease,the question of causation is moot.
i expect to opine to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that the epidemiological studies on asbestos exposure and cigarette smoking do not establish that the best model for describing the relative risks is multiplicative 
i also examined the data file to investigate the association between asbestos exposure,smoking and lung cancer.
i have performed generally accepted statistical analyses of the data in this file addressing the question of whether there is an increased risk of lung cancer in the group of males cohort enrolled in who indicated on the questionnaire that they had been exposed to asbestos and had quit smoking for between and years.this smoking and asbestos exposure history is similar to that of tompkin.
the comparison cohort consisted of males in the study who indicated on the questionnaire that they had been exposed to asbestos,and had never smoked.
based on this analysis,i will testify that i could find no statistically significant association for the cohort described in paragraph above and an increased risk of lung cancer.i will also testify that the relative risk i calculated,in addition to not being statistically significant,was less than.consequently,an attributable risk calculation shows that more probably than not,smoking is not related to lung cancer for this cohort.further,i will testify that even with consideration of his asbestos exposure,there is no statistical association between tompkin smoking from to and an increased risk of death from lung cancer in.it is a general scientific principle that when no statistically significant association is found between an exposure and a disease,the question of causation is moot.
based on further analyses of the data,i will testify that the joint risk of asbestos exposure and smoking on the development of lung cancer is best described by an additive,not multiplicative,model.
i will also testify that it is not possible to determine to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty which of the risk factors,smoking or asbestos exposure or other risk factors,contributed to tompkin lung cancer,when the only available data are from epidemiological studies.the difficulties of disentangling the relationship among several factors while attempting to control for confounding have been recognized in the scientific community.
at emphasis in original.
at trial,bradley opined that there was an association between the exposure of the type to asbestos that tompkin had and an elevated risk of developing lung cancer.at.he testified that,using the data in,he calculated the relative risk of developing lung cancer due to asbestos exposure,he measured a cohort of persons who never smoked but who were exposed to asbestos against a cohort of persons who never smoked and who were never exposed to.at.he further testified that the medical literature sets the relative risk of lung cancer for patients who have asbestosis,and thus have a high level of asbestos exposure,at.at.thus,he concluded that tompkin relative risk of developing lung cancer from asbestos exposure was between and and,as a pathological exam performed by tomashefski,one of the plaintiff experts,revealed a fiber burden in tompkin lungs consistent with asbestosis,his relative risk was probably closer to the level.at.
in connection with this testimony,bradley used three exhibits,each titled analysis of tompkin risk profile,which illustrate his findings on tompkin relative risk of developing lung cancer from smoking and from asbestos exposure.the first exhibit was a bar graph depicting tompkin relative risk from smoking as,a figure which the graph describes as not statistically significant.at.the second exhibit was a bar graph depicting tompkin relative risk from smoking as and his relative risk from asbestos as,figures which the graph describes as not statistically significant and statistically significant,respectively.at.the third exhibit was a bar graph depicting tompkin relative risk from smoking as,his relative risk from asbestos as,and his relative risk from asbestosis as,figures which are labeled not statistically significant and statistically significant,respectively.at.in the second and third exhibits,the bar representing tompkin relative risk from smoking is colored blue,and the bars representing his relative risk from asbestos and asbestosis are colored red.at.
during the trial,the district court overruled tompkin objection to bradley testimony concerning the relation between tompkin exposure to asbestos and his lung cancer.after the verdict,the district court denied tompkin motion for a new trial,which motion contended,in part,that bradley had not disclosed in his expert report his testimony that tompkin asbestos exposure gave him an elevated risk of developing lung cancer.in denying the motion,the district court concluded that it had erred in overruling tompkin objection,as the defendants had violated federal rule of civil procedure a b by not disclosing the exhibits and the related testimony in bradley report.however,the court further concluded that its error was not prejudicial,given the strength of the defendants other witnesses.specifically,the court found 
the testimony of the defense witness,mccue,was well documented and supported by his examination of the slides of the decedent lung tissue and also supported by the negative findings of tomashefski as to the and genes.in the court view,that testimony,which followed bradley testimony,was far more devastating than bradley testimony about epidemiology associations.
on appeal,tompkin challenges the admission of bradley testimony that tompkin relative risk of developing cancer from asbestos exposure was between and and the use of the exhibits in connection with this testimony.she contends that,as the district court concluded,the defendants violated federal rule of civil procedure a b by not disclosing this testimony and the exhibits in bradley expert report.she argues that this testimony was directly inconsistent with bradley report,which stated,among other things,that it is not possible to determine to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty which of the risk factors,smoking or asbestos exposure or other risk factors,contributed to tompkin lung cancer.at.further,she asserts that she was prejudiced by this surprise testimony because her counsel were unable to prepare adequately for of bradley and were unable to present responsive testimony,and because bradley testimony dramatically bolstered defendants theory of causation essentially the only defense in the case.appellant br.at.
the defendants counter that bradley properly disclosed the testimony in his expert report.they note that paragraph of the report states that bradley will testify about the epidemiological studies on asbestos exposure,cigarette smoking and lung cancer,and that paragraph advised that bradley analyzed a cohort with a smoking and asbestos history similar to that of tompkin.at.they also argue that paragraph is not inconsistent with bradley testimony,explaining that paragraph simply states that an epidemiologist can not offer an opinion as to which risk factor caused tompkin cancer,and that bradley simply testified to a statistical association between tompkin cancer and asbestos exposure.
the defendants argue,in the alternative,that any violation of rule a was not prejudicial.they contend that the testimony was disclosed to tompkin during bradley deposition and in bradley reliance materials.they also contend that tompkin was not harmed by the admission of the testimony,given that tompkin admitted that asbestos contributed to her husband cancer and that two other defense experts,mccue and parkinson,testified that asbestos was a cause of tompkin cancer.
rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure requires an expert witness to provide a written reporting containing,inter alia,a complete statement of all opinions to be expressed and the basis and reasons therefor,and any exhibits to be used as a summary of or support for the opinions.a b.rule provides that a party that without substantial justification fails to disclose information required by rule a is not,unless such failure is harmless,permitted to use as evidence at trial any witness or information not so disclosed.c.rule further provides that i n addition to or in lieu of this sanction,the court may impose other appropriate sanctions.id.
clearly,the defendants failed to comply with federal rule of civil procedure a.it is true the testimony in question was arguably consistent with paragraph of bradley report.on one reading,paragraph states that it is not possible to determine from epidemiological studies whether smoking or asbestos was the medical cause of tompkin cancer,whereas,in the challenged testimony,bradley opined that there was a statistical association between lung cancer and tompkin level of asbestos exposure.in any event,the report does not state that bradley will testify that tompkin had an elevated risk of developing lung cancer due to his exposure to asbestos let alone that his relative risk was between and,and rule a would require such a statement paragraphs through,which the defendants argue disclose the testimony,merely state in general terms,that bradley will testify about the association between asbestos exposure,cigarette smoking,and lung cancer,that bradley will testify that an additive,rather than a multiplicative,model best describes the joint risk of smoking and asbestos exposure,and that bradley will testify that the relative risk of tompkin level of smoking to someone who has been exposed to asbestos is less than.at.none of this information alerts the reader that bradley will testify about the increased risk of lung cancer from asbestos exposure 
however,tompkin has not shown that the district court finding that she was not prejudiced by the admission of the testimony was clearly erroneous.other defense experts testified about the connection between tompkin cancer and his asbestos terms of specific causation rather than mere associations.parkinson,a physician specializing in occupational medicine opined that the most significant exposure that induced tompkin lung cancer was his asbestos exposure over the many years he was exposed to asbestos and that smoking was not a proximate cause of tompkin lung cancer.at.peter mccue,a surgical pathologist,testified that he examined tissue samples from tompkin lungs and found evidence of damage from exposure to asbestos and mineral fibers but no evidence of damage from smoking.at.he opined that tompkin cancer most likely resulted from occupational exposure to silicates and asbestos and that smoking was not a proximate cause of tompkin cancer at.
moreover,tompkin conceded that asbestos contributed to her husband cancer.see at testimony of plaintiff expert,joseph tomashefski,a pathologist,that asbestos interacted with the cigarette smoke as to cause his lung cancer at testimony of tomashefski that tompkin cancer was due to the combined effect of his cigarette smoking and his exposure to asbestos at opening argument that tobacco and asbestos caused tompkin lung cancer 
in denying tompkin motion for a new trial,the district court concluded that mccue testimony was far more devastating than bradley testimony about epidemiology associations.at.we have not found anything in the record or the parties briefs that undermines this conclusion,and we can not say that the exclusion of the testimony would have caused a different outcome at trial.morales,at citation omitted.in sum,we do not have a definite and firm conviction that the trial court committed a clear error of judgment.tobin,at citation omitted.
the district court exclusion of evidence proffered by tompkin 
introduction 
tompkin argues that the district court erred by excluding four categories of evidence evidence concerning research and public relations organizations affiliated with the tobacco industry evidence concerning tobacco companies deposition testimony from other lawsuits and evidence.however,tompkin has not explained the relevance of any specific piece of evidence,either making a generalized assertion that a category of evidence is relevant and leaving the court to sift through hundreds of pages of documents or thousands of pages of deposition testimony in an effort to divine the relevance of particular items,or failing to identify the specific pieces of evidence excluded by the district court at all.moreover,tompkin has made no effort to explain how she was prejudiced by the exclusion of the evidence.consequently,we can not conclude that the district court abused its discretion in excluding the evidence or that the exclusion of the evidence was prejudicial.
this court reviews a district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion,and a district court determination will be reversed only if the abuse of discretion caused more than harmless error.argentine united steelworkers of,cir trepel roadway,cir.broad discretion is given to district courts in determinations of admissibility based on considerations of relevance and prejudice,and those decisions will not be lightly overturned.united states,cir.as a leading treatise observes,c laims of error with regard to the admission or exclusion of evidence are prime candidates for application of the harmless error rule.charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure ed.
as defined by the federal rules of evidence,relevant evidence is evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.all relevant evidence is admissible.however,
although relevant,evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,or misleading the jury,or by considerations of undue delay,waste of time,or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.
exclusion of evidence concerning tobacco industry groups 
tompkin contends that the district court erred by excluding evidence concerning certain research and public relations groups affiliated with the tobacco industry.however,tompkin has not shown that any specific document was relevant or that the exclusion of any specific document resulted in prejudice.
on august,the district court entered an order tentatively granting the defendants motion in limine to exclude evidence or allegations concerning the council for tobacco research ctr,the tobacco industry research committee tirc,the tobacco institute,ti,and hill knowlton h k on september,after considering additional briefing by the parties,the district court refused to overrule its original ruling.the district court did not explain its rationale for excluding the evidence in either order.on december,the district court denied tompkin motion for a new trial without discussing tompkin argument that it had erred by excluding evidence concerning the tobacco industry groups.
on appeal,tompkin asserts,in broad terms,that evidence concerning ctr,tirc,ti,and h k was relevant.specifically,she contends that the efforts of these groups are highly relevant to the issues of common knowledge,as well as to consumer expectations,failure to warn,and punitive damages,apparently because these groups allegedly attempted to mislead the public about the dangers of cigarette smoking.she points to internal memoranda concerning the formation of,and the activities of,tirc and ti,press releases by tirc,ti,and newsletters published by examples of evidence wrongfully excluded by the district court ruling.however,she does not explain how any specific piece of evidence was relevant or how the exclusion of any specific piece of evidence inflicted prejudice.
tompkin has not shown that she was prejudiced by the district court ruling.before this court,tompkin merely asserts that this category of documents is relevant to an array of issues,making no effort to demonstrate the relevance of particular documents or to explain how she was prejudiced by the exclusion of particular documents.without such information,we can not say that the trial court committed a clear error of judgment or that tompkin suffered prejudice 
exclusion of evidence concerning tobacco companies 
the district court exclusion of evidence concerning tobacco companies does not constitute grounds for a new trial,as tompkin has not demonstrated that the district court improperly excluded any specific piece of evidence or that the exclusion of any specific piece of evidence was prejudicial.
on august,the district court entered an order tentatively granting the defendants motion in limine to exclude evidence of or reference to conduct or documents of tobacco companies.on september,after considering additional briefing by the parties,the district court refused to overrule its original ruling.the district court did not explain its rationale for excluding the evidence in either order.on december,the district court denied tompkin motion for a new trial without discussing tompkin argument that it had erred by excluding evidencing concerning tobacco companies.
on appeal,tompkin argues that the district court erred by excluding evidence concerning tobacco companies.speaking in the most general terms,she contends that this evidence was relevant because evidence showing that other tobacco companies knew of the dangers of smoking indicates that the defendants should have known of the dangers as well and,hence,should have warned consumers of the dangers.she has not identified any specific piece of evidence that was excluded by the district court ruling.
given tompkin failure to direct the court to the specific pieces of evidence that she was prevented from introducing,we can not say that the district court committed reversible error.it is impossible to determine whether the evidence that tompkin intended to present was relevant or whether the evidence should have been excluded under federal rule of evidence without knowledge of the substance of the testimony or documents.likewise,it is impossible to say that tompkin was prejudiced by the exclusion of the evidence simply on the basis of tompkin generalized assertion that the evidence was relevant.
exclusion of deposition testimony from other proceedings 
the district court exclusion of deposition testimony from other proceedings does not constitute reversible error,as tompkin has not established that she was prejudiced by the exclusion of the testimony.
on appeal,tompkin complains that she was not allowed to present the following deposition testimony testimony from robert heimann,the former president and ceo of the american tobacco company,regarding warnings appellant reply br.at testimony from frederick panzer,an employee of ti starting in,that the tobacco industry had employed a holding strategy of creating doubt about the health charge without actually denying it and advocating the public right to smoke,without actually urging them to take up the practice id.at testimony from bennett lebow,who acquired ownership of liggett group,in the,that the tobacco companies were all lying regarding the defenses they were making including cigarettes causing disease id.at testimony from irwin tucker,an employee of a tobacco company,that,at the december meeting where tobacco company presidents created tirc to respond to adverse publicity from medical research linking smoking to lung cancer,there was no discussion whether the tobacco companies should issue warnings to smokers regarding the health risks id.at testimony from joseph cullman,the former ceo of philip morris,that his company took the position that it had not been proved that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer and that the tobacco industry endeavored to point out to the public a controversy about smoking and health concerns id.at testimony from alexander white spears,iii,the former chairman and ceo of lorillard tobacco,that his company would have kept selling cigarettes as long as they were a legal product,regardless of whether there were several definitive studies showing smoking causes lung cancer id.at testimony from carl thompson,a former employee of h k,that ti position with respect to tobacco and health was basically a theme of scientific controversy id.at testimony from william kloepfer,an employee of ti starting in,about the use of the cigarette controversy since at least ti inception in id.at and testimony from walker merryman,a spokesman for ti,that one of ti purposes was to convince the public that we are vitally interested in getting the facts that would provide answers to questions about smoking and health.id.at.
assuming that this testimony was relevant and not excludable under federal rule of evidence and also assuming that the testimony was not inadmissible hearsay tompkin has not shown that she was prejudiced by the exclusion of this testimony.she has not identified the specific testimony that she believes was erroneously excluded,has not matched the testimony of specific individuals to specific issues,and has not made any attempt to explain how her case was prejudiced by the exclusion of the testimony.accordingly,we can not conclude that the evidence would have caused a different outcome at trial.in re air crash disaster,cir 
exclusion of evidence 
the district court exclusion of evidence does not constitute reversible error,as tompkin has not shown that she was prejudiced by the exclusion of the evidence.
on april,the district court entered an order granting,in part,the defendants motion to exclude evidence.it interpreted this court prior ruling to endorse the use of evidence in support of tompkin argument that there was no common knowledge in of a direct link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer.however,it ruled that any evidence must relate to the common knowledge issue,and it specifically ruled that evidence was not relevant to the issue of punitive damages.on august,the district court denied tompkin motion to reconsider its april ruling.on december,the district court denied tompkin motion for a new trial without discussing tompkin argument that it had erred by excluding evidence.
on appeal,tompkin rests on bald argument.her discussion of this issue follows 
post evidence is relevant and should not have been excluded since the factors to be considered in determining punitive damages as set forth above included a number of items which necessarily involve post injury activity.defendants engaged in a continuing course of deceitful conduct throughout the period tompkin smoked and for many years thereafter.evidence regarding events subsequent to will explain defendants motives,intent and knowledge prior to.this relates to plaintiff failure to warn and consumer expectation claims.and evidence of defendants post routine practices of distorting the health risks of smoking is relevant and admissible under evid.

with only this information before us,we are unable to say that the district court abused its discretion in excluding evidence.to the extent that the evidence relates to punitive damages,any error was harmless as the jury did not reach the issue of damages.see miller caterpillar tractor,cir holding that any error in the admission of evidence relating to damages was harmless as the jury never reached the issue of damages and therefore the testimony could not have contributed to its verdict of no cause of action.to the extent that the evidence relates to her failure to warn and consumer expectations claims,tompkin has not identified the excluded evidence nor explained how the evidence would have illuminated the defendants motive,intent and knowledge prior to.we therefore can not conclude that the district court erred,much less that any error caused prejudice.
the district court refusal to instruct the jury on tompkin consumer expectations theory 
the district court refusal to instruct the jury on tompkin consumer expectations theory does not constitute grounds for a new trial,as any error was harmless,given that the district court did instruct the jury on a virtually indistinguishable claim.

even assuming for the sake of argument that tompkin created a triable issue as to her consumer expectations theory,the district court refusal to instruct the jury on this claim was harmless error.the district court did instruct the jury on tompkin breach of implied warranty claim,a cause of action that is virtually indistinguishable from a design defect claim under opla.tompkin,at quoting temple wean united,ohio,see also white depuy,ohio app d,ohio observing that the two theories have been used interchangeably and analyzed together internal quotation omitted.at least under the present facts,the elements of a consumer expectations claim and a breach of implied warranty claim are materially indistinguishable and the district court instruction on tompkin breach of implied warranty claim paralleled the pattern instruction for a consumer expectations claim consequently,we can not conclude that the district court refusal to instruct the jury on the consumer expectations claim resulted in prejudice.
