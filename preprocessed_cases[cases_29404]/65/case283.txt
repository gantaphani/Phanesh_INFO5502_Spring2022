background 
on april,torres filed her original petition later amended alleging,among other things,she was a resident of texas when her physician issued her a prescription for baycol,a drug manufactured and sold by bayer.torres claimed the drug caused her serious and permanent damaging injuries,and sued bayer for negligence in manufacturing the drug,and strict products liability for a failure to warn and breach of warranty of merchantability.bayer removed the case to the united states district court for the district of minnesota based upon diversity jurisdiction under a.torres case then was transferred to the in re baycol products litigation.during the course of the litigation,torres moved to california,where she died on or about april.
on april,bayer filed a.a notice,suggesting torres had died.on july,bayer filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that torres wa s deceased and no motion to substitute parties was filed within days as required by federal rule of civil procedure a.on july,torres counsel filed an unopposed motion for enlargement of time to join the proper parties.
torres counsel filed a motion to substitute as plaintiffs nicole hampton and stephanie,the natural daughters and sole heirs of the deceased plaintiff,melinda torres.torres counsel included with the motion a memorandum of law and a joint affidavit of heirship by hampton and.in their affidavit,hampton and swore they were melinda torres natural daughters and only children.the district court found appellants failed to demonstrate they had the legal right or authority to pursue plaintiff claims on her behalf,and provided appellants with days to submit evidence demonstrating that nicole hampton and stephanie are proper parties under.
appellants responded to the district court order by filing a proof of heirship status as distributees,along with a copy of appellants birth certificates,and separate affidavits.the proof of heirship declared torres died without a will,survived only by natural daughters,sole heirs,and sole distributees of torres estate.the filing further stated there was no need for an administration of torres estate because the pending action against bayer was the only asset the estate possessed.thus,appellants asked the district court to accept the proof of heirship and appellants status as sole distributees of torres estate without requiring an administration of the estate.the attached affidavits stated torres died without a will,appellants were torres daughters,and appellants could not afford the cost of pursuing a probate administration proceeding in california.the appellants both asked the district court to enter an o rder recognizing our status as sole heirs and distributees of our mother so they could substitute as plaintiffs in the case.
once again,the district court found appellants evidence insufficient to establish appellants were the proper parties for purposes of substitution.the district court declared an affirmative statement that torres had no other heirs was n otably absent from appellants affidavits.the court was particularly concerned by the lack of evidence as to torres s marital status at the time of her death.the district court concluded,
without affirmative evidence torres has no other heirs or that no person has a superior right to commence the action or proceeding or to be substituted for the decedent in a pending action,see of civ.and,the court is not convinced appellants are proper parties for substitution.
the district court granted appellants another days to submit evidence establishing that appellants are proper parties under rule.specifically,that appellants are the sole heirs to torres s estate,and that no other person has a superior right to be substituted in this action.
appellants responded to the district court order by submitting another filing for further submission of proof of heirship status as distributees.appellants included with their filing a letter their mother had written,presumably many years before her death,stating appellants were her only daughters,appointing a guardian over them,and noting the children grew up without a father an affidavit from a relative stating the letter was in torres handwriting a printed program from torres memorial service and appellants joint affidavit.in their joint affidavit,appellants declared they were the sole descendants of melinda torres and therefore the sole d istributees of her right to bring a law suit for personal injuries she suffered while she was alive for her wrongful death.
absent from appellants joint affidavit was any discussion of their mother marital status at the time of her death.the attached program from torres memorial service did include an obituary.the obituary stated torres left behind her daughters,hampton and,and named several other relatives,but made no mention of a spouse.appellants requested,if the district court found the filing and attached evidence insufficient to prove appellants status as distributees,the c ourt hold an evidentiary hearing to resolve any claims or suspicions by any party or authority that additional heirs of melinda torres exist.
on november,the district court denied appellants motion to substitute as plaintiffs for their deceased mother,melinda torres.the district court noted appellants had previously failed to provide sufficient proof pursuant to california law,that they had the legal right to pursue torres claims.the district court added,in their latest submissions,the prospective plaintiffs did not submit any additional evidence addressing torres marital status or whether torres had additional heirs besides appellants.the court then granted bayer motion to dismiss torres case.appellants moved for a new hearing,which the district court construed as a motion for reconsideration and denied.hampton and appeal the district court denial of their motion for substitution and their motion to reconsider.appellants also move to substitute as parties in this appeal.
ii.discussion 
standard of review and applicable law 
appellants argue the district court erred by requiring appellants to prove more than was necessary to satisfy the requirements of.a,and in denying their motion to substitute as plaintiffs.pursuant to.a,if a party dies and the claim is not extinguished,the court may order substitution of the proper party.a motion for substitution may be made by any party or by the decedent successor or representative.id.we review district court determinations regarding substitution for an abuse of discretion.elca enters.sisco equip.rental sales,cir.we review de novo the district court interpretation of the law and federal rules of civil procedure.see.lumbermens mut.ins.timberland pallet lumber,cir.
history of.a 
federal rule of civil procedure was promulgated by the supreme court in.rule a was derived,in part,from,which provided,when either of the parties,whether plaintiff or petitioner or defendant dies before final judgment,the executor or administrator of such deceased party may,in case the cause of action survives by law,prosecute or defend any such suit to final judgment,repealed by revision act of june,stat.see.advisory committee note to subdivision a.in contrast.a,both today and as initially promulgated,permits the decedent successor or representative to move for substitution.when was repealed as superseded by,the historical requirement that only an administrator or executor of a decedent estate could substitute as plaintiff was removed,and under the new federal rules,the proper party for substitution is the decedent successor or representative.see sinito dep t of justice,noting the addition of the word successor to the rule means that a proper party need not necessarily be the appointed executor or administrator of the deceased party estate.
despite this change,federal courts often strictly construed.to preclude substitution of parties.see,gertler united states.as a result,in,the supreme court amended rule a.the purpose of the amendments to rule,which replaced a harsher prior rule regarding proper party plaintiffs,was to liberalize the rule and to allow flexibility in substitution of parties.sinito,at internal marks omitted quoting mcsurley mcclellan,per curiam see also boggs dravo,cir similar.
the language of.a is permissive.currently,rule provides,if a party dies and the claim is not extinguished,the court may order substitution of the proper party.this court has noted,the decision whether to substitute parties lies within the discretion of the trial judge and he may refuse to substitute parties in an action even if one of the parties so moves.froning,johnston feed,cir.however,the advisory committee on the amendments to.intended that motions to substitute be freely granted.see,advisory committee note of a motion to substitute made within the prescribed time will ordinarily be granted,but under the permissive language of the first sentence of the amended rule the court may order it may be denied by the court in the exercise of a sound discretion if made long after the death and circumstances have arisen rendering it unfair to allow substitution.
with this historical context in mind,we consider appellants claim that they are the proper parties for substitution.it is that a decedent legal representative may substitute as plaintiff for the decedent in a cause of action.see,mallonee fahey,cir graham henderson.it is not,however,who may be considered the decedent successor under rule a,and therefore,also a proper party for purposes of substitution.
relevant cases 
in a groundbreaking case,rende kay,the defendant died during litigation in the district court.the defendant attorney continued to defend the action and filed a suggestion of death pursuant to.a.id.the defendant will was filed in the state court,but no legal representative was appointed.id.time passed,and the defendant attorney moved to dismiss the action because the plaintiffs had not moved to substitute a proper party for the defendant within the time allotted.id.the rende court considered the issue of proper parties,recognizing that although not applicable to the case,the addition of the word successor in rule a would encompass the distributee of an estate that had been distributed as a proper party.id.at.the court continued by noting the plaintiffs attorney knew the will had been submitted to probate,but had no knowledge of who would be appointed as the estate legal representative.the court observed,
the tactic of the defendant attorney would place on plaintiff the burden,where no conventional representative was appointed for the estate in probate court,of instituting machinery in order to produce some representative of the estate ad litem,pending appointment of the representative contemplated by law of the domicile of the deceased.
id.at.this,the court reasoned,was contrary to the purpose of the amendments to rule,which were intended to dispel unwarranted rigidity and allow more flexibility in substitution.id.for these reasons,the court concluded that a suggestion of death should identify the representative or successor of an estate who may be substituted as a party for the deceased before rule a may be invoked by those who represent or inherit from the deceased.id.
the rende case established several principles which have been adopted and followed in later cases.see,gronowicz leonard,a distributee of an estate is a proper party under rule a if the estate of the deceased has been distributed at the time the motion for substitution has been made.ashley.cent.gulf,noting the s uccessors would be the distributees of the decedent estate if his estate had been closed.many years after rende,the circuit expanded upon the rende principles with mcsurely,at.in mcsurely,the plaintiffs sued multiple defendants,two of whom later died.id.at.both decedents had wills which named their wives as executor and provided for the wives to receive all assets.id.however,the wills were never probated,and the wives were never designated legal representative s of their husbands estates.id.the defendants claimed the widows could not be the proper parties for substitution.id.at.the court rejected this claim,deciding the plaintiffs should not be required to institut e machinery in order to produce some representative ad litem,in contravention of the purpose of amended rule a to permit more flexibility in substitution.id.the court elected to construe rule a equitably and sensibly,and declared,despite the absence of a formal appointment or probate of the decedents estates,the widows were the proper parties for substitution.id.at.see also kilgo bowman,reaching a similar result.
in hardy kaszycki sons contractors,a district court evaluated a claim by a widow that she was not the proper party to substitute for her husband as the defendant in an ongoing action.the widow first claimed the estate had no assets a claim the district court rejected because the decedent estate included two insurance policies in favor of the estates,heirs,and personal representative of the decedent.id.the district court then rejected the widow claim that she was not the representative of the estate,emphasizing,although the decedent died intestate,it is undisputed that the widow is the at least the of her husband estate.id.as a result,the court refused to permit the case to be prolonged any further,and found the widow to be the proper party for substitution under the unique facts of the case.id.at.
together,these cases demonstrate,under certain circumstances,a person may be a successor under rule a if she is the primary beneficiary of an already distributed estate,see rende,at named in a will as the executor of the decedent estate,even if the will is not probated,see mcsurely,at or the primary beneficiary of an unprobated intestate estate which need not be probated,hardy.at.
procedural substantive 
it is,of course,that in a suit based on diversity of citizenship jurisdiction the federal courts apply federal law as to matters of procedure but the substantive law of the relevant state.hiatt mazda motor,cir citing erie tompkins.rule a is a procedural rule.see downie pritchard,cir rule a is merely a formula used to fascilitate the closing of a decedent estate within a reasonable time.surely this is a rule of procedure.it does not provide for the survival of rights or liabilities but merely provides the method by which the original action may proceed if the right of action survives.id.quoting pritchard downie.thus,in a diversity case,we look to state substantive law to determine whether the cause of action survives.see ransom brennan,cir.neither party contends torres causes of action were extinguished upon her death.assuming then,without deciding,that torres claims continued,we must consider whether the district court correctly determined appellants were not proper parties for substitution.
rule a is a procedural rule setting forth the proper method for the substitution of parties,and federal courts must apply federal rules,rather than state law,in determining the proper procedure for substitution following a party death.see servidone const.levine,cir.kuelbs hill,wl,at cir.july,discussing substitution under rule b for an incompetent party and the real party in interest under rule a.this is true even if the court must apply state substantive law,see servidone const,at,or where the state procedural rules are inconsistent with federal law,see ransom,at.while it is often said that rule is strictly procedural,see,roberson wood,some courts and commentators have recognized,in many instances,state law governs who can be a representative or successor,and therefore,who can qualify as a proper party for substitution under rule a.see,madison vintage,applying state law to determine the proper party for substitution james moore et,moore federal practice ed extrapolating,without citation,that w hether a person is a proper party is a substantive
