in this complex products liability case involving the tragic crash of a small passenger aircraft,we consider primarily the following issue of law whether we may exercise appellate jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine to review the denial of a motion for summary judgment on the basis that a statute of repose was inapplicable.we conclude that the district court order does not fall under the collateral order doctrine and will accordingly dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
on august,hartzell manufactured the y shank aluminum propeller that eventually made its way onto a mooney aircraft.that aircraft was subsequently purchased by wendy and michael robinson.years later,on august,the propeller fractured,causing the aircraft to crash.both wendy and michael suffered extensive injuries wendy suffered a broken back,breast bone,and left foot,while michael fractured his spine,rendering him a paraplegic.the robinsons thereafter brought suit against hartzell under theories of negligence and products liability 
the general aviation revitalization act gara contains a statute of repose that generally bars suits against airplane manufacturers brought more than eighteen years after the delivery date to an initial purchaser of the aircraft.see note the robinsons,however,allege that they are entitled to bring their suit under an exception to the gara statute of repose because hartzell made several material misrepresentations in connection with obtaining a type certificate for the propeller at issue from the federal aviation administration faa id.
federal law requires propeller manufacturers to obtain a type certificate from the faa.see id.the purpose of that process is to ensure that the propeller has been designed and manufactured properly,performs properly,and meets faa minimum standards.see id.some manufacturers are able to grant themselves a type certificate through the faa delegated opinion authority doa process.doa status grants to a designated engineering representative der the ability to assume the faa role and certify a part.following certification,an entity with doa also is responsible to ensure that the product design is in accordance with the regulations and has no characteristics which may detract from flight safety.service difficulties,such as a failure,malfunction,or defect in any part,including propeller blade structural failure,are to be reviewed,reported,and resolved.c.
in,hartzell submitted an application for type certification to the faa for the propeller and aircraft combination at hartzell propeller installed on the lycoming powered mooney airplane in connection with its initial application,hartzell conducted a vibration test of the combination the week of july.that test measured the stresses measured in pounds per square inch psi placed on the propeller at different speeds measured in revolutions per minute rpm at four different flight conditions at full throttle level flight at full throttle level flight with throttle set at manifold pressure and static flight at full throttle.with regard to these tests,the report stated the following 
the peak stress at rpm reached a value of psi for the inch hg manifold setting,which is approximately the allowable value.since this engine has no dampers which can wear and cause higher stresses,the probability of this value being reached or exceeded in service seems remote.there appears to be no necessity to placard against operation in the rpm range.
the propeller is considered satisfactory vibrationwise when installed on the lycoming engine without restrictions.
the robinsons contend that this statement in the report contains three misrepresentations.first,the robinsons contend that the peak stress was not approximately equivalent to the allowable value,but rather exceeded the allowable value.the robinsons cite to a set of graphs that were contained in engineering report that demonstrate that allowable vibratory stress limits were exceeded at three different points second,the robinsons contend that the lack of vibration dampers on the lycoming engine would increase,rather than decrease,the stress on the propeller.they point to a engineering report in which hartzell recommended the use of a dampered engine to decrease the chances of propeller failure.finally,the robinsons argue that there was a necessity to placard against operation at certain speeds because vibratory peak stresses exceeded faa permissible limits.when the type certification was first issued,the type certification data sheet included a note requiring owners of the mooney to mark their tachometers between and rpm.because of some early propeller tip failures,the faa issued airworthiness directive ad which placed further rpm restrictions on the combination and required an addendum to the airplane flight manual.app.in addition,the faa issued another ad in,which required additional rpm restrictions.
the robinsons also assert that hartzell continued to make knowing misrepresentations and omissions regarding the propeller at issue following faa certification of the engine combination.as noted above,hartzell had a continuing obligation under its doa status to comply with the reporting requirements of.according to the robinsons,hartzell continuing airworthiness measures,approved through its doa,did not resolve the illegal vibratory stresses disclosed by report and did not disclose the excessive vibrations to the faa.appellee br.at.in fact,there have been approximately forty prior blade failures involving the same combinations as the one at issue.see app.the robinsons essentially argue that hartzell on several occasions blamed other pilot of disclosing that there was a vibration problem.see app.
following the completion of discovery,hartzell brought a motion for summary judgment contending that the suit was barred by the statute of repose enacted under gara,note a.the district court agreed with the robinsons that material issues of fact existed as to whether the gara exception applied and denied hartzell motion.hartzell filed a timely appeal and urges us to reach the merits of the district court decision under the collateral order doctrine.
our jurisdiction as an appellate court extends under over a final order of a district court.an order is final when it terminates the litigation between the parties on the merits of the case and leaves nothing to be done but to enforce by execution what has been determined.richerson jones,cir quoting louis,iron mountain and ry.express.in most cases,a denial of a motion for summary judgment does not qualify as a final order because,far from finally deciding a case,it is a decision to permit litigation to continue.hamilton leavy,cir citation omitted.
in cohen beneficial loan,however,the supreme court explained that is to be given a practical rather than a technical construction,and that there is a small class of orders which finally determine claims of right separable from,and collateral to,rights asserted in the action,too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.id.at.see also dotzel ashbridge,cir bell.pub.util.comm.n,cir in re ford motor,cir.cohen and its progeny have been interpreted to permit the immediate appeal of an otherwise collateral order if the order conclusively determines a disputed legal question,resolves an important issue completely separable from the merits of the action,and is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.bell,at.
the supreme court has referred to the collateral order doctrine as a narrow exception that contains stringent requirements.digital equip.desktop direct,d.strict construction of the doctrine is grounded on the longstanding congressional policy against piecemeal appeals that underlies the final judgment rule.we,city of philadelphia,cir.to prevent the unwarranted expansion of the doctrine,the issue of appealability under is to be determined for the entire category to which a claim belongs,without regard to the chance that the litigation at hand might be speeded,or a particular injustic e averted by prompt appellate court litigation.digital,at.see we,at this approach reflects the court insistence that the finality requirement of must not be reduced to a determination.thus,considerations such as whether the litigation will be expedited by immediate review,or whether an erroneous ruling will incur increased expenses,are not factors that can justify review under the collateral order doctrine.bell,at.
moreover,simply characterizing a right as an irreparable entitlement not to stand trial is insufficient for an appeal to fall under the collateral order doctrine,as virtually every right that could be enforced appropriately by pretrial dismissal might loosely be described as conferring a right not to stand trial.digital,at.as the supreme court has pointed out,the collateral order doctrine is exceedingly narrow because numerous adverse pretrial rulings can not be completely remedied following final judgment 
even as they have recognized the need for immediate appeals under to vindicate rights that would be irretrievably lost if review were confined to final judgments only,our cases have been at least as emphatic in recognizing that the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals should not,and can not,depend on a party agility in so characterizing the right asserted.this must be so because the strong bias of against piecemeal appeals almost never operates without some cost.a fully litigated case can no more be untried than the law proverbial bell can be unrung,and almost every pretrial or trial order might be called effectively unreviewable in the sense that relief from error can never extend to rewriting history.thus,erroneous evidentiary rulings,grants or denials of attorney disqualification,and restrictions on the rights of intervening parties,may burden litigants in ways that are only imperfectly reparable by appellate reversal of a final district court judgment and other errors,real enough,will not seem serious enough to warrant reversal at all when reviewed after a long trial on the merits.in still other cases,an erroneous district court decision will,as a practical matter,sound the death knell for many plaintiffs claims that might have gone forward if prompt error correction had been an option.but if immediate appellate review were available every such time,congress final decision rule would end up a pretty puny one,and so the mere identification of some interest that would be irretrievably lost has never suffered to meet the third cohen requirement.

we have not yet addressed whether an order denying summary judgment on a statute of repose defense qualifies as a collateral order under cohen and its progeny.each party has offered competing analogies in support of their respective positions.the robinsons assert that the order is not appealable because we have explicitly held that defendants can not appeal from a order denying a statute of limitations defense.see,at.in contrast,hartzell argues that a decision on a statute of repose is more akin to a decision denying an assertion of qualified immunity,which is appealable to the extent it touches upon an issue of law.see hamilton,at giuffre bissell,cir.
a review of our caselaw confirms that the collateral order doctrine has been applied only to a narrow universe of rights primarily rooted in constitutional or statutory provisions or a competing public policy rationale.see charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure,at ed.the theory that some rights are designed to protect against the burdens of trial and support appeal from a refusal to dismiss is likely to be limited narrowly.the essential question that must be answered is the nature of the right to be protected.in cases where the collateral order doctrine is applied,the interest at stake is so important that it is comparable to an immunity from suit that can not be remedied unless immediate appellate review is taken.id.
for example,in abney united states,d,the supreme court held that a criminal defendant could appeal immediately the district court denial of a motion to dismiss on the ground that the indictment violated double jeopardy protections.id.at.the court explained that the particular fifth amendment right at issue was a constitutional right not to face trial at all,id.at,which would be forever lost if the defendant was forced to go to trial t here can be no doubt that such orders constitute a complete,formal and,in the trial court,final rejection of a criminal defendant double jeopardy claim.there are simply no further steps that can be taken in the district court to avoid the trial the defendant maintains is barred by the fifth amendment guarantee.id.at.similarly,in helstoski meanor,d,the court held that the denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment premised on the speech and debate clause of the constitution was subject to immediate appellate review because that clause was designed to protect congressmen from being exposed to liability for actions taken on the floor of the legislature.id.at.see also aqueduct sewer auth.metcalf eddy,d holding that entities claiming to be arms of the state may appeal an order denying eleventh amendment immunity under the collateral order doctrine stack boyle.permitting immediate appeal of denial of motion to reduce bail on grounds that it was an excessive penalty in violation of eighth amendment.the court has also determined that denials of absolute and qualified immunity serve compelling public ends which would be irretrievably lost if officials were forced to go to trial.nixon fitzgerald,d holding that denial of absolute immunity immediately was appealable because immunity was a functionally mandated incident of the president unique office,rooted in the separation of powers and supported by our history mitchell forsyth,d concluding in the qualified immunity context that an essential attribute of freedom from suit for past conduct that did not violate a clearly established right was an entitlement not to stand trial or face the other burdens of litigation,which could otherwise impede the official discretionary actions.
in the vast majority of cases,our court and the united states supreme court have rejected the application of the collateral order doctrine to orders.in fact,the narrow scope of the collateral doctrine might be better understood by examining those orders from which courts have held that an immediate appeal may not be taken.for example,courts have held that decisions denying the following defenses were not appealable under the collateral order doctrine 
an order denying a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,van cauwenberghe biard,d 
an order denying a motion to dismiss on the grounds that an extradited person was immune from civil process,

a decision denying dismissal of an indictment for an alleged violation of federal rule of criminal procedure a,which forbids the disclosure of secret grand jury information,midland asphalt united states,d 
a decision denying effect to a contractual provision,lauro lines,chasser,d.
the key consideration in each of these cases was whether the claimed right sought to be protected was characterized as a right to immunity from suit or a defense to liability.we,at.in each decision enumerated above,the courts characterized the defenses as defenses to liability,which may be considered following a final judgment.see,united states hollywood motor car,d stating that there is a crucial distinction between a right not to be tried and a right whose remedy requires the dismissal of charges.
two of the decisions referenced above,we,and,are particularly instructive to our analysis of the present case.in we,the plaintiff brought suit after the city of philadelphia issued a cease operations order to the plaintiff to shut down two adjacent businesses near the university of pennsylvania penn dental school without first providing the plaintiff with notice or an opportunity for
