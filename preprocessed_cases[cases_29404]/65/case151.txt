appellant bell challenges the dismissal with prejudice of his case following the district court denial of his requests either to substitute a new bellwether plaintiff or to continue the scheduled trial date.the court actions were taken in the course of its management of thousands of similar suits for allegedly injurious formaldehyde exposure in fema trailers following hurricanes katrina and rita.after reviewing all the factors that affected the district court decisions,we find no abuse of discretion and affirm.
background and standard of review 
raymond bell and his mother,like thousands of other plaintiffs,filed suit against multiple defendants who participated in the government program to supply temporary housing for victims of the devastating hurricanes.these cases were assigned by the litigation panel for pretrial management by judge engelhardt in new orleans.in re fema trailer formaldehyde prods liab,mdl.after he denied the motion for class certification,the judge systematically began issuing,with counsel participation,pretrial management orders and trial dates for bellwether trials.pretrial order,on february,set dates in and january for four bellwether cases,each to be prosecuted by a plaintiff against one of the four trailer manufacturers estimated to have the most units at issue in the suits.the parties were to confer on the identity of the plaintiffs in these trials,while the defendant manufacturers were gulf stream,fleetwood,forest river,and keystone.the court insisted that proper venue be established in the eastern district of louisiana for each of these test cases.
on april,the case of diana bell,raymond mother,was identified as the bellwether case against keystone rv,manufacturer of the trailer in which her family had lived.both diana and raymond had been nominated as bellwether plaintiffs,but the court selected diana.a formal scheduling order followed two days later and incorporated an earlier comprehensive trial management order.trial was set to occupy two weeks in january.pretrial preparation proceeded concerning the trailer that had housed the bells.
five months later,in early september,diana bell requested,and the court permitted,her withdrawal as a bellwether plaintiff diana then voluntarily dismissed her case with prejudice on september.after consulting with counsel,the court promptly selected raymond bell as the next bellwether plaintiff in order to maintain the benefit of trial preparation concerning the particular trailer.on september,however,bell moved to substitute a new bellwether plaintiff or obtain a continuance of the january trial date.he made three arguments in support of this dual motion.he asserted he could not take two weeks off from his job to attend trial moreover,as the supporter of a child,he could not afford to forego at least one week of income and the trial dates would interfere with his participation in delgado community college classes at the beginning of the spring semester.bell suggested no alternative trial date that would be convenient.keystone rv and its questioned how these facts,even if true,could differentiate raymond bell inconvenience at meeting a trial date from that of any other plaintiff,and it pointed out that he had three and a half months before trial in which to resolve these alleged problems.
on october,the court denied raymond bell motions for all the reasons the undersigned has previously discussed with counsel,but it also stated that,the court is willing to appropriately instruct the jury as to any commitments of bellwether plaintiff raymond bell,iii that prohibit him from sitting through the entire trial,such that those absences will be excused.
raymond bell really did not want to go to trial in january.he moved on october for a dismissal without prejudice and attached an affidavit asserting as fact the arguments noted above.he expressed doubt about the curative impact of the judge proposed instruction if he were to be absent from part of the trial.he complained,t he fact that the attorneys herein have been readying themselves for months to try a case on january of next year,while a source of frustration,should not obscure the fact that these claimants are being asked to make what is for them an important of their affairs on extremely short notice.he also opined that were this not an mdl case,the request for rescheduling would not be unexpected.
at this juncture the court ordered dismissal with prejudice,as requested by the defendants.the court order states 
plaintiffs counsel should take notice that all plaintiffs who assert claims in this mdl shall be ready and willing to serve as bellwether plaintiffs in this matter,if called upon to do so,as any other plaintiff would be expected to do in an ordinary case.the claims of those plaintiffs who refuse to do so,when called upon,will be dismissed with prejudice.such has been the case thus far in this litigation and the court sees no reason to depart from this mode of procedure for raymond bell,iii.
as discussed on many previous occasions,the parties have expended much time,effort,and money into readying the case involving the bell trailer for trial.when bell chose to voluntarily dismiss her claims with prejudice in lieu of fulfilling her role as the bellwether plaintiff,the court chose her son,bell to fulfill the role,reasoning that the same trailer could be used,which would save the parties from incurring more expenses readying a case involving a different trailer for trial.however,despite the offer from the court to instruct the jury as to any commitments of bell that would prohibit him from sitting through the entire trial,he still insists on dismissing his claims in lieu of fulfilling his role as the bellwether plaintiff.based on his decision and that of bell,all the work and discovery relating to the bell trailer is rendered utterly useless.all of the resources spent in preparing this case for trial have been wasted.because the parties will now have to choose another bellwether plaintiff,which will involve conducting discovery on an entirely different trailer and readying a completely different case for trial,the claims of bell,like those of bell,should be dismissed with prejudice.not doing so would possibly cause other bellwether plaintiffs to jump ship at the last minute this is obviously a tactic that the court does not wish to encourage.
bell has appealed from all three orders denial of the motion to substitute another bellwether plaintiff denial of the motion to continue and dismissal with prejudice.all three orders are reviewed for abuse of discretion.see united states stalnaker,cir noting that courts examine the totality of the circumstances in reviewing the denial of a continuance united states german,cir noting that serious prejudice is required to find abuse of discretion on a motion for continuance streber hunter,cir noting that district courts have broad discretion in scheduling decisions transamerica ins.avenell,cir.we do not speculate on whether the motions to continue or dismiss without prejudice might have had some merit had this been ordinary litigation.the challenge to case administration arose here from the court obligation to manage thousands of claims against numerous defendants in an efficient and expeditious manner that would best serve justice for both plaintiffs and defendants.that multiparty background heavily influenced the trial court and permeates this court review.
ii.discussion 
motion to substitute to continue.
at the heart of the bellwether case approach to handling complex litigation is the court decision,reached after numerous pretrial conferences with the parties,to select particular plaintiffs cases whose trials will furnish data that may facilitate settlement of the remaining cases.judge engelhardt handled this formaldehyde litigation in the standard fashion by selecting a test case against each of the four prominently involved trailer manufacturers.of course,in each case,different subsidiary defendants,such as contractors and the united states,would also be involved,but the focus was correctly placed on an attempt to find representative plaintiffs claims against these four major defe
