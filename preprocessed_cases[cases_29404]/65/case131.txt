after jo huskey experienced complications from the implantation of a transvaginal mesh medical device,she and her husband allen huskey filed this products liability action against ethicon,and johnson johnson collectively ethicon.following a trial,the jury returned a general verdict for the huskeys on their design defect,failure to warn,and loss of consortium claims.ethicon now appeals the denial of its renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law or,in the alternative,for a new trial.the huskeys offered sufficient evidence to sustain the jury verdict and the district court committed no reversible error.accordingly,we affirm.
in,huskey began suffering symptoms of stress urinary incontinence sui.in january,after her condition had worsened,she discussed treatment options with her doctor,gretchen byrkit.by this time,huskey was regularly leaking urine while coughing,laughing,and sneezing,and she also experienced pain during intercourse.at byrkit suggestion,huskey agreed to have byrkit surgically implant a medical device called the vaginal.
the is a sling that uses a mesh.ethicon received clearance from the food and drug administration fda to market the in december.ethicon uses polypropylene for the mesh.the was not the first sling ethicon had manufactured rather,it was a version of an earlier ethicon device called the gynecare tvt and is one of multiple slings that ethicon has manufactured and sold.
on february,byrkit performed huskey implantation surgery.a few weeks later,huskey visited byrkit office for a.at this visit,byrkit examined huskey and found that some mesh on her right side had eroded.this eroded mesh caused huskey to experience pelvic pain.
on june,after various alternative treatments that byrkit had recommended failed,huskey agreed to have a second surgical operation to cover the exposed mesh.byrkit performed this operation on june.unfortunately,this operation was not successful and did not relieve huskey pain.byrkit then referred huskey to sohail siddique,a urogynecologist,for further treatment.
on november,siddique performed surgery to excise huskey mesh.he found that she had an infection and that the mesh on huskey right side had completely eroded.he could not remove all the mesh because some had retracted behind huskey pubic bone.
to this day,the remaining mesh and scar tissue from her operations cause huskey to experience severe pain,particularly when engaging in physical activity and sexual intercourse.additionally,her sui symptoms have returned.for the rest of her life,she will require medication for pain management no surgical intervention can permanently cure her.
on september,the huskeys filed the operative short form complaint in the southern district of west virginia in the instant multidistrict litigation,in re ethicon,pelvic repair.prods.liab,mdl.the huskeys,illinois residents,brought all of their claims under illinois law.after the district court granted ethicon partial summary judgment,five claims remained for trial strict liability and negligent design defect strict liability and negligent failure to warn and huskey loss of consortium.beyond actual damages,huskey sought punitive damages for the substantive claims.
trial began on august,and lasted nine days.the huskeys presented their case,which consisted of testimony from thirteen witnesses and the introduction of numerous documents,over the first six trial days.at the conclusion of their case,ethicon orally moved for judgment as a matter of law under federal rule of civil procedure a.the court granted the motion as to huskey claim for punitive damages but otherwise deferred ruling on the motion.ethicon renewed its motion at the close of its case,and the court,again deferring a ruling,submitted the case to the jury.
the jury returned a unanimous general verdict for the huskeys on all five claims.the jury awarded huskey million in total damages,allocated between past expenses for medical care,previous pain and suffering,and future pain and suffering.the jury awarded huskey an additional for his loss of consortium.
after the jury returned its verdict,ethicon again renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law.in the alternative,ethicon sought a new trial pursuant to rule a a.the court issued a thorough written order denying the motion.huskey ethicon,wl.ethicon subsequently noted this timely appeal.
ethicon initially contends that the district court erred in denying it judgment as a matter of law.we review de novo the denial of ethicon motion.durham jones,cir.a court may grant judgment as a matter of law only if,viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the party and drawing every legitimate inference in that party favor,the only conclusion a reasonable jury could have reached is one in favor of the moving party.saunders branch banking tr.of,cir.if,upon the conclusion of a party case,a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue,a court may grant a motion from the opposing party for judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.a.when the court defers ruling on such a motion,rule b allows a party to renew it after the jury returns a verdict.
ethicon moved for judgment as a matter of law on all five of the huskeys claims.as ethicon counsel conceded at oral argument,since the jury returned a general verdict,we can reverse the court denial of ethicon motion only if the huskeys failed,as a matter of law,to prove both their design defect and failure to warn claims.given our resolution of the huskeys design defect claims,we need not discuss their failure to warn claims.moreover,because their negligent design defect claim relies on the same facts and arguments as their strict liability design defect claim,we address those claims together.similarly,because it is wholly derivative of huskey claims,we do not separately consider huskey loss of consortium claim.see blagg.truck equip.
to prevail on their design defect claims,the huskeys had to demonstrate that a certain condition of the resulted from ethicon design,that this condition made the product unreasonably dangerous,that the dangerous condition existed when huskey left ethicon control,and that the dangerous condition in the proximately caused harm to huskey.see mikolajczyk ford motor.ethicon makes two arguments in support of its contention that the court erred in denying it judgment as a matter of law that the huskeys failed to prove a specific flaw in the design as opposed to a general complication flowing from implantation,and that comment k of the restatement second of torts shields it from liability.we address these arguments in turn.
the record belies ethicon assertion that the huskeys failed to prove that a specific defect of the design caused harm to huskey.as the district court properly held,the huskeys offered sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that ethicon use of heavyweight polypropylene mesh in the caused huskey injuries.
first,scott guelcher,an associate professor of chemical engineering at vanderbilt university and one of the huskeys expert witnesses,testified about the body reaction to polypropylene and the consequences that ensue.he explained that the body recognizes the polypropylene mesh as a foreign material,and will continue to attack it in this way until it removed or destroyed or it gone.and guelcher testified,based on his research,that it best to minimize the amount of polypropylene that present in the mesh,because the more polypropylene surface that present,the greater those changes would be,and the more hazardous they could be.
next,bruce rosenzweig,a urogynecologist and another of the huskeys expert witnesses,bolstered guelcher testimony.rosenzweig testified that ethicon used a heavyweight mesh and t he more mesh there is in the pelvis,the more of a foreign body response.he explained that heavyweight mesh can lead to a foreign body response in an area near the inner thigh called the obturator space,and that these foreign bodies can irritate the nerve that passes nearby and lead to pain.
additionally,brigitte hellhammer,a former ethicon employee,testified that she had no reason to believe that lightweight mesh could not effectively treat sui.hellhammer explained that one risk of implanting mesh devices in patients was that the mesh would shrink,and that the weight of the mesh helps determine the likelihood of shrinkage.hellhammer testified to a understanding that lightweight mesh would help in reducing a foreign body response,inflammatory response,and would reduce the potentiation for scar plating.
finally,jerry blaivas,a urologist and another expert witness for the huskeys who had conducted a pelvic examination of huskey,testified that huskey had severe scarring and suffered from chronic pelvic pain.blaivas believed huskey symptoms were a reaction to the mesh and that he did not know of anything else that can cause this particular constellation of symptoms.
drawing all inferences in the huskeys favor,a reasonable jury could conclude from this expert testimony that ethicon use of a heavyweight quantity of polypropylene mesh in the constituted a design defect that caused huskey inflammation and pelvic pain.
ethicon next argues that an exception to strict liability found in comment k to of the restatement second of torts,on which illinois courts rely,nevertheless shields it from liability.see kirk michael reese hosp.med,citing comment k in a recitation of applicable law.
comment k,which is captioned u navoidably unsafe products,recognizes that some products,in the present state of human knowledge,are quite incapable of being made safe for their intended and ordinary use.restatement second of torts cmt.k am.law inst.comment k recommends that such products,with the qualification that they are properly prepared and marketed,and proper warning is given,not trigger strict liability.id.this is because the marketing and the use of unavoidably unsafe products are fully justified,notwithstanding the unavoidable high degree of risk which they involve.id.such products,it explains,are neither defective,nor unreasonably dangerous.id.
although comment k notes that unavoidably unsafe products are especially common in the field of drugs,under illinois law,courts determine on a case by case basis if a particular product falls within comment k,glassman wyeth.app.whether a product is unavoidably unsafe is a question of fact on which the defendant bears the burden of proof.id.at.if a reasonable jury could find that the did not meet comment k parameters,ethicon reliance on comment k fails.
much of the trial evidence indicating that the use of heavyweight polypropylene mesh constituted a design defect also suggests that comment k provides ethicon no defense.specifically,the jury could reasonably infer from guelcher testimony that the greater quantity of mesh ethicon used in the,the greater the chance that a patient would experience an adverse foreign body response.the jury could also reasonably infer from hellhammer testimony that had ethicon used lightweight mesh,the would have remained effective and patients would have a reduced risk of an adverse foreign body response.taken together,the expert testimony allowed the jury to infer that ethicon could have designed the with lightweight mesh without sacrificing any performance.consequently,the jury could reasonably conclude that the was not unavoidably unsafe.comment k does not shield ethicon from liability.
we next address ethicon contention that the district court should have granted it a new trial.federal rule of civil procedure a a allows a court to grant a party motion for a new trial if the verdict is contrary to the clear weight of the evidence,rests upon false evidence,or will cause a miscarriage of justice.minter wells fargo bank,cir.
we review a denial of a new trial for abuse of discretion.united states ex rel.drakeford tuomey,cir.a court abuses its discretion if it relies on incorrect legal conclusions or clearly erroneous findings of fact.belk,meyer,cir.moreover,we can reverse even without such errors if we have a definite and firm conviction that the court below committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.id.quoting westberry gislaved gummi ab,cir.
ethicon raises two grounds for a new trial.first,it contends that the district court improperly refused to instruct the jury on comment next,it asserts that the court improperly excluded multiple pieces of evidence involving the fda.
we turn first to the comment k instruction.ethicon argued at trial that comment k entitled it to at a minimum,an appropriate jury instruction.after considering briefing and oral argument on the question,the district court declined to include the requested comment k instruction instead,the court instructed the jury that it could find ethicon liable on the design defect claim only if it found that the was unreasonably dangerous.the court then defined an unreasonably dangerous product as one in which the risk of danger inherent in the design outweighs the benefits of the design when the product is put to a use that is reasonably foreseeable considering the nature and function of the product.
we review the district court refusal to provide ethicon proposed instruction for abuse of discretion.rowland am,cir.we evaluate the jury charge as a whole,and an instructional error warrants a new trial only if it fails to inform the jury of the controlling legal principles.id.any lack of clarity must prejudice the challenging party.id.
again,to show that a product falls within comment k protection,the defendant must prove that a product marketing and use are fully justified,notwithstanding the unavoidable high degree of risk which it involve s.restatement second of torts cmt.k.we can discern only one difference between comment k and the jury instruction the court gave that difference is the burden of proof,which of course shifts to the defendant for comment even assuming that ethicon had produced sufficient evidence to justify the issuance of a comment k instruction,we can not hold that it suffered prejudice from the absence of that instruction.as the district court correctly observed,the failure to provide an instruction that shifts the burden to ethicon would not likely have provided ethicon with a more favorable outcome.without any prejudice,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying ethicon a new trial on that basis.
we next address ethicon evidentiary contentions.ethicon posits that the district court exclusion of four pieces of fda evidence warrants a new trial.those four pieces of evidence are evidence of the compliance with the fda section k evaluation process evidence that a fda advisory committee deemed mesh slings,including the,safe and effective a published guidance,which reported the advisory committee conclusions and the regulatory history of the prolene suture,an ethicon product that contains the same polypropylene as the mesh.
the court relied on federal rule of evidence in excluding this evidence.that rule allows a court to exclude relevant evidence when its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following unfair prejudice,confusing the issues,misleading the jury,undue delay,wasting time,or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.fed.evid.we review a decision to exclude evidence on this basis for abuse of discretion.united states davis,cir.improper exclusion of evidence warrants a new trial only if it results in a high probability that the error affect ed the judgment.drakeford,at.
we will address each exclusion in turn.but before doing so,we consider whether ethicon has waived any challenge pertaining to the latter three pieces of evidence.the huskeys argue that ethicon never sought to introduce these three pieces of evidence,and that ethicon thus can not now rely on the exclusion of this evidence to gain a new trial.to the extent this accurately represents the proceedings below a notion ethicon strongly contests the huskeys have waived this argument.
ethicon memorandum in support of its motion contended that the exclusion of all of the evidence it invokes on appeal justified a new trial.the huskeys only response to this argument in their briefing was to incorporate by reference their filing to exclude the k eviden
