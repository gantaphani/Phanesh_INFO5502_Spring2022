appellant carlyne mckenney brought this civil action against respondent purepac pharmaceutical company purepac and other defendants.appellant alleges that she was injured as a result of using the prescription drug metoclopramide manufactured by purepac.the superior court sustained purepac demurrer to mckenney fourth amended complaint and entered judgment in favor of purepac.the pleading alleges that metoclopramide is the active ingredient of the brand name drug reglan,and that purepac distributed the generic drug metoclopramide.it alleges that there were false and or misleading statements contained in purepac labeling of the drug,and that the labeling substantially understated and downplayed the risks of tardive dyskinesia,a condition mckenney contracted as a result of her treatment with metoclopramide.the superior court concluded all of plaintiff causes against purpac are by federal law defendant purepac is not the original manufacturer of reglan.it is a generic manufacturer of metoclopramide and,as such,must obtain approval by the fda before issuing any label on metoclopramide which deviates from the labeling previously approved by the fda.
appellant contends that the court erred in sustaining the demurrer to her fourth amended complaint.as we shall explain,we agree with appellant.we hold that the federal requirement that a generic drug have the same labeling as a reference listed drug does not necessarily result in federal preemption of a state tort action against the generic manufacturer for failure to adequately warn of the dangers of the drug.we will reverse the judgment.
