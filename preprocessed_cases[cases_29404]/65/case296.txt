background 
plaintiffs claims arose from their purchase of a defective recreational vehicle rv manufactured by blue bird.on july,highway sales purchased,for oren use a blue bird wanderlodge rv from shorewood rv,a blue bird authorized dealer.the purchase price was.
in the months following the sale,oren discovered numerous defects,including failures of the rv electrical system,batteries,seals,slides,gauges,compressor,monitor,and lighting.oren returned the rv to shorewood rv for repairs on a number of occasions,and shorewood rv attempted to remedy the rv various defects.despite shorewood rv efforts,oren continued experiencing problems with the rv.
on july,oren delivered the rv to shorewood rv lot,giving the keys to shorewood rv and removing his belongings.oren informed anthony santarsiero santarsiero,a shorewood rv employee,that oren was returning the rv as of that day.santarsiero gave oren the name of blue bird ceo and told oren to call or write the ceo a letter to try to resolve the problem.on july,oren wrote a letter to blue bird ceo asking him to authorize repurchase of the rv at its original cost.oren copied santarsiero on the letter.the letter stated,in part 
after almost a year of continued problems with this motor home,i have come to three conclusions.first,the model was released before it had been properly designed,tested,and debugged.second,shorewood rv is a terrific dealer for you,but even they could not overcome the inherent problems in the.third,i have run out of patience,confidence,and trust that the problems can be fixed in a reasonable time,and i request that you return my purchase price.
on july,after the engine batteries once again died,i removed all my personal belongings and returned the coach to the dealer.this was the final last straw i spoke with anthony santarsiero and told him i was returning the coach as of that day 
suffice it to say that i am out of patience,and that both of our lives will be made easier if you will simply authorize a repurchase of the coach at its original cost.this coach simply needs to be permanently recalled until major corrections are made.
i not interested in further retrofits,patches,or excuses.i will never take this coach back.
neither blue bird nor shorewood rv refunded plaintiffs purchase price.instead,on july,a blue bird technician performed a major electrical retrofit on the rv.despite this repair,the batteries failed again on august.additional repairs were completed on august,while the rv was in shorewood rv possession.
on september,blue bird director of customer service formally rejected oren request for a refund,asserting,y our electrical issue on your has been repaired we do not refund purchases or buy units back.we are committed to working with our dealers and customers to resolve any service needs that may occur.i know you have had some battery issues with your unit,but i am confident that these issues have been resolved.you have a reliable unit that should give you the service and performance it is designed for.
on september,oren and shorewood rv signed a consignment agreement,giving shorewood rv the exclusive right to sell the rv.before putting the rv on shorewood rv sales lot,additional repairs were completed on september,and october.
despite the consignment agreement,oren continued his efforts to obtain a refund.on october,oren again wrote to blue bird,demanding a refund.oren wrote another letter to blue bird on november,this time notifying blue bird he considered the rv to be a lemon under minnesota lemon law.on november,blue bird replied to oren october,letter.blue bird refused to provide a refund,declaring blue bird stands behind this rv which is a reliable unit and will give you the service and performance for which it is designed.blue bird then apologized for any inconvenience oren incurred while the rv was being repaired and offered to send a wanderlodge factory representative to shorewood to provide additional owner training and a systems check of the rv.on november,oren traveled to shorewood rv to check the status of the rv.oren found the rv would not start because the batteries were once again dead.on november,blue bird attorney responded to oren november,letter stating,blue bird and its distributor have worked on the motor home and believe that the cause of the battery problem you identified,as well as any other issues,have been remedied.therefore,blue bird has fully complied with the requirements of its warranty and the minnesota lemon law.this letter went on to reiterate blue bird willingness to continue working with oren and shorewood rv to assure oren that the motor home conforms to the warranty.
on november,oren replied to blue bird attorney,enclosing a spreadsheet detailing the problems he had experienced with the rv and stating 
my purpose in sending along this information is to document the fact that neither blue bird,nor its authorized representative,shorewood center,has succeeded in meeting its obligations to conform the vehicle to the applicable express warranties.as the record clearly demonstrates,even after a reasonable number of attempts to repair the electrical and other problems that have haunted this unit,it remains unfit for the purpose it was intended therefore,i reiterate my demand that blue bird make a full refund of the purchase price of the unit.
blue bird attorney responded on december,asserting there was nothing wrong with the rv,and blue bird has lived up to its obligations under the warranty.oren wrote back to blue bird attorney on december,indicating he would consider litigation if the matter were not acceptably resolved.on january,plaintiffs attorney wrote blue bird attorney in an attempt to schedule the matter for informal arbitration,as provided by the alternative dispute settlement mechanism set forth in minnesota lemon law.
thereafter,oren learned from shorewood rv that parliament coach,an rv dealer in florida,might be interested in purchasing the rv.in february,oren agreed to sell the rv to parliament coach for,resulting in a loss to plaintiffs of over.before the sale,oren fully disclosed to parliament coach the problems oren had experienced with the rv 
oren informed shorewood rv someone from parliament coach would be coming to shorewood rv the next day to take the rv.oren admits he did not inform blue bird of the sale.blue bird did not learn until march,that plaintiffs sold the rv.
on may,blue bird informed plaintiffs it refused to participate in arbitration based on its belief the lemon law claim no longer applied after plaintiffs sold the rv.on july,plaintiffs filed suit in minnesota state court against blue bird.blue bird removed the case to federal court based on diversity of citizenship.plaintiffs later amended their complaint,adding shorewood rv as a defendant.
defendants moved for summary judgment.the magistrate recommended granting defendants motion with respect to all plaintiffs claims except plaintiffs state law claim for breach of express warranty.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,the magistrate determined a factfinder could reasonably conclude plaintiffs breach of express warranty claim did not accrue until on or after november,and,therefore,the claim was not barred by the one year limitations period contained in blue bird limited warranty.the parties filed objections to the magistrate report and recommendation.
the district court concluded defendants were entitled to summary judgment on all of plaintiffs claims,including the state law claim for breach of express warranty.the district court determined,as a matter of law,plaintiffs breach of express warranty claim was untimely because the claim accrued no later than july,and plaintiffs filed suit more than one year later,on july.plaintiffs now argue their breach of express warranty claim was timely blue bird repeated promises to repair the rv tolled the limitations period on plaintiffs breach of express and implied warranty claims plaintiffs sale of the motor home did not bar their minnesota lemon law claim and plaintiffs were entitled to pursue their claims for revocation of acceptance against blue bird and shorewood rv.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.hindman transkrit,cir citations omitted.we will find the district court grant of summary judgment proper when the record,viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,and giving that party the benefit of all reasonable inferences,shows that there is no genuine issue of material fact,and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.citations omitted 
breach of warranty 
accrual of breach of express warranty claim 
plaintiffs argue the district court erred by finding their claim for breach of express warranty was barred by the one year limitations period contained in blue bird limited warranty.the limited warranty guaranteed certain components of the rv would be free from defects in material and workmanship for specified periods of time.it also provided,a ny suit alleging a breach of this limited warranty or any other alleged warranty must be filed within one year of breach.
under minnesota law,a cause of action for breach of warranty accrues when the breach occurs,regardless of the aggrieved party lack of knowledge of the breach.a breach of warranty occurs when tender of delivery is made,except that where a warranty explicitly extends to future performance of the goods and discovery of the breach must await the time of such performance the cause of action accrues when the breach is or should have been discovered.id.thus,when a warranty extends to future performance,the cause of action accrues when the plaintiff discovers or should have discovered the defendant refusal or inability to maintain the goods as warranted in the contract.anderson crestliner,quoting church of the nativity of our lord watpro,overruled by ly nystrom.
the parties agree the limited warranty explicitly extends to future performance by guaranteeing certain components of the rv would be free from defects in material and workmanship for specified periods of time.because the limited warranty extends to future performance,oren breach of warranty claim accrued on the date oren discover ed or should have discovered blue bird refusal or inability to maintain the rv as warranted in the contract.see id.
the parties agree blue bird expressed a continued willingness to repair the rv long after july.thus,our concern is not the date blue bird refused to maintain the rv,but the date oren discovered blue bird inability to maintain the rv as warranted.the parties dispute when this discovery occurred.blue bird argues,and the district court found,that by july,oren firmly believed blue bird was unable to maintain the rv as warranted.the district court determined,as a matter of law,oren july,letter unequivocally demonstrated oren belief blue bird was unable to maintain the rv as warranted.we disagree.
oren july,letter stated,in relevant part 
after almost a year of continued problems with this motor home,i have come to three conclusions.first,the model was released before it had been properly designed,tested,and debugged.second,shorewood rv is a terrific dealer for you,but even they could not overcome the inherent problems in the.third,i have run out of patience,confidence,and trust that the problems can be fixed in a reasonable time,and i request that you return my purchase price.
on july,after the engine batteries once again died,i removed all my personal belongings and returned the coach to the dealer.this was the final last straw.
suffice it to say that i am out of patience,and that both of our lives will be made easier if you will simply authorize a repurchase of the coach at its original cost.this coach simply needs to be permanently recalled until major corrections are made.
i not interested in further retrofits,patches,or excuses.i will never take this coach back.
oren july,letter certainly evidences oren high level of frustration and disgust with the need for repeated repairs on the rv.however,the district court erred by concluding as a matter of law that oren believed the rv was beyond repair as of that date.oren statement he had run out of patience,confidence,and trust that the problems can be fixed in a reasonable time does not necessarily mean oren,at that moment,believed the rv was beyond repair.a factfinder could just as reasonably conclude oren was simply tired of dealing with the rv defects.saying i am out of patience or i not interested in further retrofits,patches,or excuses is not the same as saying,i believe blue bird is incapable of maintaining this rv as warranted.
the fact oren allowed additional repairs to be completed on july,august,september,and october,strongly suggests oren continued to believe blue bird was capable of eventually repairing the rv.it was not until november,that oren first informed blue bird he believed blue bird had failed in meeting its obligations to conform the vehicle to the applicable express warranties.we conclude a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding the date oren knew or should have known blue bird was unable to maintain the rv as warranted.
accrual of breach of implied warranty claim 
unlike express warranties,under minnesota law,i mplied warranties can not,by their very nature,explicitly extend to future performance.marvin lumber cedar ppg,cir citation omitted.see also nelson int l harvester,overruled on other grounds by lloyd smith,a breach of implied warranty occurs,and the claim accrues,when tender of delivery is made.thus,the fact blue bird expressly warranted various components of the rv would be free from defects for specified periods of time after tender of delivery does not extend the accrual date for a breach of implied warranty claim.the parties agree tender of delivery of the rv occurred on july.plaintiffs filed suit almost two years later,on july.plaintiffs breach of implied warranty claim is therefore untimely,unless blue bird is equitably estopped from asserting the statute of limitations defense 
equitable estoppel 
plaintiffs argue even if their breach of express warranty claim accrued on july,and their breach of implied warranty claim accrued on july,the limitations period was tolled until at least november because blue bird repeatedly promised to repair the rv and conform it to the limited warranty.under the doctrine of equitable estoppel,if a buyer delays filing suit as a result of reasonable and detrimental reliance on a seller assurances it will repair the defective goods,the limitations period is tolled during that period of delay see lake superior ctr.authority hammel,green abrahamson,discussing defects in real property j d,ramy int,no,wl,at,leasing biba info.processing,sohns,at.see generally,at.while estoppel is ordinarily a question of fact for the jury,when only one inference can be drawn from the facts,the question is one of law.leasing,at quoting l h transport,drew agency.
there is ample evidence in the record from which a factfinder could conclude blue bird made ongoing assurances it would repair the rv.after oren delivered the rv to shorewood rv lot on july,blue bird technicians attempted repairs on july,august,september,and october.on september,blue bird rejected oren request for a refund but maintained,we are committed to working with our dealers and customers to resolve any service needs that may occur.as late as november,blue bird asserted it had complied with minnesota lemon law and the requirements of its warranty,although reiterating its willingness to continue working with oren and shorewood rv to assure oren that the motor home conforms to the warranty.
the critical question,then,is whether plaintiffs delayed filing suit as a result of reasonable and detrimental reliance on blue bird ongoing assurances to repair the rv,and,if so,on what date plaintiffs reliance and the tolling of the limitations period ended there is no evidence in the record from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude plaintiffs reasonably and detrimentally relied on blue bird efforts or promises to repair the rv after oren delivered the rv to shorewood rv lot on july.on the contrary,by july,oren manifested no reliance on blue bird or shorewood rv assurances the defective rv would soon be repaired.although plaintiffs insist blue bird resorted to bald assertions that the motor home was not defective despite its continuing failures and need for repairs,plaintiffs do not claim oren believed these assertions or that plaintiffs delayed filing suit as a result of detrimentally relying upon such assertions.nowhere do plaintiffs maintain blue bird assurances or repair attempts after july,caused any detrimental reliance,nor does the record support such an inference.the fact oren may have believed blue bird was capable of eventually repairing the rv falls far short of establishing that oren detrimentally relied upon blue bird promises to repair the rv.on july,oren wrote blue bird ceo announcing the last straw,and explaining oren had run out of patience that the problems can be fixed in a reasonable time,and he was not interested in further retrofits,patches,or excuses.because plaintiffs have identified no action they took or failed to take after july,in reliance upon any statements or actions of blue bird,the district court did not err by determining,as a matter of law,plaintiffs were not entitled to equitable tolling.
minnesota lemon law 
plaintiffs argue the district court erred by finding plaintiffs resale of the rv prevents their claim under minnesota lemon law.the minnesota lemon law provides 
if the manufacturer is unable to conform a new motor vehicle to any applicable express warranty by repairing or correcting any defect or condition which substantially impairs the use or market value of the motor vehicle to the consumer after a reasonable number of attempts,the manufacturer shall either replace the new motor vehicle with a comparable motor vehicle or accept return of the vehicle from the consumer and refund to the consumer the full purchase price if the manufacturer offers a replacement vehicle under this section,the consumer has the option of rejecting the replacement vehicle and requiring the manufacturer to provide a refund.
subd.a emphasis added.
plaintiffs contend they were entitled to sell the rv because they offered to return the rv,but blue bird refused to refund the purchase price.this argument fails.our disposition of plaintiffs lemon law claim follows pfeiffer ford motor.in pfeiffer,the plaintiffs sold their allegedly defective vehicle after they were denied relief by ford motor company informal dispute mechanism under the minnesota lemon law.id.at.plaintiffs then filed suit against ford under the minnesota lemon law.id.the minnesota court of appeals affirmed the district court dismissal of the plaintiffs lemon law claim,concluding a plain,common sense reading of this statute evidences a requirement of tender of the allegedly defective vehicle in order to recover under the lemon law.id.at.merely offering to return the vehicle is plain language of the statute conditions a consumer refund on the manufacturer accept ing return of the vehicle from the consumer.see,subd.a.plaintiffs did not comply with the law tender requirement because plaintiffs did not return the rv to blue bird.
the pfeiffer court further explained the tender requirement comports with the lemon law purpose of protecting subsequent consumers,reasoning,it is inconsistent to allow a lemon law recovery,while allowing the same injured party to pass the defective auto on to another consumer without notice or the warranty protections provided to the first owner.pfeiffer,at.plaintiffs insist they complied with the purpose of the lemon law because,before selling the rv,they fully disclosed to parliament coach all the problems oren had experienced with the rv.we disagree.minnesota lemon law requires that clear labeling and notice be provided to subsequent purchasers of a vehicle returned due to incurable defects,id.citing,subd.a,and also requires the manufacturer to provide continued warranty coverage to the new owner,subd.a.oren disclosure to parliament coach of the rv problems was insufficient to extend all of the lemon law protections to the rv subsequent owner.we agree with the district court reading of pfeiffer and the minnesota lemon law that a plaintiff who passes his lemon to another consumer before trial can not pursue a claim under minnesota lemon law 
revocation of acceptance 
revocation of acceptance against shorewood rv 
plaintiffs contend the district court erred by granting defendants motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs revocation of acceptance claims against blue bird and shorewood rv.specifically,plaintiffs argue the district court erred by determining,as a matter of law,plaintiffs revoked acceptance only against blue bird and not against shorewood rv.
a buyer may revoke acceptance of a commercial unit whose nonconformity substantially impairs its value to the buyer if the buyer was unable to discover the nonconformity at the time of delivery.revocation of acceptance must occur within a reasonable time after the buyer discovers or should have discovered the ground for it and before any substantial change in condition of the goods which is not caused by their own defects.it is not effective until the buyer notifies the seller of it.the revocation must be unequivocal.see barry sewall indus.supply of houston,cir.however,the notice of revocation is not required to assume any particular format cissell park.rather,t he notice of revocation,to be sufficient,should fairly apprise the seller that the buyer wants to give back the goods and receive a substitute or money in return.id.citing william hawkland,uniform commercial code series.
on july,oren returned the rv to shorewood rv.oren removed his belongings and gave the keys to shorewood rv.oren informed santarsiero he was returning the rv as of that day.at santarsiero suggestion,oren wrote a letter to blue bird ceo requesting a refund.oren copied santarsiero on the letter.
the fact oren took santarsiero suggestion and sought a refund from blue bird does not,as a matter of law,defeat oren revocation of acceptance claim against shorewood rv.a reasonable factfinder could readily conclude oren return of the rv and oren conduct and discussions with santarsiero were sufficiently unequivocal to notify shorewood rv that oren intended to revoke acceptance of the rv and obtain a refund.because material fact questions exist regarding whether oren effectively revoked acceptance against shorewood rv,we conclude the district court erred by determining,as a matter of law,plaintiffs revoked acceptance only against blue bird and not against shorewood rv.
reacceptance 
defendants maintain,even if plaintiffs effectively revoked acceptance against both blue bird and shorewood rv,plaintiffs resale of the rv constituted reacceptance,which defeats plaintiffs revocation of acceptance claim against both defendants as a matter of law.
u pon notice of revocation,the buyer must not indulge in any action which would indicate that he has reaccepted the goods.barry sewall indus.supply,at.a buyer act of dominion over goods,including sale of the goods,is inconsistent with a buyer claim of revocation of acceptance.chancellor development brand,citations omitted see also pettibone minnesota castle,per curiam the sale by defendant of the machinery to others was an act inconsistent with the seller ownership.quoting.c.
under certain circumstances,a buyer resale of nonconforming goods will not defeat the buyer claim for revocation of acceptance.states,
on rightful rejection or justifiable revocation of acceptance a buyer has a security interest in goods in the buyer possession or control for any payments made on their price and any expenses reasonably incurred in their inspection,receipt,transportation,care and custody and may hold such goods and resell them in like manner as an aggrieved seller section.
if an aggrieved seller resells nonconforming goods in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner the seller may recover the difference between the resale price and the contract price together with any incidental damages,but less expenses saved in consequence of the buyer breach.the resale may be a public or private sale.where the resale is at a private sale the seller must give the buyer reasonable notification of an intention to.if the aggrieved party resells the goods without providing notification of an intention to resell,the resale does not meet the requirements of.see,jack rabbit lines,neoplan coach sales,determining the aggrieved buyer failure to notify the seller of its intention to resell at a private sale precluded recovery of damages otherwise allowable under massey moore,so d,reasoning the seller violated the notice requirements of by failing to notify the buyer of his intention to resell goods at a private sale kleiderfabrik peters sportswear,explaining explicitly requires the buyer to follow the procedures for sale set forth in,and when a buyer sold the defective goods,without observing the requirements of,it went beyond the range of permissible conduct for a buyer in possession of rejected goods,and it was no longer protected against liability by the code anheuser oswald refractories,holding,when a seller avails himself of the remedy afforded by he must comply with all of the terms of that section and the burden of showing compliance is on the seller.
it is undisputed oren did not inform blue bird he intended to sell the rv.blue bird only learned of the sale after the rv was sold.thus,with respect to blue bird,plaintiffs failed to sell the rv in a commercially reasonable manner with reasonable notice to blue bird,as required by,and therefore are precluded from recovering under.we conclude plaintiffs resale of the rv was inconsistent with plaintiffs claim of revocation of acceptance as to blue bird and constituted a reacceptance of the rv.blue bird is entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs revocation of acceptance claim 
the question of whether plaintiffs provided shorewood rv sufficient notification of their intention to resell the rv only arises if the factfinder determines plaintiffs effectively revoked acceptance against shorewood rv.assuming the factfinder resolves this issue in plaintiffs favor,we conclude there is no doubt plaintiffs complied with the notice requirement of.on september,oren and shorewood rv signed a consignment agreement,giving shorewood rv the exclusive right to sell the rv.it was shorewood rv that informed oren that parliament coach might be interested in purchasing the rv.after oren agreed to sell the rv to parliament coach,oren notified shorewood rv someone from parliament coach would be coming to shorewood rv the next day to pick up the rv.these acts,as a matter of law,were sufficient to meet the notice requirements of assuming plaintiffs revocation of acceptance was effective against shorewood rv,plaintiffs resale of the rv did not constitute reacceptance 
iii.conclusion 
genuine issues of material fact exist with respect to plaintiffs breach of express warranty and warranty claims against blue bird and plaintiffs revocation of acceptance claim against shorewood rv.we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment on these claims.we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on the equitable tolling issue,plaintiffs claim under the minnesota lemon law,and plaintiffs revocation of acceptance claim against blue bird.
i concur in the conclusions reached by the panel majority the court except for its affirmance of the district court erroneous rejection of oren implied warranty claims based upon blue bird statute of limitation defense.on this issue,i respectfully dissent and would remand the implied warranty claims for trial.
introduction 
the court purposely ignores several relevant and controlling statutory issues because the parties fail,in its view,to engage in formal discussion and disputation of the matters.but,causes of action based upon implied warranty,and affirmative defenses to them,were directly joined in the district court and should be fully dealt with in this appeal.indeed,appellate courts often of necessity resolve issues on the basis of the record alone,even without argument and briefing by the parties,where,as here,injustice might otherwise result.singleton wulff,d see also metalcrafters mcneil,cir pro svc,lenan,cir.
unless otherwise properly modified or excluded,the minnesota uniform commercial code ucc,as an incident of public policy,requires implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose to flow as a matter of law to a purchaser of goods,even outside the four corners of a written sales agreement.in minnesota,these warranties run from both the manufacturer,here blue bird,and the immediate seller,here shorewood.ann.nelson int l harvester,overruled on other grounds by lloyd smith,
background 
the blue bird rv,goods as defined in.ann,was delivered to oren by shorewood,blue bird authorized dealer,on july.oren filed suit against shorewood and blue bird in minnesota state court on july.the vehicle was accompanied by a blue bird limited warranty.appellants add.at.an exact copy of this warranty as delivered to oren is attached to and incorporated within this dissent by reference as appendix 
the relevant sections and subsections or portions thereof of the minnesota ucc that govern both the express and implied warranties that were extended to oren are as follows 
general definitions 
b conspicuous,with reference to a term,means so written,displayed,or presented that a reasonable person against which it is to operate ought to have noticed it.whether a term is conspicuous or not is a decision for the court.conspicuous terms include the following 
a a heading in capitals equal to or greater in size than the surrounding text,or in contrasting type,font,or color to the surrounding text of the same or lesser size and 
b language in the body of a record or display in larger type than the surrounding text,or in contrasting type,font,or color to the surrounding text of the same size,or set off from surrounding text of the same size by symbols or other marks that call attention to the language.
express warranties by affirmation,promise,description,sample 
express warranties by the seller are created as follows 
a any affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which relate to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the affirmation or promise.
b any description of the goods which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the description.
it is not necessary to the creation of an express warranty that the seller use formal words such as warrant or guarantee or that the seller have a specific intention to make a warranty,but an affirmation merely of the value of the goods or a statement purporting to be merely the seller opinion or commendation of the goods does not create a warranty.
implied warranty merchantability usage of trade 
unless excluded or modified section,a warranty that the goods shall be merchantable is implied in a contract for their sale if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind.
goods to be merchantable must be at least such as 
a pass without objection in the trade under the contract description and 
b in the case of fungible goods,are of fair average quality within the description and 
c are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used and 
d run,within the variations permitted by the agreement,of even kind,quality and quantity within each unit and among all units involved and 
e are adequately contained,packaged,and labeled as the agreement may require and 
f conform to the promises or affirmations of fact made on the container or label if any.
unless excluded or modified section other implied warranties may arise from course of dealing or usage of trade.
implied warranty fitness for particular purpose 
where the seller at the time of contracting has reason to know any particular purpose for which the goods are required and that the buyer is relying on the seller skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods,there is unless excluded or modified under the next section an implied warranty that the goods shall be fit for such purpose.
exclusion or modification of warranties 
words or conduct relevant to the creation of an express warranty and words or conduct tending to negate or limit warranty shall be construed wherever reasonable as consistent with each other but subject to the provisions of this article on parol or extrinsic evidence section negation or limitation is inoperative to the extent that such construction is unreasonable.
subject to subsection,to exclude or modify the implied warranty of merchantability or any part of it the language must mention merchantability and in case of a writing must be conspicuous,and to exclude or modify any implied warranty of fitness the exclusion must be by a writing and conspicuous 
notwithstanding subsection 
c an implied warranty can also be excluded or modified by course of dealing or course of performance or usage of trade.
statute of limitations in contracts for sale 
an action for breach of any contract for sale must be commenced within four years after the cause of action has accrued.by the original agreement the parties may reduce the period of limitation to not less than one year but may not extend it.
a cause of action accrues when the breach occurs,regardless of the aggrieved party lack of knowledge of the breach.a breach of warranty occurs when tender of delivery is made,except that where a warranty explicitly extends to future performance of the goods and discovery of the breach must await the time of such performance the cause of action accrues when the breach is or should have been discovered.
this section does not alter the law on tolling of the statute of limitations,nor does it apply to causes of action which have accrued before this chapter becomes effective.
discussion 
as stated above,the ucc provides that breach of an implied warranty must be commenced within four years but the parties may reduce the period of limitation by agreement to not less than one year.ann.thus,by agreement,the ucc authorized blue bird to shorten the period to one year subject to restrictions set forth in section above,that is that any modifications or exclusions be in writing,unambiguous,and mention the word merchantability.dubbe smith harvestore.in dubbe,the trial court and court of appeals found the manufacturer warranty disclaimer sufficient as a matter of law.the minnesota court noted that harvestore had totally disclaimed all implied warranties,capitalized all words in the entire disclaimer section,and specifically mentioned the word merchantability.the courts also observed that dubbe stated in the agreement that he had read the disclaimer.id.in this case,however,on the crucial issues of disclaiming implied warranties and reducing the litigation limitation period as authorized by.ann,we face very different facts.oren makes no statement that he was asked to or did read the language outlining the reduced limitation period.and,as noted in appendix a,the capitalized language dealt not with the lawsuit limitation period but rather created the overall length of the warranty period,including an implied warranty duration of two or three years,limited the nature of some recoverable damages,and specified which of blue bird employees could make additional representations.it bears repeating that this capitalized portion of the contract did not at all deal with the period of time in which litigation could be commenced for breach of any of the warranties.indeed,the statute of limitation reduction language is found in a wholly new paragraph presented in significantly smaller,uncapitalized type.the new paragraph totally deals with a different subject than the capitalized portions.blue bird slips the limitation language into the fourth and last sentence of the new paragraph,which sentence reads,in isolation both as to location and subject matter,as follows a ny suit alleging a breach of this limited warranty or any other alleged warranty must be filed within one year of breach.there is no mention of either implied warranty or merchantability within or near this supposedly limiting language.
this crucial,purportedly limiting language violates.ann.b a and b of the ucc which,as earlier stated,requires capital letters equal or greater in size than the surrounding text or use of contrasting type,font or color or that call attention to the language.see valley paving,dexter chaney,no,at.as a matter of law,this limiting language relied upon by blue bird and the court is both inconspicuous and ambiguous.accordingly,reviewing the matter de novo as we must,a statute of limitations should apply.
assuming,but purely for argument sake,the validity of blue bird claimed statute of limitation,and its contention that the limitation period began to run at the time of the july,delivery,oren implied warranty of merchantability claim is still not barred.as an initial matter,blue bird express warranties purport to be valid for either two or three years and the implied warranties are limited to the warranty period of this written warranty.appendix giving oren the benefit of these inconsistent terms,the warranty period for the implied warranties would be three years.nonetheless,for our purposes,a period is more than enough.and,while there is probably an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose under.ann.that may have passed to oren,it is not particularly relevant to my concerns.an implied warranty of merchantability was clearly imposed upon blue bird as a matter of law and public policy under.ann.and such a warranty carries with it measures of liability and damages beyond those purportedly excluded or modified by blue bird limited warranty.see.ann.thus,the viability of the merchantability warranty is more than of academic interest to oren.
without argument,blue bird expressly warranted the rv to be free from defects in at least three ways.see appellants add.at.and,as conceded by both blue bird and the court,there is little doubt that the rv was defective when delivered and,according to the court,little doubt that the vehicle was never merchantable at any time relevant to this dispute,or,at least,a fact question not reachable through summary judgment exists on this issue.
in this regard,paragraph one of the limited warranty is of particular interest.it says.for a period of two years from the date of delivery to the original purchaser blue bird warrants all other components installed by blue bird and wonderlodge.id.then,in the third and sixth paragraphs of the limited warranty,blue bird reserves for this period the right to attempt to cure any defects and make the vehicle merchantable as required by the implied warranty.accordingly,if you credit blue bird statute of limitation affirmative defense and attempt to square it with the court conclusions in this appeal,the lawsuit limitations period for the implied warranties expired well before blue bird gave up its right to cure the defects which would have made the rv comply with the requirements of the implied warranty.this result flies in the face of approximately fifty years of consumer equity policy imbedded within the enactment of the uniform commercial code in,by now,all fifty states,some territories,and a commonwealth.blue bird clever penmanship and paragraph positioning can not be allowed to overrule the policy pronouncements of the uniform commercial code.
even if you avoid the ambiguity,conspicuousness and public policy problems inherent in the facts at work in this case,a further,and perhaps more important,error lurks within the court opinion.i again assume for purposes of discussion the validity of the court analysis that oren cause of action for breach of the implied warranty occurred upon
