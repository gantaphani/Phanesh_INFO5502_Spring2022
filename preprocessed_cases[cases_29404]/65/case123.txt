this products liability case,arising under the law of pennsylvania,presents a question of admissibility under federal rule of evidence of remedial measures offered by a plaintiff to establish that a product is defective.timothy diehl was severely injured when his legs became trapped under the rear wheels of a machine manufactured by.diehl and his wife sued alleging that the machine was defective because its rear wheels were not enclosed,it lacked a alarm on the rear of the machine,and it lacked proper warning signs.the diehls sought to introduce evidence that,shortly after the accident,the owner of the machine partially enclosed the rear wheels,installed a backup alarm on the rear of the machine,and placed warning signs on the rear of the machine.these measures were taken in order to prevent similar accidents in the future.the district court excluded evidence of these remedial measures under rule.after trial,a jury returned a verdict for,and judgment was entered against the diehls.we hold that rule does not bar evidence of remedial measures taken by a,and that the evidence offered in this case was relevant and would not tend to confuse or mislead the jury.because we conclude that the exclusion of this evidence was not harmless error,we will reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for a new trial.
on may,timothy diehl was severely injured while working as a laborer on a road crew for ia construction,ia.on the day of the accident,the road crew was using a machine called a road widener to extend the shoulder of a road.manufactured by in,the road widener is used to deposit and spread material to one side of the roadway.the road widener is usually followed by laborers who must perform a number of tasks,including removing excess material that is inadvertently left on the paved portion of the roadway removing stones that become lodged in the material leveling off the material that has been spread and straightening the outer edge of the deposited material.the laborers are then followed by a roller to press the material.
on the day of the accident,diehl was working as one of the laborers behind the road widener.the road widener had come to a stop,and then began to move in reverse.diehl,who was working within a couple of feet of the road widener,was not aware that the machine was reversing toward him.one of the exposed wheels struck diehl right ankle,trapping and crushing his lower leg.
the diehls theory of the case was that the road widener was defective in design for three reasons it lacked a bumper or any other enclosure of the rear wheels the alarm was inaudible,particularly because it was placed on the front of the machine and it lacked proper warnings.the diehls sought to introduce testimony by an ia mechanic that,shortly after the accident,the mechanic modified the road widener by installing a rear that enclosed the rear tires relocating the alarm to the rear of the machine and placing warning signs on the rear of the machine the ia redesign.according to the mechanic testimony,the ia redesign was done in response to the accident and for the purpose of preventing similar accidents.significantly,ia is not a party to this lawsuit.
filed a motion in limine prior to trial to prohibit the diehls from introducing evidence of the ia redesign.the diehls filed their own motion in limine seeking an order allowing them to introduce evidence of the ia redesign at trial.the district court granted motion and denied the diehls motion,ruling that the ia redesign was a subsequent remedial measure inadmissible under.
at trial,the diehls asked the district court to reconsider its exclusion of the ia redesign,arguing that rule does not apply to subsequent remedial measures taken by a.the district court again refused to admit the ia redesign,ruling that rule by its terms is not limited to remedial measures taken by the defendant.alternatively,the district court excluded the evidence under,finding that evidence of remedial measures taken in would confuse the jury,whose focus was temporally limited to whether the product was safe in.
the jury returned a verdict for using a verdict form given by the district court.the jury answered no to question,was the road widener defective in design when manufactured and sold by the defendant finding no defect,the jury did not consider the remaining issues in the case.
the diehls filed a timely appeal,challenging numerous and trial rulings by the district court,including the court decision to exclude evidence of the ia redesign.we have jurisdiction under we exercise plenary review over the district court interpretation of the rules of evidence however,assuming that the evidence could be admissible in some circumstances,we review the district court decision to exclude that evidence for abuse of discretion.ansell green acres contracting,cir stecyk bell helicopter textron,cir.
the primary issue in this case is whether.excludes evidence of subsequent remedial measures taken by a such as ia.rule provides 
when,after an injury or harm allegedly caused by an event,measures are taken that,if taken previously,would have made the injury or harm less likely to occur,evidence of the subsequent measures is not admissible to prove negligence,culpable conduct,a defect in a product,a defect in a product design,or a need for a warning or instruction.this rule does not require the exclusion of evidence of subsequent measures when offered for another purpose,such as proving ownership,control,or feasibility of precautionary measures,if controverted,or impeachment.
rule rests on the strong public policy of encouraging manufacturers to make improvements for greater safety.stecyk,at quoting kelly crown equip,cir see also.advisory committee note the other,and more impressive,ground for exclusion rests on a social policy of encouraging people to take,or at least not discouraging them from taking,steps in furtherance of added safety.the rule recognizes that manufacturers will be discouraged from improving the safety of their products if such changes can be introduced as evidence that their previous designs were defective.stecyk,at.
this policy is not implicated where the evidence concerns remedial measures taken by an individual or entity that is not a party to the lawsuit.the admission of remedial measures by a necessarily will not expose that to liability,and therefore will not discourage the from taking the remedial measures in the first place.it is noteworthy that each of the circuits to address this issue has concluded that rule does not apply to subsequent remedial measures taken by a,mehojah drummond,cir,emerson,cir raymond raymond,cir pau yosemite park curry,cir hercules,cir dixon int l harvester,cir lolie ohio brass,cir per curiam.see generally weinstein federal evidence joseph mclaughlin,ed.
the able district judge declined to follow these authorities,observing that the text of rule makes no exception for subsequent remedial measures taken by a.this is true enough,but the advisory committee notes to rule state that the rule incorporates conventional doctrine which excludes evidence of subsequent remedial measures as proof of an admission of fault.see also rimkus.ski,cir stating that rule codified the generally accepted common law rule.prior to the enactment of rule,conventional doctrine in this circuit was that the rule excluding evidence of repairs made after an accident was not applicable to repairs made by a.see steele wiedemann mach,cir.the advisory committee reference to an admission of fault reinforces this limitation it hardly makes sense to speak of a party fault being admitted by someone other than the party.furthermore,the advisory committee was well aware of the courts consistent interpretation of the rule.the notes to the amendment of rule the rule applicable to products liability with approval the first circuit opinion in raymond raymond.the court in raymond expressly ruled that there is no rationale for excluding third party subsequent repairs under the rule.at.
because rule does not apply to evidence of subsequent remedial measures taken by a,it was error for the district court to exclude evidence of the ia redesi
