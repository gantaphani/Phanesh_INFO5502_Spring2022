plaintiffs are new jersey blueberry farmers who filed suit against a pesticide company for damages to their crops based on theories of products liability,negligence,consumer fraud,and breach of express warranty.in two separate orders,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendant novartis based on releases that some of the plaintiffs had signed before filing suit,and based on its holding that the remaining plaintiffs claims were preempted by the federal insecticide,fungicide,and rodenticide act fifra.
the principal issue on appeal is whether plaintiffs claims are preempted by fifra.we conclude that,under bates dow agrosciences llc,d,decided after the district court rulings in this case,plaintiffs claims for defective design,defective manufacture,negligent testing,negligent misrepresentation,and fraud are not preempted because those claims do not impose labeling requirements in addition to or different from those required by fifra.accordingly,we vacate the district court judgment as to those claims and remand for further proceedings.we also remand for the district court to consider whether,under bates,fifra preempts plaintiffs claim.
plaintiffs also appeal the district court granting of summary judgment against the claims of seven farmers who signed releases with novartis.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court dismissal of those claims.
factual and procedural background 
for several years,plaintiffs the farmers treated the blueberry plants on their farms with two insecticides manufactured by defendant novartis crop protection,novartis diazinon wp wp and diazinon ag ag.before applying the insecticide to the plants,the farmers engaged in the practice of tank mixing,whereby they would mix these insecticides with the fungicides captan or captec the fungicides.the farmers allege that tank mixing is a common and practice among virtually all farmers that dates back to the introduction of pesticides.for several years,the farmers safely mixed the fungicides with diazinon wp or diazinon ag and experienced no crop damage.
this changed,however,when novartis produced and marketed to the farmers a new insecticide known as diazinon ag ag.the company distributed advertising literature claiming that its new product was safer and more effective than ag or wp.the farmers began buying and using ag in the spring of,mixing the new product with the fungicides as they had done with previous novartis insecticides.unbeknownst to the farmers,however,ag contained an additional ingredient known as a surfactant,which was not found in wp or ag the farmers allege that the surfactant,when mixed with the fungicides,caused systematic injury to their blueberry plants,such as blotches,depressions,and spots on the plants,as well as plant death.the farmers also allege that novartis failed to reveal the addition of the surfactant to novartis field personnel and failed to include this information in any of its marketing materials.
in response to the damages to their blueberry crop,the farmers hired william sciarappa sciarappa,a plant pathologist,to investigate the farmers crop damage.novartis sent its representative,neil lapp lapp,also a plant pathologist.almost all contact between the farmers and novartis between august and december was conducted by lapp on behalf of novartis and sciarappa on behalf of the farmers.sciarappa investigations concluded that ag can cause plant damage when mixed with the fungicides.
novartis decided to explore goodwill settlement agreements with the farmers to compensate them for the damage to their crops.between november and january,novartis entered into settlement agreements with thirteen of the fifteen farmers the settling farmers as part of each settlement,the settling farmer signed a release indicating that he or she received the settlement proceeds 
in full satisfaction and extinguishment of all claims and causes of action against novartis arising out of any damage or loss,present or future,to crops,plants,animals,fish or land,direct or indirect,known or unknown,allegedly sustained by the settling plaintiff as a result of the use of ag.
the releases also provided that i t is agreed that this is a business decision in compromise of a disputed claim and that the making of this payment is not an admission of liability on the part of novartis.
the following year,the farmers noticed continuing damage to their blueberry crop,including continued inhibition of plant growth,from their use of ag in.when the farmers contacted novartis,novartis informed them that it would not compensate the farmers for any damages to their crop because the releases signed by the settling farmers precluded any future claims.
the farmers commenced this action seeking damages based on claims of strict products liability,negligence,negligent misrepresentation,fraud,breach of express warranty,and breach of the new jersey consumer fraud act.the thirteen farmers who signed settlement agreements bring additional claims of fraud in the inducement and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
novartis moved for summary judgment against the settling farmers based on the releases that they had signed.the district court granted summary judgment dismissing the claims of seven of the thirteen settling farmers based on the releases.the district court found that,with regard to the remaining six settling farmers,genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether novartis fraudulently induced them to sign the settlement agreements or breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in negotiating the settlement agreements.novartis brought a subsequent motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the remaining farmers claims were preempted by fifra.the district court granted the motion,finding that fifra preempted all of the farmers claims except the claims for fraud in the inducement and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,which the district court dismissed as dependent on the preempted claims.see mortellite novartis crop,d.the principal issue presented in this appeal is whether fifra preempts plaintiffs claims that are based on theories of products liability,negligence,negligent misrepresentation,fraud,breach of warranty,and breach of the new jersey consumer fraud act 
ii.legal analysis 
preemption under fifra 
fifra is comprehensive regulatory statute that covers,among other things,the use,sale,and labeling of pesticides.fifra requires a manufacturer seeking to register a pesticide to submit a proposed label to the epa along with supporting data.c c,f.the epa will register the pesticide if it determines that the pesticide is efficacious and will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on humans and the environment,and that its label complies with fifra prohibition on misbranding.a pesticide is misbranded under fifra if its label contains a statement that is false or misleading in any particular,does not contain adequate instructions for use,or omits necessary warnings or cautionary statements.q a,f,g.fifra also provides that states shall not impose or continue in effect any requirements for labeling or packaging in addition to or different from those required under this act.b.
the inducement test and the bates test 
the district court held that fifra preempts the farmers claims of strict products liability,negligence,breach of express warranty,negligent misrepresentation,fraud,and breach of the new jersey consumer fraud act.in determining that b preempted the farmers claims,the district court applied the inducement test used by the majority of circuits at the time,whereby claims are preempted by fifra if a judgment against the defendant would induce the defendant to alter its product label.mortellite,d at quoting dow agrosciences llc bates,cir.
the district court determined that,although the farmers claims are purportedly based on other theories,they in fact relate directly or indirectly to the fact that novartis did not warn on its product label that ag should not be tank mixed with captan or captec.id.because the current label on novartis had been approved by the epa pursuant to fifra,the district court concluded that a llowing these claims to proceed would be,in effect,permitting state law damages claims to impose label requirements in addition to or different from the federally approved label and fifra,contrary to fifra preemption component.id.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,the district court held that the claims were preempted by fifra.
following the district court decision,the supreme court clarified the scope of fifra preemption in bates.dow agrosciences llc,d.in bates,plaintiffs were texas peanut farmers who brought actions against a pesticide manufacturer based on alleged injuries to their crops.id.at.the pesticide label stated that it was recommended for use in the areas where the peanut farmers experienced crop damage.id.the farmers alleged that,in reality,the pesticide was unsafe for crops grown in soil with a ph level of or greater and that,as a result,it injured their peanut crops,which were grown in soil with ph levels of or higher.id.the farmers brought claims based on theories of strict liability and negligence,and claims of fraud,breach of warranty,and violation of the texas deceptive trade protection act.the district court dismissed one of the plaintiffs claims on state law grounds and rejected the others under fifra preemption provision.the court of appeals affirmed,concluding that the plaintiffs claims were preempted by fifra because those claims,if successful,would give dow a strong incentive to change its label.id.at.quoting dow agrosciences,at.
the supreme court reversed,rejecting the inducement test as a means of determining preemption by fifra.id.at.the court stated that an event,such as a jury verdict,that might induce a pesticide manufacturer to change its label should not be viewed as imposing a new labeling requirement in conflict with fifra.id.at.such an event merely motivates an optional decision to change a label and therefore does not qualify as a requirement to change a label.id.moreover,the court reasoned that,even where a claim would impose a requirement to change a label,such a claim is not preempted by fifra unless it imposes a requirement in addition to or different from those under fifra.id.at.
in place of the inducement test,the supreme court set forth a test for determining whether a state statute or common law claim is preempted by fifra.first,the statute or common law rule must create a requirement for labeling or packaging.id.second,the labeling or packaging requirement must be in addition to or different from those required under fifra.id.an action is preempted by fifra only if it fulfills both requirements of the test.id.
claims of strict liability,negligent testing,and breach of express warranty 
under the bates test,the farmers claims of strict liability,negligent testing,and breach of warranty are not preempted by fifra.in bates,the supreme court faced an almost identical question and concluded that the plaintiffs claims for strict liability,negligent testing,and breach of warranty were not preempted by fifra because such claims do not require the manufacturer to label or package the products in any particular manner.id.at.the supreme court reasoned that r ules that require manufacturers to design reasonably safe products,to use due care in conducting appropriate testing of their products,to market products free of manufacturing defects,and to honor their express warranties or other contractual commitments plainly do not qualify as requirements for labeling or packaging.id.at.the court added that,n one of these rules requires that manufacturers label or package their products in any particular way.id.although the express warranty in bates was located on the product label,the state express warranty rule would not impose a labeling requirement because the cause of action asked only that a manufacturer make good on the contractual commitment that it voluntarily undertook by placing that warranty on its product.id.because an express warranty rule does not require the manufacturer to make an express warranty,or in the event that the manufacturer elects to do so,to say anything in particular in that warranty,the rule does not impose a requirement for labeling or packaging.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
extending this reasoning to the case at hand,we conclude that fifra does not preempt claims based on theories of strict liability,negligent testing,and breach of express warranty.as the supreme court explained,such common law claims plainly do not impose labeling requirements,and therefore can not conflict with fifra.while success on these claims may induce defendant to change the label,this attenuated pressure does not amount to a requirement within the meaning of fifra preemption provision.in other words,a manufacturer may change its label as a result of a verdict against it,but it is not required to do so.we therefore vacate the district court judgment dismissing plaintiffs claims of strict liability,negligent testing,and breach of express warranty.
claims for negligent misrepresentation,fraud,and breach of the new jersey consumer fraud act 
plaintiffs allege their claims of negligent misrepresentation,fraud,and breach of the new jersey consumer fraud act are primarily based on oral misrepresentations made to them by representatives of novartis while marketing ag.in bates,the supreme court determined that claims for negligent misrepresentation,fraud,and breach of a statutory consumer fraud act were not preempted to the extent that they were based on oral representations made by defendant.id.at.the court reasoned that,b ecause fifra defines labeling as all labels and all other written,printed,or graphic matter that accompany a pesticide,p,any requirement that applied to a sales agent oral representations would not be a requirement for labeling or packaging and therefore would not fulfill the first requirement of the bates test.id.we conclude that,to the extent that plaintiffs claims for negligent misrepresentation,fraud,and breach of the statutory consumer fraud act are based on oral misrepresentations,the claims are not preempted by fifra.
plaintiffs claims of negligent misrepresentation,fraud,and breach of the new jersey consumer fraud act are also based on written misrepresentations in brochures and marketing materials that novartis used to market ag to plaintiffs.in determining that fifra preempted these claims,the district court relied on kuiper american cyanamid company,cir,in which the seventh circuit held that claims challenging statements about product safety that merely reiterate information found on the label are preempted because such challenges indirectly challenge the label.id.at.this holding is inconsistent with bates,which holds that causes of action which do not directly involve a label but which merely induce a company to change its label are not preempted under fifra.bates,at,d.we conclude that plaintiffs claims of negligent misrepresentation,fraud,and statutory consumer fraud are preempted only to the extent that those claims rely on written misrepresentations that qualify as labels or labeling as defined by fifra.
fifra defines a label as the written,printed,or graphic matter on,or attached to,the pesticide or device or any of its containers or wrappers.p.fifra defines labeling as 
all labels and all other written,printed,or graphic matter 
a accompanying the pesticide or device at any time or 
b to which reference is made on the label or in literature accompanying the pesticide or device,except to current official publications of the environmental protection agency,the united states departments of agriculture and interior,the department of health and human services,state experiment stations,state agricultural colleges,and other similar federal or state institutions or agencies authorized by law to conduct research in the field of pesticides.
p.because the question of whether the alleged written misstatements fall within this definition was not fully briefed and argued on appeal,we remand to the district court so that it may consider the issue under bates.
unlike the previous claims,plaintiffs claim clearly fulfills the first requirement of the bates tes
