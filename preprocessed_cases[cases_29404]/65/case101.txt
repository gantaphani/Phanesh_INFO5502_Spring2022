opinion of the court 
rosario lindsey,individually and as executrix of the estate of charles lindsey,appeals from an order of the district court granting summary judgment on her claim against caterpillar arising out of the rollover of a sideboom pipe layer,manufactured by caterpillar,which resulted in her husband death.lindsey alleged that the pipe layer was defective in that it did not have a rollover protective structure.the district court held that regulations promulgated under the occupational safety and health act the act or the osh act created a federal standard exempting sideboom pipe layers from the requirement for rollover protection,and that these regulations preempt lindsey state law product liability claim.lindsey argues that the savings clause of the act preserves her claim and,even if preemption is at issue,no conflict exists between the regulation and the state law cause of action.we reverse.
charles lindsey suffered his fatal accident while working on a pipeline project in franklin township,new jersey.he was operating a sideboom tractor manufactured by caterpillar,working in tandem with another tractor to carry a section of pipe up a hill.the tractors were traveling in reverse gear,one behind the other,each attached to the same suspended load via its boom rigging.the tractor,which was the lower of the two,lost power and began rolling down the hill.as it rolled,it pulled the load and the caterpillar tractor along with it.the caterpillar tractor flipped over,fatally crushing charles lindsey.the caterpillar tractor was not equipped with a rollover protective structure,which could have prevented charles from being crushed.
lindsey expert witness,a former designer of heavy industrial equipment for,opined that it was technologically and economically feasible for the caterpillar pipe layer to have been equipped with a rollover protective structure.this opinion was based in part on the fact that caterpillar had designed a rollover protective structure for the tractor model at issue,and that caterpillar provided such structures on later versions for about one percent of the machine base cost,one of caterpillar competitors,was providing such structures on its sideboom pipe layers at the time charles lindsey pipe layer was manufactured.
in,the secretary of labor published regulations pursuant to the occupational safety and health act concerning rollover protective structures for material handling equipment.the design objective of the regulations shall be to minimize the likelihood of a complete overturn and thereby minimize the possibility of the operator being crushed as a result of a rollover or upset.c i.the regulations exclude sideboom pipelaying tractors from this mandate in a single sentence this requirement to equip material handling equipment with rollover protective structures does not apply to sideboom pipelaying tractors.id.a.
in the agency report to charles lindsey employer following the accident,the occupational safety and health administration area director recognized that pipe layers are exempted from the requirement for rollover protective structures.however,in the recommendations that concluded the letter,the director wrote that the agency encourage d the use of those limited sideboom pipe layer models which do feature rollover protective structures.in,four years before lindsey death,caterpillar began offering such structures as an option on three of its sideboom pipe layer models.
rosario lindsey brought a complaint in three counts against caterpillar and midwestern manufacturing company,the manufacturer of the pipe layer operated by charles lindsey.lindsey later stipulated to a dismissal of all counts against midwestern manufacturing company.caterpillar moved for summary judgment on the product liability claim on the basis that lindsey cause of action for defective design was preempted by the act,and on the negligence and breach of warranty claims as being precluded by the new jersey products liability act,stat.ann.to.
the district court concluded that neither the act nor the regulations promulgated thereunder preempted lindsey product liability claim against caterpillar through express or field preemption,but that creates a federal standard concerning a rollover protective structure which is in actual conflict with the state law claim.the district court further concluded and lindsey had conceded that the negligence and breach of warranty claims are precluded as a matter of state law.lindsey appeals the district court order and judgment as to her product liability claim.
lindsey argues that the district court erred as a matter of law in granting summary judgment on the basis that regulations promulgated under the act preempt her tort law cause of action.she asserts that the act regulates only the relationship and does not apply to manufacturers of defective products,and that the act savings clause,b,operates to save state tort causes of action from preemption.our review of the district court grant of summary judgment is plenary,and we review the facts in the light most favorable to the party against whom the order was entered.coolspring stone supply,am.states life ins,cir.
preemption may arise in one of three ways.first,courts will find express preemption if congress has defined explicitly the extent to which a statute preempts state law.second,in the absence of explicit statutory language,state law is subject to field preemption if it regulates conduct in a field that congress intended the federal government to occupy exclusively.finally,state law is preempted to the extent it actually conflicts with federal law.english,d.actual conflict arises when it is impossible to comply with both the federal and state laws or when the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.id.at.
we are mindful that the touchstone of preemption analysis is congressional purpose,which includes a relevant understanding of the structure and purpose of the statute as a whole.medtronic,lohr,d.a federal agency may explicitly preempt state law through its regulations so long as the agency acts within its authority.fid.fed.sav.loan ass de la cuesta,d.
congress passed the occupational safety and health act in with the declared purpose to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the nation safe and healthful working conditions and to preserve our human resources.b.one of the means to this end was authorizing the secretary of labor to set mandatory occupational safety and health standards applicable to businesses affecting interstate commerce.id.b.through this legislation,the federal government entered into a field that traditionally had been occupied by the states.gade solid wastes mgmt.ass n,d.the federal entry was not uniform or comprehensive,however,as the statute also provided that states could submit to the secretary of labor their own occupational safety and health standards to supplant the federal standards.b.moreover,the statute reserved to the states the power to enact occupational safety and health laws in areas in which no federal standard exists.id.at a.although the act contains no express preemption provision,the supreme court has determined that the provisions of preclude any state regulation of an occupational safety or health issue with respect to which a federal standard has been established,unless a state plan has been submitted and approved.gade,at.
in contrast,the statute contains a clearly articulated savings clause.the act is not to be construed to supersede or in any manner affect any workmen compensation law or to enlarge or diminish or affect in any other manner the common law or statutory rights,duties,or liabilities of employers and employees under any law with respect to injuries,diseases,or death of employees arising out of,or in the course of,employment.b.state law claims that fall within the scope of this savings clause are not preempted.
lindsey argues that the savings clause applies and allows her to prosecute her tort claim under the new jersey products liability act.she asserts that the osh act,whose purpose is to promote workplace safety by regulating employer and employee conduct,is prophylactic in nature.when a workplace injury does occur,lindsey argues that nothing in the osh act prevents the injured worker from seeking compensation under state law,and the savings clause specifically preserves an injured worker right to tort recovery.lindsey made these same arguments in response to caterpillar summary judgment motion.
in its memorandum opinion granting summary judgment,the district court adopted the reasoning set forth by the new jersey supreme court in gonzalez ideal tile importing,cert.denied,d,which addressed the issue of whether the act may preempt tort claims against a forklift manufacturer whose product was in compliance with agency standards for warning devices.gonzalez concluded that the interplay between the act savings and preemption clauses means that state tort actions are not expressly preempted and that field preemption is inapplicable because congress intended to allow states to have some role in maintaining safe and healthful working conditions.at.however,the new jersey supreme court found that the plaintiff common law tort action conflicted with osha warning device standards because the warning device that the plaintiff was urging could actually create additional dangers in the workplace rather than promote safety.id.at.gonzalez did not discuss the savings clause.similarly,the district court provided no analysis of the savings clause in this case or whether lindsey cause of action falls within it.
we do not read the gonzalez case as instructive to the facts before us.we are examining the effect of osha regulation concerning rollover protection on lindsey claim that the caterpillar pipe layer her husband was operating was defective because it had no such protective device.the applicable regulation sets forth the requirements for rollover protective structures for material handling equipment,but it exempts sideboom pipe layers from having to be equipped with such devices.in other words,the regulation neither requires nor forbids pipe layers to be operated with rollover protection.
in contrast,the regulation in gonzalez contained two standards for warning devices on forklifts.the first required that forklifts be equipped with an operator controlled horn.the second allowed other devices to be installed at the operator request so long as the device was suitable for the intended area of use.id.at.the agency interpreted the second standard as forbidding any other device that would create more dangers than it would prevent.the court thus interpreted the standards as not merely set ting a mandatory minimum for forklift safety devices,but regulat ing the universe of warning devices,id.at,and concluded that the plaintiff claim for damages was preempted because the other warning devices he urged actually may tend to create additional dangers in the workplace.id.at.the new jersey supreme court was careful to point out that its holding was a narrow one,however,by twice mentioning that not all tort claims are preempted by the osh act.id.at s ome claims arising in the workplace may not be preempted by osha.id.at although a state tort action involving a third party and a work place injury could survive an osha conflict analysis,this one simply does not.
osha rollover protection regulation can not be read as regulating the universe of protective structures for sideboom pipe layers.we therefore analyze lindsey savings clause argument,an issue on which the gonzalez case is silent.
the court in gonzalez granted considerable deference to the agency lengthy interpretation of its own warning device standards.id.at citing geier am.honda motor,d.no agency interpretation exists with respect to pipe layers being exempted from the regulatory requirement for rollover protective structures.the legislative history of the act does contain a letter sent by the solicitor of labor to the chairman of a house subcommittee as that body was considering the bill that had come from the executive branch.the letter specifically addressed the savings clause and provides an indication of the department of labor interpretation.

this agency statement is consistent with the act stated purpose,which is to promote safe and healthful working conditions and preserve human resources.b.the act is limited in scope,however,as jurisdiction under the act extends only to the relationship within the workplace.id.the regulatory language exempting sideboom pipe layers from the requirement for rollover protective structures can not reach beyond the authority congress granted.therefore,the absence of a requirement for an employer does not implicate duties for a manufacturer.a n agency literally has no power to act,let alone the validly enacted legislation or common law of a sovereign state,unless and until congress confers power upon it an agency may not confer power upon itself.louisiana pub.serv.comm,d.
the act has been described as a dynamic purpose statute that does not foreclose the evolution of state laws concerning occupational health and safety.
both the language and the legislative history of the osh act reflect its dynamic character.given its language,history and interpretational ambiguity,the osh act should be interpreted in a manner that prevents the interference with states exercise of police powers to protect their citizens.the osh act language indicates a course of regulatory changes as new technology or economic developments or discovery of harmful effects makes a greater degree of workplace protection feasible.the concept of a static level of regulation is rejected by the text of the osh act,which claims as its purpose to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the nation safe and healthful working conditions and to preserve our human resources.in addition,the osh act does not reflect a congressional intent for national uniformity,and,as noted by justice souter in the gade national solid wastes management ass n,d,dissent,the field of worker protection has traditionally been a state regulated field.

the act savings clause means that a regulation that neither requires nor forbids workplace equipment to have a protective structure can not stand as a preemptive force against an employee right to recover against a manufacturer of that product for defective design.we join with those courts whose holdings have formed a solid consensus that b operates to save state tort rules from preemption.pedraza shell oil,cir citing cases and law review notes see also sakellaridis polar air cargo,d,the savings clause plainly states that workers statutory remedies for personal injuries are preserved.it is not consequential that the standard of care is prescribed by the common law,a separate statutory scheme,or an administrative scheme.york union carbide,w e agree with the pedraza court holding that the savings clause operates to exempt tort law claims from preemption.
caterpillar argues that this case is controlled by the supreme court conflict preemption analysis in geier american honda motor,d,which it asserts should result in lindsey theory of liability being preempted in spite of the act savings clause.geier held that the savings clause of the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act of did not bar the application of conflict preemption analysis to a defective design claim against
