this appeal grows out of an action brought by four purchasers of allegedly defective products.their complaint,filed in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts,sought class certification and the recovery of damages against the manufacturer,its parent,and a firm that had acquired its assets.
confronted by dispositive motions.b,the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.the court entered judgment accordingly.the plaintiffs twice moved unsuccessfully to set aside the judgment and file an amended complaint.they now appeal only from the denial of the second of these motions 
this appeal requires us to decide what legal standard obtained with respect to the motion under review.that,in turn,requires us to decide an antecedent question what effect,if any,does a passing reference to a possible future motion to amend,contained in an opposition to a motion to dismiss,have on the district court authority to allow amendment of a dismissed complaint after the entry of judgment 
we hold that such a passing request is without effect in these circumstances.thus,the plaintiffs must carry the burden of showing that they are entitled to relief from the previously entered judgment.they have not done so.accordingly,we affirm the denial of their motion albeit on grounds different than those relied on by the lower court.
background 
the plaintiffs filed their original complaint on december.they alleged that kadant composites llc composites manufactured and sold defective decking and railing products and failed to honor its concomitant warranty obligations.in addition,the complaint sought to pierce the corporate veil and recover against composites corporate parent,kadant,kadant.among other things,kadant allegedly had attempted to deflect liability by i using composites as its alter ego ii selling composites assets to a subsidiary of liberty diversified industries,ldi in a purportedly fraudulent transaction and iii helping to set up a deliberately underfunded pool for paying out warranty claims.finally,the complaint set forth claims against ldi.
each defendant moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state an actionable claim.b.the plaintiffs opposed the motions.they did not,however,avail themselves of their vested opportunity to amend as of right.see.a providing that a plaintiff may amend his complaint once,as a matter of right,before an answer is filed see also connectu llc zuckerberg,cir illustrating operation of the rule.nor did the plaintiffs file a motion for leave to amend their complaint.instead,in the last line of their opposition to the motions to dismiss,they stated if and to the extent that this court finds the complaint deficient in any respect,plaintiffs request leave to amend to plead additional facts to cure any deficiency.
in due course,the district court granted the rule b motions and dismissed the case.fisher kadant,unpublished order.as to composites,the court concluded that the plaintiffs had not sufficiently pleaded any of the asserted causes of action.as to kadant,the court concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to plead facts sufficient to pierce composites corporate veil.and as to ldi,the court concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to plead facts sufficient to establish successor liability.in the absence of any pending motion for leave to file an amended complaint,the court entered judgment for the defendants.the plaintiffs have not appealed from the entry of this judgment and,thus,the correctness of the order of dismissal is not before us.
on december,the plaintiffs moved to reconsider the judgment and for leave to file an amended complaint.the defendants objected.the court denied the motion without prejudice on january,explaining that the plaintiffs had failed to proffer a proposed amended complaint along with their motion.fisher kadant,unpublished order.the plaintiffs have not appealed from the denial of this motion and,thus,the correctness of this order is not before us.
on january,the plaintiffs filed a renewed motion seeking the same relief.this time,however,they annexed a proposed amended complaint to their motion.the defendants again objected.the district court analyzed this motion under the liberal pleading standard of.a and found it wanting.with respect to kadant,the court determined that the proposed amended complaint did not adequately plead facts anent alter ego liability.further,in the proposed amended complaint the plaintiffs dropped their claims against ldi but added claims against its subsidiary,ldi composites the acquirer of composites assets.the district court determined that,notwithstanding the change in parties,the proposed amended complaint did not adequately plead successor liability.as to all of these claims,the court made an explicit finding that any further attempt to amend would be futile.
the court also rejected the plaintiffs importuning that they should be allowed to assert new warranty claims against composites,noting that those claims were not supported by any new facts and,accordingly,should have been raised earlier in the litigation.because the proposed amended complaint stated no actionable claim against any defendant,the court denied the plaintiffs motion with prejudice.fisher kadant,unpublished order.
the plaintiffs took a timely appeal from this order.in the appeal,the plaintiffs argue that the court below abused its discretion by denying their renewed motion for relief.the defendants counter that the district court reached the right result even though the court applied too generous a legal standard in evaluating the motion.in this regard,the defendants reason that because the district court entered judgment before the filing of the motion,the court should not have looked to rule a for guidance,but rather to the rules governing relief from judgment.
ii.analysis 
as said,the plaintiffs have appealed only a single order the district court denial of the second motion for reconsideration.to determine the soundness of that order,we first must identify the governing legal standard.in undertaking that task,we are mindful that identifying the proper legal standard to be applied in ruling on a particular matter presents a question of law and,thus,the district court identification of the standard is subject to de novo review.vinick united states,cir inmates of suffolk county jail rufo,cir.
ordinarily,rule a governs a motion to amend a complaint.that rule directs that t he court should freely give leave to amend when justice so requires.a.if,however,a motion to amend is filed after the entry of judgment,the district court lacks authority to consider the motion under rule a unless and until the judgment is set aside.see palmer champion,cir maldonado dominguez,cir.as long as the judgment remains in effect,rule a is inapposite.
a good statement of this law is found in hern√°ndez,cir,in which we wrote unless postjudgment relief is granted,the district court lacks power to grant a motion to amend the complaint under rule a.id.at.the rationale for the principle is unassailable once judgment has entered,the case is a dead letter,and the district court is without power to allow an amendment to the complaint because there is no complaint left to amend.mirpuri act,cir.
in the instant case,the plaintiffs did not file a motion to amend their complaint until december.that was well after november,when the district court entered judgment.consequently,the district court lacked authority to entertain the motion to amend under the aegis of rule a without first setting aside the judgment under some rule geared to the accomplishment of that task,say,rule e or rule b.
this court reasoning in james watt,cir breyer,is especially instructive.there,the plaintiffs waited until after judgment had entered before moving for leave to amend their complaint.the court upheld a denial of the motion,explaining 
to require the district court to permit amendment here would allow plaintiffs to pursue a case to judgment and then,if they lose,to reopen the case by amending their complaint to take account of the court decision.such a practice would dramatically undermine the ordinary rules governing the finality of judicial decisions,and should not be sanctioned in the absence of compelling circumstances.
in an effort to deflect the force of this precedent,the plaintiffs point out that,in their memorandum opposing the defendants motions to dismiss,they made a passing request for leave to amend in the event that the court found the complaint wanting.the district court did not refer to this contingent request when granting the motions to dismiss,but it later ruled that because the plaintiffs had initially raised the possibility of amending the complaint before dismissal,their second motion should be treated as a rule a motion to amend the pleadings before judgment.
for present purposes,then,the controlling question is whether a contingent request to amend a complaint,contained in an opposition to a motion to dismiss,trumps the final judgment rule and reinstates the liberal standard of rule a for the purpose of adjudicating a motion for relief,the object of which is to put into play a new version of the complaint.we hold that it does not.
here,as is often the case,past is prologue.in gray evercore restructuring,cir,this court dealt with the efficacy of such a contingent request to amend.there,the plaintiff opposition to a motion to dismiss his complaint declared that in the event that the court finds that the amended complaint fails to state a claim,plaintiff requests leave to replead.id.at.we refused to treat this contingent request as the functional equivalent of a motion to amend rather,we held flatly that such a statement does not constitute a motion to amend a complaint.id.we therefore concluded that the district court had no obligation to perform a rule a analysis.id.
earlier case law in this circuit is to the same effect.see,aca fin.guar.advest,cir explaining that a contingent request to replead,contained in an opposition to a motion to dismiss,does not win the day for the plaintiffs because,if honored,it would lead to delays,inefficiencies,and wasted work wayne,gulf oil,cir holding that contingent request for leave to amend made in an opposition to motion to dismiss does not qualify as a motion to amend sufficient to preserve the amendment question for appeal.what judge now justice breyer wrote in james,quoted supra,is apropos here allowing plaintiffs to hedge their bets by adding a cursory contingent request in an opposition to a motion to dismiss would encourage plaintiffs to test the mettle of successive complaints and freely amend under rule a if their original strategic choices prove inadvisable.
the plaintiffs attempt to counterpunch by citing our decision in united states ex rel.rost pfizer,cir,abrogated on other grounds by allison engine united states ex rel.sanders,d.there,the plaintiff appealed directly from the district court dismissal of his complaint and argued that,if the decision were not reversed,he should at least be permitted to try anew by means of amending his complaint.id.at.in support,he noted that he had made a contingent request to amend prior to the entry of judgment.id.at.the court of appeals upheld the dismissal of the complaint and,without much elaboration,remanded for further consideration of whether to permit amendment.id.
rost is off point.that case,unlike this one,involved an appeal from the granting of a motion to dismiss.see id.at.in that procedural posture,the court of appeals may,in its discretion and in the interests of justice,affirm the dismissal of the complaint,yet nonetheless permit further amendment of it.see viqueira first bank,cir degnan publicker,cir de castro,cir.rost came to the court of appeals in this the existence of the contingent request to amend was merely one of the factors that bore on the exercise of the appellate court discretion.gray,at cautioning that t here may be exceptional circumstances in which a request to amend will become the functional equivalent of a motion to amend.
the case at hand is a horse of a different hue.here,the plaintiffs did not appeal from the order of dismissal.thus,this case presents an entirely different question dealing with the legal standard that a district court should employ in adjudicating a motion for reconsideration filed after the entry of judgment.the rost court did not deal with this question indeed,the plaintiff there had not filed any motion.to apply rost to the materially different configuration of this case would undercut the procedural protections erected by the civil rules to safeguard the finality of judgments.see.e,b.
that ends this aspect of the case.we hold that a passing request for contingent leave to file an amended complaint,made in an opposition to a motion to dismiss,is insufficient,in and of itself,to bring a motion for reconsideration within the orbit of rule a.put another way,such a request is without effect where,as here,no appeal is taken from the granting of the underlying motion to dismiss.consequently,the plaintiffs contingent request,embodied in a single sentence at the tail end of their lengthy and heated opposition to the defendants motions to dismiss,did not transmogrify their motion for reconsideration into a rule a motion.accordingly,the denial of that motion must be evaluated under the more stringent requirements that apply to motions for relief from judgment.only if the plaintiffs have satisfied those requirements will we have occasion to decide whether the district court abused its discretion in denying leave to amend under rule a.
in their motion for reconsideration,the plaintiffs mention two such rules rule e and rule b.the former rule provided at the relevant time,see supra note,that a motion to alter or amend a judgment must be filed no later than days after the entry of the judgment.e.this time limit is mandatory.see.b prohibiting any extension of time under rule e.an untimely motion under rule e is a nullity.morris unum life ins,cir.
the plaintiffs filed their first motion for reconsideration on december.viewed as a rule e motion,that motion was timely that is,the motion was filed within ten business days after the district court entry of judgment.but that motion is not before us the district court denied it without prejudice because it did not contain a proposed amended complaint,and the plaintiffs did not appeal from that order 
this brings us to the plaintiffs second renewed motion for motion that likewise sought relief from the underlying judgment of dismissal.the plaintiffs filed that motion on january.because this motion was not filed within the window that opened following the entry of judgment,the district court was without authority to consider it under rule e.see id.the fact that it was filed within ten days of the denial of the first motion for reconsideration makes no difference.see,at holding that even though movant filed second rule e motion within ten days of denial of first such motion,second motion,which sought relief from the underlying judgment,was untimely because it was filed more than ten days after the entry of that judgment.
the plaintiffs alternative basis for their second motion for reconsideration implicates rule b.here,timeliness is not an issue a motion under rule b must be filed within a reasonable time.c,and on certain grounds within one year from entry of the judgment,id.identifying.b.either way,the plaintiffs second motion for reconsideration,when viewed as a rule b motion,was timely.
having isolated the only cognizable basis for the motion,we next focus the lens of our inquiry on the standard of review.an appellate court ordinarily reviews for abuse of discretion a trial court denial of a motion brought pursuant to rule b departamento de asuntos del consumidor,cir.here,however,the district court did not review the motion under rule b at all.in such a situation,one option is to remand to the district court for consideration under the correct standard.see,rosario,cir john alden,john alden ins.agency of,cir.
in this case,we conclude that remand would be an empty gesture.the district court applied a more standard than that which obtains under rule b the rule a nonetheless denied relief.when,as in this case,the trial c
