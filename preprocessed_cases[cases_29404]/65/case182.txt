whether texas statute of repose applies 
section of the texas civil practice and remedies code establishes a statute of repose for products liability cases.that section provides that a claimant must commence a products liability action against a manufacturer or seller of a product before the end of years after the date of the sale of the product by the defendant.here,the date of the sale of the allegedly defective product was october,poole filed its lawsuit on april,more than years after the date of the sale.thus,if applies,poole claim is barred.
the current version of applies to actions filed on or after july,that version became effective on september,months after the chemical spill occurred and one month and days before the fifteenth anniversary of the sale of the skinner tanks to poole because the repose period affects claims that arose from events that occurred before the law came into effect,it is a retroactive law poole maintains that can not be applied retroactively because there is no clear legislative intent for retroactive application.
under texas law,an act will not be applied retrospectively unless it appears by fair implication from the language used that it was the intent of the legislature to make it applicable to both past and future transactions.here,the plain language of demonstrates that the texas legislature intended for the repose period to apply retroactively.the provision provides that a claim for a defective product must be brought before the end of years after the date of the sale moreover,the legislature specifically provided that the repose period applies to an action filed on or after july.had the texas legislature intended for to apply only prospectively,the legislature would have provided that the repose period applies to actions that accrued on or after july.thus,the texas legislature intended for the statute of repose to apply retroactively.
whether retroactive application violates texas general prohibition against retroactive laws 
poole maintains that retroactive application of would violate the texas constitution prohibition against retroactive laws.in general,the texas constitution prohibits retroactive laws texas courts,however,have indicated that laws affecting a remedy are not unconstitutionally retroactive under the texas constitution unless the remedy is entirely taken away the texas legislature can restrict the time for filing a claim without violating the retroactivity provision of the texas constitution so long as it affords a reasonable time or fair opportunity to preserve a claimant rights under the former law,or if the amendment does not bar all remedy.
section does not bar all remedy,but rather shortens the time for filing suit on a claim.whereas the texas legislature had not previously specified a time for filing suit for a defective product against a manufacturer,it did so when it amended.here,the tank ruptured approximately seven months before became effective and almost two months before the expiration of fifteen years following the sale of the skinner tanks.as result,poole had nine months from the january,rupture of the tank until the october,fifteenth anniversary of the sale of the tanks to file its complaint against at least one month and days following the september,effective date of the amendment to.poole thus had a reasonable amount of time in which to file its complaint,constituting a fair opportunity to preserve its rights against skinner under the former texas law if poole believed that a defective tank caused the accident,it did not need to wait until it was sued by the railroad company,or until it realized it had no insurance,to file its lawsuit against skinner.accordingly,retroactive application of does not violate the texas constitution general prohibition against retroactive laws.
whether retroactive application violates the texas open courts policy 
poole also argues that retroactive application violates the texas constitution open courts provision because it prevents poole from pursuing what it characterizes as accrued,vested causes of action.poole argues that applying to its causes of action cuts short the otherwise applicable limitations period by months and thus takes away its remedy 
the texas open courts provision states that a ll courts shall be open,and every person for an injury done him,in his lands,goods,person or reputation,shall have remedy by due course of law.this provision does not create any new right,but is a declaration of a general fundamental principle that for such wrongs as are recognized by the law of the land,the texas courts shall be open and afford a remedy.a plaintiff who claims that a law violates the texas open courts provision can prevail by showing that the restriction is unreasonable or arbitrary when balanced against the purpose and basis of the statute.in texas,a statute is presumed to be constitutional thus,poole has the burden of showing that is unconstitutional 
here,poole can not meet his burden because texas courts have determined that the repose period for defective products is reasonably related to the legitimate state purpose of protecting manufacturers and sellers from stale claims.additionally,texas courts have repeatedly held that statutes of repose do not violate the open courts provisions of the texas constitution.in order for common law causes of action like poole claims to be protected by the texas constitution,the claims must be a vested right or something more than a mere expectancy based upon an anticipated continuance of existing law.in texas,a party has no vested right to a cause of action because neither the federal constitution nor the texas constitution forbids the abolition of rights to attain a permissible legislative objective.thus,prior to september,poole had nothing more than an expectation based on an anticipated continuance of existing law,an expectation that is not protected by the texas constitution consequently,retroactive application of does not violate the open courts provision of the texas constitution.
