real parties in interest,carl van tassell et real parties,filed an action against the builders of their homes for recovery of damages allegedly resulting from defects in the construction of the homes.petitioners,mcmillin albany llc et.mcmillin,moved to stay the litigation until real parties complied with the statutory nonadversarial prelitigation procedures of the right to repair act,which applies to construction defect litigation involving certain residential construction.real parties opposed the motion,contending the statutory prelitigation procedures did not apply because they had dismissed the only cause of action in their complaint that alleged a violation of the right to repair act.the trial court denied the stay,and mcmillin petitioned this court for a writ of mandate compelling the trial court to vacate its order denying the motion and enter a new order granting the stay as requested.we grant the writ 
factual and procedural background 
real parties,the owners of homes constructed by mcmillin,filed a first amended complaint alleging eight causes of action,including strict products liability,negligence,and breach of express and implied warranty.they alleged the homes were in a defective condition at the time they purchased them,and the defects had resulted in damage to their homes and their component parts.the third cause of action of the first amended complaint alleged violation of the building standards set forth in civil code section section is part of a statutory scheme commonly referred to as the right to repair act et the act under the act,before a homeowner who claims defective residential construction can file an action against the builder in court,the homeowner must give notice of the claimed defects to the builder and engage in a nonadversarial prelitigation procedure,which affords the builder an opportunity to attempt to repair the defects.if the homeowner files suit without giving the required notice,the builder may obtain a stay of the litigation,pending completion of the prelitigation process,subd.b.
real parties did not give mcmillin notice of the alleged defects before filing suit.the parties attempted to negotiate a stay of the judicial proceedings to complete the prelitigation process,but real parties attorney withdrew from the negotiations,dismissed the third cause of action of the first amended complaint,and contended real parties were no longer required to comply with the statutory prelitigation process because they had dismissed the cause of action alleging violation of the act.mcmillin filed a motion for a stay,which real parties opposed.the trial court denied the motion,concluding real parties were entitled to plead common law causes of action in lieu of a cause of action for violation of the building standards set out in section,and they were not required to submit to the prelitigation process of the act when their complaint did not allege any cause of action for violation of the act.mcmillin filed this petition for a writ of mandate,seeking a writ directing the trial court to vacate its order denying mcmillin motion for a stay and to enter a new order granting a stay pending completion of the prelitigation process.
discussion 
writ relief 
a writ of mandate must be issued in all cases where there is not a plain,speedy,and adequate remedy,in the ordinary course of law.code civ.writ review is deemed extraordinary and appellate courts are normally reluctant to grant it.science applications internat.superior court th,city of half moon bay superior court th.where an order is not appealable,but is reviewable only upon appeal from a later judgment,writ relief may be appropriate if appeal after judgment would be an ineffective remedy.baeza superior court,supra,th at.mcmillin claims they are entitled to the benefits of the nonadversarial prelitigation procedure that permits them to attempt to repair the claimed defects in the homes before real parties may bring an action against them in court,but the trial court order denies them that opportunity.if they may not appeal that ruling until after judgment,the benefits of the statutory prelitigation procedure will be lost,even if they prevail on appeal.we conclude mcmillin does not have a plain,speedy,and adequate remedy,in the ordinary course of law.code civ.
additionally,a writ may be granted when the petition presents an issue of first impression that is of general interest to the bench and bar.valley bank of nevada superior court cal d.mcmillin writ petition presents an issue of first impression,which is of interest to builders,home buyers,their attorneys,and others.the issue may escape review unless it is addressed in a writ proceeding.accordingly,we conclude review by extraordinary writ is appropriate in this case.
ii.mootness 
real parties assert the issue presented by the writ petition is moot because they have offered to stipulate to a stay of the action pending completion of the statutory prelitigation procedure,if mcmillin will dismiss its petition.they contend that,in light of this offer,there is no actual controversy for this court to adjudicate and mcmillin will not be subject to irreparable injury.however,when a pending case involves a question of public interest that is likely to recur between the parties or others,the court may exercise an inherent discretion to resolve that issue even though an event occurring during its pendency would normally render the matter moot.shapell industries,superior court th,fn.in light of mcmillin showing that at least one court in this district reached the opposite result in a situation similar to that before the trial court here,and the presentations of amici curiae indicating the issues are of widespread interest in the building industry,we conclude this is an appropriate case in which to consider the issues presented despite real parties assertion that they are moot.
iii.the act 
in,the legislature enacted the act to specify the rights and requirements of a homeowner to bring an action for construction defects,including applicable standards for home construction,the statute of limitations,the burden of proof,the damages recoverable,a detailed prelitigation procedure,and the obligations of the homeowner.anders superior court th.chapter of the act chapter sets out building standards,a violation of which constitutes a deficiency in construction for which the builder may be held liable to the homeowner.chapter imposes obligations on the builder.chapter sets out the applicable statute of limitations,the burden of proof,the damages that may be recovered,and the affirmative defenses that may be asserted it also makes the act binding on of the original home purchaser.
chapter of the act chapter prescribes nonadversarial prelitigation procedures a homeowner must initiate prior to bringing a civil action against the builder seeking recovery for alleged construction deficiencies.these are the procedures mcmillin contends real parties were required to follow prior to filing suit against them.the procedures require the homeowner to give the builder written notice of the claim that the builder violated any of the standards of chapter they set time limits for the builder to inspect the alleged defects and make an offer to repair them or compensate the homeowner in lieu of repair.if the builder declines to attempt repairs or fails to meet any of the deadlines,the homeowner is released from the requirements of chapter and may file an action against the builder in court,subd.d,subd.a.the homeowner may also file an action against the builder if he is dissatisfied with the repairs.
iv.liberty mutual insurance brookfield crystal cove llc 
in liberty mutual ins.brookfield crystal cove llc th liberty mutual,hart purchased a new home built by brookfield.id.at.a few years later,a pipe in the sprinkler system burst,flooding the home and causing damage.brookfield acknowledged its liability and repaired the damage.ibid.hart lived in a hotel during the repairs his homeowner insurer,liberty mutual,paid for hart hotel and relocation expenses.liberty mutual then filed a subrogation action against brookfield to recover the expenses it paid the first amended complaint alleged causes of action for strict liability,negligence,breach of contract,breach of warranty,equitable estoppel,and declaratory relief.id.at.brookfield demurrer to the first amended complaint was sustained on the ground liberty mutual complaint was under the act.the appellate court reversed.
the court defined the issue before it as whether liberty mutual complaint in subrogation falls exclusively within the right to repair act,and therefore is.liberty mutual,supra,th at,fn.omitted.the court stated a key goal of the act was to abrogate the holding in aas superior court cal th,aas.in aas,the california supreme court held that construction defects in residential properties,in the absence of actual property damage,were not actionable in tort.liberty mutual,supra,th at.thus,homeowners could not recover in tort for costs of repair or the diminution in value of the homes arising from construction defects that had not caused property damage.ibid.the liberty mutual court cited the legislative history of the act,which stated e xcept where explicitly specified otherwise,liability would accrue under the standards regardless of whether the violation of the standard had resulted in actual damage or injury.as a result,the standards would essentially overrule the aas decision and,for most defects,eliminate that decision holding that construction defects must cause actual damage or injury prior to being actionable.liberty mutual,at pp.
after considering a number of the provisions of the act,the liberty mutual court concluded the act covers instances where construction defects were discovered before any actual damage had occurred,but does not provide the exclusive remedy when the defects have caused damage.liberty mutual,supra,th at.therefore,the time limitations of the act did not bar liberty mutual subrogation claims.id.at.
scope of the act 
in the trial court,real parties opposition to the motion for a stay relied on liberty mutual.real parties asserted this is a matter of law,cemented in the recent decision of liberty mutual,which mcmillin incorrectly claims is inapplicable to this case in fact,liberty mutual applies squarely and inescapably to the dispute before this court it holds unequivocally that a plaintiff can bring causes of action for damages that result from violation of the building standards.real parties argued that they were permitted to pursue common law causes of action for construction deficiencies that caused damage,and,once they dismissed their third cause of action for violation of the act,they were pursuing only common law causes of action and were therefore not required to comply with the requirements of the act,including the prelitigation procedure.
the trial court denied mcmillin motion for a stay,stating pursuant to liberty mutual,the plaintiffs are entitled to plead common law causes of action in lieu of a cause of action for violation of building standards set forth in civil code et.sb.plaintiffs need not submit to the sb prelitigation process when their complaint does not assert claims for violations of sb standards.the court also acknowledges that its ruling here involves a controlling question of law as to which there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion,appellate resolution of which may materially advance the conclusion of this litigation.see code civ.
we agree with real parties that the only issue before this court is whether mcmillin motion for a stay pending completion of the prelitigation procedures of chapter of the act was properly denied.in order to make that determination,however,we must consider the scope of the act and to what claims the requirements of the act,in particular the prelitigation procedures of chapter,apply.liberty mutual held the requirements of the act apply only when a plaintiff expressly alleges a cause of action for violation of the act it held that,if the plaintiff alleges a common law cause of action to recover for damages caused by a construction defect in residential housing,the act does not apply and the builder is not entitled to the benefits of the act.because it is relevant to the issue before us,we have considered the liberty mutual decision.we ultimately reject its reasoning and outcome,however,which we conclude are not consistent with the express language of the act.
the basic scope of the claims to which the act applies is set out in section.it provides 
in any action seeking recovery of damages arising out of,or related to deficiencies in,the residential construction,a builder shall,except as specifically set forth in this title,be liable for,and the claimant claims or causes of action shall be limited to violation of,the following standards,except as specifically set forth in this title.
section then goes on to set out various construction standards.thus,the act applies broadly to any action seeking recovery of damages arising out of,or related to deficiencies in,the residential construction,italics added.in such an action,the claimant claims or causes of action shall be limited to violation of the standards set out in section.section does not limit application of the act to actions seeking recovery for deficiencies that have not yet caused property damage.the language limiting a claimant claims or causes of action does not make an exception for common law tort causes of action where the defect has caused property damage.by its plain language,the act applies to any action for damages related to construction deficiencies,and limits a claimant claims or causes of action to claims of violation of the statutory standards.
section provides the standards set forth in this chapter are intended to address every function or component of a structure.to the extent that a function or component of a structure is not addressed by these standards,it shall be actionable if it causes damage.thus,the legislature intended to create a comprehensive set of construction standards and to make the violation of any of those standards actionable under the act.to the extent it omitted some function or component,however,a deficiency in that function or component would not be actionable in itself,but would be actionable if it caused property damage.
consistent with section,section provides except as provided in this title,no other cause of action for a claim covered by this title or for damages recoverable under section is allowed,subd.a.a claim covered by the act is a claim as defined in sections and.thus,the first portion of section precludes any cause of action for damages related to or arising out of a deficiency in residential construction,other than one brought pursuant to section for violation of any of the standards set out in chapter,or one brought pursuant to section,where the alleged deficiency involves a function or component not covered in the standards set out in section.
the second portion of section precludes a cause of action,other than one under sections and,for damages recoverable under section.section authorizes recovery of 
damages for the reasonable value of repairing any violation of the standards set forth in this title,the reasonable cost of repairing any damages caused by the repair efforts,the reasonable cost of repairing and rectifying any damages resulting from the failure of the home to meet the standards,the reasonable cost of removing and replacing any improper repair by the builder,reasonable relocation and storage expenses,lost business income if the home was used as a principal place of a business licensed to be operated from the home,reasonable investigative costs for each established violation,and all other costs or fees recoverable by contract or statute.
accordingly,the second portion of section also precludes any cause of action,other than a cause of action under sections and,for the reasonable value of repairing any violation of the standards or the reasonable cost of repairing and rectifying any damages resulting from the failure of the home to meet the standards set out in the act.in other words,no other cause of action is allowed to recover for repair of the defect itself or for repair of any damage caused by the defect.
section makes an exception for condominium conversions as to condominium conversions,this title does not apply to or does not supersede any other statutory or common law.section also contains an exception in addition to the rights under this title,this title does not apply to any action by a claimant to enforce a contract or express contractual provision,or any action for fraud,personal injury,or violation of a statute,subd.a.section clarifies if a claim combines causes of action or damages not covered by this part,including,without limitation,personal injuries,class actions,other statutory remedies,or claims,the claimed unmet standards shall be administered according to this part.
liberty mutual interpreted the scope of the act much differently,by focusing on other provisions and not fully analyzing the language of sections,and.it invoked the general principle that statutes should not be construed to alter or abrogate the common law,unless a legislative purpose to do so clearly and unequivocally appears from the language or evident purpose of the statute.liberty mutual,supra,th at fahlen sutter central valley hospitals cal th,california of health facilities department of health services cal th.it discussed various sections of the act and concluded the act did not establish an exclusive remedy for claims of residential construction defects where the defect allegedly resulted in actual property damage.liberty mutual,supra,th at.
the court in liberty mutual first considered sections within chapter.these sections,however,set out the prelitigation procedures for inspection and attempted repair of construction defects they do not define the scope of the act.liberty mutual,supra,th at pp,discussing.the court then discussed section,which provides 
in order to make a claim for violation of the standards set forth in chapter commencing with section,a homeowner need only demonstrate,in accordance with the applicable evidentiary standard,that the home does not meet the applicable standard,subject to the affirmative defenses set forth in section.no further showing of causation or damages is required to meet the burden of proof regarding a violation of a standard set forth in chapter commencing with section,provided that the violation arises out of,pertains to,or is related to,the original construction.
the court concluded the legislature did not intend to eliminate the need to prove causation and damages where construction defects resulted in actual property damage,but t he elimination of such basic elements of proof makes perfect sense when the claim is for construction defects that have not yet caused any actual damage.liberty mutual,supra,th at pp.
section,however,pertains only to proof of violation of a standard set forth in chapter.section,which is part of chapter,sets out standards residential construction is required to meet.a violation of any of those standards equates to a residential construction deficiency or defect.a homeowner may recover for the existence of the defect itself the violation of the standard or for damage it caused,or both.section merely provides that the violation of the standard may be proved by evidence that the applicable standard has not been met no further proof of causation or damages is needed to recover for the violation of the standard itself.section does not eliminate the need to prove causation and damages where the homeowner alleges,and seeks recovery for,other damage or costs allegedly caused by the violation of the standard.
liberty mutual addressed sections,subdivision a,and,which provide 
except as provided in this title,no other cause of action for a claim covered by this title or for damages recoverable under section is allowed.in addition to the rights under this title,this title does not apply to any action by a claimant to enforce a contract or express contractual provision,or any action for fraud,personal injury,or violation of a statute.damages awarded for the items set forth in section in such other cause of action shall be reduced by the amounts recovered pursuant to section for violation of the standards set forth in this title,subd.a.
if a claim combines causes of action or damages not covered by this part,including,without limitation,personal injuries,class actions,other statutory remedies,or claims,the claimed unmet standards shall be administered according to this part.
the court entire analysis of these provisions consisted of one sentence these code sections establish the act itself acknowledges that other laws may apply to,and other remedies may be available for,construction defect claims,and,therefore,that the act is not the exclusive means for seeking redress when construction defects cause actual property damage.liberty mutual,supra,th at.the court did not discuss the effect of the first sentence of section,that no other cause of action for a claim covered by this title or for damages recoverable under section is allowed,subd.a.it also did not discuss the specific list of exceptions set out immediately following that provision.neither list of exceptions,in section or in section,includes common law causes of action,such as negligence or strict liability.if the legislature had intended to make such a exception to the restrictive language of the first sentence of section,we would have expected it to do so expressly.it did so in the exception of condominium conversions from the scope of the act as to condominium conversions,this title does not apply to or does not supersede any other statutory or common law.
the court noted that the act contains its own statute of limitations,but the legislature did not repeal the preexisting statutes of limitations,code of civil procedure sections and.liberty mutual,supra,th at.it concluded those statutes remain and evidence a legislative intent and understanding that the limitations periods they contain could and would be used in litigation other than cases under the act.ibid.we do not interpret the failure to repeal code of civil procedure sections and as evidence the legislature retained them because it intended residential construction defect actions where the defects resulted in actual property damage to be actionable outside the act.those statutes of limitation continue to govern actions expressly excluded from the act,such as actions for personal injuries arising out of construction defects and actions involving nonresidential construction.
finally,the court discussed section.liberty mutual,supra,th at.instead of analyzing the language of the section itself,however,the court analyzed the builder argument,which it dubbed circular.ibid.brookfield argues the language any action means that the present case must fall within the right to repair act.brookfield argument,however,is circular brookfield argument is essentially that any action arising out of the act is an action under the act.section refers to any action that is covered by the right to repair act as explained ante,we conclude the act was never intended to,and does not,establish exclusive remedies for claims for actual damages for construction defects such as those suffered by hart.ibid.
section does not provide that any action arising out of the act is an action under the act.liberty mutual,supra,th at.as previously discussed,it provides that i n any action seeking recovery of damages arising out of,or related to deficiencies in,the residential construction,the claimant claims or causes of action shall be limited to violation of the standards set out in chapter.the language of the statute clearly and unequivocally expresses the legislative intent to limit the causes of action available to a homeowner claiming damages arising out of,or related to deficiencies in,the construction of the homeowner residence.
in verdugo target cal th,the california supreme court listed the following as examples of statutes in which the legislature clearly expressed its intent to abrogate liability under common law principles for acting or failing to act in a particular manner
