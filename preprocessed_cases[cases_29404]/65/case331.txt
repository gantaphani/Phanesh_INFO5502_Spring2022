background 
nebraska plastics is a producer of polyvinyl chloride pvc products,including pvc fencing.in,nebraska plastics decided to develop colored pvc fencing.with no experience or expertise in producing outdoor colored pvc products,nebraska plastics recognized that it needed assistance.therefore,nebraska plastics hired pigment supplier hca to help develop the colored fencing,based on hca representation that it had the technical knowledge and resources to help nebraska plastics develop a quality product.nebraska plastics gave hca its proprietary pvc formula to allow hca to develop an appropriate pigmentation technology.hca sales agent dick bushart instructed nebraska plastics on the equipment and procedures needed to add hca pigment during the fencing manufacturing process.nebraska plastics began producing colored fencing in.
in,nebraska plastics customers and dealers began to complain that the colored fencing was weathering abnormally.nebraska plastics was obligated by its product warranty,and by a desire to maintain its good name in the market,to replace fencing that weathered abnormally.nebraska plastics alerted hca immediately about the abnormal weathering,and hca assembled a technical team to address the problem.
by april,hca had determined the source of the problem.nebraska plastics pvc formula for fencing included calcium carbonate,supplied by omya,omya.calcium carbonate is a common ingredient in white pvc products.however,it was known in the industry that calcium carbonate is an unsuitable ingredient for outdoor colored pvc products.pvc reacts with sunlight to form material.the calcium carbonate in the pvc attracts moisture to the material,causing it to wash away in rain.after the material washes away,only a white surface remains,resulting in a faded or chalky appearance for the colored pvc.
hca chose not to inform nebraska plastics that calcium carbonate was causing the abnormal weathering.bushart knew that if nebraska plastics altered its pvc formula to remove calcium carbonate,it would also remove another ingredient that bushart sold,and bushart did not want to lose his sales commissions on that ingredient.instead,at the urging of bushart,hca technical team told nebraska plastics that expensive changes in nebraska plastics equipment and manufacturing process would solve the problem.hca was fully aware that,even if nebraska plastics implemented the changes,the abnormal weathering would continue as long as calcium carbonate was included in nebraska plastics pvc formula.
naturally,even after making the changes recommended by hca,nebraska plastics continued to receive warranty claims from fading and chalking of the colored fencing.nebraska plastics sought information from other consultants and learned that calcium carbonate was causing the problem.in august,nebraska plastics reduced the calcium carbonate in its formula from eight parts per hundred to three five months later,they completely eliminated calcium carbonate from the formula.nebraska plastics has yet to receive a complaint of abnormal weathering related to fencing manufactured after the reformulation.nebraska plastics sold a total of pounds of defective fencing between and.
when nebraska plastics questioned hca about the new information nebraska plastics had received regarding calcium carbonate,hca initially was evasive.in february,visiting hca technical personnel finally hinted to nebraska plastics that calcium carbonate was indeed the source of the problem.those hca personnel were rebuked by bushart.
nebraska plastics brought suit against hca and omya,the calcium carbonate supplier,in october for breach of express and implied warranties,negligent design,manufacture and supply,negligent misrepresentation and fraudulent concealment.hca brought a counterclaim against nebraska plastics to recover payment for deliveries of pigment between march and june of.the district court granted summary judgment to omya on the implied warranty of merchantability and negligent design,manufacture and supply claims.the remaining claims proceeded to jury trial.
in the early stages of trial,omya settled the remaining claims against it.the jury returned a verdict for nebraska plastics on all of its claims against hca,except for breach of express warranty,and awarded damages totaling.of that amount,was awarded for colored fence warranty claims expected to be incurred in the future.the jury also returned a verdict for hca on its counterclaim.
following the jury verdict,the district court granted hca motion for judgment as a matter of law jaml on the issue of future damages.in addition,the district court granted hca motion for a pro tanto settlement credit,reducing the damages against hca by the amount nebraska plastics received in the omya settlement.as a result,the judgment against hca was reduced to.finally,the district court entered judgment on hca counterclaim against nebraska plastics for.

ii.discussion 
excluded expert testimony 
nebraska plastics expert william cheese offered future damages testimony in which he attempted to estimate the cost to nebraska plastics of customer warranty claims expected to be received in the future for defective colored fencing.after a hearing,the district court excluded cheese opinions because they did not fit the facts of the case.decisions concerning the admission of expert testimony lie within the broad discretion of the trial court,and these decisions will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.anderson raymond,cir quoting peitzmeier hennessy,cir.we evaluate the district court understanding of the evidence at the time the district court made the ruling.see old chief united states,d it is important that a reviewing court evaluate the trial court decision from its perspective when it had to rule and not indulge in review by hindsight.
cheese calculated future damages by assuming that every pound of colored fence produced between and would be subject to a warranty claim the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that cheese assumption was invalid in view of the facts of the case.specifically,the district court noted that,while nebraska plastics evidence did show that all colored fencing with calcium carbonate would eventually fade,it did not demonstrate that every pound of fencing would fade to the point of being subject to a valid warranty claim.in fact,at the time of the district court order excluding cheese testimony in november,warranty claims had been filed on only of the total colored fencing produced with calcium carbonate.other evidence suggested that the rate of chalking would vary with regional climate differences and that the chalking would be more noticeable with some fence colors than with others.cheese estimate of future damages addressed none of these relevant facts 
we agree with nebraska plastics that a s a general rule,the factual basis of an expert opinion goes to the credibility of the testimony,not the admissibility,and it is up to the opposing party to examine the factual basis for the opinion in.hartley dillard,cir quoting bonner isp,cir.however,it also is true that if the expert opinion is so fundamentally unsupported that it can offer no assistance to the jury,it must be excluded.id.an expert opinion that fails to consider the relevant facts of the case is fundamentally unsupported 
if a party believes that an expert opinion has not considered all of the relevant facts,an objection to its admission is appropriate.even a theory that might meet certain daubert factors,such as peer review and publication,testing,known or potential error rate,and general acceptance,should not be admitted if it does not apply to the specific facts of the case.
concord boat brunswick,cir citations and footnote omitted.
cheese calculation of future damages failed to take into account a plethora of specific facts tending to show limits on the amount of defective fencing that would be the subject of future warranty claims.therefore,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding cheese testimony.
jaml on future damages 
at the close of evidence in the jury trial,hca moved for jaml on the issue of future damages.the district court reserved ruling on the motion until after the verdict.the jury returned a verdict against hca which included in future damages.after additional briefing by the parties,the district court granted hca motion for jaml,concluding that there was not sufficient evidence from which the jury could have calculated nebraska plastics future damages with reasonable certainty.
we review the grant of jaml de novo,applying the same standards used by the district court.arabian agric.servs.chief,cir.j udgment as a matter of law should not be granted unless a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.id.quoting.a.in applying this standard,we must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party without making credibility assessments or weighing the evidence.id.quoting phillips collings,cir.a reasonable inference is one which may be drawn from the evidence without resort to speculation.thus,judgment as a matter of law is appropriate when the record contains no proof beyond speculation to support a verdict.id.citations omitted.
the parties agreed in their briefs to the district court that the issue of future damages is governed by nebraska law as set forth in pribil koinzan.the relevant language from pribil is as follows 
t he initial question of law for the trial court is whether the evidence of damages provides a basis for determining damages with reasonable certainty,the evidence of damages is not speculative or conjectural.if the evidence does provide such a basis,the issue of damages can be submitted to the jury.
pribil,at.in other words,under nebraska law,a plaintiff evidence of damages may not be speculative or conjectural and must provide a reasonably certain basis for calculating damages.id.at.we agree with the district court conclusion that several missing pieces of evidence prevented a reasonably certain computation of the expected amount of future warranty claims.
first,there was insufficient evidence to allow the jury to determine the temporal limits of the warranty coverage of the defective fencing.for example,the jury had no means to determine what proportion of the defective fencing was covered by a warranty as opposed to a warranty.nebraska plastics represented that only the fencing produced in was subject to the shorter warranty,representing of the total defective fencing sold.however,nebraska plastics also introduced a letter from a customer who purchased fencing in which refers to the customer warranty.
second,the warranty also limited coverage to the original purchaser,but nebraska plastics presented insufficient evidence to assist the jury in determining how long the original purchaser would be expected to own the fencing.the of the warranty would presumably limit the effective period for warranty coverage in many cases,but the jury was not provided with any evidence that would enable a reasonable estimate of the effective coverage period.
third,the rate of chalking of the fencing was unquantified.nebraska plastics evidence indicated the rate of chalking would vary with regional climate,but no evidence was presented to help the jury quantify those regional variations.even if adequate evidence regarding the duration of warranty coverage had been introduced,the jury had no basis for a reasonable estimate of what proportion of the defective fencing would fade to the point of creating a valid warranty claim before termination of the warranty.
fourth,even if the jury had been able to estimate the number of potential warranty claims,the jury was given no guidance to estimate the proportion of customers with timely potential warranty claims who would actually choose to pursue those claims.nebraska plastics evidence showed that some customers with abnormally weathered fences had chosen not to make warranty claims against nebraska plastics.nebraska plastics presented no statistical analysis regarding what proportion of customers would be expected to pursue a timely claim if they had one.
nebraska plastics argues that exhibit,when combined with the jurors personal knowledge and common sense,contains all the purportedly missing information.exhibit is a list of existing warranty claims and four potential warranty claims.for each claim,exhibit lists the fencing manufacture date,warranty claim date,fence color and fence location.nebraska plastics believes that in choosing a dollar figure for future damages,the jury must have extrapolated those raw data points into reasonably certain statistical data to determine what proportion of the defective fencing would eventually become the subject of a warranty claim.however,nebraska plastics failed to establish that those fences constituted a statistically meaningful sample of the almost ten million pounds of defective fencing sold.
furthermore,nebraska plastics evidence provided the jury no guidance on extrapolating the data on existing claims in exhibit to the overall amount of fencing sold without such guidance,the jury had no reasonably certain factual basis for computation of the probable loss.in racicky farmland,cir,this court,applying nebraska law,reversed a jury award of future damages because t he financial data presented,though voluminous,was not accompanied by testimony explaining its significance.the court stated,we are at a loss to know how the jury here calculated the damages award.id.at.
here,as in racicky,we are at a loss to know how the jury calculated the damages award.the jury choice of as the value of the future warranty claims had to result from sheer guesswork about the effective warranty coverage period,the speed of the weathering process,and the likelihood that a given customer with a timely potential warranty claim would actually pursue the claim against nebraska plastics.
we conclude that,because the jury had no reasonably certain factual basis for computation of the value of future warranty claims,the district court did not err in granting jaml to hca on the issue of future damages.
settlement credit 
the district court granted hca motion to reduce the damages awarded against it by the amount nebraska plastics received in the settlement with omya.nebraska plastics argues that hca was not entitled to this pro tanto settlement credit under nebraska law.we review the district court interpretation of state law de novo.kolb paul revere life ins,cir.
the nebraska supreme court explained nebraska law on settlement credits in vowers sons strasheim,
in a breach of contract case,the ultimate objective of a damages award is to put the injured party in the same position he would have occupied if the contract had been performed,that is,to make the injured party whole.as a general rule,a party may not have double recovery for a single injury,or be made more than whole by compensation which exceeds the actual damages sustained.where several claims are asserted against several parties
