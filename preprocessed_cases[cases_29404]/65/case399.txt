cody geurin sued winston industries,for damages in a products liability action.the district court granted partial summary judgment for geurin on defendant affirmative defense of liability.after a jury trial,geurin was awarded damages.winston industries,appeals the partial summary judgment,and the denial of its motions for a mistrial and a new trial.
in,winston industries,winston designed,manufactured,and sold a pressure cooker that had a pressure lid lock system.on june,some thirteen years later,cody geurin,an employee of a kentucky fried chicken franchise in spokane,washington,was cooking chicken in the pressure cooker when the lid popped open,allowing hot oil to spray him.geurin was severely burned.at the time of the accident,the fryer had been altered and a cam lid lock had been installed in place of the originally installed pressure lid lock.
in may of,geurin filed this action under washington product liability actions statute.code,against winston,alleging that it manufactured and sold a defectively designed fryer and that this defect proximately caused his injuries.
winston answered that it denied these allegations.in addition,it raised eleven affirmative defenses.affirmative defense asserted that third parties were liable for geurin damages.affirmative defense asserted that geurin damages were solely caused by superseding intervening causes.affirmative defense asserted that fryers manufactured and sold by defendants to plaintiff employer did not proximately cause plaintiff alleged injuries.affirmative defense asserted that the safe life of the fryer had expired at the time of the accident.
in april of,geurin moved for partial summary judgment as to affirmative defenses and.he argued that the safe life of the fryer had not expired as a matter of law.he also argued that winston defense that the negligence of third parties caused his injuries should be dismissed because some of these third parties were immune from liability as employers or and the rest had no duty with respect to the fryers that they breached.winston opposed the motion,arguing that disputed issues of fact remained as to these issues 
in may,the district court denied geurin motion as to affirmative defense,holding that the issue of the fryer safe life was a factual one for the jury.the court,however,granted geurin partial summary judgment as to winston affirmative defense of liability,holding that the third parties were either immune,or that,even if they were not immune,winston had failed to establish that any of these third parties had a duty to geurin that they breached.
in july,geurin filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude from trial all evidence pertaining to winston allegations of third party negligence.specifically,geurin sought to exclude the testimony of jeffrey thamert,who prepared a report for winston stating that the problems with the fryer should have been noticed during routine maintenance and that the fryer should have been repaired or replaced before the accident.winston opposed the motion on the ground that thamert testimony and report were relevant to winston remaining affirmative defenses,including that supervening events caused the accident 
the district court granted geurin motion in limine,holding that since third party liability had been dismissed as an affirmative defense,winston could present evidence of the condition of the fryer only when it was manufactured and sold in,and at the time of the accident in.no evidence on intervening events would be allowed.
also in july,winston filed its own motion in limine,seeking to exclude at trial the deposition testimony of its own investigators relating to other accidents involving the same type of fryer.winston argued that these other accidents did not involve facts and circumstances similar to geurin accident.the district court agreed and granted the motion.prior to trial,however,geurin designated this deposition testimony for introduction at trial.winston objected,but the court never ruled.
during the trial,the district court precluded winston from referring to the failure of third parties to properly maintain the fryer after it left winston possession and control.the district court sustained all objections to winston efforts to introduce evidence of the alleged failure to maintain the fryer for the period following its sale.the court explained,i do think that maintenance in the defense case has anything to do with proximate cause.winston was permitted to present evidence concerning the condition of the fryer only at the time it was sold in,and at the time of the accident in.
additionally,over winston objections,geurin was permitted to introduce those portions of winston investigators depositions in which they testified regarding their investigations of other accidents involving fryers winston moved for mistrial,which the district court denied.
after trial,the jury returned a verdict for geurin of,reduced by their finding that he was negligent.winston filed a motion for new trial alleging evidentiary error,which the district court denied.final judgment was entered in october of.

a.the partial summary judgment 
in,washington enacted a tort reform statute that abolished joint and several liability,and replaced it with proportionate liability.code.see also stewart estes,the short happy life of litigation between tortfeasors contribution,indemnification and subrogation after washington tort reform acts,seattle.under this statute,any party to a proceeding can assert that another person is at fault.mailloux state farm mut.auto.ins,citing adcox children orthopedic hosp.and med,if a party does so,the trier of fact shall determine the percentage of the total fault which is attributable to every entity which caused the claimant damages except entities immune from liability to the claimant under title rcw.code if a party other than the plaintiff proves fault that is a proximate cause of the plaintiff damages,his or her fault operates to reduce the proportionate share of damages that the plaintiff can recover from those against whom the plaintiff has claimed.mailloux,at.
winston asserted as one of its affirmative defenses that several entities,not sued by geurin,were at fault for geurin injuries winston asked the district court to apportion fault and reduce its damages by those entities share of geurin total damages.see id.
the district court,however,dismissed this defense.first,it held that two of the entities named by winston were immune under washington workman compensation statute title and,therefore,specifically exempted by.code from a finding of proportionate fault.
these two entities were spokane,and david moyer.the district court found that geurin had met his burden of establishing that spokane,is geurin employer.in the face of winston contrary evidence,only such a finding of fact would enable the court to reach this result.on summary judgment,however,such a finding is inappropriate.as to moyer,the court held that,although there were issues of material fact as to whether he was an independent,therefore,not immune under title was,nonetheless,entitled to title immunity as a.this finding is tainted by the prior finding that spokane,is geurin employer.we therefore hold that on the current record,the questions whether spokane,was the employer and moyer a should have gone to the jury,and the jury should have been instructed that if they were employer and no part of the liability could be allocated to them.
as to the other entities,the district court held that winston failed to identify any duty they owed geurin,or to do more than speculate as to how they breached this duty we find this con
