introduction 
this diversity case arises from the sale of a speed boat by defendant lake cumberland marine cumberland to plaintiff tina dillon.dillon claims the boat was defective.defendant cobra power cobra manufactured the engines and transmissions,and cumberland installed them in the boat in may.the subsequent repair history of the boat is long and tortuous not unlike the history of this lawsuit.after several unsuccessful attempts to repair the boat engines and outdrives,dillon,in january,sued cumberland for breach of contract and warranty,as well as a violation of the kentucky consumer protection act kcpa she also sued cobra for breach of warranty.
the district court granted partial summary judgment in october,dismissing the warranty claim against cobra and thereby dismissing it as a party,and also dismissing the warranty claims against cumberland.in july,the court held a bench trial on dillon remaining breach of contract claim against cumberland.the court dismissed this remaining claim against cumberland,but sua sponte reinstated the breach of warranty claim against cobra,found it liable,and entered judgment on that claim in favor of dillon.the court did so after hearing the testimony of randy garciga,president of cobra,called by cumberland to testify at the bench trial.because cobra had been previously dismissed from the lawsuit,counsel for cobra was not present at the trial.the court found garciga testimony contradicted his earlier affidavit,which was the basis for the earlier dismissal of cobra.
the court also granted dillon request to amend the complaint to add conversion and kcpa claims against cobra,although two years earlier the court had denied a similar request by dillon to add a claim of conversion against cobra.in june,the court entertained briefing from cobra opposing dillon proposed amendments and contesting the court finding of liability.ultimately,and without further hearing,the court granted summary judgment in favor of dillon and entered a verdict of in compensatory damages against cobra in december,nearly two and a half years after the bench trial with cumberland.
cobra and dillon each appeal from the adverse decisions against them,including pretrial and orders on amendment of pleadings.cumberland defends the district court decision to dismiss all claims against it.
for the reasons discussed below,we affirm in part and reverse in part,and,given the already lengthy history of this lawsuit,reluctantly,but properly,remand the matter for further proceedings.
factual background 
dillon contracted with cumberland in november to purchase a fountain power boat with two hp engines,each with an outdrive.after some delay,cumberland installed these engines and delivered the boat to dillon in may.a purchase agreement between dillon and cumberland contained an express warranty disclaimer 
dillon claims that she was given only hp engines,rather than the promised hp,and that she experienced problems with the outdrives.cobra subsequently repaired both outdrives,the first free of charge,and then shipped each repaired outdrive to cumberland for on the boat.cumberland returned the boat to dillon in july.neither dillon nor cumberland paid cobra for the second repair bill and freight charges.
in august,dillon noticed smoke from the engine compartment and shipped one of the engines back to cobra for inspection and repair.cobra built a new engine and shipped it to cumberland for installation.cobra sent cumberland an invoice for half the cost of the new engine,but it too was never paid.nonetheless,the new engine was installed by cumberland,and the boat was delivered back to dillon.the next month,during a race,the same engine suffered an oil line break and also lost an outdrive.dillon disassembled and attempted,unsuccessfully,to repair the outdrive the engine was repaired by a cumberland mechanic at the dock.dillon sent the repaired engine back to cobra for inspection,but cobra found nothing wrong and retained possession of the engine while the parties attempted to negotiate responsibility for unpaid charges.
dillon attempted to revoke acceptance of the boat by way of two letters,dated october,and november,respectively.cumberland refused to accept either a return of the boat it was then missing the engine still being held by cobra and an outdrive remained unrepaired or a refund of the purchase price.this lawsuit followed in january.
procedural background 
upon completion of discovery,all parties filed motions for summary judgment.in october,the district court dismissed dillon breach of express warranty claim against cobra.this was the only claim against cobra,and therefore it was dismissed as a party to the lawsuit.the litigation continued between dillon and cumberland.a bench trial took place in july.following the bench trial,the court invited dillon to address in her briefing whether the court had authority to reinstate the lawsuit against cobra at that time,the court did not invite briefing from cobra.it was not until cobra counsel received a court order in august that cobra learned the court was not only vacating its earlier dismissal of cobra,but,even further,was holding cobra liable for a breach of warranty that entitled dillon to recover damages from cobra.
following the court august order,dillon and cobra filed numerous memoranda and motions,and the district court issued several orders.the district court orders,both before and after the bench trial,which have been appealed,are as follows 
january,ja the court denied dillon motion to amend her complaint to assert conversion against cobra.
october,ja the court granted partial summary judgment,dismissing cobra as a party.
august,ja the court set forth findings of fact and conclusions of law from the july bench trial,ruling in favor of dillon,in part,and in favor of cumberland,in part.
june,ja the court ordered cobra to file a pleading to contest its liability and granted dillon motion for leave to assert conversion and kcpa claims.
december,ja the court terminated the case,finding cobra liable for breach of warranty and conversion,but denying dillon attempted amendment of a kcpa claim,and awarding dillon difference in value between the two engines purchased from cobra and the value of the single engine still in dillon possession.
each of these rulings is reviewed below.
discussion 
the district court erred in reversing its prior grant of summary judgment in favor of cobra and later entering judgment in favor of dillon.
this court reviews the grant or denial of summary judgment de novo.water dist.city of athens,cir.
after its order granting summary judgment to cobra and dismissing cobra as a party ja,the court conducted a bench trial on dillon remaining claims against cumberland.at this trial,randy garciga,president of cobra,testified that cobra intended to warrant the engines for six months,apparently contradicting cobra argument in its summary judgment motion that it had extended no warranty to dillon.in its findings of fact and conclusions of law following the bench trial,the court ruled that cobra had warranted the engines and breached the warranty.the court reaffirmed this ruling twice,in its june and december orders,respectively.
cobra argues that reversing summary judgment and simultaneously imposing liability against a party previously dismissed from the litigation violates due process.in particular,cobra notes it was dismissed as a party in october and was no longer on the docket for service of pleadings or for any court orders.moreover,cobra did not participate in the july bench trial.
it was not until two years later,in june,that the court invited cobra to show cause why,in light of garciga sworn testimony at the bench trial,the court should not alter its summary judgment order of three years earlier to find cobra breached the warranty to dillon ja.this invitation was limited to briefing,with a review of the bench trial transcript,but no opportunity for discovery.
dillon cites no legal authority supporting reinstatement of previously dismissed and absent parties based upon testimony offered at a later trial.instead,dillon cites the interlocutory nature of partial summary judgment orders and argues cobra had a duty either to attend trial dillon does not explain what cobra could have done beyond acting as a to seek entry of final judgment pursuant to federal civil rule b.we conclude that the district court erred when it reversed its grant of summary judgment based on evidence elicited at the later trial.
federal civil rule makes clear that summary judgment is a pretrial procedure.the district court correctly noted that trial testimony may be submitted for consideration at the summary judgment stage,but such testimony comes from prior proceedings that are submitted as part of the pretrial record.in other words,sworn testimony given in earlier court proceedings is the same as the pleadings,the discovery including depositions and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits which rule c expressly allows the court to consider.here,garciga testimony was produced at trial in the very case for which summary judgment was decided,long after the pretrial process had come to an end.this is not the type of evidence on which a court may base summary judgment.
furthermore,the pretrial nature of summary judgment is not changed by rule a and its use of any time to describe when a summary judgment motion may be filed.the advisory committee notes on the amendments make clear that this language was used to allow the filing of motions earlier than previously allowed,and that the language does not permit the filing of a summary judgment motion so late that it can not be decided until after the case has gone to trial.united states gilbert,wl at.lexis,at cir.accordingly,it was not appropriate for the district court to consider evidence produced at trial in the pretrial summary judgment motion that it granted in favor of cobra.
moreover,the order that ultimately granted dillon summary judgment was issued in december.up to that point,dillon only motion for summary judgment claimed that dillon had properly revoked acceptance of the boat and was entitled to summary judgment against cumberland,a motion which the district court dismissed.nevertheless,the court revised its order,to now grant summary judgment in favor of dillon,by construing dillon submission,filed in september,as a motion for summary judgment.thus,the order of reversing the earlier summary judgment pretrial decided by a motion filed after trial and based solely on garciga trial testimony.this can not be right.
in addition to the plain reading of how amendments are made pursuant to federal civil rule see later discussion,the case law supports our conclusion on the unusual procedural path of this case.this court in parkview mem l,cir,held that a district court had no authority to realign parties after trial.in that case,the district court had previously dismissed a direct claim by plaintiff against parkview,a defendant.however,after a bench trial and on plaintiff motion,parkview was reinstated and held jointly and severally liable to plaintiff with other defendants.this court reversed the judgment,reasoning that sometimes rule may be availed of to permit an amendment after judgment and a realigning of parties.however,this may only be done if all parties have notice of the issues being tried and no prejudice will result.id.at.the court emphasized the prejudice parkview suffered in approaching the trial believing it would be only a defendant,but later being reinstated and held directly liable.highlights the principles that guide our analysis notice,opportunity and prejudice.
other federal circuits have considered the authority of a district court,after trial,to reverse its previous finding of summary judgment that dismissed a party.see corporacion de puerto rico para la difusion publica,cir finding prejudice to defendant when district court reversed,at trial,prior finding of partial summary judgment,thereby broadening scope of trial the judge must inform the parties and give them an opportunity to present evidence relating to the newly revived issue or grant a continuance of the trial to avoid prejudice leddy standard drywall,cir finding that failure to inform parties and provide an opportunity to present evidence relating to a newly revived issue might cause substantial prejudice where district court ruled certain erisa claims were barred by res judicata,then reversed this ruling at the beginning of a bench trial united states arkansas,cir remanding to the district court for further proceedings because due process demanded both notice and an opportunity to be heard on the issue of liability.
this court has applied leddy to a similar situation,holding a party that was present at trial was not prejudiced when the district court reversed its pretrial ruling on the extent of liability.huss king,cir,cited leddy extensively and ultimately concluded 
here,the district judge informed huss of the change of his initial ruling and gave him an opportunity in briefing to argue that he was entitled to continued payment of maintenance and cure after january.although the court change of its ruling did not occur until after trial,it was based on the damage evidence relevant to maintenance and cure presented at trial.counsel on brief made no attempt to show that the change of the ruling prejudiced his trial presentation.
if notice and opportunity are deficient,the court then must determine whether the party was substantially prejudiced.the instant case stands in stark contrast to leddy and huss,where the adversely affected parties were present at trial and admitted on appeal that they suffered no identifiable prejudices as a result of the late reversal.cobra situation is more analogous to that of the defendant in united states arkansas,where the state was not a party at trial but was subjected to judgment and liability several years later.once dismissed from the case,cobra had no reason or right to participate in the later trial.no claim was pending against it at that time.
the prejudice to cobra in the instant case is obvious.certainly with a bench trial,the better procedure would have been to adjourn the trial,join cobra again as a party defendant,and allow it an opportunity to respond to the new testimony.participation at trial as a party may well have prevented any prejudice by such a late reversal of summary judgment.
the district court erred in allowing dillon to amend her complaint post trial to allege conversion against cobra.
the district court decision to allow the amendment of pleadings pursuant to rule is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.duggins steak shake,cir.
dillon twice attempted to amend her complaint to add a claim of conversion against cobra garciga.the first occasion was in november,prior to trial.the court denied this attempt.dillon second attempt came in her submission and was interpreted by the district court as a motion under rule a as opposed to rule b,which is how dillon framed was granted by the court.the district court determined that the issue on dillon conversion claim is whether,in failing to honor dillon warranty,cobra converted an engine belonging to dillon for cobra own benefit.the facts supporting the breach of warranty claim are the same as those supporting the conversion claim.the court further found no additional discovery was needed on either claim,and determined that cobra was not prejudiced by allowing dillon to amend her five years after the original filing.
cobra argues that it was prejudiced by the added conversion claim,deadline and because it was forced to defend itself against a claim on which cobra was never afforded the opportunity to take discovery,and where the only testimony elicited at trial was by opposing counsel.because cobra was no longer a party,it was not present to call witnesses,or otherwise introduce evidence.
