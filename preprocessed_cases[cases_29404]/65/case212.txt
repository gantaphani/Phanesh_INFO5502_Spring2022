plaintiff joshua nye was injured as a passenger of a car that collided with a train.nye and his mother,judy ramirez collectively referred to as nye,sued railroad operator csx transportation,csxt,for negligently causing personal injury.specifically,nye brought various claims for negligence,spoliation of evidence,loss of consortium,and punitive damages.
nye presents three overarching questions for this court to decide whether his adequacy of warning device claim is preempted by federal law,whether summary judgment was proper on his negligence claims relating to adequacy of visibility of the train cars and railroad crossing,and whether summary judgment was proper on his spoliation claim.we hold that nye first claim is preempted by federal law.norfolk so.ry.shanklin,d.his remaining claims fail to present genuine issues of material fact,and no reasonable jury could find for nye.therefore,the district court grant of summary judgment is affirmed.
on july,larry bishop attended a gathering with friends in a field in wood county,ohio.between and he decided to move his classic mustang automobile because people were leaning on it.nye accompanied bishop because he wanted to take a ride in bishop car.originally,bishop only intended to circle around the field and park the car by hough road away from everyone at the party.bishop agreed to take nye for a ride,and pulled out of the field to the left on hough road.as he approached a stop sign at the intersection of state route and hough road,just south of the hough road railroad crossing,bishop was unable to stop his car.he applied the brakes to no avail and continued past the stop sign through an intersection.at some point he noticed passing train cars and attempted to swerve to the left,but he was unable to avoid collision with the side of the csxt train.bishop impacted the train at the seventh and eighth railroad cars.although it is not clear whether nye jumped out of the car to avoid the accident or was thrown by force out of the car,he was dragged by the train,and sustained severe injuries that required amputation of both of his legs.
one of bishop friends,cole buchanan,was attending the party in the nearby field.he ran to the scene of the accident and helped remove bishop from the car as the train continued moving.buchanan stated that the car would move as each railway car went by,and that the train was traveling east toward north baltimore,ohio.the conductor of the train,babbitt,and the engineer,heinert,did not realize that the train had been struck 
procedural history 
under a grant of diversity jurisdiction,nye sued csxt.he alleged that csxt proximately caused the collision by inadequate warnings at the hough road crossing insufficient lights or reflector strips on train cars failure to perform a diagnostic review or safety study of the crossing defective design and insufficient visibility of the crossbuck sign at the crossing inadequate pavement markings failure to sound an adequate and audible warning as the train approached failure to avoid the hazards presented by the crossing and to operate the train within applicable speed restrictions defective design,maintenance,and construction of the hough road crossing and negligent operation of the train as it approached and passed through the hough road crossing.in response,csxt argued that federal law preempts in whole or in part,by federal state law,including but not limited to,the federal rail safety act,et,and federal rail safety act.
the district court provided two written decisions.first,it found that federal law preempted nye state tort claim based on alleged inadequacy of the warning devices at the hough road crossing.it later granted summary judgment for csxt,finding that no reasonable jury could conclude that csxt conduct contributed to,let alone caused,this accident and csxt is entitled to summary judgement on negligence.it found proximate causes of the collision were brake failure and driver error.in addition,it granted summary judgment on nye spoliation claims.the court concluded that because the negligence and spoliation claims fail,summary judgment is also appropriate for nye loss of consortium and punitive damages claim.
ohio crossbuck program 
in,the ohio department of transportation odot submitted a proposal to the department of transportation,federal highway administration fhwa to study the effectiveness of a new,experimental buckeye crossbuck in reducing accidents at public,passive grade crossings in ohio.based on this proposal,odot developed the ohio buckeye crossbuck program the program,a federally funded program intended to evaluate new crossbuck designs and to improve grade crossings.funded by the federal government,the program involved the installation of either an upgraded standard crossbuck or an experimental buckeye crossbuck.
under the program,buckeye crossbucks were placed at passive crossings bearing even numbered dot identification numbers while upgraded standard crossbucks were installed at passive crossings with odd numbered dot identification numbers.standard crossbucks are signs that read railroad crossing.the upgraded standard crossbucks were reflectorized.the buckeye crossbuck is a standard crossbuck with red lettering,reflective tape on the blades,reflective sheeting on all four sides of the post,and a new sign mounted on the crossbuck post which read yield in red lettering and a white background.
later in,csxt and the state of ohio entered into an agreement to cooperate in a demonstration project to evaluate the relative safety improvements generated by the new buckeye crossbuck versus an upgraded standard crossbuck.under the agreement,csxt was to provide all labor,equipment,tools and materials to install the crossbucks at all passively guarded csxt grade crossings in the state of ohio but would be fully reimbursed by the state.the state of ohio received the funding by which it reimbursed csxt pursuant to the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of istea.following the installation of the crossbucks under the agreement,csxt became the owner of the crossbucks and was required to maintain them in good condition,as required by statute at company cost and expense.
as a part of the federally funded program,csxt installed two upgraded standard crossbucks at the hough road crossing in.while these crossbucks were installed pursuant to approval granted by the fhwa,the fhwa itself made no determination that a standard crossbuck at the hough road crossing would be adequate.in fact,the first determination of the adequacy of warning devices at the hough road crossing was not made until when the state of ohio,through a diagnostic team comprised of individuals from the ohio rail development commission,csxt,the public utilities commission,and local highway authorities,recommended that the crossing either be closed or flashing lights and roadway gates be installed.ultimately the fhwa paid for the installation of standard crossbucks and buckeye crossbucks at csxt crossings in the state of ohio pursuant to the buckeye crossbuck program,representing of the total installation cost.
preemption 
this court reviews questions of federal preemption de novo.shanklin norfolk so.ry,cir.the supremacy clause of the constitution authorizes federal law to preempt conflicting state law.const.art.vi,cl.however,intent to preempt state law must be the clear and manifest purpose of congress.see csx,easterwood,d.congress can express its intent to preempt state law through explicit statutory language or implicitly through the statute structure and purpose.see cipollone liggett group,d.
in,congress enacted the frsa and conferred upon the united states secretary of transportation the authority to preempt state law relating to railroad crossing safety.see shanklin,at.the express preemption provision of the frsa provides for uniformity of law between the states to enact railroad safety laws until the secretary of transportation through the fhwa addresses the issue.
enacted in,the highway safety act created the federal crossings program to provide funding for the cost of construction projects for the elimination of hazards of crossings.a.through the promulgation of regulations,the secretary of transportation addresses the adequacy of warning devices for railway crossings in b and 
in shanklin,the united states supreme court resolved whether b and preempted state tort law claims for failure to maintain adequate warning devices at railroad crossings.at.generally,the court stated that the scope of the regulations applies to any project where federal aid funds participate in the installation of the devices.id.at.citing b i.the court held 
sections b and therefore establish a standard of adequacy that determine s the devices to be installed when federal funds participate in the crossing improvement project.easterwood,at.if a crossing presents those conditions listed in b,the state must install automatic gates and flashing lights if the b factors are absent,b dictates that the decision as to what devices to install is subject to fhwa approval.see id.at.in either case,b or is applicable and determines the type of warning device that is adequate under federal law.as a result,once the fhwa has funded the crossing improvement and the warning devices are actually installed and operating,the regulation displace s state and private decision making authority by establishing a requirement that certain protective devices be installed or federal approval obtained.id.at.
shanklin,at.discussing easterwood,d some citations omitted.
in a somewhat similar set of facts to this case,the ninth circuit addressed preemption after shanklin in lee burlington northern santa fe railway,cir.in lee,a pickup truck collided with the second and third car of a train at a grade crossing.the plaintiff filed a state tort law claim against the railroad for negligent failure to install active warning lights to make the crossing safe under montana law.id.at.the crossing was guarded by reflectorized crossbucks,which were installed with federal funding approved by the fhwa.the district court denied summary judgment reasoning that since the secretary of transportation did not expressly approve the crossbuck,the plaintiff state claim was not preempted.the ninth circuit opined that shanklin makes clear that once the fhwa has funded a crossing improvement and warning devices are actually installed and operating,federal regulations displace state and private decision making authority.id.at citing shanklin,at.
in strozyk norfolk southern,a plaintiff claimed that a railroad was negligent,among other things,for inadequate warning devices at grade crossings.cir.the third circuit noted that the district court dismissal of plaintiff claim that crossbucks were inadequate was not challenged by the plaintiff and was properly dismissed.however,the court considered the dismissal of all claims arising out of the grade crossing accident an overly broad application of b and allowed the general maintenance of a safe grade crossing claim and limited sight distance claims to continue.again shanklin was discussed as settling a division among the circuit courts of appeals by clarifying that an individualized determination ensuring the adequacy of the warning devices at a particular crossing is not a necessary precondition to preemption.id.at citing shanklin,at.
nye raises the following arguments against preemption of his adequacy of warning negligence claim preemption does not apply because the warning devices were experimental the secretary of transportation did not make an adequacy determination for particular improvements at railroad crossings to protect the monitoring public the program is not an improvement project qualifying for preemption the fhwa did not approve the program and summary judgment is not proper because a genuine issue of preemption exists.
nye arguments are clearly at odds with shanklin.it is indisputable that the program was federally funded by the fhwa and istea.most significant is the fact that nye concedes the use of federal funds and,as shanklin makes clear,federal funding plus installation of a crossbuck is all that is necessary for preemption under the frsa.at.it is not a requirement of preemption that the secretary of transportation through the fhwa make an adequacy determination as to particular warning devices.strozyk,at.in essence,the fhwa approval,albeit tacit approval,is its federal funding of the ohio crossbuck program with funding through the istea.nye contentions that preemption does not apply because the sign was experimental or that it was not an improvement project have no impact on the fact that the crossbucks were placed on the hough road crossing with federal funds by csxt railroad in,and that is all that is required for preemption.finally,nye argument against summary judgment on the issue of preemption is unfounded since preemption by the frsa is purely a question of law.tyrrell norfolk ry,cir gte mobilnet johnson,cir.therefore,nye negligence claim based on inadequate warnings is preempted.shanklin,at.
ii.csxt negligence 
this court reviews the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.lautermilch findlay city schools,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c anderson liberty lobby,d.a mere scintilla of evidence in support of the nonmoving party will not be sufficient.id.in considering a motion for summary judgment,the district court must construe the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the central issue is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.anderson,at.a court duty is not to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.id.at.
diversity jurisdiction requires a federal court to apply the substantive law of the state in which it sits.hayes equitable energy res,cir.however,federal courts may apply their own procedural rules.see miller davis,cir.therefore,we apply ohio negligence law and our summary judgment standard.as nye negligence claims based on inadequate warnings are preempted,his negligence claims as to inadequate train visibility and reflectorization will be reviewed.
under ohio law,in order to defeat a motion for summary judgment on a negligence claim,a plaintiff must establish that a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff breached that duty and the breach of that duty proximately caused injury to the plaintiff.texler summers cleaners shirt laundry,ohio.the existence of duty is a legal question for the court to determine.mussivand david,ohio.
thus,we review de novo to decide whether a reasonable jury could find that csxt has a duty to make sure that its train cars are visible,it breached that duty,and bishop inability to perceive the train was a proximate cause of the accident.it is well settled that csxt owes a duty of ordinary care to protect the safety of motorists.matkovich penn cent.transp,ohio,ohio.if not preempted by federal law,a railroad minimum statutory duty is to erect crossbuck signs at each crossing pursuant to ohio code,and this duty may be enlarged under common law to include additional warnings given special circumstances.id.at.as to the duty of a driver of an automobile approaching a railroad crossing in ohio,that driver owes a duty of care to avoid a collision.barger chesapeake ohio ry,ohio app d,see also ohio code general duty to stop at stop sign before railroad crossing.
bishop testimony 
nye asserts that bishop testimony that he did not see the train until he was less than one car length away established a genuine issue of fact as to csxt negligence.specifically,nye claims that bishop could have avoided the collision if he could have seen the train.nye concludes that bishop lack of notice of the train presents a genuine issue of material fact as to csxt negligence because the crossing was dark,there was no illumination at the crossing or on the train,and there were no reflectors on the train.nye cites ohio law for the proposition that discernability is an issue for the jury.sharp norfolk ry,ohio,case norfolk western ry,ohio app d,ohio app.dist.
csxt argues that bishop statement that he could not have seen the train does not withstand summary judgment because he also admitted that he was not looking for a train.therefore,csxt proposes that discernability is not a jury issue.csxt suggests that even if the crossing was illuminated by lights or the train had reflector strips,it would have made no difference in the outcome of the case because he was not looking for a train.moreover,bishop admitted that he was familiar with the railroad tracks,he knew trains traveled over those tracks,and he knew there was a crossbuck at the crossing.bishop felt the collision was caused solely by his brake failure and not csxt conduct.
deciding whether bishop could have steered his car to safety with more warning required speculation on the part of bishop.at some point of visibility,bishop likely would have been able to steer the vehicle to safety.however,bishop knew the train was crossing,and expected his car to stop,but the car was unable to stop.it is conceivable,that upon seeing the train earlier,he could have realized his brakes were malfunctioning and taken appropriate action.however,it is also conceivable that bishop would have continued up and until he reached the intersection,expecting to stop,only to realize his brakes would not stop him safely.
the issue of proximate cause usually is a question of fact.whiteleather yosowitz,ohio app d.dist.however,if the plaintiff evidence on the issue of proximate cause requires mere speculation and conjecture to determine the cause of the event at issue,then the defendant is entitled to summary judgment.renfroe ashley,ohio.nye support is conjecture and based upon what if deposition questions.although discernability may very well be a jury issue,the portions of bishop testimony cited by nye are nothing more than speculation.moreover,bishop repeatedly refers to his brakes as the cause of the accident.see,ayoub passenger,cir holding where driver own negligence proximately caused collision,no reasonable jury could return a verdict against railroad.as bishop was the driver and repeatedly stated that visibility of the train would not have mattered,no reasonable jury could conclude that csxt proximately caused this accident.
heathington testimony 
nye contends the district court committed reversible error by weighing the testimony of his expert,kenneth heathington.he posits that heathington testimony established that csxt caused the collision and nye damages by breaching its duty of ordinary care in the following ways maintaining improper vertical grades failing to illuminate the hough road crossing or failing to place reflective materials on the trains.heathington concluded that if csxt had taken any series of fundamental safety steps,this accident could have been prevented.in response,csxt argues that heathington opinions are conclusory and there was no evidence to support his irrelevant theories.
heathington submitted an affidavit and report of his findings.the district court considered heathington opinion directly contrary to eyewitness reports and at odds with sworn statements and depositions.this court has held that status as an expert does not relieve the nonmoving party of the burden of rebutting summary judgment.thomas city of chattanooga,cir i f the witness is relying solely or primarily on experience,then the witness must explain how that experience leads to the conclusion reached and how that experience is reliably applied to the facts.consequently,this court can not rely solely on the expert word.id.
heathington report is rife with unfounded conclusions about national railway safety problems that are for the most part irrelevant to resolution of this case.however,it concluded that csxt created bishop perception problem by breaching its duty of ordinary care by failing to illuminate the hough road crossing and failing to place reflective materials on its train.heathington stated that nighttime collisions are a result of trains not emitting light or else reflecting the light coming from some other source back toward drivers and concluded that the accident would not have occurred had csxt adopted countermeasures to overcome bishop inability to perceive the train.these concerns did not arise in this case,because bishop was the driver and repeatedly stated that visibility of the train would not have mattered.on that basis,no reasonable jury could conclude that csxt or the visibility of its trains proximately caused this accident,irrespective of heathington report.
brake failure 
nye argues that the district court erred by relying on bishop testimony as conclusive proof of brake failure.he claims that the physical proof is inconsistent with brake failure and creates a genuine issue of material fact as to bishop inability to perceive the train.he notes that csxt assistant trainmaster joseph tupa investigated the collision and found no evidence or information whatsoever that there was any problems with bishop brakes.the deposition shows tupa had no knowledge of brake problems.during his deposition,csxt claims manager aughenbaugh stated that he pressed the brake pedal and felt that it was firm.when asked by counsel whether he had any evidence that the brakes were not working that night,aughenbaugh responded,the only evidence that i aware of,that i seen anyway,is bishop statement that the brakes were working.he also stated that he was not aware of any evidence to the contrary.
nye asserts that two affidavits from experts show undisputed evidence that the brakes were functioning.one affidavit appears to be a report of a brake inspection of the mustang.the report concludes that the brake system of bishop mustang is in operational condition and no failures were found during this inspection.the second affidavit is a letter from joseph praha,an engineering consultant,reporting the test results of the previous brake test.he wrote to nye counsel 
tests were made that established that with reasonable engineering and scientific certainty that braking system is in working order.there is no evidence of leakage of brake fluid from any of the wheel cylinders,the master cylinder or any of the connecting piping.every wheel exhibited braking action with shoes moving in response to peddle depression.
throughout his deposition,bishop consistently highlights that the cause of the accident was the failure of his brakes.the inspection by the csxt claims manager was cursory and only stated that the pedal was firm,and the other evidence was a report of a brake examination occurring a few days later.in any event,based on the evidence,we agree with the district court ruling that csxt alleged negligence was not a proximate cause of the accident.driver error brake failure was the sole cause in fact for the collision.no reasonable juror could rule otherwise.
legal duty to provide audible warning 
nye argues that the train engineers did not comply with the legal duty to provide audible warnings.ohio law requires that train personnel sound a whistle at a distance of at least rods and not further than rods from a crossing,and ring a bell continuously until the engine passes the crossing ohio code.bishop stated that he never heard a whistle at the hough road crossing,but he stated that his car engine was very loud.in addition,csxt claims manager aughenbaugh stated in his deposition that the event recorder that would log the number of whistle blows did not record anything from beginning to end.nye posits that whether bishop engine was too loud and drowned out the whistle is a question of fact for the jury.in addition,he contends that a whistle post,a sign to inform the train crew to sound the whistle,was not in place near the hough road crossing.
the evidence is clear that the impact was not with the lead engine and that bishop collided with the seventh and eighth cars.as the engine had passed by the hough road crossing and was feet in front of the location of impact,the engineer was no longer under a duty to sound the whistle.the train crew testified that the audible warning devices w
