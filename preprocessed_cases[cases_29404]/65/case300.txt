background 
factual background 
this products liability case arises from a tractor accident that occurred on october.on that day,menz was moving dirt using his ford model tractor tractor,which was equipped with a loader loader manufactured by westendorf.menz planned to use the tractor and loader to move dirt at the bottom of a levee near a pond adjacent to menz missouri farm to decrease the slope of the terrain.
menz began dumping his first load of dirt while driving at the bottom of and parallel to the levee,on a slight incline sloping downward toward a washout.to the left of menz path was the washout.to menz right was the uphill side of the levee.the loader was full to completely full of dirt.before menz began raising the loader bucket,it was about one or two feet off the ground.when menz was approximately ten feet from the spot where he intended to unload the dirt,he began raising the loader bucket further off the ground.as menz approached the unloading spot and raised the loader bucket,the tractor left front tire skidded into the washout.the tractor then rolled over onto its left side.menz tried to jump out of the way but failed ultimately,menz was pinned by the tractor face down in the dirt.menz suffered several injuries,including the amputation of his left arm.
menz purchased the tractor from a previous owner in about,and acquired the loader in approximately or.menz estimated he had used the tractor with its attached loader for hundreds of hours.in the years before the accident,menz had not experienced any problems with the tractor or loader,and the tractor had not previously leaned or tipped over while in use.menz tractor was not equipped with a protection system rops,a device capable of being installed on a tractor to aid the operator in the event of a.

standard of review 
we review de novo a district court order granting summary judgment.see ehlis shire richwood,cir.summary judgment is proper if,after viewing all the evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c libel adventure lands of,cir.mere allegations,unsupported by specific facts or evidence beyond the nonmoving party own conclusions,are insufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment.thomas corwin,cir.we may affirm a district court grant of summary judgment on any basis supported by the record.see tenge phillips modern ag,cir.missouri substantive law governs in this diversity action.see pro serv,lenan,cir.
strict liability failure to warn claim against new holland and ford 
menz first argues the district court erred in granting summary judgment to new holland and ford on menz strict liability failure to warn claim.to prove causation in a failure to warn case,menz must demonstrate his injuries were caused by a product for which there was no warning,and a warning would have altered his behavior.see arnold,banc.summary judgment is proper if either element is not satisfied.see mothershead greenbriar country club.the district court found menz failed to satisfy the second causation element because menz expert witness ryan testified there were no warnings new holland and ford could have given menz that would have altered his conduct at the time of the accident.new holland,d at.during ryan deposition,he testified 
q is there information that you believe steve menz lacked that would have changed the outcome of this accident 
q so,there is any information that you think menz needed to be warned about 
q that would have changed the outcome.
a no you ca do safety with warnings.it number or number,depending on the standard.so forget warnings.fix it.
on appeal,menz argues the district court erroneously determined missouri law requires expert testimony to prove causation for his failure to warn claim,menz was not entitled to a presumption that he would have heeded a warning because he had knowledge of the tractor specific dangers,and menz could not contradict his expert witness testimony by submitting his own affidavit regarding the effect of a warning.
missouri law does not necessarily require expert testimony in a strict products liability case.see pro.serv,at citing tune synergy gas,banc.such testimony is necessary,however,where the lay jury does not possess the experience or knowledge of the subject matter sufficient to enable them to reach an intelligent opinion without help.id.internal quotation omitted see,housman fiddyment,banc when jurors,for want of experience or knowledge of the subject under inquiry,are incapable of reaching an intelligent opinion without outside aid,the courts out of necessity admit the testimony of experts in the field.because the determination of whether expert testimony is necessary rests in the first instance in the trial court sound discretion,we review that decision for abuse of discretion.see housman,at.
the necessity of expert testimony in a failure to warn case turns on the complexity of the subject matter.see bryant laiko int l,wl,at,recognizing missouri courts have always allowed,and often required expert testimony on the question of failure to warn.here,menz strict liability claim alleges the defendants failed to warn him of the tractor inherent instability and propensity to turn over on relatively level ground,and of the added danger of using a loader.menz argues r esolution of these issues does not require analysis of any complex machinery.we disagree.contrary to menz assertion,the products at issue in this case are fairly technical and complex,and are not the type of machinery commonly utilized by the typical lay juror.see pro.serv,at requiring expert testimony on causation for the plaintiff strict products liability claim given the complexities involved in the operation of the equipment at issue.the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding a lay jury would lack the experience and knowledge necessary to determine causation on menz warnings claim without the aid of expert testimony.cole goodyear tire rubber,holding the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failure to warn case by admitting testimony of the plaintiff expert witness,and noting w arnings and how people react to warnings are arguably subjects about which persons h
