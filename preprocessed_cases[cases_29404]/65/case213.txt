rolf lindstrom,a merchant seaman,brought suit against numerous defendants seeking compensation for his mesothelioma,a disease he claims was caused by exposure to asbestos released from products manufactured by.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of ingersoll rand company,coffin turbo pump,garlock sealing technologies,llc,henry vogt machine company,and goulds pumps,but denied john crane,summary judgment motion.following a bench trial,the district court entered a verdict in favor of john crane.willard bartel and david peebles,administrators of lindstrom estate,now appeal.
for the following reasons,we affirm the decision of the district court with respect to all of the defendants.
lindstrom was employed from until as a merchant seaman.he worked in the engine department as a licensed engineer aboard numerous vessels during this time.in his work,lindstrom was allegedly exposed to many pieces of equipment that contained asbestos.lindstrom was diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma of the peritoneum in october and died of this disease on june.willard bartel and david peebles were appointed as administrators of lindstrom estate and were substituted as plaintiffs.
lindstrom filed a complaint in the northern district of ohio in january of against various defendants seeking compensation for the mesothelioma,a condition which he asserts he developed as a result of exposure to asbestos contained in products.lindstrom complaint listed claims of negligence under the jones act,et,unseaworthiness under maritime law,and products liability claims of design and manufacturing defects.only the products liability claims are at issue in this appeal.

we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.golden city of columbus,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.we must review the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
on an appeal from a judgment entered after a bench trial,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.pressman franklin bank,cir.when the factual findings involve credibility determinations,we afford great deference to the district court factual findings.schroyer frankel,cir.
plaintiffs in products liability cases under maritime law may proceed under both negligence and strict liability theories.under either theory,a plaintiff must establish causation.stark armstrong world,cir.we have required that a plaintiff show,for each defendant,that he was exposed to the defendant product,and the product was a substantial factor in causing the injury he suffered.id.in addition,we have permitted evidence of substantial exposure for a substantial period of time to provide a basis for the inference that the product was a substantial factor in causing the injury.id.at.minimal exposure to a defendant product is insufficient.id.likewise,a mere showing that defendant product was present somewhere at plaintiff place of work is insufficient.id.rather,where a plaintiff relies on proof of exposure to establish that a product was a substantial factor in causing injury,the plaintiff must show a high enough level of exposure that an inference that the asbestos was a substantial factor in the injury is more than conjectural.id.quoting harbour armstrong world,wl,at cir.april.in other words,proof of substantial exposure is required for a finding that a product was a substantial factor in causing injury.
urge this court to reject the stark approach to causation proof.we decline their invitation.the stark reasoning permits a plaintiff,faced with a difficult task of establishing causation,to meet his burden through proof of substantial exposure and has proved workable in maritime asbestos products liability cases.
the also argue that the district court erred in its application of stark.argue that stark stands for the proposition that in order to withstand a motion for summary judgment,evidence of substantial asbestos exposure for a substantial period of time is required only if the evidence is entirely circumstantial.because submitted an affidavit from an expert witness,maintain that their causation proof is not entirely circumstantial and that the above standard does not apply.see id.at had stark presented expert testimony,summary judgment might well have been improper.
while are correct that causation may also be established through direct evidence that a product to which a worker has been exposed is a substantial factor in causing injury,they are incorrect in their assertion that their affidavit enables them to survive summary judgment.the affidavit in question was prepared by joseph corson,with regard to the issue of whether products were a substantial factor in lindstrom mesothelioma,corson affidavit stated each of lindstrom occupational exposures to asbestos aboard ship to a reasonable degree of medical certainty were sic a substantial contributing factor to his development of mesothelioma.the medical and scientific community can not exclude any specific asbestos exposure as to lindstrom mesothelioma.after reviewing this affidavit in considering the summary judgment motions of ingersoll rand and coffin turbo pump,the district court stated 
corson does not specifically reference the product of any particular defendant.rather,he opines that there is no safe level of asbestos exposure,and that every exposure to asbestos,however slight,was a substantial factor in causing lindstrom disease.if an opinion such as corson would be sufficient for plaintiff to meet his burden,the sixth circuit substantial factor test would be meaningless.accordingly,corson opinion is insufficient as a matter of law to get lindstrom past summary judgment.
the district court correctly found the affidavit,which sought to base causation on any hypothetical exposure,however slight,to be insufficient to allow to avoid summary judgment in favor of ingersoll rand and coffin turbo pump the affidavit does not reference any specific defendant or product,but rather states in a conclusory fashion that every exposure to asbestos was a substantial factor in lindstrom illness.the requirement,however,is that the plaintiff make a showing with respect to each defendant that the defendant product was a substantial factor in plaintiff injury,see stark.at commonly,the substantial factor standard is separately applied to each of the defendants.as a matter of law,corson affidavit does not provide a basis for a causation finding as to any particular defendant.a holding to the contrary would permit imposition of liability on the manufacturer of any product with which a worker had the briefest of encounters on a single occasion.
next argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of each of the involved in this appeal.also argue that the district court ruling in favor of john crane,should be reversed.we will examine the district court decisions with respect to each of these separately.
henry vogt machine company 
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of henry vogt machine company based on a finding that had failed to produce evidence that henry vogt products had caused lindstrom illness.in vogt answers to the interrogatories,vogt acknowledged that the valves the company manufactured contained encapsulated asbestos packing and the company gaskets were covered in metal and had chyrsotile asbestos encapsulated between each of the metal windings.vogt also noted that the gaskets contained asbestos manufactured by other suppliers.
in lindstrom may,deposition,he listed vogt as one of the companies that manufactured valves aboard the vessels upon which lindstrom had worked.lindstrom did not,however,name vogt as one of the companies that manufactured replacement valve packing containing asbestos to which lindstrom was exposed on the ships.
lindstrom also presented deposition testimony given by horace george,with whom lindstrom had served with on one ship,the almeria lykes.george stated in his deposition that lindstrom commenced work aboard the ship four years after the ship was commissioned.george testified that generally,the shipping company,rather than the valve manufacturer,provided the replacement packing and gasket material.george named five manufacturers who provided packing materials that lindstrom would have come in contact with during his tenure on the ship,none of which was henry vogt.george also testified that and containing packings were used aboard the ship,but he could not visually distinguish packing containing asbestos from packing that was.george also testified that the packing generally needed to be replaced a couple of times per year.based on this statement,coupled with the fact that lindstrom boarded the ship four years after it was initially commissioned,the district court surmised that it would have been impossible for lindstrom to have handled any original packing or gasket material attributable to henry vogt.
in his response to henry vogt motion for summary judgment,lindstrom filed an affidavit in which he stated,i specifically recall numerous valves manufactured supplied by henry vogt machine on board vessels upon which i served throughout my career and i specifically recall replacing the packing materials and gaskets in working on henry vogt machine valves described above,many times throughout my career as a merchant mariner.additionally,lindstrom filed an affidavit from george,which stated that he specifically recalled numerous henry vogt valves aboard the almeria lykes and that he witnessed lindstrom replacing packing material and gaskets numerous times on those valves.the district court refused to consider these affidavits based on a finding that it was an inappropriate attempt by lindstrom to create a factual issue by filing affidavits that contradict the earlier deposition testimony.in their appellate brief,ignore this ruling by the district court and discuss the information contained in these affidavits as if they are properly before the court.however,because the have failed to challenge the district court ruling on the admissibility of these affidavits,they are precluded from relying on them on appeal 
the district court conclusion that there was insufficient information presented to survive summary judgment with respect to whether a henry vogt product was a substantial factor in lindstrom illness was correct,and thus we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in vogt favor.based on the information properly before the district court at the time that the motion for summary judgment was filed,there was insufficient evidence to connect lindstrom with any henry vogt product or to connect a henry vogt product with asbestos that caused lindstrom illness.lindstrom almost certainly could not have handled the original packing or gasket material,and this fact compels the conclusion that any asbestos that he may have been exposed to in connection with a henry vogt product would be attributable to some other manufacturer.according to stark,henry vogt can not be held responsible for material attached or connected to its product on a claim of a manufacturing defect.see stark.at koonce quaker safety prods,cir the component part manufacturer is protected from liability when the defective condition results from the integration of the part into another product and the component part is free from defect.see also stark.at a n product,even one with a warning label,is not inherently defective as a matter of law.
goulds pumps.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of goulds pumps,based on a finding that had failed to produce evidence that goulds pumps products had caused lindstrom illness.when listing the manufacturers of the water pumps on board the various vessels on which he worked,lindstrom mentioned goulds,among others.however,when lindstrom was asked which manufacturers pumps were most prevalent,he stated,it depends on what ship you went on.some of them used aurora pumps,some of them used worthington pumps,it all depends.lindstrom did not mention goulds pumps as one of the prevalent types of pumps.lindstrom testified that the packing material used to repack the pumps contained asbestos.lindstrom identified several companies that manufactured the replacement packing used in water pumps,none of which was goulds pumps.it does not appear that george ever specifically mentioned goulds pumps in his deposition.george testified that lindstrom spent approximately ten percent of his time working with gaskets and packing.george also testified that the replacement packing material was primarily provided by the shipping company 
the information before the district court was insufficient to create an issue of material fact regarding whether any goulds pumps product was a substantial factor in lindstrom illness.the information fails to establish a sufficient link between a goulds pumps product and lindstrom or between the asbestos causing lindstrom illness and a goulds pumps product.the cursory treatment brief affords their argument that the district court erred in granting summary judgment does not contain any viable reason that the district court decision was incorrect.as a result,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of goulds pumps.
coffin turbo pump.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of coffin turbo pump,based on a finding that had failed to produce evidence that coffin turbo pump products had caused lindstrom illness.lindstrom testified that coffin manufactured most of the feed pumps on the vessels upon which he worked.lindstrom testified that new coffin pumps do not come with any insulation and that coffin did not send insulation at the time it delivered the pumps.lindstrom stated that any insulation put on a coffin pump was probably provided by the shipyard.lindstrom also testified that the replacement gaskets were not coffin products.lindstrom further testified regarding packing rings on the pumps as well as the packing in the valve.lindstrom stated that he replaced the original packing rings,which were manufactured by coffin,many times and they usually slid right off and were not dusty.lindstrom testified that the new rings tended to be dusty when they were being put on but stated that he did not know whether the dust contained asbestos.it is unclear from the record whether the replacement packing rings were manufactured by coffin.
lindstrom also testified that he worked on the asbestos packing in coffin pumps in the valve stem many times.lindstrom testified that he knew that the packing was asbestos packing because it was hot.finally,lindstrom testified that he replaced gaskets on the pump throttles approximately twelve times.lindstrom testified that the replacement gaskets were not coffin products.william kammerzell,an individual with whom lindstrom had worked aboard the allison lykes for various periods between and,also testified regarding lindstrom exposure to coffin products.kammerzell testified that coffin produced special packing made especially for their pumps.kammerzell testified that he had observed lindstrom repacking coffin pumps.he testified that asbestos products are everywhere on merchant vessels.
the information before the district court at the time of the summary judgment motion does not establish a question of material fact regarding the issue of whether a coffin turbo product was a sub
