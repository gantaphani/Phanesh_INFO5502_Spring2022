plaintiff ashley glennen sued defendant allergan,allergan alleging she suffered complications after allergan lap band adjustable gastric banding system lap band was surgically implanted in her body.she appeals from the judgment rendered after the trial court sustained allergan demurrer to her second amended complaint sac without leave to amend.she contends the court erred in concluding her claim that allergan failed to adequately train physicians in the use of the lap band is preempted by federal law.we affirm.
factual background and procedural history 
we take the factual material from plaintiff sac and from matters subject to judicial notice.bioenterics was a subsidiary of inamed corporation,a company that merged with allergan in.in march,bioenterics applied for food and drug administration fda premarket approval to manufacture and market the lap band.the lap band is designed to induce weight loss in severely obese patients by limiting food consumption.the band buckle design eases laparoscopic placement around the stomach,allowing the formation of a small gastric pouch and stoma.bioenterics application was based on the lap band designation as a class iii device under the medical device amendments to the food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca.stat,as amended,et.
bioenterics received premarket approval for the lap band on june.in the letter notifying bioenterics of this approval,the fda indicated that the lap band labeling must specify the requirements that apply to the training of practitioners who may use the device as approved in this order a brochure prepared by bioenterics provides that surgeons planning laparoscopic placement must,among other things,h ave extensive advanced laparoscopic experience h ave previous experience in treating obese patients and have the staff and commitment to comply with the requirements of obesity procedures p articipate in a training program for the lap band system authorized by bioenterics corporation or an authorized bioenterics distributor this is a requirement for use.the brochure also states that surgeons were required to be observed by qualified personnel during their first band placements,to have the equipment and experience necessary to complete the procedure via laparotomy if required,and to report on their personal experiences using the device furthermore,the fda approval letter obligated the manufacturer to include annual progress reports on the postapproval study that you agreed to conduct to gather safety and effectiveness data on the subject device.you agreed to continue on subjects enrolled under protocol a and protocol b of your investigative study.these subjects must be followed for a total of years from the time of implantation.italics added.
in january,plaintiff underwent a surgical procedure to implant a lap band.the lap band eventually eroded into both her stomach and her liver.the erosion into the stomach caused a portion of her stomach to die.additionally,the tubing attached to the lap band became entangled with her small intestine,resulting in the death of a portion of her small intestine.the erosion into the liver caused the lap band to become firmly adhered to her liver.during surgery to remove the lap band she suffered a massive hemorrhaging from her liver,causing her to experience profound hypotension and systemic shock as a result,plaintiff suffered brain damage.
in september,more than nine years after the procedure,plaintiff filed a complaint alleging several causes of action against allergan and other defendants.
in december,plaintiff filed a first amended complaint.
on april,plaintiff filed her sac,alleging a single cause of action against allergan for negligence.
on july,the trial court granted allergan demurrer to the sac without leave to amend.
on april,judgment after demurrer was entered in favor of allergan.notice of entry of judgment was served on may.plaintiff thereafter filed a timely appeal.
discussion 
standard of review 
we apply a de novo standard of review because this case was resolved on demurrer citation and because federal preemption presents a pure question of law citation.citation.in ruling on a demurrer,the allegations of the complaint must be liberally construed,with a view to substantial justice between the parties.coleman medtronic,th,coleman.
ii.federal regulation of class iii medical devices 
a.the medical device amendments of 
this case,asserting injuries allegedly stemming from an medical device,arises within a complex and highly regulated area of federal law pursuant to which the contours of permissible private enforcement suits are carefully circumscribed.the starting point is the federal medical device amendments of mda,title united states code section et which imposed a regime of detailed federal oversight over the market for medical devices.riegel medtronic,riegel.regulation of medical devices,an expansive field encapsulating everything from bedpans to brainscans medtronic,lohr,lohr,had traditionally been left largely to state supervision.however,rapid technological change and highly publicized instances of medical device failure led many to doubt the ability of the tort system to manage the risks associated with dangerous devices.riegel,at.in response to this mounting consumer and regulatory concern lohr,at,congress entered the field and enacted the mda,which intentionally swept back some state obligations in favor of uniform federal regulation.walker medtronic,cir,quoting riegel,at.
the mda utilized a approach to achieve its purpose.on the one hand,it imposed an intricate regulatory scheme to increase oversight and promote uniformity at the federal level.correspondingly,as will be discussed below,it eliminated the potential for state enforcement interference by enacting an express preemption clause.see.
classification system f or medical devices 
a key feature of the federal scheme is a graduated classification system designed to tailor the level of fda oversight to the safety risks posed by a given medical device the higher the safety risk,the more regulatory requirements apply.see a.class i devices present the lowest safety risk and accordingly are subject only to general controls,such as labeling requirements,imposed by the fdca and the regulations promulgated pursuant to its authority.riegel,supra,at.such devices need not adhere to regulations because general quality controls,applicable to all finished devices intended for human use are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device.a a i.
the safety and effectiveness of class ii devices can not be guaranteed by these generally applicable controls,and so these devices require further oversight,including special controls,such as the promulgation of performance standards,postmarket surveillance,patient registries,and the dissemination of guidelines.a b.where not even such special controls can ensure the device safety,and where the device is either useful in supporting or sustaining human life,substantially important in preventing the impairment of human health,or presents an unreasonable risk of illness or injury,the device is given a class iii classification.a c.because of the risks associated with them,new class iii devices are required to go through a premarket approval pma process to provide reasonable assurance of their safety and effectiveness.ibid.
premarket approval process 
premarket approval is a rigorous process riegel,supra,at,designed to fully vet and secure safety and effectiveness before a new class iii device may be introduced to the market.lohr,supra,at.the pma process for new devices is governed by section,as well as regulations promulgated under its authority.where pma is required,the device proponent must file with the fda an application providing a wide variety of information reports of all investigations into the safety and effectiveness of the device,a statement of its components,a full description of the methods used to manufacture and produce the device,device samples,and specimens of proposed labeling.c.this application process typically requires a multivolume application.riegel,at.the fda review of each submission generally entails an average of hours of study before possible approval.lohr,at.within days of receipt of such application,the fda is required to make a decision regarding approval.the fda will grant premarket approval only if it finds that there is reasonable assurance of the device safety and effectiveness.d a ii riegel,at.
the fda has broad authority to condition its approval in a number of ways,including requiring that the device meet formal performance standards b,or any other postapproval requirement necessary to provide reasonable assurance,or continued reasonable assurance,of the safety and effectiveness of the device.a.these postapproval requirements can include restrictions on the sale,distribution,or use of the device,continuing reporting and recordkeeping requirements,and requirements related to labeling and advertising of the restricted device.a.
moreover,the fdca and its accompanying regulations impose continuing requirements on medical devices and their manufacturers after they receive pma.these include a general obligation to inform the fda about the known adverse consequences of the device.the rigorous oversight regime following approval also generally subjects approved medical devices to continuing recording and reporting requirements,including the obligation to inform the fda of new clinical investigations or scientific studies concerning the device of which the manufacturer knows or reasonably should know,and the obligation to report incidents in which the device may have caused or contributed to death or serious injury,or malfunctioned in a manner that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury were it to recur.b,a riegel,at.
iii.federal preemption.
the supremacy clause provides that the laws of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding,art.vi,cl.consistent with that clause command,state laws that conflict with federal law are without effect they are preempted.altria group,good,quoting maryland louisiana.preemption can occur either expressly or impliedly.express preemption occurs when congress define s explicitly the extent to which its enactments state law.english general electric.implied preemption occurs when state law regulates conduct in a field that congress intended the federal government to occupy exclusively,or when state law actually conflicts with federal law,which exists where it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements,citation,or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.id.at.
express preemption 
the mda contains an express preemption provision for medical devices,which provides that no state or political subdivision of a state may establish or continue in effect with respect to a device intended for human use any requirement which is different from,or in addition to,any requirement applicable under this act to the device,and which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under this act.a k a.thus,the mda expressly only state requirements different from,or in addition to,any requirement applicable to the device under federal law.riegel,supra,at.
in riegel,the supreme court examined whether the mda preempted claims regarding an allegedly defective medical device.in doing so,the court set forth a test to determine whether the claim was preempted.specifically,the court held that preemption under section a applies if the federal government established requirements applicable to the medical device in question,and the claims concerning the device are based on requirements that are different from,or in addition to the federal requirements,and relate to the safety and effectiveness of the device.riegel,supra,at pp.the first prong is automatically satisfied if the fda authorizes commercial distribution of a class iii medical device following the pma process.id.at pp.
the riegel court also affirmed that court earlier holding in lohr,supra,that section a does not prevent a state from providing a damages remedy for claims premised on a violation of fda regulations because the state duties in such a case parallel,rather than add to,federal requirements.riegel,supra,at.the ninth circuit court of appeals has confirmed that the mda does not preempt a claim for violating a duty that parallels a duty under the mda.perez nidek cir,perez,quoting stengel medtronic,cir,en banc stengel,cert.denied by medtronic stengel,d.in wolicki gables arrow international,the eleventh circuit explained in order for a state requirement to be parallel to a federal requirement,and thus not expressly preempted under section a,the plaintiff must show that the requirements are genuinely equivalent.state and federal requirements are not genuinely equivalent if a manufacturer could be held liable under the state law without having violated the federal law.id.at,quoting mcmullen medtronic,cir.if state law liability could be found notwithstanding compliance with the federal requirements,those state law duties are not parallel to the federal requirements and will be preempted.see riegel,at.
implied preemption 
even if a plaintiff claim is not expressly preempted,it will be deemed impliedly preempted if it conflicts with the fdca enforcement scheme.implied preemption under the mda bars claims seeking to enforce an exclusively federal requirement that is not grounded in traditional state tort law.claims not tied to state law tort duties are essentially private actions to enforce the fdca and are barred by section a,a provision authorizing the federal government to enforce the mda the fda is responsible for investigating potential violations of the fdca,and the act provides the agency with a range of enforcement mechanisms,such as injunction proceedings,civil and criminal penalties,and seizure.citations.although citizens may petition the fda to take administrative action,citations,private enforcement of the statute is barred all such proceedings for the enforcement,or to restrain violations,of the act shall be by and in the name of the united states.perez,supra,at.
in buckman plaintiffs legal committee,buckman,individuals who claimed to have been injured by the implantation of orthopedic bone screws brought state tort claims alleging that the manufacturer consultant had made fraudulent representations to the fda while seeking approval to market the screws.the court concluded claims that a device manufacturer had made fraudulent representations to the fda were inherently federal in character because the relationship between the manufacturer and the fda originates from,is governed by,and terminates according to federal law.at.the court held such claims were impliedly preempted id.at because they exist solely by virtue of the fdca disclosure requirements id.at.although claims for fraud are a traditional feature of state common law,the case at issue did not implicate federalism concerns and the historic primacy of state regulation of matters of health and safety id.at,citing lohr,supra,at.the court observed that the consulting company dealings with the fda were prompted by the mda,and the very subject matter of the company statements were dictated by that statute provisions.buckman,at pp.
iv.application 
a.the narrow gap 
together,express preemption and implied preemption identify a narrow gap through which a claim must fit to escape preemption.citation.the plaintiff must be suing for conduct that violates the fdca or else his claim is expressly preempted by a,but the plaintiff must not be suing because the conduct violates the fdca such a claim would be impliedly preempted under buckman.citations.thus,to avoid preemption,a plaintiff must assert a claim that is premised on a violation of law,but that is not based solely on such violation.beavers gabriel medtronic,hawaii d.stated another way,i n order to survive preemption,such claims must be premised on conduct that both violates the fdca and would give rise to a recovery under state law even in the absence of the fdca.scanlon medtronic sofamor danek usa d.
whether plaintiff has allege d a violation of the fdca 
cases finding state law claims that parallel federal regulations 
applying this framework,we first consider whether plaintiff negligence claim is expressly preempted under the test outlined in riegel,supra.plaintiff asserts her negligence action parallels fda regulations and is not preempted because it is not different from or in addition to federal requirements.the cases she relies on,however,are readily distinguishable on their facts.
plaintiff first cites to bausch stryker cir bausch.in that case,a plaintiff sued claiming she was injured by a hip replacement manufactured in violation of federal law.id.at.the court concluded her state law claim for defective manufacture was not expressly preempted by section a.the court reasoned that section a provides immunity for manufacturers of class iii medical devices to the extent that these manufacturers comply with federal law,but it does not protect them if they have violated federal law.thus,if a plaintiff can prove his or her harm was caused by a violation of federal law,the state law claim would not impose on manufacturers any requirement different from,or in addition to,any requirement imposed by federal law.accordingly,the plaintiff manufacturing defect claim in bausch was not preempted.bausch,at.in the present case,however,plaintiff does not allege that the lap band contained any manufacturing defects.instead,she asserts allergan provided inadequate training to the surgeon who installed her lap band.thus,bausch is not on point.
plaintiff next cites to hughes boston scientific cir hughes.there,the plaintiff sued after she was injured by a medical device designed to treat excess uterine bleeding.id.at pp.the court found her state law claim for failure to warn was not preempted to the extent she asserts that the defendant violated the state duty to warn by failing to accurately report serious injuries and malfunctions of the medical device as required by the fda medical device reporting regulations.id.at.specifically,a factfinder could infer that a manufacturer failure to provide this information as required by fda regulations is a parallel violation of the state duty to provide reasonable and adequate information about a device risks.id.at pp.the court concluded such a claim does not impose additional or different requirements to the federal regulations,but is parallel to the federal requirements.id.at.in the present case,plaintiff is not asserting a state law failure to warn claim arising out of a failure to report serious injuries or malfunctions as required by fda regulations.thus,hughes is distinguishable.
plaintiff also cites to bass stryker cir,bass,another case in which the plaintiff,as in bausch,alleged a state law manufacturing defect claim regarding a hip replacement that malfunctioned and caused injury.id.at.the appellate court in bass concluded the operative complaint sufficiently pleaded parallel claims to the extent that the claims were based upon manufacturing defects resulting from violations of federal regulations.id.at.again,no such claim is at issue here.
finally,plaintiff relies on stengel,supra.like hughes,supra,stengel is a failure to warn case.the device at issue in stengel was a surgically implanted spine pain pump.the manufacturer was allegedly aware of certain risks at that time,but failed to report these risks to the fda as was required by the mda.stengel,at.citing hughes and to bausch,supra,the court in stengel concluded the plaintiff failure to warn claim rested on a duty that parallels a duty under the mda,as in lohr,supra.stengel,at.as such,the claim was not preempted.again,plaintiff complaint regarding the lap band does not allege a failure to warn.moreover,plaintiff does not cite to any case in which a plaintiff has successfully maintained a negligence claim based on a manufacturer alleged failure to adequately train physicians in the use of any medical device,let alone a class iii device that has undergone the pma review process 
plaintiff does not articulate any facts in the sac tying allergan alleged negligence to her surgeon implantation of the lap band device.rather than discuss specific features of the allergan brochure training protocols that were approved in the extensive pma review by the fda,the sac contains a narrative of what her surgeon did incorrectly.however,physician error is not enough to support a claim against a manufacturer for improper training or marketing of an approved class iii device.as was noted by one court the only decision that has considered a claim in this context held that claim survived preemption only to the extent the manufacturer failed to provide the training required by the premarket approval process.de la paz bayer healthcare llc dist.lexis,alsup.the sac here does not identify where the training provided by allergan deviated from what the fda required.
in this regard we are concerned about the realities of the distinction.we review below the several cases that have indicated the specific procedures used in the practice of medicine by a professional are not part of the manufacturer regulation process.see post,pp.the pma process does not obligate allergan and like manufacturers to follow their products into the surgery room.as one commentator has observed in this regard the practice of medicine doctrine traces its roots to the concept of federalism,the division of powers between the federal government and the states.historically,medical practice has been a local matter,largely regulated through state licensure of healthcare professionals.courts have concluded that congress recognized and supported this concept in its enactment of the fdca.the practice of medicine doctrine was articulated explicitly in the fdama,the most recent amendments to the fdca nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit or interfere with the authority of a health care practitioner to proscribe or administer any legally marketed device to a patient for any condition or disease within a legitimate health care relationship.smith,physician modification of legally marketed medical devices regulatory implications under the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act food drug,italics added,fns.omitted citing.
plaintiff claim does not parallel any federal regulation 
in an apparent effort to align her claim with a violation of federal law,plaintiff sac alleges violations of several federal provisions contained in the fda quality system regulation.et because none of the regulations on which she relies references any requirement to train physicians in the use of a medical device,her allegations fail to state a parallel claim.
current good manufacturing practice requirements 
medical devices in general,including class iii devices,are subject to the fda current good manufacturing practice cgmp requirements.f et.these cgmp requirements,promulgated under the authority of several mda provisions,are located within the quality system regulation,which applies to all medical devices.see.the requirements are applicable to any finished device,as defined in this part,intended for human use.a.though not sufficient to ensure the safety and effectiveness of class iii devices,cgmp requirements are nonetheless applicable to such devices.bausch,supra,at.this remains true,e ven after pma is granted elmore smith nephew,c,wl.
the stated purpose of the cgmp requirements is to govern the methods used in,and the facilities and controls used for,the design,manufacture,packaging,labeling,storage,installation,and servicing of all finished devices intended for human use.a.to comply with cgmp requirements,a device manufacturer must adopt a variety of procedures and controls relating to areas such as design control,quality assurance,manufacturing and processing,process validation,device inspection,and corrective and preventive action.
courts are not in complete agreement as to what constitutes a sufficient pleading with regard to a cgmp.bass,supra,and cases cited.some cases hold that cgmps can not be used as a basis for state law parallel claims it has been recognized that these standards are intended to serve only as an umbrella quality system providing general objectives medical device manufacturers must seek to achieve.citations.these regulations are purposefully broad so as to apply to a broad range of medical devices.the regulations are to be tailored by each manufacturer of a device to apply to their particular safety and efficacy needs.citation.the intentionally vague and nature of the regulations relied upon is the precise reason why they can not serve as the basis for a parallel claim.since these regulations are open to a particular manufacturer interpretation,allowing them to serve as a basis for a claim would lead to differing safety requirements that might emanate from various lawsuits.this would necessarily result in the imposition of standards that are different from,or in addition to those imposed by the mda precisely the result that the mda preemption provision seeks to prevent.citations.accordingly,where,as here,a plaintiff relies on nothing more than cgmp in support of a parallel cause of action,preemption bars the claim.ilarraza medtronic,d.
other courts appear to agree that cgmps constitute generally applicable federal requirements.for example,the court in bausch,supra,stated section makes preemption a defense if a state seeks to impose on a manufacturer any requirement which is different from,or in addition to,any requirement applicable under this chapter to the device,and which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under this chapter.citing a.we emphasize the phrase any requirement.and federal law is clear for manufacturers of class iii medical devices,the quality system regulations and current good manufacturing practices adopted by the fda under its delegated regulatory authority are legally binding requirements under this chapter.citation.the failure to comply with any applicable provision in this part of the regulations renders a device adulterated such a device,as well as any person responsible for the failure to comply,is subject to regulatory action.bausch,at.
cgmps do not apply t o physician training programs 
assuming cgmps can form the basis of a parallel claim,we note that while section a indicates that cgmps have broad application,the regulations themselves operate in the context of product manufacturing current good manufacturing practice requirements are set forth in this quality system regulation.the requirements in this part govern the methods used in,and the facilities and controls used for,the design,manufacture,packaging,labeling,storage,installation,and servicing of all finished devices intended for human use.the requirements in this part are intended to ensure that finished devices will be safe and effective and otherwise in compliance with the fdca.italics added see also deka internat.genzyme,the fda routinely conducts inspections to determine if facilities are complying with current good manufacturing practices standards for biologics manufacturers.italics added.
in her sac,plaintiff alleges allergan failed to adopt and implement current good manufacturing practices,including failing to adopt and implement a quality policy as required by a and a quality system as required by that were adequate and appropriate for the training of surgeons in implanting lap bands in compliance with the conditions imposed by the fda in granting approval for the lap band.she also asserts allergan violated code of federal regulations section b by failing to devote adequate resources to its lap band surgeon training program to ensure that surgeons who completed the program were skilled in the implantation of lap bands.she further claims allergan violated code of federal regulations section by failing to conduct adequate and appropriate quality audits to assure that its quality system for its lap band training program was in compliance with its established quality system requirements and to determine the effectiveness of its quality system.while these regulations could potentially support a negligence claim based on a design or manufacturing defect,we see nothing in the language of these four provisions to suggest that they are intended to address the quality of a manufacturer physician training program.
code of federal regulations section provides each manufacturer shall establish and maintain a quality system that is appropriate for the specific medical device s designed or manufactured,and that meets the requirements of this part.italics added.code of federal regulations section,by its terms,pertains to m anagement responsibility.subdivision a of that section states management with executive responsibility shall establish its policy and objectives for,and commitment to,quality.management with executive responsibility shall ensure that the quality policy is understood,implemented,and maintained at all levels of the organization.section b does contain a reference to training however,it pertains to the training of a manufacturer own personnel.it states that manufacturers shall provide adequate resources,including the assignment of trained personnel,for management,performance of work,and assessment activities,including internal quality audits,to meet the requirements of this part.italics added.
finally,code of federal regulations section provides,in part each manufacturer shall establish procedures for quality audits and conduct such audits to assure that the quality system is in compliance with the established quality system requirements and to determine the effectiveness of the quality system.quality audit is defined as a systematic,independent examination of a manufacturer quality system that is performed at defined intervals and at sufficient frequency to determine whether both quality system activities and the results of such activities comply with quality system procedures,that these procedures are implemented effectively,and that these procedures are suitable to achieve quality system objectives.t.whatever else this regulatory language may mean,nothing suggests that it pertains to training programs for surgeons who implant medical devices 
case law supports our conclusion that cgmps apply to the manufacturing process only.in bass,the fifth circuit held the plaintiff could state a claim based on violation of the cgmps.in that case,part of a hip replacement had allegedly failed to attach correctly due to impurities in the manufacturing process.the plaintiff asserted the defendant manufacturer had violated the manufacturing or sterilization procedures that it had adopted to fulfill the cgmps.in that case,the court noted the fda itself had found the defendant in violation of the cgmps,suggesting that the federal regulations are not so vague that they do not spell out standards that the court could enforce.bass,supra,at.the court held the plaintiff reliance,in part,on the cgmps did not preclude him from having effectively alleged a parallel claim.ibid.again,the present case does not concern a defect occurring during the manufacturing process of the lap band.plaintiff reliance on the cgmps is therefore inapposite.
that the language of the cgmps does not suggest the existence of any physician training protocols is not surprising.as the court in buckman observed,the fdca expressly disclaims any intent to directly regulate the practice of medicine buckman,supra,at,italics added.we also observe imposing performance standards on the training of physicians in the use of a class iii device would tend to increase the burden facing potential applicants.plaintiff effectively seeks to write in a new provision to the fdca,namely,that medical device companies who are required to provide training to physicians as a condition of premarket approval must insure such training is designed to satisfy the standard of care applicable to medical malpractice actions.we do not pass judgment on whether this would be a wise rule for the fda to adopt.it is sufficient for our inquiry that it has not done so.just as significant,the alleged inadequate training relates to the safety or effectiveness of the lap band.see a.in r
