plaintiff bernardino santos was injured in a boating accident when a corroded rod end that was part of the boat steering mechanism failed.santos and several relatives sued defendant seastar solutions seastar,the manufacturer of the boat steering mechanism,alleging a design defect and a failure to warn.santos appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of seastar.we affirm.
background 
factual.the boating accident 
on june,santos was riding in a boat in a bay near guayama,puerto rico.raúl viera owned the boat,which was equipped with a hydraulic steering system manufactured in by seastar then known as teleflex canada.the rod connecting the steering system to the right motor had a at the end,which broke while the boat was in motion,resulting in a loss of steering and ejecting santos from the boat.santos sustained extensive injuries,resulting in paraplegia.none of the other plaintiffs,all relatives of santos,were in the boat.subsequent examination revealed that the rod end failed because of corrosion.
the instruction manual and the boat maintenance 
the steering system instruction manual the manual informed owners that b inspection of the steering system by a qualified marine mechanic is required and instructed them to c heck fittings and seal locations for leaks or damage and service as necessary.the manual did not include a specific warning about corrosion of the rod end.
the boat owner,viera,acquired it.he did not perform maintenance on the boat,did not keep a maintenance log or request maintenance documentation from the previous owner,and did not read the manual or any of the warnings affixed to the steering system.viera hired mechanics to maintain the boat,but none of those mechanics ever brought the corroded rod end to viera attention.
procedural history 
on june,santos and four relatives filed the operative complaint,claiming diversity jurisdiction and,in the alternative,maritime jurisdiction.on march,the district court granted summary judgment to seastar.it first ruled that federal maritime law,rather than the substantive law of puerto rico,applied to the plaintiffs claims.the district court then determined that the plaintiffs expert did not identify a specific design defect in his expert report.in doing so,the district court ruled that the expert deposition testimony that seastar had used a type of stainless steel that was prone to corrosion in marine environments was inadmissible because it was not raised in the expert report.the district court also ruled that santos could not show causation on his claim because there was no evidence that viera or any person maintaining the boat had ever looked at the manual or the steering system warning labels.finally,the district court dismissed claims by santos relatives,which were contingent on santos claims.the district court denied the plaintiffs motion to alter or amend the judgment on september.
the plaintiffs timely appealed both orders.
ii.analysis 
we review orders for summary judgment de novo,assessing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and resolving all reasonable inferences in that party favor.bingham supervalu,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.a.
the plaintiffs claim that the district court erred by applying federal maritime law,rather than the substantive law of puerto rico.we need not address this issue,however,because even under the law of puerto rico,the plaintiffs have not created a triable issue of fact on their claims for either a design defect or a failure to warn.
santos can not prove that any failure to warn caused his injuries 
under puerto rico law,
a plaintiff alleging failure to warn must prove the manufacturer knew,or should have known of the risk inherent in the product there were no warnings or instructions,or those provided were inadequate the absence of warnings made the product inherently dangerous and the absence of adequate warnings or instructions was the proximate cause of plaintiff injury.
reynolds tobacco,cir.quoting aponte rivera sears roebuck,offic.trans.the district court ruled that santos had not shown causation because it was uncontested that viera did not read the manual,and there was no evidence that santos himself,the mechanics who maintained the boat,or the boat previous owner ever read the manual or that anyone communicated the warnings in the manual to viera.
here on appeal,the plaintiffs briefly summarize evidence that the manual did not include any warnings about corrosion of the rod end and their expert conclusion that the rod end was corroded and that this caused loss of control of the steering of the boat,leading to the accident and santos injuries.they then assert,without citation,that u nder puerto rico law,this is sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact.this argument does not address the district court conclusion that no evidence has been brought to the court attention from which the trier of fact could reasonably infer that the omission of additional warnings caused santos damages.unless someone read the manual,no warnings in it could have prevented santos injuries.thus,even assuming that the manual did not contain adequate warnings or instructions,that can not be the proximate cause of santos injury,at see ramírez plough,cal.plaintiff mother,who administered the drug to plaintiff,neither read nor obtained translation of the product labeling.thus,there is no conceivable causal connection between the representations or omissions that accompanied the product and plaintiff injury.massok keller,app x,cir.applying california law the plaintiff admits that he did not read the warnings and so the sufficiency of the manufacturer warnings is therefore irrelevant.the plaintiff claim based on failure to warn is without merit.
santos can not prove that any design defect in the steering rod caused his injuries 
to prove a products liability claim under puerto rico law,santos must show that seastar equipment has a defect,in any of its modalities the defect existed when the product left seastar control seastar is in the business of selling this type of product the defect was the adequate cause of santos injuries and viera use d the product in a manner that was reasonable and foreseeable by seastar.laser eye surgery mgmt.of,translation at june,in,the plaintiff developed an eye issue after he received laser eye surgery,and he sued the manufacturer of the surgical equipment for selling a defective product.id.at.after discovery,the manufacturer moved for summary judgment,arguing,among other things,that the plaintiff had not identified a specific defect in the surgical equipment.id.at.the court of first instance denied summary judgment,but the puerto rico supreme court reversed and ordered dismissal.id.at.it determined that the plaintiff reliance on the presence of metal particles in his eye was insufficient to establish that the surgical equipment suffer ed from a manufacturing defect or was defectively designed.id.at.rather,the plaintiff evidence established only that it is not normal to fin d metal particles in one eye,and that showing was deficient and insufficient to survive summary judgment.id.at.
here,the plaintiffs expert reported that the rod end was corroded and that this corrosion was the main cause for the failure of the subject hydraulic steering cylinder rod end.no admissible evidence shows that the corrosion was because of some defect in the product design.in fact,the plaintiffs expert report focuses almost exclusively on whether the manual included adequate warnings it does not address whether the product was properly designed 
the plaintiffs assert that the rod end failed to perform as safely as an ordinary consumer would expect and that their expert reported that the product design was subject to corrosiveness.their expert report,however,stated only that seastar was required to warn against all foreseeable hazards associated with the subject hydraulic steering cylinder rod end interchangeability,corrosiveness,preventive maintenance,and the risks associated with
