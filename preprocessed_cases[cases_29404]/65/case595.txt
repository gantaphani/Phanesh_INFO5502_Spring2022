factual and procedural backgrounda.the complaint 
brenton complaint alleged she consumed the product in accordance with the use instructions for a few months before she suffered a psychotic breakdown in june,and that her injuries were caused by the effects of ingredients including ephedrine contained in the product.brenton pleaded causes of action for product liability,negligence,breach of express and implied warranty and fraud,and sought compensatory and punitive damages.she also alleged that mii false advertising for and misbranding of the product violated business and professions code sections and and sought the remedies provided by those statutes 
b.the motion 
mii moved to strike the complaint under the statute.mii argued brenton complaint targeted mii commercial speech,which can qualify for first amendment protection see generally.pharmacy bd.consumer council,d gerawan farming,lyons cal th,d,mii noted that the complaint was replete with allegations referring to mii labeling of and marketing for the product,and each of the discrete causes of action contained at least one express or implied reference to this commercial speech.mii argued that because brenton causes of action arose out of protected speech,the burden shifted to brenton to show a reasonable probability of success on the merits.
brenton opposed the motion to strike,arguing that mii could not meet the threshold burden to show her claims were within the ambit of the statute because her claims were not based on conduct protected by the first amendment.brenton also asserted that,even if the court deemed some or all of her claims to be within the ambit of the statute,she could show a reasonable probability of success on the merits the trial court denied mii motion,and we affirm

analysis of brenton individual claimsa.ambit of section 
the statute applies only to a cause of action arising from acts in furtherance of the defendant constitutional right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue,subd.b,and it is the defendant burden in an motion to initially show the suit is within the class of suits subject to a motion to strike under section.fox searchlight pictures,paladino th,d fox searchlight.in deciding whether the initial arising from requirement is met,a court considers the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts on which the liability or defense is based.navellier sletten cal th,d,navellier.
the courts have struggled to refine the boundaries of a cause of action that arises from protected activity.in city of cotati cashman cal th,d,the court explained that the statutory phrase cause of action arising from means simply that the defendant act underlying the plaintiff cause of action must itself have been an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.citation.in the context,the critical point is whether the plaintiff cause of action itself was based on an act in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech.second italics added.in navellier,the court cautioned that the statute definitional focus is not the form of the plaintiff cause of action but,rather,the defendant activity that gives rise to his or her asserted whether that activity constitutes protected speech or petitioning.navellier,supra,cal th at,d,original italics.accordingly,the arising from prong encompasses any action based on protected speech or petitioning activity as defined in the statute id.at,d,regardless of whether the plaintiff lawsuit was intended to chill equilon,supra,cal th at,d,or actually chilled cotati,supra,cal th at,d,the defendant protected conduct.
brenton individual claims 
the specific issue presented here is a recurring one whether a claim for physical injury against a manufacturer allegedly caused by use of its product,asserting theories of liability sounding in tort,contract and strict liability,is within the ambit of the statute merely because the manufacturer also engaged in commercial speech to market that product.although section,subdivision e specifies four categories of conduct that qualify for protection,mii argument relies on only two of those categories any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest subd.e and any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest subd.e.mii asserts its labeling of and advertising for the product constitute written statements made in a place open to the public in connection with an issue of public interest within the meaning of subdivision e,and there is widespread public interest in dietary supplements generally and in the product in particular.mii also asserts that its labeling of and advertising for the product are within the meaning of subdivision e because labels and advertisements are commercial speech entitled to first amendment protection and concern dietary supplements,an issue of public interest.
in martinez metabolife,th,d,this court determined,on facts substantively indistinguishable from the facts of this case,that a claim against a manufacturer for personal injuries to a consumer caused by a defective product can not be characterized as a claim premised on first amendment protected speech or conduct by the manufacturer within the meaning of the statute.martinez held that it is the principal thrust or gravamen of the plaintiff cause of action that determines whether the statute applies citation,and when the allegations referring to arguably protected activity are only incidental to a cause of action based essentially on nonprotected activity,collateral allusions to protected activity should not subject the cause of action to the statute.id.at,d,original italics.martinez concluded protected speech is not the gravamen or principal thrust of claims seeking recovery for personal injuries to a consumer caused by a defective product,even though commercial speech might be mentioned in the complaint,because such speech is largely unrelated to and entirely distinct from the wrongful,conduct on which plaintiffs claims are premised.ibid.
as in martinez,the core of the wrongful conduct alleged here is that mii manufactured and sold a defective product that caused brenton physical injuries,and the theories pleaded here as to brenton individual claims mirror those considered in martinez.other than its disagreement with the decision in martinez,mii articulates no principled reason that martinez should not control our decision on the applicability of the statute to brenton individual claims.we adhere to martinez and conclude brenton individual claims are not based on,and do not arise from,protected activity as defined by section,subdivision e.accordingly,the burden never shifted to brenton to demonstrate a probability she would prevail on her individual claims,and the trial court correctly denied mii motion as to benton individual claims.
analysis of brenton unfair practices claim 
brenton unfair practices claim stands on a significantly different footing from her individual claims.the gravamen of the wrongful,conduct by mii on which her unfair practices claim is based is mii commercial speech allegedly mii false advertising for and misbranding of the product.however,assuming a claim alleging unfair business practices based on advertising and labeling would previously have qualified for section s procedural protections compare dupont merck pharmaceutical superior court th,d with nagel twin laboratories,th,d,newly enacted section applies to the present case and removes brenton unfair business practices claim from the operation of section.
the legislature,based on its finding that there had been a disturbing abuse of section,subd.a,enacted section to limit the application of section.section,effective january,provides in part 
c section does not apply to any cause of action brought against a person primarily engaged in the business of selling or leasing goods or services,including,but not limited to,insurance,securities,or financial instruments,arising from any statement or conduct by that person if both of the following conditions exist 
the statement or conduct consists of representations of fact about that person or a business competitor business operations,goods,or services,that is made for the purpose of obtaining approval for,promoting,or securing sales or leases of,or commercial transactions in,the person goods or services,or the statement or conduct was made in the course of delivering the person goods or services.
the intended audience is an actual or potential buyer or customer,or a person likely to repeat the statement to,or otherwise influence,an actual or potential buyer or customer 
section,subdivision c appears to remove brenton unfair practices claim as well as her individual claims from the types of claims against which an motion can be filed.mii does not contest that application of subdivision c here would be fatal to its present motion.mii instead argues that application of section to this action would be an improper retroactive application of the statute,and in any event,section can not be applicable because it is unconstitutional.
b.the retrospectivity claim 
absent an express declaration of retrospectivity or other clear indication that the legislature intended retrospective application,a new statute is presumed to operate prospectively.tapia superior court cal d.because neither the text of section nor the legislative history contains an express indication that it was intended to have retrospective application,there is no basis to depart from the ordinary rule of construction that it was intended to operate prospectively.tapia,at.
however,t here remains the question of what the terms prospective and retrospective mean.tapia superior court,supra,cal d at.the courts have broadly distinguished between substantive and procedural statutes to assess whether applying a new statute would have improper retrospective application,and have declined to interpret a statute as having retrospective application when doing so would change the legal consequences of the parties past conduct.id.at.accordingly,if a statutory change is substantive because it would impose new,additional or different liabilities based on past conduct,courts are loath to interpret it as having retrospective application.id.at,see also landgraf usi film products,d every statute that takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws,or creates a new obligation,imposes a new duty,or attaches a new disability,in respect to transactions or considerations already past,must be deemed retrospective.
in contrast to changed substantive statutes,applying changed procedural statutes to the conduct of existing litigation,even though the litigation involves an underlying dispute that arose from conduct occurring before the effective date of the new statute,involves no improper retrospective application because the statute addresses conduct in the future.such a statute is not made retroactive merely because it draws upon facts existing prior to its enactment instead,t he effect of such statutes is actually prospective in nature since they relate to the procedure to be followed in the future.citation.for this reason,we have said that it is a misnomer to designate such statutes as having retrospective effect.citation.tapia superior court,supra,cal d at.as one court explained 
t he presumption against retrospective construction does not apply to statutes relating merely to remedies and modes of procedure.citation.p rocedural changes operate on existing causes of action and defenses,and it is a misnomer to designate them as having retrospective effect.citations.in other words,procedural statutes may become operative only when and if the procedure or remedy is invoked,and if the trial postdates the enactment,the statute operates in the future regardless of the time of occurrence of the events giving rise to the cause of action.citation.in such cases the statutory changes are said to apply not because they constitute an exception to the general rule of statutory construction,but because they are not in fact retrospective.there is then no problem as to whether the legislature intended the changes to operate retroactively.ara living,superior court th,d.
it is the effect of the law,not its form or label,that is important for purposes of this analysis.tapia superior court,supra,cal d at,moore state bd.of control th,d i t is not significant whether the statute is labeled substantive or procedural in nature.citation.rather,what is determinative is the effect that application of the statute would have on substantive rights and liabilities.the issue is whether applying section here would impose new,additional or different liabilities on mii based on mii past conduct,or whether it merely regulates the conduct of ongoing litigation.
section is properly characterized as a procedural statute applicable to pending actions.in robertson rodriguez th,d,the court applied tapia to conclude section could be invoked to strike a lawsuit filed before the effective date of the statute without implicating retrospectivity concerns,reasoning the statute is merely a procedural screening mechanism for determining whether a plaintiff can demonstrate sufficient facts to permit the matter to go to a trier of fact.robertson,at,d.section does nothing more than amend section to except certain claims from applicability of the statutorily conferred remedy of the screening mechanism provided by section section does not impose new,additional or different liabilities based on past conduct or deprive mii of any substantive defense to the action.where,as here,the legislature has conferred a remedy and withdraws it by amendment or repeal of the remedial statute,the new statutory scheme may be applied to pending actions without triggering retrospectivity concerns lemon los angeles ry.d,as a general rule,a cause of action or remedy dependent on a statute falls with a repeal of the statute,even after the action thereon is pending,in the absence of a saving clause in the repealing statute.citations.the justification for this rule is that all statutory remedies are pursued with full realization that the legislature may abolish the right at any time.callet alioto cal.mii acknowledges the numerous cases holding that when a remedial statute is amended or repealed before a final judgment is entered in the pending action,the court will apply the law in force at the time of the decision.lemon los angeles ry,supra,d,beckman thompson th,d south coast regional com.gordon d.chapman farr d.mii attempts to distinguish these cases because the statute on which it neither amended nor repealed instead,new section was added.however,
