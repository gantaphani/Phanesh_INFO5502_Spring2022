plaintiffs paul and eileen andrews seek reversal of the trial court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant foster wheeler llc foster wheeler.we affirm the trial court judgment because plaintiffs have not established a triable issue of fact regarding causation.
background 
in september,plaintiffs filed products liability claims in superior court in san francisco against dozens of manufacturers,suppliers,and contractors for allegedly causing the disease suffered by paul andrews andrews,then years old,as a result of exposure to asbestos during his years of employment.among other things,the complaint set forth a history of andrews work as a laborer,deckhand,and gunner mate for over years at multiple naval facilities and on naval vessels,including the uss brinkley bass brinkley bass.on october,plaintiffs filed an amendment to their complaint which identified foster wheeler as the entity sued under the fictitious name doe.
the trial court granted plaintiffs motion below for trial preference and scheduled a trial date for approximately nine months after the filing of the original complaint.foster wheeler obtained three relatively short trial continuances,and then moved for summary judgment.
in support of summary judgment,foster wheeler contended,based on two undisputed facts,that plaintiffs had no evidence that andrews was exposed to asbestos from any foster wheeler equipment.foster wheeler pointed out that andrews had admitted in deposition that he had no knowledge of foster wheeler,of having worked with or in the presence of anyone working with foster wheeler products,or of ever being exposed to asbestos as a result of any action by or interaction with foster wheeler.foster wheeler also contended as an undisputed fact that plaintiffs did not identify any facts supporting their claim in their answers to foster wheeler special interrogatories,which interrogatories sought all of plaintiffs knowledge about andrews exposure to asbestos from foster wheeler products.we provide the details of plaintiffs responses in the discussion,post.
in their opposition to foster wheeler summary judgment motion,plaintiffs relied on a handful of facts about the brinkley bass and two expert declarations,from charles ay and kenneth cohen,which we also detail further in the discussion.plaintiffs contended that andrews,as a result of visits to the brinkley bass boiler room after his arrival onboard in,had been exposed to asbestos fibers previously released into the air from gaskets in foster wheeler condensers and then into the air.
foster wheeler argued in its summary judgment motion reply that plaintiffs theory was speculative as a matter of law based on inadmissible evidence contained in ay and cohen expert declarations,which inadmissibility foster wheeler challenged with expert declarations of its own and failed to establish causation because the expert opinions lacked any reasoned explanation or factual basis.
the trial court granted summary judgment,finding that foster wheeler had met its initial burden of demonstrating that plaintiffs were not in possession of any evidence to support their claim,and that plaintiffs had failed to meet their burden of presenting admissible evidence that created a triable issue of fact.at hearing,the court stated the argument that given the unusual nature of asbestos fibers,some fibers from the original gasketing must necessarily have remained in the boiler room over the course of all of these overhauls,as a result of which andrews must have been exposed to fibers that are and years old that have been sitting there and sort of lurking in the machinery is,in this court view,unacceptably speculative.
this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred by failing to find that foster wheeler did not meet its initial burden of production of evidence in support of its summary judgment motion,and by improperly weighing the evidence each side submitted via expert declarations in the course of concluding that plaintiffs expert evidence was too speculative to support their claim.both arguments lack merit.
applicable legal standards 
the trial court summary judgment rulings are subject to de novo review.scheiding dinwiddie construction th,d scheiding.in performing our de novo review,we must view the evidence in a light favorable to plaintiff as the losing party citation,liberally,construing his evidentiary submission while strictly scrutinizing foster wheeler own showing,and resolving any evidentiary doubts or ambiguities in plaintiff favor.saelzler advanced group cal th,d.
a motion for summary judgment must be granted if all of the papers submitted show there is no triable issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.in determining whether the papers show there is no triable issue as to any material fact the court shall consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers,and all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence,subd.c.a defendant has met its burden of showing a cause of action has no merit if it has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established,or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.once the defendant has met that burden,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.the plaintiff may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings to show a triable issue of material fact exists but,instead,shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists,subd.o citations.scheiding,supra,th at,d.
as our supreme court has noted,s ummary judgment law in this state,however,continues to require a defendant moving for summary judgment to present evidence,and not simply point out that the plaintiff does not possess,and can not reasonably obtain,needed evidence.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,aguilar accord,saelzler advanced group,supra,cal th at,d,burden shifts to the opposing party upon a showing that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established.there is a triable issue of material fact if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.aguilar,at,d,fn.omitted.thus,the party moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact if he carries his burden of production,he causes a shift,and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact.ibid.circumstantial evidence supporting a defendant summary judgment motion can consist of factually devoid discovery responses from which an absence of evidence can be inferred,but the burden should not shift without stringent review of the direct,circumstantial and inferential evidence.scheiding,supra,th at,d.
to ultimately prevail in their underlying claim,plaintiffs would need to establish that andrews exposure to a product attributable to foster wheeler was to a reasonable medical probability a substantial factor in contributing to any disease suffered by him,pursuant to the standard of proof articulated in rutherford,cal th,d.see also lineaweaver plant insulation th,d discussing the substantial factor test with regard to claims involving asbestosis.relevant considerations include the f requency of exposure,regularity of exposure,and proximity of the asbestos product to plaintiff although these considerations should not be determinative in every case.citation.additional factors may also be significant in individual cases,such as the type of asbestos product to which plaintiff was exposed,the type of injury suffered by the plaintiff,and other possible sources of plaintiff injury.lineaweaver plant insulation,supra,th at,d.the substantial factor standard is a relatively broad one,requiring only that the contribution of the individual cause be more than negligible or theoretical.rutherford,supra,cal th at,d.
ii.foster wheeler met its initial burden of production 
we first examine plaintiffs contention that foster wheeler,as the defendant below,did not meet its initial burden of producing evidence sufficient to make a prima facie showing that plaintiffs can not establish causation.
we pick up where we left off in scheiding,supra,th,d,to analyze whether foster wheeler met its initial burden of production.in scheiding,we discussed the quantum of evidence a defendant must show when moving for summary judgment in order to shift the burden of production to the plaintiff.scheiding and his wife brought an action against hundreds of defendants following his diagnosis with asbestosis and pleural disease,alleging he had been injured from asbestos exposure during his work as a laborer and electrician.id.at,d.dinwiddie,allegedly liable as a general contractor at various jobsites during scheiding career,moved for summary judgment for lack of causation,and offered as support for its motion scheiding failure in deposition to identify any jobsite where dinwiddie was a general contractor.ibid.it was undisputed that neither dinwiddie nor any other defendant every asked scheiding to identify any jobsite where dinwiddie had been present.ibid.plaintiffs,rather than submit any evidence of causation,claimed that dinwiddie had not carried its statutory burden of showing that the element of causation could not be established.
this court agreed with the scheiding plaintiffs because no one had asked scheiding about dinwiddie role at any of his jobsites.as aguilar,supra,cal th,d,and saelzler advanced group,supra,cal th,d,later made clear,a defendant can not simply argue that a plaintiff lacks sufficient evidence to establish causation the defendant must make an affirmative showing that the plaintiff can not do so.while we acknowledged that circumstantial evidence supporting a defendant summary judgment motion can consist of factually devoid discovery responses from which an absence of evidence can be inferred,we also noted that the burden should not shift without stringent review of the direct,circumstantial and inferential evidence.scheiding,supra,th at,d.we found that it would be unreasonable to infer from this record that plaintiffs can produce no other evidence to link dinwiddie to scheiding illness.this record does not reflect whether any party ever asked scheiding specifically whether he had any information placing dinwiddie at any of his work sites w e can infer nothing at all with respect to questions which were neither asked nor answered.id.at,d.we held dinwiddie was not entitled to summary judgment in the absence of questions aimed specifically at the presence or absence of dinwiddie at jobsites it is entirely possible plaintiffs could have supplied further information concerning dinwiddie.id.at,d.
in scheiding,supra,th,d,we did not consider directly whether or not any particular response to a comprehensive discovery request was factually devoid.this is our focus in the present case.foster wheeler based its summary judgment motion on plaintiffs minimal discovery responses,contending both that its discovery,in the form of andrews deposition and special interrogatories,was comprehensive and that plaintiffs factually devoid responses indicated that they could not prove causation.plaintiffs contend that their discovery responses provided facts sufficient to require denial of summary judgment and,moreover,that these responses pointed to further discovery that foster wheeler should have pursued in order to meet its initial burden of production.as we discuss below,we conclude that foster wheeler is correct.
andrews deposition testimony 
andrews deposition testimony made clear that he had no knowledge himself that he was exposed to one of foster wheeler products.plaintiffs do not contend otherwise,but simply argue this testimony was not sufficient to conclude they could not ultimately obtain evidence necessary to prevail in their claim.this might be the case,if it were not for plaintiffs interrogatory answers.
plaintiffs special interrogatory answers 
foster wheeler propounded a series of special interrogatories which called for all facts regarding andrews exposure to asbestos from foster wheeler products.plaintiffs answers made clear that they did not have specific evidence of such an exposure.
foster wheeler special interrogatory asked plaintiffs to identify each fact in support of their contention that foster wheeler was liable to them as alleged in their complaint.in response,plaintiffs merely stated that andrews had during his working career been exposed to boilers manufactured,constructed,assembled,supplied distributed by foster wheeler as more fully described below.plaintiffs followed this statement with a list of a number of ships,including the brinkley bass,and two school districts,including the location of exposure and the exposure dates,which appeared to be nothing more than the jobsite locations and andrews dates of employment.this list was followed by a one paragraph description of plaintiffs job duties on these ships and at these school districts.despite plaintiffs initial qualification that andrews exposure to foster wheeler products was as more fully described below,they did not refer to any foster wheeler products in the remainder of their response,instead referring generally to andrews exposure knowledge of materials at various jobsites.with regard to the brinkley bass,plaintiffs stated 
plaintiff served aboard the uss brinkley bass,which he boarded at long beach naval shipyard,long beach,california.plaintiff recalls pipe covering on the steamlines.plaintiff visited shipmates in the boiler room.plaintiff recalls that the boiler was insulated inside and out with material.
this answer was insufficient to support a claim.it contains little more than general allegations against foster wheeler and does not state specific facts showing that andrews was actually exposed to material from foster wheeler products.
foster wheeler propounded other special interrogatories in its effort to obtain all of the facts known to plaintiffs regarding andrews exposure to foster wheeler products.plaintiffs provided little,if any,substantive information in reply.
for example,foster wheeler asked plaintiffs to state the basis for their contention that foster wheeler was liable to them as alleged in their complaint.plaintiffs answered by incorporating their answers to special interrogatory,and by repeating that during his work at the jobsites listed,andrews was exposed to foster wheeler boilers boiler components constructed,assembled,supplied distributed by defendant foster wheeler.
foster wheeler asked plaintiffs to identify for each exposure to an product manufactured by foster wheeler every fact,location,date,employer,and type of work or activity engaged in,and how the exposure occurred.in each case,plaintiffs simply referred to their answers to special interrogatory.
plaintiffs included the names of several people from the brinkley bass in response to an interrogatory calling for the identification of coworkers and supervisors during the times of each alleged exposure to andrews,and provided a list of depositions in other cases in response to an interrogatory calling for the identification of the depositions of individuals who had knowledge of relevant facts relating to each exposure.however,foster wheeler also asked plaintiffs to identify each person having knowledge of facts and the facts known regarding each asbestos exposure.rather than provide any facts known to these persons,plaintiffs merely referred to their list of coworkers and supervisors and their answer to special interrogatory.
foster wheeler asked plaintiffs to describe the physical appearance and packaging of each product of foster wheeler to which andrews was exposed.plaintiffs again relied entirely on their answer to special interrogatory without any further elaboration.
as can be seen by this review,plaintiffs answered comprehensive interrogatories by stating in effect that they had no specific facts supporting their claim against foster wheeler.furthermore,plaintiffs stated as part of their answer to interrogatory that they have no further information responsive to the interrogatory,an answer they incorporated into numerous other answers as well.
plaintiffs contend we should not draw an inference of completeness from foster wheeler discovery.they contend foster wheeler inaccurately portrayed their discovery responses,and fault foster wheeler for failing to refer to the elements of plaintiffs claim addressed by foster wheeler special interrogatories,or to the specific interrogatory answers that showed a lack of evidence.we find no merit in this contention.as we have discussed herein,plaintiffs discovery responses were devoid of material facts showing that andrews had been exposed to a foster wheeler product.foster wheeler was correct to cite to these interrogatory answers in support of its motion,as they are prima facie evidence that plaintiffs do not possess,and can not reasonably obtain,needed evidence to support their claim.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.
plaintiffs argue that their interrogatory answers did in fact present substantive evidence to support their claim.at oral argument before this court,plaintiffs counsel placed great emphasis on the list of persons plaintiffs had identified as having facts regarding andrews exposure to asbestos.counsel argued that the list constituted information so substantial that foster wheeler was not entitled to summary judgment,particularly because foster wheeler had not deposed these people and ascertained the information they may well have in support of plaintiffs claim.plaintiffs also argue that foster wheeler did not establish its discovery was sufficiently thorough because it did not refer below to plaintiffs extensive listing of depositions in other cases and documents in response to interrogatory,which called for all documents relating to alleged asbestos exposures.
plaintiffs arguments make little sense.plaintiffs lists of names,depositions,and documents do not raise disputed issues of material fact by themselves.this is particularly the case because plaintiffs did not provide any facts relating to andrews claimed asbestos exposure in response to foster wheeler comprehensive interrogatories,instead relying almost entirely on its restatement of its general allegations in interrogatory.either plaintiffs knew some additional material facts at the time that they responded to the interrogatories and chose not to disclose these facts in their interrogatory responses,or plaintiffs had no idea what additional facts were available,if any,from the people and documents listed.either way,plaintiffs arguments go against the reasoning of scheiding,supra,th,d.
scheiding presumed,as a matter of law,that plaintiffs responses to comprehensive discovery must fully disclose the evidence known to them at the time of their responses.parties have a duty to respond to discovery requests as completely and straightforwardly as possible given the information available to them.union bank superior court th,fn,d.when defendants conduct comprehensive discovery,plaintiffs can not play hide the ball.moreover,it is not reasonable for courts to infer pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision c,that defendants can discover further material facts from plaintiffs lists of people and documents if the plaintiffs do not disclose any facts known by such persons or contained in such documents when asked to do so.in moving for summary judgment,t he defendant may present evidence that the plaintiff does not possess,and can not reasonably obtain,needed through admissions by the plaintiff following extensive discovery to the effect that he has discovered nothing.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.if plaintiffs respond to comprehensive interrogatories seeking all known facts with boilerplate answers that restate their allegations,or simply provide laundry lists of people documents,the burden of production will almost certainly be shifted to them once defendants move for summary judgment and properly present plaintiffs factually devoid discovery responses 
in short,foster wheeler discovery was sufficiently comprehensive,and plaintiffs responses so devoid of facts,as to lead to the inference that plaintiffs could not prove causation upon a stringent review of the direct,circumstantial and inferential evidence contained in their interrogatory answers and deposition testimony.scheiding,supra,th at,d.foster wheeler met its initial burden of presenting evidence sufficient to make a prima facie showing that triable issue of fact did not exist regarding causation.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.therefore,the burden of production shifted to plaintiffs to establish a triable issue of fact regarding causation here 
iii.the trial court did not improperly weigh evidence 
plaintiffs expert evidence amounted to speculation 
plaintiffs first contend in effect that the trial court must have weighed the expert evidence submitted by the parties because their own expert evidence was rooted in fact rather than speculation.this is not the case.
the mere possibility of exposure does not create a triable issue of fact.mcgonnell kaiser gypsum th,d mcgonnell,citing aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.it is not enough to produce just some evidence.the evidence must be of sufficient quality to allow the trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion for summary judgment.ibid.notably,p laintiffs can not manufacture a triable issue of fact through use of an expert opinion with conclusions devoid of any basis,explanation or reasoning.id.at,d.a n expert opinion rendered without a reasoned explanation of why the underlying facts lead to the ultimate conclusion has no evidentiary value because an expert opinion is worth no more than the reasons and facts on which it is based.bushling fremont medical center th,d.
in their opposition to foster wheeler motion for summary judgment,plaintiffs did not contend that andrews had been exposed to asbestos from a foster wheeler boiler,as they had in their interrogatory answers.instead,relying on sparse facts and two expert declarations,they attempted to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether andrews had been exposed to asbestos fibers that had been released from gaskets in foster wheeler condensers during ship overhauls modernizations,and later into the ship air.
plaintiffs contended that during an overhaul of the brinkley bass at long beach,california,sometime between and,andrews,who had never worked with a foster wheeler product,had visited the boiler room and seen,replenishment and repair work,including work on the water and steam lines.he also had seen people carrying materials out of the boiler room that he described as raggedy dusty stuff.
plaintiffs also submitted a navy document,which stated that,in,some years before andrews had begun his service on the brinkley bass,four foster wheeler condensers had been installed in the ship boiler room.the document indicated that the ship had been overhauled,was soon due for another overhaul,and referred to an inspection of the condensers.
plaintiffs first expert was charles ay,an asbestos consultant certified by the state of california and the environmental protection agency to sample and evaluate airborne asbestos fibers.ay had worked from to as an insulator in the shipyard industry,including on the brinkley bass.he declared in a two and page declaration that,based on his personal knowledge,research and examination of the types of equipment found on naval ships,including the use of packing and gaskets as a means of preventing leakage in condensers,p acking and gaskets used in naval applications commonly contained asbestos from the until at least the early.ay continued
