background 
gregory and tracey cummings were involved in a car accident on the evening of september,in rural carter county,oklahoma.cummings was driving a pontiac grand am with his wife,tracey,in the front passenger seat.their children were in the back seat,with the in a car seat behind cummings.cummings ran a partially obscured stop sign at a intersection and drove off the road,through a ditch,and into a field.i.at.although the other passengers sustained only minor injuries,cummings sustained a compression fracture of the third vertebra resulting in paraplegia.i aplt.br.at.
the cummings brought this suit against gm,asserting that cummings sustained such severe injuries as a result of the design of the seat belt and the seat,as well as gm failure to warn.prior to trial,the parties engaged in multiple discovery disputes,including disputes over the adequacy of responses to requests for production,expert witness designations,depositions,and electronic discovery.see i.at.these disputes resulted in three motions to compel by the cummings and several motions for protective orders by gm.the magistrate judge addressed the majority of these disputes in an order dated june,in which the judge denied plaintiffs motions,granted defendant motions for protective orders,and granted defendant their attorney fees and costs.id.the district court reviewed the plaintiffs motions de novo and affirmed the magistrate findings in all respects.id.at.
at trial,gm countered the cummings claims with evidence that there was no defect in either the seat,the seat belt system,or the warning.see id.at.gm contended that cummings injuries resulted not from any defect,but rather from a combination of the forces exerted on her during the accident and her position and posture at the time of the accident.although the cummings offered evidence that cummings had her seat angled back approximately degrees,id.at,gm experts testified that she was most likely reclined at degrees at the time of the accident,id.at sitting slouched in the seat,id.at,turned to attend to the children in the back seat,i aplee.at.the cummings argued that such a conclusion was impossible because there was a child safety seat located behind cummings that prevented her from reclining her seat.gm offered evidence that the child seat was actually installed in a direction at the time of the accident,thus allowing the front passenger seat to recline.
at the close of all the evidence,out of the presence and hearing of the jury,both the cummings and gm moved for judgment as a matter of law.i.at.gm made its motion first,moving for judgment as a matter of law with regard to all claims,including the alleged defective seat,seat belt,failure to warn,and punitive damages claims.the cummings responded to gm contentions,and then the court directed them to make their motion for judgment as a matter of law.counsel for the cummings stated 
your honor,i would move for judgment as a matter of law on the foreseeable misuse or the misuse defense.throughout the trial we have had to listen to general motors accuse cummings of reclining the seat.i do need to tell your honor.your honor knows foreseeable misuse is not a defense.no one denies that this is foreseeable misuse of a seat.no one denies that they built the capability into the seat to do it.they knew the risk,that they knew people would be injured if they did that.no one whatsoever denies that in this trial.this jury should be instructed that reclining the seat is not a defense,and that if this defendant built a recliner seat that is dangerous,this defendant should be held legally responsible for the consequences.that the law in oklahoma.
id.at.the court denied both motions.
the jury returned a verdict for gm,finding gm not liable for any design defect or failure to warn.i aplee.at.the cummings failed to make any motions following the return of the verdict.id.at.the cummings filed a timely appeal,asserting that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law with regard to liability,and the trial court abused its discretion in its rulings on various discovery motions.
one month after the verdict,and after filing the appeal,the cummings discovered six videos of child safety seat acceleration tests conducted by gm and produced by gm in an unrelated trial.the videos show tests by gm involving dummies in child car seats placed in the back seat.in the videos,the children are thrown from the car seat during various accident simulations.the cummings argue the tests fall within their prior requests for production and would have demonstrated that it was impossible for cummings to have her seat fully reclined at the time of the accident,as their child would have been injured had the child been in a child restraint.
the cummings did not immediately move for relief upon discovery of the videos.instead,they waited seven months to file a motion for relief under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court,finding the motion both untimely and lacking in support,denied the motion,and the cummings appeal.the appeals have been consolidated and are addressed jointly below.
discussion 
preserving appellate review of sufficiency of the evidence 
the cummings assert the trial court erred in not granting judgment in their favor,arguing that the e vidence of defect and causation presented at trial entitled them to judgment as a matter of law.i aplt.br.at.gm contends that the cummings have failed to preserve this issue for appeal,stating the cummings moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of evidence only on the defense of product misuse and not on liability generally,and the cummings failed to renew their motion for judgment as a matter of law after the verdict.i aplee.br.at.
a party challenging the sufficiency of the evidence during a civil trial must make a motion for judgment as a matter of law before the case is submitted to the jury,in accordance with federal rule of civil procedure a.if,for any reason,the court does not grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law made at the close of all the evidence,the court is considered to have submitted the action to the jury subject to the court later deciding the legal questions raised by the motion.b.if the court denies the motion and submits the case to the jury,the party may nevertheless renew its motion after the verdict if the jury finds for the opposing party or fails to reach a verdict.id.
because a motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of evidence and following a verdict are closely intertwined,we consider both in turn.a motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the evidence,formerly referred to as a motion for a directed verdict,serves several purposes.anderson united.of,cir collecting cases.a motion under rule a protects the seventh amendment right to trial by jury.such a motion alerts the opposing party to any deficiencies in the case,thereby giving the party an opportunity to rectify any deficiencies prior to the case being submitted to the jury.id.a motion for judgment as a matter of law also alerts the court to a claim of insufficient evidence before the case is submitted to the jury so the court is not faced with such a claim after the fact when the court ability to address the motion is limited.id.finally,a motion at the close of evidence preserves the issue as a question of law for appeal.id.
these purposes are met when the moving party alerts the court and the opposing party to the insufficiency of the evidence prior to submission of the case to the jury.greenwood societe francaise de,cir.upon such a motion,the court may grant a directed verdict only if the evidence points but one way and is susceptible to no reasonable inferences which may support the opposing party position,with the evidence and inferences construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,hickerson,cir.on appeal,this court reviews de novo the district court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law,cadena pacesetter,cir,applying the same standard as applied in the district court,at.w e will reverse only if there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis with respect to a claim or defense under the controlling law.cadena,at internal quotations and citations omitted.
where a party fails to move for judgment as a matter of law before the close of the evidence,however,we have repeatedly held that such a failure bars appellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence.united pac.ins,cir green constr.power light,cir comcoa,nec,cir.the motion must also be sufficiently certain as to the issues raised.rule a requires that a motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the evidence specify the judgment sought and the law and the facts on which the moving party is entitled to the judgment.a.the motion must include all issues challenged,as the failure to move for a directed verdict now judgment as a matter of law on a particular issue will bar appellate review of that issue.davoll webb,cir.
when determining whether a particular issue has been raised in a motion for judgment as a matter of law,the court has liberally construed such motions,aguinaga united food commercial workers int l union,cir,stating that t echnical precision is not necessary in stating grounds for the motion so long as the trial court is aware of the movant position,united states fenix scisson,cir see also anderson,at.while technical precision is not required,merely moving for directed verdict is not sufficient to preserve any and all issues that could have been,but were not raised in the directed verdict motion.united int l holdings,wharf,cir.rule does require that the grounds for a motion be stated with sufficient certainty to apprise the court and opposing counsel of the movant position with respect to the motion.id.
in this case,the cummings moved for judgment as a matter of law with regard to the defense of misuse only and requested a jury instruction on this issue.counsel did not move for judgment as a matter of law with regard to gm liability generally.the cummings assert that the motion should be read liberally in accordance with aguinaga to include the issue of liability generally.although technical precision is not required,the moving party must adequately notify the court of the issues being raised in order to satisfy the purposes of the rule.the plaintiffs motion was limited to a motion for judgment as a matter of law on the issue of misuse,and therefore any appeal is so limited.see dilley supervalu,cir smith northwest fin.acceptance,cir united pac,at.beyond the issue of foreseeable misuse,we are limited to review for plain error constituting a miscarriage of justice.dilley,at quoting first sec.bank taylor,cir see also smith,at.
gm also asserts that the cummings failure to renew their motion after the verdict results in a waiver.while true in most circuits under tenth circuit precedent,even where a party fails to make a motion for judgment as a matter of law,it is not barred from appealing the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence,at least where an appropriate motion has been made prior to the submission of the case to the jury.see morrison knudsen fireman fund ins,cir holding such a failure does not bar appellant from appealing the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence marshall el paso natural gas,cir holding failure to move for judgment notwithstanding the verdict does not bar an appeal hansen vidal,cir holding motion for judgment as a matter of law not a condition precedent to appeal from a final judgment.thus the cummings failure to move for judgment as a matter of law following the adverse jury verdict does not bar their appeal regarding the sufficiency of the evidence to support the misuse defense.
in the absence of a rule b motion,however,we are limited in the relief we may grant.the supreme court has repeatedly noted that in the absence of a motion for judgment as a matter of law following an adverse jury verdict made in the trial court within ten days after reception of a verdict,rule b forbids the trial judge or an appellate court to enter such a judgment.johnson,at.see also globe liquor san roman.cone.pulp paper.holding appellate court is without power to direct the district court to enter judgment contrary to the one it had permitted to stand.thus,t his court has no authority to direct a verdict contrary to that of the trial court where,as here,the complaining party has not given the trial court an opportunity to first correct its own error.fortier dona anna plaza partners,cir.in this situation,the only remedy available is a new trial.johnson,at.morrison knudsen,at fortier,at.
as to whether the court should have granted the cummings judgment as a matter of law with regard to gm liability generally,because the cummings rule a motion was limited to the issue of gm misuse defense,we review the sufficiency of the evidence only for plain error constituting a miscarriage of justice.in addition,we are limited to determining whether a new trial is required,as we are without power to grant judgment in the cummings favor.as noted previously,judgment as a matter of law is appropriate only if the evidence points but one way and is susceptible to no reasonable inferences which may support the opposing party position.davis united states postal,cir internal quotations and citations omitted.this stringent standard of review is further heightened under plain error review,which has been limited to errors which seriously affect the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.dilley,at internal quotations and citations omitted.after a thorough review of the record in this case,we find nothing that rises to the level of such a miscarriage of justice.therefore we conclude the district court did not commit plain error in allowing the cummings products liability claims to go to the jury.
we review the district court denial of the cummings motion for judgment as a matter of law as to gm defense of misuse de novo,although as above noted we are limited to determining whether the cummings are entitled to a new trial.under oklahoma law,to establish a manufacturer product liability,a plaintiff must prove that the product was the cause of the injury,the defect existed in the product at the time the product left the manufacturer possession and control,and the defect made the article unreasonably dangerous.kirkland motors.however,where a plaintiff is using a product for a purpose for which it was not intended,and is injured,the plaintiff may not recover.id.at.misuse of a product is a defense subject to being pleaded and proved by defendant.stewart miller.abnormal or misuse of a product occurs where the method of using a product is not that which the maker intended or is a use that could not reasonably be anticipated by a manufacturer.treadway uniroyal tire.oklahoma has drawn a distinction between use for an abnormal purpose or misuse,and use for a proper purpose but in a careless manner.id.use for a proper purpose but in a careless manner is considered contributory negligence,and contributory negligence is not a defense to a products liability claim,fields volkswagen of.
although gm main defense was that there was no defect in the seat or seat restraint system,gm also asserted that cummings injuries may have resulted from either her posture or position at the time of the accident.gm presented evidence that cummings was reclined in her seat and that the injury resulted due to her position at the time of the accident.gm presented evidence of a warning in the owner manual against such use,which contained a picture of a person reclined and a warning that e ven if you buckle up,your safety belts ca do their job when you reclined like this.i.at.the experts testified that riding with the seat reclined was not an advised use of the seat given the warning and safety concerns,id.at,and that the seat reclined for uses while the car was parked rather than moving,id.at.the cummings countered with evidence that such a use was foreseeable by manufacturers.i aplee.at.the cummings own statements were that such a use was unsafe and that cummings would never ride in this position.id.at.
a motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the evidence may only be granted if the evidence points but one way and is susceptible to no reasonable inferences which may support the opposing party position,at.construing the evidence and inferences in the light most favorable to gm,and refraining from weighing the evidence,passing on the credibility of witnesses,or substituting our judgment for that of the jury,brown stores,cir,we find there was evidence supporting both parties positions,and consequently the court did not err in denying the motion for judgment as a matter of law and submitting the issue to the jury.
discovery rulings 
with regard to the cummings appeal of the trial court discovery rulings,we discern three main arguments gm failed to respond adequately to requests for discovery gm withheld names and locations of persons responsible for the design and implementation of the seat system and gm failed timely to produce research,development,and testing,including the failure to provide access to gm databases.i aplt.br.at.
the district court has broad discretion over the control of discovery,and we will not set aside discovery rulings absent an abuse of that discretion.gwn petroleum oil gas,cir.this standard of review applies equally to the denial of a motion to compel,motley marathon oil,cir noting a denial of a motion to compel discovery will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion,and the grant of a protective order,kidd taos ski valley,cir the decision of a district court to enter a protective order under rule c is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.under this standard,we will not disturb a trial court decision absent a definite and firm conviction that the lower court made a clear error of judgment or exceeded the bounds of permissible choice in the circumstances.id.internal quotations and citations omitted.such an abuse will occur only when the judge renders an arbitrary,capricious,whimsical,or manifestly unreasonable judgment.coletti cudd pressure control,cir internal quotations and citations omitted.
we do not find such an abuse of discretion in this case.the cummings assert that gm abused the discovery process and failed to adequately respond to discovery requests,yet they fail to point to anything in the record to support this proposition.we agree with the district court conclusion that numerous miscommunications and unnecessary disputes have been caused by plaintiffs failure to frame precise discovery requests and notices in accordance with the provisions of the rules.i.at.
we similarly find no support for the cummings assertion that gm failed to provide the names and locations of persons,including a zurkiwskyj,responsible for the design and implementation of the seat system.gm provided several representatives from the company to be deposed under rule b on the issues of the seat design,seat restraint system,and the design.i.at.the cummings can not place the blame on gm for their own failure to depose the designated representatives.
to the extent the cummings attempted to depose specific individuals,their service of notice to gm was in error.under federal rule of civil procedure b,a party may issue a notice of intent to take a deposition to an organization,and then the organization shall designate one or more officers,directors or managing agents,or other persons who consent to testify on its behalf.the corporate entity itself designates the representative.id.to the extent a party wants to subpoena an individual of its choice for a deposition,it must do so under rule a,which states that a party may take the testimony of any person,including a party,by deposition upon oral examination without leave of court.rule a allows the cummings to take the deposition of nonparty witnesses,including employees.except where the employee has been designated by the corporation under rule b,an employee is treated in the same way as any other witness.his or her presence must be obtained by subpoena rather than by notice wright,miller marcus,federal practice and procedure civ d.zurkiwskyj attendance must be compelled as any other nonparty subpoena.
the cummings reliance on rule is similarly misplaced.the magistrate ruled the newest version of rule would govern in this case,including the amendments,i.at,and the cummings did not object to this holding.under the amendments,a party initial disclosure obligation has been narrowed.advisory committee note,amends.rule a only requires automatic disclosure of the name and,if known,the address and telephone number of each individual likely to have discoverable information that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses.a a.under this rule,a party is not obligated to disclose witnesses or documents,whether favorable or unfavorable,that it does not intend to use.advisory committee note,see gluck ansett austl,holding under the new version of rule that the opposing party was not required to produce information with regard to potential witnesses because the essential inquiry is whether the disclosing party intends to use the witness.
finally,we find no abuse of discretion in the denial of the motion to compel access to gm databases and the grant of a protective order to gm.as noted by the magistrate judge,plaintiffs proposed computer database searches are overly broad in scope,duplicative of prior requests and unduly burdensome.i.at.it is the unusual or exceptional case where the reviewing court will vacate a protective order entered by a trial court under.c,in re coordinated pretrial proceedings in petroleum prods.antitrust,cir,and there is no support for such a conclusion in this case.rather than an abuse of discretion,the record reveals a thorough and reasoned disposition on the part of the court,especially given the multiple motions before the court and the breakdown of communication between the parties.
rule b motion 
federal rule of civil procedure b provides that o n motion and upon such terms as are just,the court may relieve a party or a party legal representative from a final judgment,order or proceeding for fraud,misrepresentation,or other misconduct of an adverse party.we review a district court denial of a rule b motion for an abuse of discretion.amoco oil epa,cir see also stubblefield windsor capital group,cir collecting cases.in undertaking such a review,we are guided by the principle that r elief under rule b is extraordinary and may only be granted in exceptional circumstances.bud brooks trucking,bill hodges trucking,cir.
timeliness of rule b motion 
in denying the cummings rule b motion,the district court relied in part on counsel delay in filing the motion.ii aplt,att.at.rule requires that such a motion be made within a reasonable time,and for reasons,and not more than one year after the judgment,order,or proceeding was entered or taken.b.because the cummings have argued misconduct under rule b,the motion must have been filed within a reasonable time,and not more than a year after the judgment.
the cummings filed the rule b motion within a year of the judgment.however,a motion is not timely merely because it has been filed within one year of the judgment.white am.airlines,cir.the cummings waited seven months after discovery of the tests to file the motion.this court has upheld several rule b denials based on delay where the motion was nevertheless filed prior to the one year d
