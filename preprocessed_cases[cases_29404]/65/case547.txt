we reverse the entry of summary judgment in favor of autoliv asp,autoliv.autoliv failed to provide any evidence negating the theory that the airbag it manufactured was defective under the theory of design defect.therefore,the summary adjudication of sister guadelupe gonzalez cause of action for strict products liability was error.the trial court correctly summarily adjudicated gonzalez remaining causes of action for negligent products liability and breach of warranty.
factual and procedural background 
on january,gonzalez,a passenger in a ford taurus,suffered injury to her right eye as a result of a car accident she sued the other driver,ford motor company,galpin ford and several doe defendants.autoliv eventually was named as doe and is the sole respondent in this appeal.autoliv manufactured the front airbag modules used in the ford taurus.
the complaint included causes of action for negligent and strict products liability and breach of warranty.gonzalez contends that the front airbag system in the vehicle was defectively manufactured or designed because the airbag allegedly deployed with excessive and dangerous force causing damage to plaintiff right eye.she also contends the airbag should not have deployed in the low speed collision.it is undisputed that t he front airbag module installed in the vehicle in this case fully deployed the cushion from the airbag module as it was designed and manufactured to do.
motion for summary judgment 
autoliv moved for summary judgment or alternatively for summary adjudication arguing as follows autoliv as a component part manufacturer is not liable for any design,manufacturing,or failure to warn defect in a finished product that autoliv did not design,manufacture,package,or sell the undisputed evidence establishes that autoliv component part is not defective and plaintiff has failed to produce sufficient evidence to create a triable issue of fact as to the existence of any defect in autoliv component part that caused her injury.
in its motion,autoliv further maintained that it did not manufacture the overall front airbag system used by ford but instead manufactured only the front airbag module.according to autoliv motion,a front airbag system contains components including sensors,a restraint control module rcm,and front airbag modules,among other components,all of which are assembled and installed into the vehicle the rcm controls when a front airbag will deploy.it processes information from the sensors in the vehicle and sends a deployment signal to a front airbag module when it receives information that a crash warranting front airbag deployment is occurring.airbag modules are designed to deploy only when a deployment signal is sent from the rcm to the module.the front airbag modules in the ford taurus vehicles contain,among other things,an initiator or squib,an inflator,and a textile bag or cushion.when an airbag module receives a signal to deploy from the rcm,the initiator generates the heat required to start a pyrotechnic reaction within the airbag module inflator,which in turn causes the cushion to inflate and deploy from the module.these facts were supported by russell gans declaration 
gans is the autoliv employee who coordinated with ford regarding airbag modules.to show that the airbag module was not defective,autoliv relied on gans declaration.he explained an airbag cushion is designed to deploy when,and only when,the squib activates the inflator after receiving a signal from the rcm.the photographs of the airbag cushions from the car gonzalez was riding in appear to depict a passenger side front airbag which has fully deployed from the airbag module.my observations from my physical inspection of the vehicle were consistent with a normal full deployment,and the quality records show that the modules manufactured during the same time frame as the subject module that were tested met all of ford specifications.gans continued i am not aware of an inflator deploying at a rate in excess of the manufacturing requirements during an accident that warranted an airbag deployment.moreover,there is no evidence that the airbag module at issue did not function properly during deployment or that the deployment rate speed exceeded ford specifications.
gans further stated that autoliv manufactured airbag modules for ford according to specifications provided by ford.autoliv then supplied the manufactured airbag modules to ford.autoliv was not involved in the installations of these modules into the vehicles.aside from manufacturing and supplying the front airbag modules,autoliv did not have any other involvement or responsibility with respect to the front airbag systems utilized in the ford taurus vehicles.gans declared that autoliv did not manufacture the overall front airbag system,did not test the overall system and did not install the system in the ford vehicles.
opposition to summary judgment 
gonzalez opposed summary judgment arguing that the airbag deployed in a manner which was unnecessarily and overly aggressive,which struck plaintiff right front head region and right eye,which was the cause of blindness in that eye.gonzalez opposition was supported by the declaration of theodore zinke.he stated at the time the ford taurus passenger airbag system was being engineered,autoliv knew or should have known that a phenomenon known as bag slap from a deploying airbag could cause eye injuries.defendant autoliv did not conform to prudent engineering practices by failing to consider the risk of eye injuries when designing,manufacturing and supplying the ford taurus passenger airbag module to defendant ford.a reasonably prudent airbag system design engineer would have evaluated the results of testing of the ford taurus passenger airbag system to determine whether the deploying bag would strike the passenger head in a potentially injurious manner.to date,plaintiff has received no evidence to suggest that such an appropriate evaluation was conducted during the design and testing of the ford taurus passenger airbag system.
the trial court adopted a judgment as proposed by autoliv.the court ruled that zinke declaration lacked foundation.
gonzalez timely appealed.
discussion 
strict products liability 
in their separate statements,the parties agree that plaintiff contends that the front airbag system in the vehicle was defectively manufactured or designed because the airbag allegedly deployed with excessive and dangerous force causing damage to plaintiff right eye.theodore zinke,gonzalez expert,concluded that autoliv failed to consider that bag slap from a deploying airbag could cause eye injuries and this risk could have been eliminated by the use of internal tethering,a fact autoliv challenges.
design defect 
a product is defective in design either if the product has failed to perform as safely as an ordinary consumer would expect when used in an intended or reasonably foreseeable manner,or if,in light of the relevant factors the benefits of the challenged design do not outweigh the risk of danger inherent in such design.barker lull engineering cal d,barker.i n evaluating the adequacy of a product design pursuant to this latter standard,a jury may consider,among other relevant factors,the gravity of the danger posed by the challenged design,the likelihood that such danger would occur,the mechanical feasibility of a safer alternative design,the financial cost of an improved design,and the adverse consequences to the product and to the consumer that would result from an alternative design.id.at.o nce the plaintiff makes a prima facie showing that the injury was proximately caused by the product design,the burden should appropriately shift to the defendant to prove,in light of the relevant factors,that the product is not defective.ibid.
these principles were applied in mccabe american honda motor th,d,a case similar to the present one.lucille mccabe sued honda,the manufacturer of the airbag in her honda civic,when the air bag failed to deploy in a collision.id.at,d.honda argued that the air bag performed in accordance with its intended design.id.at,d.honda expert opined that the air bag system performed as designed,and there was no evidence of a defect.id.at,d.the court reversed the entry of summary judgment in favor of honda because among other reasons honda failed to negate the risk benefit theory of design defect.ibid.the court held that even if honda demonstrated that the air bag performed under the circumstances of the crash in conformity with its design such evidence alone is not sufficient to negate mccabe theory that the design itself was defective under either the consumer expectation or theory.id.at,d.under the theory,mccabe need only show the design caused her injuries if so,the burden shifts to the defendant to prove the benefits of the design outweigh its inherent risks.id.at,d.the burden fell to honda even on summary judgment.id.at,d.
like the defendant in mccabe,autoliv argues that its airbag performed in accordance with its intended design and autoliv expert,gans,opined that the airbag performed as it was designed to do.specifically,gans concluded that it appears that the airbag module deployed as it was designed and manufactured to do.however,also like in mccabe,autoliv offered no evidence that the benefits of the design outweigh its inherent risks evidence necessary to show the absence of a design defect,a burden carried by the defendant where as in this case,gonzalez alleges strict products liability.
this conclusion is not altered by autoliv argument that it is a component manufacturer.a component part manufacturer that had no role in designing the finished product and who supplied a nondefective component part can not be held liable for the defective product.lee electric motor division d.a component seller who simply designs a component to its buyer specifications,and does not substantially participate in the integration of the component into the design of the product,is not liable artiglio general electric th,d,quoting rest d torts,com.e.however,a component part manufacturer may be held liable for damages caused by a component part which was defective at the time it left the component part manufacturer factory.wiler firestone tire rubber d.
the component manufacturer defense applies to generic or components,as opposed to those which are really a separate product with a specific purpose and use.citations.springmeyer ford motor th,d.t he policy reasons favoring strict products liability for component manufacturers are the same as for other participants in the general enterprise of manufacturing and marketing consumer goods,and these interests,including the incentives for improved product safety,outweigh the burden imposed by increased litigation.jimenez superior court cal th,d.thus,for example,the manufacturer of silicon could not be held liable for a design defect in silicon breast implants.artiglio general electric,supra,th at,d.the manufacturer of a motor could not be liable when a meat grinding machine containing the component motor injured the plaintiff.lee electric motor division,supra,d at.in contrast,a fan manufacturer could be held liable along with ford when the fan broke off the engine and injured the plaintiff.springmeyer ford motor,supra,th,d.
but the component manufacturer defense requires that the component part standing alone is not defective.t he manufacturer of a product component or ingredient is not liable for injuries caused by the finished product unless it appears that the component itself was defective when it left the manufacturer.fetzger th,d,italics added.autoliv argument that courts have refused to extend products liability to the manufacturer of a component part absent a showing of substantial participation in the integration of that component into the ultimate finished product requires that it have manufactured a component.
autoliv correctly points out that comment e to section of the restatement third of torts,products liability,page sometimes,restatement provides when the component seller is substantially involved in the integration of the component into the design of the integrated product,the component seller is subject to liability when the integration results in a defective product and the defect causes harm to the plaintiff.however,when considered in its entirety,the restatement does not support autoliv position.
the restatement section explains the refusal to impose liability on sellers of nondefective components is expressed in various ways,such as the raw material supplier defense or the bulk purchaser rule.however expressed,these formulations recognize that component sellers who do not participate in the integration of the component into the design of the product should not be liable merely because the integration of the component causes the product to become dangerously defective.this section subjects component sellers to liability when the components themselves are defective or when component providers substantially participate in the integration of components into the design of the other products.rest d torts,products liability,com.a,italics added.
the restatement further illustrates a defective component in which the component manufacturer may be held liable.for example,if motorcycle headlights intended for rugged use are so designed that they fail when the motorcycle is driven over bumpy roads,they are defective within the meaning of b.since reasonable alternative designs are available that prevent such foreseeable failures from occurring,the headlight supplier is subject to liability for harm caused by the defectively designed headlight.rest d torts,products liability,com.b.
section,subdivision b,provides a product is defective in design when foreseeable risks of harm posed by the product could have been reduced or avoided by the adoption of a reasonable alternative design by the seller or other distributor,or a predecessor in the commercial chain of distribution,and the omission of the alternative design renders the product not reasonably safe.rest d torts,products liability,subd.b.
taken together,section,subdivision b,and section of the restatement indicate that a component part manufacturer may be held liable for a defect in the component.when viewed in its entirety,the restatement does not support autoliv argument that o nly if the component part analysis establishes sufficient control over the design of the alleged defect should the component manufacturer be held to the standard of the test.instead,the test considering foreseeable risks of harm and alternative designs is applied to the component part manufacturer when the alleged defect is in the component.
for the same reason,the cases autoliv cites,which do not include an alleged defect in the component part,fail to show that the risk benefit test is inapplicable,as autoliv argues.for example,autoliv relies on wiler firestone tire rubber d,in which discovery showed no defects existed in a firestone tire.the car accident at issue in that case was caused by the valve stem manufactured and attached to it the tire by ford motor company.id.at.the appellate court affirmed the entry of summary judgment stating as plaintiffs evidence shows no defect in the component part,the tire,which was manufactured by firestone,it may not be held liable.id.at.the court reasoned in dealing with an automotive manufacturer which designs and produces automotive products,firestone could reasonably believe ford motor company would take appropriate measures to insure proper design and installation of the valve stem.accordingly,responsibility for the valve,as distinguished from the tire,rests with ford motor company and not firestone.id.at.
in lee electric motor division d,the appellate court affirmed summary judgment in favor of a component part manufacturer.the plaintiff was injured by a meat grinding machine and sued the manufacturer of the motor.the court found that there was no defect in the motor and the manufacturer of the motor had no role in designing the finished meat grinding machine.id.at.the evidence establishes that defendant had no role in the design of the machine,and that defendant reasonably relied on lasar to take appropriate measures to insure proper design and installation of the motor.we conclude that defendant manufacture or design
