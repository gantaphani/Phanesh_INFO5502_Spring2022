the national childhood vaccine injury act of ncvia or act created a compensation program to stabilize a vaccine market adversely affected by an increase in tort litigation and to facilitate compensation to claimants who found pursuing legitimate injuries too costly and difficult.the act provides that a party alleging a injury may file a petition for compensation in the court of federal claims,naming the health and human services secretary as the respondent that the court must resolve the case by a specified deadline and that the claimant can then decide whether to accept the court judgment or reject it and seek tort relief from the vaccine manufacturer.awards are paid out of a fund created by an excise tax on each vaccine dose.as a quid pro quo,manufacturers enjoy significant protections.most importantly,the act eliminates manufacturer liability for a vaccine unavoidable,adverse side effects.
hannah bruesewitz parents filed a petition in the court of federal claims,claiming that hannah became disabled after receiving a diphtheria,tetanus,and pertussis dtp vaccine manufactured by lederle laboratories now owned by respondent wyeth.after that court denied their claim,they elected to reject the unfavorable judgment and filed suit in pennsylvania state court,alleging,inter alia,that the defective design of lederle dtp vaccine caused hannah disabilities,and that lederle was subject to strict liability and liability for negligent design under pennsylvania common law.wyeth removed the suit to the federal district court.it granted wyeth summary judgment,holding that the relevant pennsylvania law was preempted by b,which provides that n o vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages arising from a injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after october,if the injury or death resulted from that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings.the third circuit affirmed.
held the ncvia preempts all claims against vaccine manufacturers brought by plaintiffs seeking compensation for injury or death caused by a vaccine side effects.
a section b text suggests that a vaccine design is not open to question in a tort action.if a manufacturer could be held liable for failure to use a different design,the even though clause would do no work.a vaccine side effect could always have been avoidable by use of a different vaccine not containing the harmful element.the language of the provision thus suggests the design is not subject to question in a tort action.what the statute establishes as a complete defense must be unavoidability given safe manufacture and warning with respect to the particular design.this conclusion is supported by the fact that,although law establishes three grounds for liability defective manufacture,inadequate directions or warnings,and defective design the act mentions only manufacture and warnings.it thus seems that the act failure to mention liability is by deliberate choice,not inadvertence.barnhart peabody coal.
b contrary to petitioners argument,there is no reason to believe that b term unavoidable is a term of art incorporating restatement second of torts,comment k,which exempts from strict liability rules unavoidably unsafe products.unavoidable is hardly a rarely used word,and cases interpreting comment k attach special significance only to the term unavoidably unsafe products,not the word unavoidable standing alone.moreover,reading the phrase side effects that were unavoidable to exempt injuries caused by flawed design would require treating even though as a coordinating conjunction linking independent ideas when it is a concessive,subordinating conjunction conveying that one clause weakens or qualifies the other.the canon against superfluity does not undermine this court interpretation because petitioners competing interpretation has superfluity problems of its own.
c the structure of the ncvia and of vaccine regulation in general reinforces what b text suggests.design defects do not merit a single mention in the act or in food and drug administration regulations that pervasively regulate the drug manufacturing process.this lack of guidance for design defects,combined with the extensive guidance for the two liability grounds specifically mentioned in the act,strongly suggests that design defects were not mentioned because they are not a basis for liability.the act mandates lead to the same conclusion.it provides for federal agency improvement of vaccine design and for federally prescribed compensation,which are other means for achieving the two beneficial effects of torts prompting the development of improved designs,and providing compensation for inflicted injuries.the act structural quid pro quo also leads to the same conclusion.the vaccine manufacturers fund an informal,efficient compensation program for vaccine injuries in exchange for avoiding costly tort litigation and the occasional disproportionate jury verdict.taxing their product to fund the compensation program,while leaving their liability for design defect virtually unaltered,would hardly coax them back into the market.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit 
justice scalia delivered the opinion of the court.
we consider whether a preemption provision enacted in the national childhood vaccine injury act of ncvia bars claims against vaccine manufacturers.
for the last years,vaccines have been subject to the same federal premarket approval process as prescription drugs,and compensation for injuries has been left largely to the states under that regime,the elimination of communicable diseases through vaccination became one of the greatest achievements of public health in the century but in the and vaccines became,one might say,victims of their own success.they had been so effective in preventing infectious diseases that the public became much less alarmed at the threat of those diseases and much more concerned with the risk of injury from the vaccines themselves 
much of the concern centered around vaccines against diphtheria,tetanus,and pertussis dtp,which were blamed for children disabilities and developmental delays.this led to a massive increase in tort litigation.whereas between and only nine suits were filed against dtp manufacturers,by the the suits numbered more than each year this destabilized the dtp vaccine market,causing two of the three domestic manufacturers to withdraw and the remaining manufacturer,lederle laboratories,estimated that its potential tort liability exceeded its annual sales by a factor of vaccine shortages arose when lederle had production problems in 
despite the large number of suits,there were many complaints that obtaining compensation for legitimate injuries was too costly and difficult a significant number of parents were already declining vaccination for their children and concerns about compensation threatened to depress vaccination rates even further this was a source of concern to public health officials,since vaccines are effective in preventing outbreaks of disease only if a large percentage of the population is vaccinated 
to stabilize the vaccine market and facilitate compensation,congress enacted the ncvia in.the act establishes a compensation program designed to work faster and with greater ease than the civil tort system.shalala whitecotton.a person injured by a vaccine,or his legal guardian,may file a petition for compensation in the united states court of federal claims,naming the secretary of health and human services as the respondent a special master then makes an informal adjudication of the petition within except for two limited exceptions days the court of federal claims must review objections to the special master decision and enter final judgment under a similarly tight statutory deadline at that point,a claimant has two options to accept the court judgment and forgo a traditional tort suit for damages,or to reject the judgment and seek tort relief from the vaccine manufacturer fast,informal adjudication is made possible by the act vaccine injury table,which lists the vaccines covered under the act describes each vaccine compensable,adverse side effects and indicates how soon after vaccination those side effects should first manifest themselves claimants who show that a listed injury first manifested itself at the appropriate time are prima facie entitled to compensation no showing of causation is necessary the secretary bears the burden of disproving causation a claimant may also recover for unlisted side effects,and for listed side effects that occur at times other than those specified in the table,but for those the claimant must prove causation unlike in tort suits,claimants under the act are not required to show that the administered vaccine was defectively manufactured,labeled,or designed.
successful claimants receive compensation for medical,rehabilitation,counseling,special education,and vocational training expenses diminished earning capacity pain and suffering and for deaths attorney fees are provided,not only for successful cases,but even for unsuccessful claims that are not frivolous these awards are paid out of a fund created by an excise tax on each vaccine dose 
the quid pro quo for this,designed to stabilize the vaccine market,was the provision of significant protections for vaccine manufacturers.the act requires claimants to seek relief through the compensation program before filing suit for more than manufacturers are generally immunized from liability for failure to warn if they have complied with all regulatory requirements including but not limited to warning requirements and have given the warning either to the claimant or the claimant physician they are immunized from liability for punitive damages absent failure to comply with regulatory requirements,fraud,intentional and wrongful withholding of information,or other criminal or illegal activity.and most relevant to the present case,the act expressly eliminates liability for a vaccine unavoidable,adverse side effects 
no vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages arising from a injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after october,if the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings.
the vaccine at issue here is a dtp vaccine manufactured by lederle laboratories.it first received federal approval in and received supplemental approvals in and.respondent wyeth purchased lederle in and stopped manufacturing the vaccine in.
hannah bruesewitz was born on october.her pediatrician administered doses of the dtp vaccine according to the center for disease control recommended childhood immunization schedule.within hours of her april vaccination,hannah started to experience seizures she suffered over seizures during the next month,and her doctors eventually diagnosed her with residual seizure disorder and developmental delay.hannah,now a teenager,is still diagnosed with both conditions.
in april,hannah parents,russell and robalee bruesewitz,filed a vaccine injury petition in the united states court of federal claims,alleging that hannah suffered from residual seizure disorder and encephalopathy injuries a special master denied their claims on various grounds,though they were awarded in attorney fees and costs.the bruesewitzes elected to reject the unfavorable judgment,and in october filed this lawsuit in pennsylvania state court.their complaint alleged as relevant here that defective design of lederle dtp vaccine caused hannah disabilities,and that lederle was subject to strict liability,and liability for negligent design,under pennsylvania common law 
wyeth removed the suit to the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania,which granted wyeth summary judgment on the and negligence claims,holding that the pennsylvania law providing those causes of action was preempted by b the united states court of appeals for the third circuit affirmed we granted certiorari.
we set forth again the statutory text at issue 
no vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages arising from a injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after october,if the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings.
the even though clause clarifies the word that precedes it.it delineates the preventative measures that a vaccine manufacturer must have taken for a to be considered unavoidable under the statute.provided that there was proper manufacture and warning,any remaining side effects,including those resulting from design defects,are deemed to have been unavoidable.claims are therefore preempted.
if a manufacturer could be held liable for failure to use a different design,the word unavoidable would do no work.a side effect of a vaccine could always have been avoidable by use of a differently designed vaccine not containing the harmful element.the language of the provision thus suggests that the design of the vaccine is a given,not subject to question in the tort action.what the statute establishes as a complete defense must be unavoidability given safe manufacture and warning with respect to the particular design.which plainly implies that the design itself is not open to question 
a further textual indication leads to the same conclusion.law establishes a classic and well known triumvirate of grounds for liability defective manufacture,inadequate directions or warnings,and defective design if all three were intended to be preserved,it would be strange to mention specifically only two,and leave the third to implication.it would have been much easier and much more natural to provide that manufacturers would be liable for defective manufacture,defective directions or warning,and defective design.it seems that the statute fails to mention liability by deliberate choice,not inadvertence.barnhart peabody coal.expressio unius,exclusio alterius.
the dissent principal textual argument is mistaken.we agree with its premise that side effects that were unavoidable must refer to side effects caused by a vaccine design.we do not comprehend,however,the second step of its reasoning,which is that the use of the conditional term if in the introductory phrase if the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable plainly implies that some side effects stemming from a vaccine design are unavoidable,while others are avoidable.that is not so.the if clause makes total sense whether the design to which unavoidable refers is as the dissent believes any feasible design making the side effects of the design used for the vaccine at issue avoidable,or as we believe the particular design used for the vaccine at issue making its side effects unavoidable.under the latter view,the condition established by the if clause is that the vaccine have been properly labeled and manufactured and under the former,that it have been properly designed,labeled,and manufactured.neither view renders the if clause a nullity.which of the two variants must be preferred is addressed by our textual analysis,and is in no way determined by the if clause.
petitioners and the dissent textual argument also rests upon the proposition that the word unavoidable in b is a term of art that incorporates comment k to restatement second of torts the restatement generally holds a manufacturer strictly liable for harm to person or property caused by any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user.comment k exempts from this rule unavoidably unsafe products.an unavoidably unsafe product is defined by a of criteria and a few examples,such as the pasteur rabies vaccine and experimental pharmaceuticals.despite this lack of clarity,petitioners seize upon one phrase in the comment k analysis,and assert that by a majority of courts had made this a sine qua non requirement for an unavoidably unsafe product a showing that the product was quite incapable of being made safer for its intended use.
we have no need to consider the finer points of comment whatever consistent judicial gloss that comment may have been given in,there is no reason to believe that b was invoking it.the comment creates a special category of unavoidably unsafe products,while the statute refers to side effects that were unavoidable.that the latter uses the adjective unavoidable and the former the adverb unavoidably does not establish that congress had comment k in mind.unavoidable is hardly a rarely used word.even the cases petitioners cite as putting a definitive gloss on comment k use the precise phrase unavoidably unsafe product none attaches special significance to the term unavoidable standing alone.
the textual problems with petitioners interpretation do not end there.the phrase even though in the clause even though the vaccine was properly prepared and labeled is meant to signal the unexpected unavoidable side effects persist despite best manufacturing and labeling practices but petitioners reading eliminates any opposition between the even though clause called a concessive subordinate clause by grammarians and the word unavoidable.their reading makes preemption turn equally on unavoidability,proper preparation,and proper labeling.thus,the dissent twice refers to the requirements of proper preparation and proper labeling as two additional prerequisites for preemption independent of unavoidability the primary textual justification for the dissent position depends on that independence but linking independent ideas is the job of a coordinating junction like and,not a subordinating junction like even though.
petitioners and the dissent contend that the interpretation we propose would render part of b superfluous congress could have more tersely and more clearly preempted claims by barring liability if the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings.the intervening passage the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though is unnecessary.true enough.but the rule against giving a portion of text an interpretation which renders it superfluous does not prescribe that a passage which could have been more terse does not mean what it says.the rule applies only if verbosity and prolixity can be eliminated by giving the offending passage,or the remainder of the text,a competing interpretation.that is not the case here to be sure,petitioners and the dissent interpretation gives independent meaning to the intervening passage the supposed meaning of comment k but it does so only at the expense of rendering the remainder of the provision superfluous.since a vaccine is not quite incapable of being made safer for its intended use if manufacturing defects could have been eliminated or better warnings provided,the entire even though clause is a useless appendage it would suffice to say if the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable full stop.
the structure of the ncvia and of vaccine regulation in general reinforces what the text of b suggests.a vaccine license spells out the manufacturing method that must be followed and the directions and warnings that must accompany the product manufacturers ordinarily must obtain the food and drug administration fda approval before modifying either deviations from the license thus provide objective evidence of manufacturing defects or inadequate warnings.further objective evidence comes from the fda regulations more than of that pervasively regulate the manufacturing process,down to the requirements for plumbing and ventilation systems at each manufacturing facility material noncompliance with any one of them,or with any other fda regulation,could cost the manufacturer its defense 
design defects,in contrast,do not merit a single mention in the ncvia or the fda regulations.indeed,the fda has never even spelled out in regulations the criteria it uses to decide whether a vaccine is safe and effective for its intended use and the decision is surely not an easy one.drug manufacturers often could trade a little less efficacy for a little more safety,but the safest design is not always the best one.striking the right balance between safety and efficacy is especially difficult with respect to vaccines,which affect public as well as individual health.yet the act,which in every other respect micromanages manufacturers,is silent on how to evaluate competing designs.are manufacturers liable only for failing to employ an alternative design that the fda has approved for distribution an approval it takes years to or does it suffice that a vaccine design has been approved in other countries or could there be liability for failure to use a design that exists only in a lab neither the act nor the fda regulations provide an answer,leaving the universe of alternative designs to be limited only by an expert imagination.
jurors,of course,often decide similar questions with little guidance,and we do not suggest that the absence of guidance alone suggests preemption.but the lack of guidance for design defects combined with the extensive guidance for the two grounds of liability specifically mentioned in the act strongly suggests that design defects were not mentioned because they are not a basis for liability.
the mandates contained in the act lead to the same conclusion.torts,broadly speaking,have two beneficial effects prompting the development of improved designs,and providing compensation for inflicted injuries.the ncvia provides other means for achieving both effects.we have already discussed the act generous compensation scheme.and the act provides many means of improving vaccine design.it directs the secretary of health and human services to promote the development of childhood vaccines that result in fewer and less serious adverse reactions.it establishes a national vaccine program,whose director is to achieve optimal prevention of human infectious diseases and to achieve optimal prevention against adverse reactions.the program is to set priorities for federal vaccine research,and to coordinate federal vaccine safety and efficacy testing the act requires vaccine manufacturers and providers to report adverse side effects and provides for monitoring of vaccine safety through a collaboration with eight organizations and of course whenever the fda concludes that a vaccine is unsafe,it may revoke the license 
these provisions for federal agency improvement of vaccine design,and for federally prescribed compensation,once again suggest that b silence regarding liability was not inadvertent.it instead reflects a sensible choice to leave complex epidemiological judgments about vaccine design to the fda and the national vaccine program rather than juries 
and finally,the act structural quid pro quo leads to the same conclusion the vaccine manufacturers fund from their sales an informal,efficient compensation program for vaccine injuries in exchange they avoid costly tort litigation and the occasional disproportionate jury verdict but allegations are the most speculative and difficult type of products liability claim to litigate.taxing vaccine manufacturers product to fund the compensation program,while leaving their liability for design defect virtually unaltered,would hardly coax manufacturers back into the market.
the dissent believes the act mandates are irrelevant because they do not spur innovation in precisely the same way as tort systems that is a novel suggestion.although we previously have expressed doubt that congress would quietly preempt claims without providing a federal substitute,see medtronic,lohr,plurality opinion,we have never suggested we would be skeptical of preemption unless the congressional substitute operated like the tort system.we decline to adopt that stance today.the dissent belief that the fda and the national vaccine program can not alone spur adequate vaccine innovation is probably questionable,but surely beside the point.
since our interpretation of b is the only interpretation supported by the text and structure of the ncvia,even those of us who believe legislative history is a legitimate tool of statutory interpretation have no need to resort to it.in any case,the dissent contention that it would contradict our conclusion is mistaken.
the dissent legislative history relies on the following syllogism a house committee report states that b sets forth the principle contained in comment k of section of the restatement of torts second in comment k was commonly understood to require a showing that no feasible alternative design existed congress therefore must have intended b to require that showing the syllogism ignores unhelpful statements in the report and relies upon a term of art that did not exist in.
immediately after the language quoted by the dissent,the report notes the difficulty a jury would have in faithfully assessing whether a feasible alternative design exists when an innocent young child,often badly injured or killed is the plaintiff eliminating that concern is why the report authors strongly believ e that comment k is appropriate and necessary as the policy for civil actions seeking damages in tort.the dissent interpretation of b and its version of the principle in comment k adopted by the report leave that concern unaddressed.
the dissent buries another unfavorable piece of legislative history.because the report believes that b should incorporate the principle in comment k and because the act provides a generous compensation scheme,the report counsels injured parties who can not prove a manufacturing or labeling defect to pursue recompense in the compensation system,not the tort system.that counsel echoes our interpretation of b.
not to worry,the dissent retorts,a committee report by a later congress authoritative ly vindicates its interpretation legislative history a contradiction in terms is not a legitimate tool of statutory interpretation.see jones united states,united states mine workers.real legislative history is persuasive to some because it is thought to shed light on what legislators understood an ambiguous statutory text to mean when they voted to enact it into law.see exxon mobil allapattah services.but legislative history by definition could have had no effect on the congressional vote,district of columbia heller.
it does not matter that b did not take effect until the later congress passed the excise tax that funds the compensation scheme and that the supposedly dispositive committee report is attached to that funding legislation those who voted on the relevant statutory language were not necessarily the same persons who crafted the statements in the later committee report or if they were did not necessarily have the same views at that earlier time and no one voting at that earlier time could possibly have been informed by those later statements.permitting the legislative history of subsequent funding legislation to alter the meaning of a statute would set a dangerous precedent.many provisions of federal law depend on appropriations or include sunset provisions they can not be made the device for unenacted statutory revision.
that brings us to the second flaw in the dissent syllogism comment k did not have a commonly understood meaning in the.some courts thought it required a showing that a product was unavoidably unsafe many others thought it categorically exempted certain types of products from strict liability when all or nearly all of the relevant judicial decisions have given a term or concept a consistent judicial gloss,we presume congress intended the term or concept to have that meaning when it incorporated it into a statute.merck reynolds,scalia,concurring in part and concurring in judgment slip,at.the consistent gloss represents the public understanding of the term.we can not make the same assumption when widespread disagreement exists among the lower courts.we must make do with giving the term its most plausible meaning using the traditional tools of statutory interpretation.that is what we have done today.
for the foregoing reasons,we hold that the national childhood vaccine injury act preempts all claims against vaccine manufacturers brought by plaintiffs who seek compensation for injury or death caused by vaccine side effects.the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.
it is so ordered.

i join the court judgment and opinion.in my view,the court has the better of the purely textual argument.but the textual question considered alone is a close one.hence,like the dissent,i would look to other sources,including legislative history,statutory purpose,and the views of the federal administrative agency,here supported by expert medical opinion.unlike the dissent,however,i believe these other sources reinforce the court conclusion.
house committee report contains an authoritative account of congress intent in drafting the clause of the national childhood vaccine injury act of ncvia or act.see garcia united states,t he authoritative source for finding the legislature intent lies in the committee reports on the bill that report says that,if persons 
can not demonstrate under applicable law either that a vaccine was improperly prepared or that it was accompanied by improper directions or inadequate warnings they should pursue recompense in the compensation system,not the tort system.pt,hereinafter.
the report lists two specific kinds of tort suits that the clause does not suits based on improper manufacturing and improper labeling,while going on to state that compensation for other tort claims,claims,lies in the ncvia compensation system,not the tort system.ibid.
the strongest contrary argument rests upon the report earlier description of the statute as set ting forth the principle contained in comment k of the restatement second of torts strict liability section,that a vaccine manufacturer should not be liable for injuries or deaths resulting from unavoidable side effects.at emphasis added.but the appearance of the word unavoidable in this sentence can not provide petitioners with much help.that is because nothing in the report suggests that the statute means the word unavoidable to summon up an otherwise unmentioned third exception encompassing suits based on design defects.nor can the report reference to comment k fill the gap.the report itself refers,not to comment k details,but only to its principle,namely,that vaccine manufacturers should not be held liable for unavoidable injuries.it says nothing at all about who judge,jury,or federal safety agency should decide whether a safer vaccine could have been designed.indeed,at the time congress wrote this report,different state courts had come to very different conclusions about that matter.see cupp,rethinking conscious design liability for prescription drugs the restatement third standard versus a negligence approach,geo,c ourts had adopted a broad range of conflicting interpretations of comment k.neither the word unavoidable nor the phrase the principle of comment k tells us which courts view congress intended to adopt.silence can not tell us to follow those states where juries decided the question.
the legislative history describes the statute more generally as trying to protect the lives of children,in part by ending the instability and unpredictability of the childhood vaccine market.at see ante,at.as the committee report makes clear,routine vaccination is one of the most spectacularly effective public health initiatives this country has ever undertaken.at.before the development of routine whooping cough vaccination,for example,nearly all children in the united states caught the disease and more than people died annually,most of them infants.of health and human services,centers for disease control and prevention,what would happen if we stopped vaccinations all internet materials as visited,and available in clerk of court case file preventing tetanus,diphtheria,and pertussis among adolescents use of tetanus toxoid,reduced diptheria toxoid and acellular pertussis vaccines,morbidity and mortality weekly report,no,hereinafter preventing tetanus statistics for,of health and human services,centers for disease control and prevention,epidemiology and prevention of diseases ed.may.after vaccination became common,the number of annual cases of whooping cough declined from over to about,and the number of deaths from about to about.preventing tetanus childhood immunizations,house committee on energy and commerce,comm.print hereinafter childhood immunizations.
but these gains are fragile t he causative agents for these preventable childhood illnesses are ever present in the environment,waiting for the opportunity to attack the unprotected individual.hearing on before the senate committee on labor and human resources,pt,hereinafter hearings testimony of the american academy of pediatrics see california of public health,pertussis report,in,people in california caught whooping cough,and infants died.even a brief period when vaccination programs are disrupted can lead to children deaths.hearings see gangarosa et,impact of movements on pertussis control the untold story,lancet,when vaccination programs are disrupted,the number of cases of whooping cough skyrockets,increasing by orders of magnitude.
in considering the ncvia,congress found that a sharp increase in tort suits brought against whooping cough and other vaccine manufacturers between and had prompted manufacturers to question their continued participation in the vaccine market.at childhood immunizations.indeed,two whooping cough vaccine manufacturers withdrew from the market,and other vaccine manufacturers,fac ing great difficulty in obtaining product liability insurance,told congress that they were considering a similar course of action.at childhood immunizations.the committee report explains that,since there were only one or two manufacturers of many childhood vaccines,t he loss of any of the existing manufacturers of childhood vaccines could create a genuine public health hazard it would present the very real possibility of vaccine shortages,and,in turn,increasing numbers of unimmunized children,and,perhaps,a resurgence of preventable diseases.at.at the same time,congress sought to provide generous compensation to those whom vaccines injured as determined by an expert compensation program,at.
given these broad general purposes,to read the clause as preserving suits seems anomalous.the department of health and human services hhs decides when a vaccine is safe enough to be licensed and which licensed vaccines,with which associated injuries,should be placed on the vaccine injury table.ante,at a comprehensive review of federal vaccine safety programs and public health activities.a special master in the act compensation program determines whether someone has suffered an injury listed on the injury table and,if not,whether the vaccine nonetheless caused the injury.ante,at.to allow a jury in effect to those determinations is to substitute less expert for more expert judgment,thereby threatening manufacturers with liability indeed,strict liability in instances where any conflict between experts and nonexperts is likely to be particularly severe instances where congress intended the contrary.that is because potential tort plaintiffs are unlikely to bring suit unless the specialized compensation program has determined that they are not entitled to compensation say,because it concludes that the vaccine did not cause the injury.brief for united states as amicus curiae of successful compensation program claimants have accepted their awards,foregoing any tort remedies against vaccine manufacturers it is difficult to reconcile these potential conflicts and the resulting tort liabilities with a statute that seeks to diminish manufacturers product liability while simultaneously augmenting the role of experts in making compensation decisions.
the united states,reflecting the views of hhs,urges the court to read the act as i and the majority would do.it notes that the compensation program listed vaccines have survived rigorous administrative safety review.it says that to read the act as permitting lawsuits could lead to a recurrence of exactly the crisis that precipitated the act,namely withdrawals of vaccines or vaccine manufacturers from the market,disserv ing the act central purposes,and hampering the ability of the agency expert regulators,in conjunction with the medical community,to control the availability and withdrawal of a given vaccine.brief for united states as amicus curiae.
the united states is supported in this claim by leading public health organizations,including the american academy of pediatrics,the american academy of family physicians,the american college of preventive medicine,the american public health association,the american medical association,the march of dimes foundation,the pediatric infectious diseases society,and other similar organizations.brief for american academy of pediatrics et as amici curiae hereinafter aap brief.the american academy of pediatrics has also supported the retention of vaccine manufacturer tort liability provided that federal law structured liability conditions in ways that would take proper account of federal agency views about safety.hearings.but it nonetheless tells us here,in respect to the specific question before us,that the petitioners interpretation of the act would undermine its basic purposes by threatening to halt the future production and development of childhood vaccines in this country,by threaten ing a resurgence of the very problems which caused congress to intervene by enacting this statute.aap brief internal quotation marks omitted.
i would give significant weight to the views of hhs.the law charges hhs with responsibility for overseeing vaccine production and safety.it is likely to have a thorough understanding of the complicated and technical subject matter of immunization policy,and it is comparatively more qualified to comprehend the likely impact of state requirements.geier american honda motor,internal quotation marks omitted see medtronic,lohr,breyer,concurring in part and concurring in judgment the agency is in the best position to determine whether or the extent to which state requirements may interfere with federal objectives hhs position is particularly persuasive here because expert public health organizations support its views and the matter concerns a medical and scientific question of great importance how best to save the lives of children.see skidmore swift.
in sum,congressional reports and history,the statute basic purpose as revealed by that history,and the views of the expert agency along with those of relevant medical and scientific associations,all support the court conclusions.i consequently agree with the court.

vaccine manufacturers have long been subject to a legal duty,rooted in basic principles of products liability law,to improve the designs of their vaccines in light of advances in science and technology.until today,that duty was enforceable through a traditional tort action for defective design.in holding that b of the national childhood vaccine injury act of vaccine act or act,b,all design defect claims for injuries stemming from vaccines covered under the act,the court imposes its own bare policy preference over the considered judgment of congress.in doing so,the court excises words from the statutory text,misconstrues the act legislative history,and disturbs the careful balance congress struck between compensating children and stabilizing the childhood vaccine market.its decision leaves a regulatory vacuum in which no one ensures that vaccine manufacturers adequately take account of scientific and technological advancements when designing or distributing their products.because nothing in the text,structure,or legislative history of the vaccine act remotely suggests that congress intended such a result,i respectfully dissent.
section of the vaccine act provides s tandards of responsibility to govern civil actions against vaccine manufacturers.section a sets forth the g eneral rule that state law shall apply to a civil action brought for damages for a injury or death.a.this baseline rule that state law applies is subject to three narrow exceptions,one of which,b,is at issue in this case.section b provides 
no vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages arising from a injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after october,if the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings.b.
the provision contains two key clauses if the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable the if clause,and even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings the even though clause.
blackletter products liability law generally recognizes three different types of product defects design defects,manufacturing defects,and labeling defects,failure to warn the reference in the even though clause to a properly prepared vaccine accompanied by proper directions and warnings is an obvious reference to two such defects manufacturing and labeling defects.the plain terms of the even though clause thus indicate that b applies only where neither kind of defect is present.because b is invoked by vaccine manufacturers as a defense to tort liability,it follows that the even though clause requires a vaccine manufacturer in each civil action to demonstrate that its vaccine is free from manufacturing and labeling defects to fall within the liability exemption of b 
given that the even though clause requires the absence of manufacturing and labeling defects,the if clause reference to side effects that were unavoidable must refer to side effects caused by something other than manufacturing and labeling defects.the only remaining kind of product defect recognized under traditional products liability law is a design defect.thus,side effects that were unavoidable must refer to side effects caused by a vaccine design that were unavoidable.because b uses the conditional term if,moreover,the text plainly implies that some side effects stemming from a vaccine design are unavoidable,while others are avoidable.see webster third new international dictionary if means in the event that,so long as,or on condition that accordingly,because the if clause like the even though clause sets forth a condition to invoke b defense to tort liability,congress must also have intended a vaccine manufacturer to demonstrate in each civil action that the particular side effects of a vaccine design were unavoidable.
congress use of conditional if clauses in two other provisions of the vaccine act supports the conclusion that b requires an inquiry in each case in which a manufacturer seeks to invoke the provision exception to state tort liability.in b,congress created a presumption that,for purposes of b,a vaccine shall be presumed to be accompanied by proper directions and warnings if the vaccine manufacturer shows that it complied in all material respects with federal labeling requirements.b.similarly,in d,congress created an exemption from punitive damages i f the manufacturer shows that it complied,in all material respects,with applicable federal laws,unless it engages in fraud,intentional and wrongful withholding of information from federal regulators,or other criminal or illegal activity.d.it would be highly anomalous for congress to use a conditional if clause in b and d to require a specific inquiry in each case while using the same conditional if clause in b to denote a categorical exemption from liability.erlenbaugh united states,a legislative body generally uses a particular word with a consistent meaning in a given context 
indeed,when congress intends to design defect claims categorically,it does so using categorical,all declarative language,shall rather than a conditional term if for example,in a related context,congress has authorized the secretary of health and human services to designate a vaccine designed to prevent a pandemic or epidemic as a covered countermeasure.b,i,i a i.with respect to such covered countermeasure s,congress provided that subject to certain exceptions,a covered person shall be immune from suit and liability under federal and state law with respect to all claims for loss caused by,arising out of,relating to,or resulting from the administration to or the use by an individual of a covered countermeasure,a emphasis added,including specifically claims relating to the design of the countermeasure,a b.
the plain text and structure of the vaccine act thus compel the conclusion that b some but not all design defect claims.contrary to the majority and respondent categorical reading,petitioners correctly contend that,where a plaintiff has proved that she has suffered an injury resulting from a side effect caused by a vaccine design,a vaccine manufacturer may invoke b liability exemption only if it demonstrates that the side effect stemming from the particular vaccine design is unavoidable,and that the vaccine is otherwise free from manufacturing and labeling defects 
the legislative history confirms petitioners interpretation of b and sheds further light on its scope.the house energy and commerce committee report accompanying the vaccine act,pt.hereinafter report,explains in relevant part 
subsection b unavoidable adverse side effects direct warnings.this provision sets forth the principle contained in comment k of section of the restatement of torts second that a vaccine manufacturer should not be liable for injuries or deaths resulting from unavoidable side effects even though the vaccine was properly prepared and accompanied by proper directions and warnings.the committee has set forth comment k in this bill because it intends that the principle in comment k regarding unavoidably unsafe products,those products which in the present state of human skill and knowledge can not be made safe,apply to the vaccines covered in the bill and that such products not be the subject of liability in the tort system.at.
the report expressly adopts comment k of of the restatement of torts second hereinafter restatement,which provides that unavoidably unsafe products,those that in the present state of human knowledge,are quite incapable of being made safe for their intended and ordinary use are not defective as a n outstanding example of an u navoidably unsafe product,comment k cites the vaccine for the pasteur treatment of rabies,which not uncommonly leads to very serious and damaging consequences when it is injected s ince the disease itself invariably leads to a dreadful death,both the marketing and the use of the vaccine are fully justified,notwithstanding the unavoidable high degree of risk which they involve.at.comment k thus provides that seller s of u navoidably unsafe products are not to be held to strict liability provided that such products are properly prepared and marketed,and proper warning is given.ibid.
as the report explains,congress intended that the principle in comment k regarding unavoidably unsafe products apply to the vaccines covered in the bill.report.that intent,in turn,is manifested in the plain text of b in particular,congress use of the word unavoidable,as well as the phrases properly prepared and accompanied by proper directions and warnings,which were taken nearly verbatim from comment b see restatement such a n unavoidably unsafe product,properly prepared,and accompanied by proper directions and warning,is not defective by the time of the vaccine act enactment in,numerous state and federal courts had interpreted comment k to mean that a product is unavoidably unsafe when,given proper manufacture and labeling,no feasible alternative design would reduce the safety risks without compromising the product cost and utility given congress expressed intent to codify the principle in comment k,report,the term unavoidable in b is best understood as a term of art,which incorporates the commonly understood meaning of unavoidably unsafe products under comment k at the time of the act enactment in.see mcdermott int l,wilander,w e assume that when a statute uses a term of art,congress intended it to have its established meaning morissette united states,same similarly,courts applying comment k had long required manufacturers invoking the defense to demonstrate that their products were not only unavoidably unsafe but also properly manufactured and labeled by requiring prope r prepar ation and proper directions and warnings in b,congress plainly intended to incorporate these additional comment k requirements.
the report thus confirms petitioners interpretation of b.the report makes clear that side effects that were unavoidable in b refers to side effects stemming from a vaccine design that were unavoidable.by explaining what congress meant by the term unavoidable,moreover,the report also confirms that whether a side effect is unavoidable for purposes of b involves a specific inquiry in each case as to whether the vaccine in the present state of human skill and knowledge can not be made safe,report,whether a feasible alternative design existed that would have eliminated the adverse side effects of the vaccine without compromising its cost and utility.see brief for kenneth starr et as amici curiae if a particular plaintiff could show that her injury at issue was avoidable through the use of a feasible alternative design for a specific vaccine,then she would satisfy the plain language of the statute,because she would have demonstrated that the side effects were not unavoidable finally,the report confirms that the even though clause is properly read to establish two additional prerequisites proper manufacturing and proper labeling to qualify for b liability exemption 
in addition to the report,one other piece of the act legislative history provides further confirmation of the petitioners textual reading of b.when congress enacted the vaccine act in,it did not initially include a source of payment for the compensation program the act established.the act thus made the compensation program and accompanying tort reforms contingent on the enactment of a tax to provide funding for the compensation.report.in,congress passed legislation to fund the compensation program.the house energy and commerce committee accompanying that legislation specifically stated that the codification of comment k of the restatement second of torts was not intended to decide as a matter of law the circumstances in which a vaccine should be deemed unavoidably unsafe.at.the committee noted that a n amendment to establish that a manufacturer failure to develop a safer vaccine was not grounds for liability was rejected by the committee during its original consideration of the act.ibid.in light of that rejection,the committee emphasized that there should be no misunderstanding that the act undertook to decide as a matter of law whether vaccines were unavoidably unsafe or not,and that t his question is left to the courts to determine in accordance with applicable law.ibid.
to be sure,postenactment legislative history created by a subsequent congress is ordinarily a hazardous basis from which to infer the intent of the enacting congress.see sullivan finkelstein,scalia,concurring in part.but unlike ordinary postenactment legislative history,which is justifiably given little or no weight,the report reflects the intent of the congress that enacted the funding legislation necessary to give operative effect to the principal provisions of the vaccine act,including b congress in had a number of options before it,including adopting an entirely different compensation scheme,as the reagan administration was proposing establishing different limitations on tort liability,including eliminating design defect liability,as pharmaceutical industry leaders were advocating or not funding the compensation program at all,which would have effectively nullified the relevant portions of the act.because the tort reforms in the act,including b,had no operative legal effect unless and until congress provided funding for the compensation program,the views of the congress that enacted that funding legislation are a proper and,indeed,authoritative guide to the meaning of b.those views,as reflected in the report,provide unequivocal confirmation of petitioners reading of b.
in sum,the text,structure,and legislative history of the vaccine act are fully consistent with petitioners reading of b.accordingly,i believe b exempts vaccine manufacturers from tort liability only upon a showing by the manufacturer in each case that the vaccine was properly manufactured and labeled,and that the side effects stemming from the vaccine design could not have been prevented by a feasible alternative design that would have eliminated the adverse side effects without compromising the vaccine cost and utility.
in contrast to the interpretation of b set forth above,the majority interpretation does considerable to the statutory text,misconstrues the legislative history,and draws the wrong conclusions from the structure of the vaccine act and the broader federal scheme regulating vaccines.
as a textual matter,the majority interpretation of b is fundamentally flawed in three central respects.first,the majority categorical reading rests on a faulty and untenable premise.second,its reading functionally excises words from the statutory text,including the key term unavoidable.and third,the majority entirely ignores the vaccine act default rule preserving state tort law.
to begin,the majority states that a side effect of a vaccine could always have been avoidable by use of a differently designed vaccine not containing the harmful element.ante,at.from that premise,the majority concludes that the statute must mean that the design of the vaccine is a given,not subject to question in the tort action,because construing the statute otherwise would render b a nullity.ibid.a tort claimant,according to the majority,will always be able to point to a differently designed vaccine not containing the harmful element,and if that were sufficient to show that a vaccine side effects were not unavoidable,the statute would nothing.
the starting premise of the majority interpretation,however,is fatally flawed.although in the most literal sense,as the majority notes,a side effect can always be avoided by use of a differently designed vaccine not containing the harmful element,this interpretation of unavoidable would effectively read the term out of the statute,and congress could not have intended that result.indeed,b specifically uses the conditional phrase if the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable,which plainly indicates that congress contemplated that there would be some instances in which a vaccine side effects are unavoidable and other instances in which they are not.see supra,at.the majority premise that a vaccine side effects can always be avoid ed by use of a differently designed vaccine not containing the harmful element,ante,at,entirely ignores the fact that removing the harmful element will often result in a less effective or entirely ineffective vaccine.a vaccine,by its nature,ordinarily employs a killed or weakened form of a bacteria or virus to stimulate antibody production removing that bacteria or virus might remove the harmful element,but it would also necessarily render the vaccine inert.as explained above,the legislative history of the vaccine act and the cases interpreting comment k make clear that a side effect is unavoidable for purposes of b only where there is no feasible alternative design that would eliminate the side effect of the vaccine without compromising its cost and utility.see supra,at.the majority premise that side effects stemming from a vaccine design are always avoidable is thus belied by the statutory text and legislative history of b.and because its starting premise is invalid,its conclusion that the design of a vaccine is not subject to challenge in a tort action is also necessarily invalid.
the majority reading suffers from an even more fundamental defect.if congress intended to exempt vaccine manufacturers categorically from all design defect liability,it more logically would have provided no vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages arising from a injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after october,if the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings.there would have been no need for congress to include the additional words the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though.see trw andrews,noting cardinal principle of statutory construction that a statute ought,upon the whole,to be so construed that,if it can be prevented,no clause,sentence,or word shall be superfluous,void,or insignificant internal quotation marks omitted.
in bates dow agrosciences llc,this court considered an analogous situation where an express provision stated that certain states shall not impose or continue in effect any requirements for labeling or packaging in addition to or different from those required under this subchapter.at quoting b ed.the bates court stated 
conspicuously absent from the submissions by respondent and the united states is any plausible alternative interpretation of in addition to or different from that would give that phrase meaning.instead,they appear to favor reading those words out of the statute,which would leave the following such state shall not impose or continue in effect any requirements for labeling or packaging.this amputated version of the statute would no doubt have clearly and succinctly commanded the of all state requirements concerning labeling.that congress added the remainder of the provision is evidence of its intent to draw a distinction between state labeling requirements that are and those that are not.at.
as with the statutory interpretation rejected by this court in bates,the majority interpretation of b functionally excises words out of the statute,including the key term unavoidable.see duncan walker,we are especially unwilling to treat a statutory term as surplusage when the term occupies so pivotal a place in the statutory scheme although the resulting amputated version of the statutory provision would no doubt have clearly and succinctly commanded the of all state design defect claims,the fact t hat congress added the remainder of the provision is strong evidence of its intent not to design defect claims categorically.bates,at see also american home prods.ferrari,if congress had intended to deprive injured parties of a long available form of compensation,it surely would have expressed that intent more clearly quoting bates,at,cert.pending.
strikingly,the majority concedes that its interpretation renders words of the statute entirely superfluous.see ante,at the intervening passage the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though is unnecessary.true enough nevertheless,the majority contends that the rule against giving a portion of text an interpretation which renders it superfluous applies only if verbosity and prolixity can be eliminated by giving the offending passage,or the remainder of the text,a competing interpretation.ibid.according to the majority,petitioners reading of b renders the even though clause superfluous because,to reach petitioners desired outcome,i t would suffice to say if the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable full stop.ibid.as explained above,however,the even though clause establishes two additional prerequisites proper manufacturing and proper labeling to qualify for b exemption from liability.contrary to the majority contention,then,the even though clause serves an important function by limiting the scope of the afforded by the preceding if clause 
the majority only other textual argument is based on the expressio unius,exclusio alterius canon.according to the majority,because blackletter products liability law generally recognizes three different types of product defects,i f all three were intended to be preserved,it would be strange for congress to mention specifically only two namely,manufacturing and labeling defects in the even though clause and leave the third to implication.ante,at.the majority argument,however,ignores that the default rule under the vaccine act is that state law is preserved.as explained above,a expressly provides that the g eneral rule is that state law shall apply to a civil action brought for damages for a injury or death.a.because a already preserves design defect claims to the extent the exemption in b does not apply,there was no need for congress separately and expressly to preserve design defect claims in b.indeed,congress principal aim in enacting b was not to preserve manufacturing and labeling claims those,too,were already preserved by a,but rather,to federalize comment protection for unavoidably unsafe vaccines.the even though clause simply functions to limit the applicability of that defense.the lack of express language in b specifically preserving design defect claims thus can not fairly be understood as impliedly and categorically such traditional state tort claims,which had already been preserved by a 
the majority also suggests that if congress wished to preserve design defect claims,it could have simply provided that manufacturers would be liable for defective manufacture,defective directions or warning,and defective design.ante,at internal quotation marks omitted.putting aside the fact that a already preserves design defect claims to the extent b does not apply,the majority proposed solution would not have fully effectuated congress intent.as the legislative history makes clear,congress used the term unavoidable to effectuate its intent that the principle in comment k regarding unavoidably unsafe products apply to the vaccines covered in the bill.report see also report.at the time of the vaccine act enactment in,at least one state had expressly rejected comment k while many others had not addressed the applicability of comment k specifically to vaccines or applied comment k to civil actions proceeding on a theory other than strict liability.a statute that simply stated that vaccine manufacturers would be liable for defective design would be silent as to the availability of a comment defense for unavoidably unsafe vaccines,and thus would not have fully achieved congress aim of extending greater liability protection to vaccine manufacturers by providing comment protection in all civil actions as a matter of federal law.
the majority structural arguments fare no better than its textual ones.the principal thrust of the majority position is that,since nothing in the vaccine act or the fda regulations governing vaccines expressly mentions design defects,congress must have intended to remove issues concerning the design of vaccines from the tort system.ante,at.the flaw in that reasoning,of course,is that the fda silence on design defects existed long before the vaccine act was enacted.indeed,the majority itself concedes that the fda has never even spelled out in regulations the criteria it uses to decide whether a vaccine is safe and effective for its intended use.ibid.and yet it is undisputed that prior to the act,vaccine manufacturers had long been subject to liability under state tort law for defective vaccine design.that the vaccine act did not itself set forth a comprehensive regulatory scheme with respect to design defects is thus best understood to mean not that congress suddenly decided to change course sub silentio and a longstanding,traditional category of state tort law,but rather,that congress intended to leave the status quo alone except,of course,with respect to those aspects of state tort law that the act expressly altered.see report it is not the committee intention to preclude court actions under applicable law.the committee intent at the time of considering the act was to leave otherwise applicable law unaffected,except as expressly altered by the act 
the majority also suggests that congress necessarily intended to design defect claims since the aim of such tort suits is to promote the development of improved designs and provide compensation for injured individuals,and the vaccine act provides other means for achieving both effects most notably through the compensation program and the national vaccine program.ante,at,and nn.citing,a,b,a.but the majority position elides a significant difference between state tort law and the federal regulatory scheme.although the vaccine act charges the secretary of health and human services with the obligation to promote the development of childhood vaccines and make or assure improvements in vaccines,and research on vaccines,a,neither the act nor any other provision of federal law places a legal duty on vaccine manufacturers to improve the design of their vaccines to account for scientific and technological advances.indeed,the fda does not condition approval of a vaccine on it being the most optimally designed among reasonably available alternatives,nor does it or any other federal entity ensure that licensed vaccines keep pace with technological and scientific advances rather,the function of ensuring that vaccines are optimally designed in light of existing science and technology has traditionally been left to the states through the imposition of damages for design defects.bates,at t he specter of damage actions may provide manufacturers with added dynamic incentives to continue to keep abreast of all possible injuries stemming from use of their product s so as to forestall such actions through product improvement wyeth levine,slip,at noting that the fda has traditionally regarded state law as a complementary form of drug regulation as s tate tort suits uncover unknown drug hazards and provide incentives for drug manufacturers to disclose safety risks promptly the importance of the states traditional regulatory role is only underscored by the unique features of the vaccine market,in which there are only one or two manufacturers for a majority of the vaccines listed on the routine childhood immunization schedule.brief for respondent.the normal competitive forces that spur innovation and improvements to existing product lines in other markets thus operate with less force in the vaccine market,particularly for vaccines that have already been released and marketed to the public.absent a clear statutory mandate to the contrary,there is no reason to think that congress intended in the vaccine context to eliminate the traditional incentive and deterrence functions served by state tort liability in favor of a federal regulatory scheme providing only carrots and no sticks see levine,at slip,at the case for federal is particularly weak where congress has indicated its awareness of the operation of state law in a field of federal interest,and has nonetheless decided to stand by both concepts and to tolerate whatever tension there is between them.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.
in enacting the vaccine act,congress established a carefully wrought federal scheme that balances the competing interests of persons and vaccine manufacturers.as the legislative history indicates,the act addressed two overriding concerns a the inadequacy from both the perspective of persons as well as vaccine manufacturers of the current approach to compensating those who have been damaged by a vaccine and b the instability and unpredictability of the childhood vaccine market.report.when viewed in the context of the vaccine act as a whole,b is just one part of a broader statutory scheme that balances the need for compensating children with added liability protections for vaccine manufacturers to ensure a stable childhood vaccine market.
the principal innovation of the act was the creation of the compensation program a scheme funded entirely through an excise tax on vaccines through that program,congress relieved vaccine manufacturers of the burden of compensating victims of injuries in the vast majority of an extremely significant economic benefit that functionally creat es a valuable insurance policy for injuries.reply brief for petitioners.the structure and legislative history,moreover,point clearly to congress intention to divert tort claimants into the compensation program,rather than eliminate a longstanding category of traditional tort claims.see report the committee anticipates that the speed of the compensation program,the low transaction costs of the system,the nature of the required findings,and the relative certainty and generosity of the system awards will divert a significant number of potential plaintiffs from litigation indeed,although complete of tort claims would have eliminated the principal source of the unpredictability in the vaccine market,congress specifically chose not to state tort claims categorically.see a providing as a g eneral rule that state law shall apply to a civil action brought for damages for a injury or death that decision reflects congress recognition that court actions are essential because they provide injured persons with significant procedural tools including,most importantly,civil discovery that are not available in administrative proceedings under the compensation program.see d e,d.congress thus clearly believed there was still an important function to be played by state tort law.
instead of eliminating design defect liability entirely,congress enacted numerous measures to reduce manufacturers liability exposure,including a limited regulatory compliance presumption of adequate warnings,see b,elimination of claims based on failure to provide direct warnings to patients,c,a heightened standard for punitive damages,d,and,of course,immunity from damages for unavoidable side effects,b.considered in light of the vaccine act as a whole,b exemption from liability for unavoidably unsafe vaccines is just one part of a broader statutory scheme that reflects congress careful balance between providing adequate compensation for children and conferring substantial benefits on vaccine manufacturers to ensure a stable and predictable childhood vaccine supply.
the majority decision today disturbs that careful balance based on a bare policy preference that it is better to leave complex epidemiological judgments about vaccine design to the fda and the national vaccine program rather than juries.ante,at to be sure,reasonable minds can disagree about the wisdom of having juries weigh the relative costs and benefits of a particular vaccine design.but whatever the merits of the majority policy preference,the decision to bar all design defect claims against vaccine manufacturers is one that congress must make,not this court by construing b to all design defect claims against vaccine manufacturers for covered vaccines,the majority decision leaves a regulatory vacuum in which no one neither the fda nor any other federal agency,nor state and federal juries ensures that vaccine manufacturers adequately take account of scientific and technological advancements.this concern is especially acute with respect to vaccines that have already been released and marketed to the public.manufacturers,given the lack of robust competition in the vaccine market,will often have little or no incentive to improve the designs of vaccines that are already generating significant profit margins.nothing in the text,structure,or legislative history remotely suggests that congress intended that result.

comment k provides as follows 
unavoidably unsafe products.there are some products which,in the present state of human knowledge,are quite incapable of being made safe for their intended and ordinary use.these are especially common in the field of drugs.an outstanding example is the vaccine for the pasteur treatment of rabies,which not uncommonly leads to very serious and damaging consequences when it is injected.since the disease itself invariably leads to a dreadful death,both the marketing and the use of the vaccine are fully justified,notwithstanding the unavoidable high degree of risk which they involve.such a product,properly prepared,and accompanied by proper directions and warning,is not defective,nor is it unreasonably dangerous.the same is true of many other drugs,vaccines,and the like,many of which for this very reason can not legally be sold except to physicians,or under the prescription of a physician.it is also true in particular of many new or experimental drugs as to which,because of lack of time and opportunity for sufficient medical experience,there can be no assurance of safety,or perhaps even of purity of ingredients,but such experience as there is justifies the marketing and use of the drug notwithstanding a medically recognizable risk.the seller of such products,again with the qualification that they are properly prepared and marketed,and proper warning is given,where the situation calls for it,is not to be held to strict liability for unfortunate consequences attending their use,merely because he has undertaken to supply the public with an apparently useful and desirable product,attended with a known but apparently reasonable risk.restatement.

the majority refuses to recognize that unavoidable is a term of art derived from comment k,suggesting that u navoidable is hardly a rarely used word.ante,at.in fact,however,unavoidable is an extremely rare word in the relevant context.it appears exactly once,in b in the entirety of title of the code public health and welfare which governs,inter alia,social security,see et,medicare,see et,and several other of the federal government largest entitlement programs.the singular rarity in which congress used the term supports the conclusion that unavoidable is a term of art.

respondent suggests an alternative reading of the report.according to respondent,the principle in comment k is simply that of nonliability for unavoidably unsafe products,and thus congress stated intent in the report to apply the principle in comment k to the vaccines covered in the bill means that congress viewed the covered vaccines as a class to be unavoidably unsafe.report brief for respondent.the concurrence makes a similar argument.ante,at opinion of breyer.this interpretation finds some support in the report,which states that if injured individuals can not demonstrate under applicable law either that a vaccine was improperly prepared or that it was accompanied by improper directions or inadequate warnings they should pursue recompense in the compensation system,not the tort system.report.it also finds some support in the act case law,which reflected considerable disagreement in the courts over whether comment k applies to pharmaceutical products across the board or only on a basis.ausness,unavoidably unsafe products and strict products liability what liability rule should be applied to the sellers of pharmaceutical products,and collecting cases.this interpretation,however,is undermined by the fact that congress has never directed the food and drug administration fda or any other federal agency to review vaccines for optimal vaccine design,see infra,at,and,and thus it seems highly unlikely that congress intended to eliminate the traditional mechanism for such review,design defect liability,particularly given its express retention of state tort law in the vaccine act,see a.in any event,to the extent there is ambiguity as to how precisely congress intended the principle in comment k to apply to the covered vaccines,that ambiguity is explicitly resolved in petitioners favor by the house energy and commerce committee report,pt,hereinafter report.see infra this page and.
the third circuit opinion below expressed uncertainty as to whether the report was authored by the house budget committee or the house energy and commerce committee.see.as petitioners explain,although the budget committee compiled and issued the report,the energy and commerce committee wrote and approved the relevant language.title iv of the report,entitled committee on energy and commerce,comprises two committee prints approved by the committee on energy and commerce for inclusion in the forthcoming reconciliation bill.report.
the majority suggests that the legislation creating the funding mechanism is akin to appropriations legislation and that giving weight to the legislative history of such legislation would set a dangerous precedent.ante,at.the difference,of course,is that appropriations legislation ordinarily funds congressional enactments that already have operative legal effect in contrast,operation of the tort reforms in the act,including b,was expressly conditioned on the enactment of a separate tax to fund the compensation program.see a,stat.accordingly,this court general reluctance to view appropriations legislation as modifying substantive legislation,see,tva hill,has no bearing here.

in this manner,the even though clause functions in a concessive subordinat ing fashion,ante,at,in accord with normal grammatical usage.according to the majority,however,the even though clause clarifies the word that precedes it by delineat ing the conditions that make a side effect unavoidable under the statute.ante,at.the majority interpretation hardly treats the clause as concessive,and indeed strains the meaning of even though.in the majority view,proper manufacturing and labeling are the sole prerequisites that render a vaccine side effects unavoidable.thus,an injurious side effect is unavoidable because the vaccine was properly prepared and labeled,not even though it was.the two conjunctions are not equivalent the sentence i am happy even though it is raining can hardly be read to mean that i am happy because it is raining.in any event,the more fundamental point is that petitioners interpretation actually gives meaning to the words even though,whereas the majority concedes that its interpretation effectively reads those words entirely out of the statute.see supra this page.
this court,moreover,has long operated on the assumption that the historic police powers of the states are not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.altria group,good,slip,at internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.given the long history of state regulation of vaccines,see brief for petitioners,the presumption provides an additional reason not to read b as all design defect claims,especially given congress inclusion of an express saving clause in the same statutory section,see a,and its use of the conditional if clause in defining the scope of the provision.see bates dow agrosciences llc,in areas of traditional stat
