tragically,on may,lawrence inlow was struck in the head by a helicopter rotor blade as he disembarked from the aircraft owned by his employer,conseco.he died instantly.his estate,represented by first national bank and trust corporation,claimed that the helicopter was a defective product under indiana law because its manufacturer,eurocopter,had negligently failed to warn inlow or conseco of the relevant danger.because we agree with the district court that indiana sophisticated intermediary doctrine compels a grant of summary judgment to eurocopter,we affirm.
inlow served as general counsel for conseco.the corporation is based in carmel,indiana,and owns numerous insurance and financial services companies.although inlow worked out of conseco carmel headquarters,his duties took him around the country.on the morning of may,he and another attorney,michael colliflower,had a planned business trip.they intended to fly out of nearby indianapolis international airport to north dakota via one of conseco private jets.inlow and colliflower left the company headquarters aboard the helicopter.upon arrival at the airport,inlow was killed by the rotor blade as he made his way from the helicopter toward the private jet.
a.the dauphin helicopter 
the helicopter involved in this case was a dauphin.it was manufactured by eurocopter,a french corporation,and marketed in the by its subsidiary,american eurocopter collectively eurocopter.conseco purchased the dauphin helicopter in.
to better understand the specific circumstances of this accident,it is necessary to know a few basic facts about helicopters and,in particular,the dauphin.as the district court performed this task concisely and without dispute by the parties,we will quote the helpful discussion 
the lift that allows a helicopter to stay in the air is generated by the flow of air over the main rotor blades,which have a of an airfoil,like the wings of a aircraft.for the dauphin helicopter involved in the inlow accident,the four main rotor blades have an overall diameter of feet,inches.thus,at a typical flying speed of revolutions per minute,the blade tips travel about feet per second,or about miles per hour.the rotor blades are made of a strong,lightweight carbon fiber material.they can and do bend up and down as they rotate.
when a helicopter runs its rotor blades at normal flight speeds,the blades are subject to centrifugal and lifting forces that raise the plane of the disk in which the blades rotate.when the dauphin helicopter involved in this accident is parked and its blades are not moving,the blades droop to about feet,inches above level ground in front of the helicopter.the blades are closest to the ground in front of the nose.the cyclic control on a helicopter controls the angle of the plane in which the rotor blades rotate.when the blades are under power and the cyclic control is in the neutral position,the blades may rise as high as feet,inches above level ground in front of the helicopter.
dist.op.at citations omitted.
the height of the rotor blades at rest at the lowest point,which is directly in front of the helicopter and during flight speed up to are marketed to eurocopter executives,medical personnel,law enforcement,and offshore oil platform a safety feature and a convenience.
however,there are two ways in which the safety of the dauphin rotor is counteracted.first is the cyclic control factor,where the pilot tilts the rotor in order to move the helicopter in the direction of the tilt.as noted in the excerpt from the district court,w hen the blades are under power and the cyclic control is in the neutral position,the blades may rise as high as feet,inches above level ground in front of the helicopter.but,as testing done by eurocopter in demonstrates,the height of the rotating blades at full power can decrease dramatically when the cyclic control is engaged.with normal use of the cyclic control at degrees forward,the rotor blade clearance is feet,inches.but when the cyclic control is pushed beyond the normal operating limit to its absolute maximum forward position of degrees,the rotor blade can reach as low as feet,inches.the record contains information about an accident in which an offshore oil worker was fatally struck in the head by a dauphin blade as he approached the helicopter from the front.at the time,the helicopter was operating under full rotor and the cyclic control was pushed forward 
the second safety concern is known as blade flap.information about this dangerous phenomenon is set forth and widely available in federal aviation administration documents,federal regulations adopted in indiana,helicopter industry publications,pilot safety manuals,and pilot training books.simply stated,blade flap occurs because the rotor blades are made of a,lightweight carbon fiber material the blades,therefore,flex up and down.the downward flex occurs at lower.the main rotor blades pose the greatest danger at ground level when they are decelerating with the engines off.under those circumstances,the lifting and centrifugal forces on the rotor blades are diminishing,and the rotor blades are subject to gusts of wind that may push the blades lower.
thus,despite the rotor,evidence favorable to the inlow estate establishes that,under two circumstances,the dauphin rotor blades pose grave danger to anyone within the circular path of the blades.and as the inlow accident and the offshore oil worker accident demonstrate,there is an actual danger at least in front of the nose of the dauphin of death from either use of the cyclic control or blade flap.
but within the eurocopter organization,there was a difference of opinion as to whether it is safe under any circumstances to disembark from the dauphin while the rotor blades are decelerating.the head of the preliminary design department and the engineer in charge of testing the dauphin testified that it is a basic rule of the art that passengers should never be under the rotor disk during deceleration or acceleration phases.the engineer noted that if circumstances dictated that the rotors must continue turning such as a medical evacuation or mountain rescue,the rotors should be under full power.the eurocopter safety manager agrees that it is standard procedure to not load or unload while the blades are decelerating,although he did not think it was a practice expressly prohibited by eurocopter.and finally,eurocopter former chief pilot agreed that unloading passengers while the blades are decelerating is the least desirable way to disembark,but he also said that he was never instructed to not do so and that he had probably unloaded some passengers while the blades were decelerating on demonstration flights in the past.
conseco policies and practices 
eurocopter marketed the dauphin as particularly desirable because of its rotor.the salesman who closed the deal with conseco executives,neil williams,told former conseco president stephen hilbert that the dauphin facilitated rapid egress.williams even disembarked from a dauphin with hilbert and vice president of conseco flight operations dan rice while the rotors were still spinning during a demonstration flight.
notwithstanding the dangers of disembarking while the rotors are decelerating,eurocopter did not directly warn anyone at conseco of such risks.no warnings were posted in the helicopter none were in the instruction manual.the flight manual simply states that w hen practical,boarding and deplaning will be conducted with rotors stopped.when escorts are not available to assist in boarding and deplaning,passengers will be thoroughly briefed on appropriate procedures.the manual also makes clear that the pilot should remain at the controls and the flight crew or ground crew should accompany passengers to safety while disembarking.
after conseco purchased the dauphin,rice implemented an imprudent disembarkation procedure that was concerned more with saving executive time and the level of engine noise than safety.hilbert did not want to delay disembarking for the seconds it takes for the rotor blades to fully stop with the engines off,nor did he want to depart while the engines were running because the noise was extremely loud.as a result,conseco developed as its deboarding policy that passengers would exit the dauphin after the engines had been shut down but before the rotor blades had completely stopped.to implement this policy,conseco pilots required that passengers exit the helicopter directly abeam,ninety degrees off the aircraft.this requirement was designed to prevent passengers from stepping into the most dangerous sector of the blades front of the helicopter.
the conseco pilots,including carl deaton,who piloted the dauphin the day of the accident,and michael sojka,the the day of the accident,were well aware of the risks inherent in exiting a helicopter while the rotor blades were decelerating.in fact,deaton told sojka some time before the accident that he would prefer not to disembark passengers while the rotor was slowing,and sojka agreed.deaton had even overruled the conseco policy in the past when wind gusts were particularly strong.several pilots and mechanics also complained to their conseco superiors on occasion about the practice.despite these suggestions by pilots and ground crew to stop the rotors completely before allowing passengers to deboard,conseco management did not change the procedure.the conseco pilots,although testifying after the accident that they were uncomfortable with the procedures because of their general inclination toward taking all conceivable precautions,confirmed that this discomfort did not stem from any warnings issued by eurocopter.instead,in the words of deaton the pilot during the relevant flight,his knowledge that there was a potential for endangerment of passengers or personnel came from intuit ion or from military experience,not specific knowledge of how low the dauphin blades actually could bend.eurocopter former chief pilot delivered the helicopter to conseco and trained conseco pilots.he provided no warnings about blade flap.
c.the accident 
the dauphin arrived at indianapolis international airport in windy conditions on the morning of may.consistent with established conseco procedures,the pilot shut down the helicopter after landing.the exited the helicopter,hugged the nose of the dauphin in walking to the other side,and opened the door for the tall inlow and colliflower.at the time of the accident,the pilot was at the controls as he should have been,the was attending to the passengers luggage,and no one else,apparently,was present to escort the passengers away from the dauphin.
inlow was aware of the proper route for out of the aircraft at a angle perpendicular to the body of the helicopter.a frequent passenger for five years prior to the fatal accident,he had been warned in the past about walking in front of the dauphin.inlow was told more than once by pilots to follow the correct path.on one prior occasion,he had walked to the same spot where he was later killed.a conseco pilot warned inlow that it looked as if the blade came close to hitting him and that he needed to follow the exit procedure inlow acknowledged his understanding.on another occasion,inlow was stopped before he could walk towards the front of the plane and was asked to proceed along the exit path.
in addition to inlow previous missteps,at least one other conseco passenger walked to the front of the helicopter while disembarking.fortunately,he was not struck by the blade.despite these prior occurrences and knowledge of dangerous conditions within conseco organization,conseco did not alter its policies,and inlow was not given a briefing before disembarking nor escorted to safety on the day of his death.
inlow,after beginning to walk on roughly the correct line of exit,abruptly turned and walked fully upright back to the helicopter.he proceeded to move in front of the helicopter into the path of the blades.he was struck by a blade at about the one position off the nose of the helicopter.the blades were turning at approximately,or about miles per hour less than half of what they would be turning under flying speed power.
in contrast,colliflower,the conseco attorney accompanying inlow,instinctively it was his first helicopter this,he received no safety briefing from the pilots crouched as he followed inlow off the aircraft.although colliflower jitters were assuaged by the thought that he could simply follow inlow lead,when inlow turned and walked towards the front of the dauphin,colliflower did not follow.
deaton,manning the controls in the cockpit,said that nothing appeared to be unusual about the rotor blade path he testified that it appeared that inlow simply walked into the path of the blades,a place deaton never expected anyone to be 
procedural history 
the district court,after carefully considering the complicated issues presented by this case,granted eurocopter motion for summary judgment on three grounds that the danger that befell inlow was open and obvious and therefore eurocopter did not have a duty to warn conseco or inlow of the danger that,even assuming the danger was not open and obvious because of the increased risk of blade flap during deceleration,the pilots in the employ of conseco served as sophisticated intermediaries who relieved eurocopter of the duty to warn conseco or inlow and that the dauphin was not unreasonably dangerous under the indiana products liability act ipla and therefore the inlow estate could not proceed with the suit.
eurocopter requests that we affirm on any of these grounds,or on alternate that the failure to warn could not have been the proximate cause of the accident as a matter of law or that the ipla affirmative defense of incurred risk was proven as a matter of law,thus eliminating all liability.the inlow estate insists that the district court erred in its application of the ipla and that a trial is appropriate to decide whether eurocopter negligently caused this accident by its failure to warn conseco of the dangers of blade flap.
an additional issue on appeal is whether the district court abused its discretion in granting summary judgment to eurocopter without first deciding a pending motion to compel discovery by first national.the district court held that because the inlow estate did not invoke rule f of the federal rules of civil procedure to assert that the pending discovery disputes prevented it from obtaining evidence it needed to oppose the summary judgment motion,the motion was ripe for decision and the judge denied the pending discovery motion as moot.
ii.analysis 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,construing all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the party.ritchie glidden,cir.summary judgment is proper when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
applicable law 
as a federal court sitting in diversity,we apply state substantive law and federal procedural law.musser gentiva health,cir.thus,the product liability claim against eurocopter is governed by the ipla,et 
the inlow estate must show the following to succeed on its product liability claim under the ipla the seller is engaged in the business of selling the product that caused the injury the product was defective and unreasonably dangerous the defect existed at the time the product left the defendant control the product was expected to and did reach the consumer without substantial change in its condition and the defective product was the proximate cause of plaintiff injuries.ritchie,at.only the second and fifth requirements are at issue on appeal.
was the dauphin defective and unreasonably dangerous in order to show that the product is defective and unreasonably dangerous under the ipla,a plaintiff must establish either a manufacturing defect,a design defect,or a failure to warn.here,the inlow estate claims only that eurocopter was negligent in failing to warn conseco executives also at issue is whether eurocopter alleged failure to warn was a proximate cause of inlow accident.
negligent failure to warn under the ipla 
the facts we have recited establish that there are m
