this diversity case arose from the death of maribel quilez bonelli following an automobile accident involving maribel jeep liberty and a truck in use by municipality of san juan employees that had fitted onto its trash body an underride guard designed by ox bodies,ox bodies.maribel family members brought suit in federal court against ox bodies,seeking damages for,inter alia,defective design of the underride guard.a jury found ox bodies strictly liable for defective design and awarded the plaintiffs damages totaling.by special verdict form,the jury assigned of responsibility for the damages to ox bodies,to the municipality of san juan,which was not a party in the suit,and to maribel.the presiding magistrate judge ruled that judgment should enter on the strict liability claim in favor of the plaintiffs and that under puerto rico law,ox bodies should be held responsible only for of the damages award,which equaled.this appeal and followed.
ox bodies appeals the verdict,contending that the court should not have allowed the plaintiffs expert to testify on an alternative underride guard design,and that absent such testimony,no reasonable jury could have found for the plaintiffs.the plaintiffs appeal the order limiting their recovery,arguing that under puerto rico law ox bodies should be held jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff s for the totality of the damages the entire award such that the risk of loss of having to pay the entire judgment without obtaining contribution is borne by the defendant joint tortfeasor,not by the plaintiffs.
we affirm the court decision to admit the plaintiffs expert testimony and so reject ox bodies appeal.on the plaintiffs appeal,in the absence of clear puerto rico law,we certify to the puerto rico supreme court the question of the extent of ox bodies liability for the damages award.
on october,maribel quilez bonelli,a then year old married woman and mother,was driving on a highway overpass near the city of san juan in a jeep liberty with her toddler son when her jeep collided with a stopped or slowly moving truck in use by municipality of san juan employees.the truck bore an underride guard near its rear that had been designed by ox bodies.the front of maribel jeep hit the truck from behind and underrode the truck trash body such that the truck penetrated the jeep passenger compartment and struck maribel,lacerating her head and face.maribel died from resulting injuries on october.
maribel family members,berardo quilez velar,marta bonelli caban,berardo quilez bonelli,and carlos quilez collectively quilez,brought suit in a puerto rico court and in federal court in a puerto rico trial court,quilez filed an amended complaint on november,alleging negligence and seeking damages from,inter alia,the commonwealth of puerto rico,the puerto rico highway and transportation authority,integrand assurance company integrand,and the municipality of san juan.the municipality of san juan and integrand brought a complaint for indemnification or contribution against,inter alia,ox bodies and its parent company,truck bodies equipment international.on may,the municipality of san juan,through its insurer,deposited with the puerto rico court its maximum policy limit,for potential distribution if found liable.the puerto rico court ordered that the funds be distributed to the plaintiffs and dismissed the municipality of san juan from suit.quilez expressly represented to this court that n o settlement agreement was ever executed and quilez granted no release to or assumed any liability from the municipality of san juan or its insurer.ox bodies conceded this point at oral argument,no document in the record establishes otherwise,and so we accept quilez representation.
on march,quilez filed an amended complaint in its diversity action in federal district court against ox bodies,its parent company,and other defendants,for defective design and negligence under puerto rico law.ox bodies and its parent company brought a claim for contribution indemnification against,inter alia,the municipality of san juan.on may,the municipality of san juan notified the federal court that it had deposited that day with the puerto rico court.on september,the federal court dismissed the municipality of san juan from the suit,without objection from ox bodies.quilez velar ox bodies,no.civ,wl,at,reconsideration denied,no.civ,wl.at the time of this appeal,the only remaining defendant is ox bodies.
on january,ox bodies filed a motion in limine to exclude the testimony of quilez expert,perry ponder,arguing that ponder report is devoid of any scientific analysis or calculations that would support his conclusion that his proposed alternative underride guard design would have been a safer design in the instant accident,and that his opinions should be excluded under daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d ox bodies supported its motion with excerpts from ponder deposition and expert report,but it did not request that ponder testify at a daubert hearing quilez opposed the motion.
after reviewing both parties submissions and relevant discovery materials,the magistrate judge,presiding pursuant to,denied the motion to exclude ponder testimony.quilez velar ox bodies,no.civ,wl,at.the magistrate judge acknowledged ox bodies argument that ponder did not perform specific tests or calculations in the course of his analysis,but found,first,that ox bodies failed to show that these specific tests must have been carried out to provide a foundation for ponder opinions,and second,that upon review ing ponder report,its conclusions are,and its use of data appears appropriate.id.
at trial,when quilez moved to qualify ponder as an expert,ox bodies requested voir dire,which was initially conducted in front of the jury and during which ponder acknowledged that he did not his proposed alternative design and that none of his rear underride guard designs had ever been adopted by tilt or dump bed manufacturers.ox bodies conceded that ponder was qualified as an accident reconstructionist but renewed its objection to ponder testifying about an alternative design for an underride guard.the court permitted further questioning by both parties outside the presence of the jury,spanning more than nine pages of transcript,before ultimately ruling that ponder was qualified to testify about an alternative underride guard design.
following a day trial,the jury returned a verdict finding ox bodies strictly liable to quilez for defective design.in the magistrate judge march,memorandum and order,damages were apportioned as described earlier.quilez velar ox bodies,no.civ,wl,at.
ox bodies appeals the admission of ponder testimony regarding a feasible safer alternative design,arguing that without ponder testimony no reasonable jury could have found it liable.under puerto rican tort law governing design defect claims,if the plaintiff proves that the product design is the proximate cause of the damage,the burden shifts to the defendant to prove that the benefits of the design at issue outweigh the risk of danger inherent in such a design.quintana ruiz hyundai motor,cir quoting aponte rivera sears roebuck de,wl.here,the court instructed the jury that if it found that the plaintiffs met their burden,then i n deciding whether the benefits outweigh the risks,it should consider a number of factors,including t he feasibility of an alternative safer design at the time of manufacture.neither party contests this instruction 
ponder expert report pointed to two key deficiencies in ox bodies guard design first,a pproximately the outside inches on each side of the rear of the ox bodies truck is left without any underride guarding at all,and second,the guard is not sufficiently braced against impacts because t he outside span of the horizontal member is a beam supported at an interior location,but unsupported at the end,such that part of the guard would begin to fail at a load of approximately lbs.he further opined that t he frontal collision safety features in maribel jeep liberty were rendered ineffective because the truck lacked a substantially constructed underride guard.
ponder report went on to conclude that t here exist feasible safer alternative rear impact guard designs for the truck involved here.he noted a number of published studies that offer completed truck underride guard designs.he outlined a design suited for the instant truck,consist ing of a horizontal member positioned at the or very close to the rear extremity of the vehicle,long enough to protect the entire width of the truck,and d iagonal bracing placed at the truck bed interior longitudinal members and side longitudinal members at a degree angle along with a vertical support to complete the truss at the side extremities.
our review of the magistrate judge decision to admit ponder testimony on alternative design is for abuse of discretion.kumho tire carmichael,d.absent a material error of law,we will not such a discretionary determination unless it appears that the trial court committed a meaningful error in judgment.united states jordan,cir quoting ruiz troche pepsi cola of bottling,cir.we find that under federal rule of evidence,the magistrate judge decision to admit ponder testimony was within her discretion.
under federal rule of evidence 
a witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if 
a the expert scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue 
b the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data 
c the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods and 
d the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.
the magistrate judge here must serve as the gatekeeper for expert testimony by ensuring that it both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.milward rust oleum,wl,at cir,second and third alteration in original quoting daubert,at.
there is no dispute that testimony regarding alternative design was necessary to determine a fact at issue.the magistrate judge acted within her discretion in determining that ponder scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge would help the jury determine that issue.a.ponder,a licensed professional engineer with a degree in mechanical engineering,has designed and tested at least four underride guards,reviewed crash tests and underride crashes,and lectured or published on the subjects of underride guard history,regulations,and side underride guard protections.he is also certified by the accreditation commission for traffic accident reconstruction as an accident reconstructionist and has performed more than accident reconstructions,including about twenty in underride cases.on appeal,ox bodies has not raised a developed objection to the relevance of these experiences to the issue at hand.
rather,the central question before us concerns whether the magistrate judge abused her discretion in concluding that ponder testimony on alternative design was sufficiently reliable to survive the admissibility threshold ox bodies asserts that ponder testimony should have been excluded under daubert because the expert must have actually tested the alternative design,either physically or using computer modeling,and ponder did not do so.ox bodies argument rests on a profound misunderstanding of daubert,which eschews such per se approaches.see kumho tire,at holding that the inquiry depends upon the particular circumstances of the particular case at issue milward acuity specialty prods,cir conducting a reliability inquiry.testing is certainly one of the most common and useful reliability guideposts for a district court when contemplating proposed rule evidence.lapsley xtek,cir.however,this circuit has never adopted a rule that an expert himself must have tested an alternative design,much less by building one.we decline to adopt either requirement as a rule or as applied to this case.see kumho tire,at t he factors daubert mentions do not constitute a definitive checklist or test.quoting daubert,at johnson manitowoc boom trucks,cir declining to hold that testing is a requirement or the sole,dispositive factor under daubert wagner hesston,cir noting that lack of testing is a factor watkins telsmith,cir testing is not an absolute prerequisite to the admission of expert testimony on alternative designs,but rule demands that experts adhere to the same standards of intellectual rigor that are demanded in their professional work.quoting cummins lyle,cir cummins,at we do not mean to suggest,of course,that testing is an absolute prerequisite to the admission of expert testimony.
in any event,the record permitted a factfinder to conclude that ponder did do some testing,and here,the record supports the magistrate judge determination that there were alternate methods of testing from which the jury could evaluate reliability.see johnson,at.first,ponder testified that he looked at crash test information from several sources,including a study available from the national technical information system,a number of patents,crash test data from from aeronautical research associates,and other crash tests done under contract with the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa.ox bodies argues that ponder conclusion regarding the guard in the instant case does not fit with or follow from the studies.in its motion in limine,ox bodies argued that those studies evaluated impacts and forces that were different from those involved in this case.but ponder testified in voir dire that at least some of the information is transferrable to underride guards for any type of vehicle.he explained in response to a question about data asked during his deposition,for example,that a degree frontal test is what nhtsa uses as confirmation for crash worthiness and passenger safety in crash types all crash types.upon review of the arguments and documents in the record properly submitted to us we can not say that it was an abuse of discretion for the magistrate judge to conclude,as she did at trial,that ponder had enough data that did not require him to conduct further testing for research to base his opinions on.
second,ponder testified that he tested his design using stress calculation s.lapsley,at a mathematical or computer model is a perfectly acceptable form of test.his reliance in part on a society of automotive engineers sae article,in order to determine the energy involved as well as compar e the damage to the sae article damage matrix index,was appropriate ponder also testified that he performed photogrammetry analysis using calculations performed by hand to test how his design would react upon impact.
ox bodies contends that ponder failed to perform calculations its expert said were necessary in testing his design.however,as the magistrate judge correctly stated in ruling on ox bodies motion in limine,defendants do not show that these specific tests must have been carried out to provide a foundation for ponder opinions.moreover,ponder report and his responses when questioned during his deposition demonstrate support for his findings.we emphasize that in most cases,v igorous,presentation of contrary evidence,and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence.daubert,at.and here,ox bodies had ample opportunity to cross examine ponder and to use its own expert witness which it did.diefenbach sheridan,cir.
finally,on appeal ox bodies argues that ponder did not show that his alternative design would have withstood the force of the crash and would have prevented intrusion into the passenger compartment,or that the alternative design guard would have caused the jeep to rotate away from the truck on impact,rather than continuing further into the trash body.ox bodies did not raise these objections in its motion in limine or in its objections at trial.arguably,the contention is waived.sierra club wagner,cir.but even assuming that the more general argument that ponder has not shown that his alternative design would have prevented maribel injuries was properly raised,that argument goes to the credibility of his testimony that the design was safer.as these arguments were appropriate to make to the jury when it weighed the evidence,they do not lead us to conclude that the testimony admission was in error.
in short,admitting ponder testimony on alternative design was not a meaningful error in judgment,ruiz troche,at quoting anderson cryovac,cir,and we affirm the magistrate judge decision to admit his testimony.
the sole issue in quilez appeal is whether the magistrate judge erred by not holding ox bodies jointly and severally for the entire damages award.that decision was based on a particular reading of the puerto rico supreme court decisions in cortijo walker water res,widow of andino water res,and rosario crespo water res.see quilez velar,wl,at.on our reading,those precedents do not clearly answer the question at hand,and the question raises important public policy concerns.because the issue is determinative of quilez appeal,we find the prudent course is to certify the question to that court better suited to address the issue.pagán colón walgreens of san patricio,cir.we explain,without in any sense meaning to influence the outcome.
the underlying assumption of the magistrate judge reasoning is that ox bodies had no right of contribution against the municipality of san juan and that it necessarily followed that quilez could not recover the sum of against ox bodies on a joint and several liability theory.there are many questions,as discussed below,about whether contribution is or is not available,and whether the reasoning tying the existence of contribution to the existence of joint and several liability is valid under puerto rico law.quilez posits that even if ox bodies does not have a right of contribution,ox bodies is nonetheless responsible to quilez as a jointly and severally liable defendant.that is,the municipal cap does not excuse ox bodies from paying the sum of and so,it can not have the effect of shifting the risk of of the full sum to quilez.
the magistrate judge march,order read the puerto rico supreme court decision in cortijo walker,which disallowed a suit by a defendant against a plaintiff employer covered by puerto rico workmen compensation statute,at,to preclude ox bodies from seeking contribution from the municipality of san juan.quilez velar,wl,at.then,the magistrate judge held that,under widow of andino and rosario crespo,where a defendant general right to contribution is lost due to a statutory immunity,wl,at,in a tort action a defendant should be held liable for the damage only in proportion to its fault,id.at quoting widow of andino,at see rosario crespo,at ox bodies urges us to affirm based on this reasoning.
quilez disputes both steps in the court reasoning.quilez argues that the cap on municipal damages at issue here is not analogous to the workmen compensation statute remedial restriction in cortijo walker.this view,according to quilez,finds some support in the statutory text.the statutory scheme in cortijo walker was a workmen compensation scheme barring all tort actions against covered employers.see cortijo walker,at quoting the workmen accident compensation act of,which established that compensation under the act shall be the only remedy against the employer.in contrast,the municipal damages cap codified at laws ann.tit,permits liability in c laims against municipalities for personal or property damages caused by the fault or negligence of the municipality up to a certain amount,in this case up to the the collectible indemnity actually provided by the municipality of san juan insurance policy,laws ann.tit.see quilez velar,wl,at.other jurisdictions have recognized this type of municipal damages cap as a partial waiver of sovereign immunity.see,morris,the governmental liability limitation is contained in the same sentence in which sovereign immunity is waived the cap is one term of the waiver.in this case,there is an argument that because the municipal damages cap operates differently than the remedial restriction in the workmen compensation statute by permitting suits up to a certain amount of damages,ox bodies is able to seek at least partial contribution from the municipality of san juan.it is notable that the municipality of san juan has acted consistent with this view,including by depositing its insurance policy limit with the puerto rico court.even while ruling that ox bodies lacked a right of contribution against the municipality of san juan,the magistrate judge noted that t heoretically,ox bodies could seek contribution from the municipality up to the limits of its insurance policy.quilez velar,wl,at 
ox bodies counters that the municipal cap and the workmen compensation remedial restriction provision are materially indistinguishable.it points to the magistrate judge reading of cortijo walker as holding that where a statute precludes a party liability,a claim against that party is prohibited because it would amount to doing indirectly what the lawmaker has forbidden to be done directly.cortijo walker,at.in ox bodies view,the magistrate judge correctly interpreted the municipal damages cap here as a legislative policy choice to protect the municipal fisc and any right to contribution as a forbidden attempt to indirectly get at that fisc.see quilez velar,wl,at.
quilez suggests that ox bodies has misunderstood cortijo walker reasoning,suggesting that the quoted language is dicta,and the court holding actually resides in the preceding paragraph.there,the cortijo walker court reasoned that the right to contribution was lacking because under the particular statutory scheme the workmen compensation statute t he employer is not liable to the workman in tort,and so he can not be a joint tortfeasor with the third person and plaintiff.at.the court explained that the defendant lacked a right of contribution against the plaintiff employer because t he workman claim or remedy against his employer is solely for the statutory benefits his claim against the third party is for damages.both causes of action are in law different in kind and they can not result in a common legal liability.id.quilez argues that cortijo walker reasoning is inapposite,as the action here against ox bodies and the action against the municipality of san juan both seek damages based in tort the magistrate judge has determined the municipality of san juan to be a,see quilez velar ox bodies,no.civ,wl,at,quilez velar,wl,at,and ox bodies has not contested that ruling.quilez suggests that practical inability to obtain contribution here because of a deposit with the puerto rico court that only by happenstance preceded judgment in the federal suit poses a legal question concerning proper allocation of risk of from a liable defendant,not concerning whether ox bodies is unable to seek contribution because of some kind of immunity.
quilez also views the magistrate judge subsequent reliance on widow of andino and rosario crespo for the rule that a defendant should be held liable for the damage only in proportion to its fault,widow of andino,at see rosario crespo,at,as misplaced see quilez velar,wl,at.quilez asserts that puerto rico case law almost always prioritizes a plaintiff recovery through joint and several liability.joint and several liability is t he rule.szendrey hospicare,tspr,wl,see ruiz troche,at applying puerto rico law ramos caparra dairy,offic.trans.quilez acknowledges that the right to contribution establishes that the onerous effect between the joint tortfeasors should be distributed in proportion to their respective degree of negligence,szendrey,wl,but,in the usual case,quilez argues,the risk of of one debtor is placed on the defendants,not the plaintiff,id.the theory is that even if ox bodies lacks a right of contribution either in fact or in law the general rule of joint and several liability should apply.no puerto rico supreme court case cited by the parties resolves this issue,which the parties also concede.
ultimately,we lack sufficient guidance to allow us reasonably to predict which of our options the puerto rico supreme court would choose,carrasquillo ortiz am.airlines,cir quoting pagán colón,at.because the allocation of risk is an important question of puerto rico tort law,it is determinati
