donald malen slipped while getting off his reconditioned riding lawn mower and injured his foot on the rotating blade.he and his wife sued the manufacturer and seller,claiming that the mower was defective in design and construction.the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants because undisputed evidence established that malen own actions were the sole proximate cause of his injury.but viewing the record in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs and taking all inferences in their favor,we conclude that a jury could find that the mower was both defective and the proximate cause of malen injury.therefore,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants and remand for further proceedings.
background 
before his injury malen had operated riding lawn mowers for more than years.in he purchased a riding mower at home depot that was manufactured by mtd products in and advertised as reconditioned power equipment with a full manufacturer warranty.the mower was designed with a safety interlock system.one component of that system is the operator presence control,or opc,a device which kills the engine if the operator rises from the seat without first disengaging the cutting blade and setting the parking brake.a second component is the no cut in reverse switch,or ncr,which kills the engine if the operator shifts into reverse without first disengaging the blade.the american national standards institute ansi did not make an ncr compulsory until,but by the organization had mandated that riding mowers had to have an opc that will stop the engine and fully arrest the blade within five seconds of being triggered.before malen purchased the mower,he tested it under the supervision of a home depot sales employee.during that test ride malen never rose from the seat with the engine running,but it is not disputed that he operated the machine in reverse while the blade was engaged.
a label on the mower in front of the seat warns the operator to protect against death or serious injury 
do not operate the unit where it could slip or tip.
be sure blade s and engine are stopped before placing hands or feet near blade s.
before leaving the operator position,disengage blade s,place the shift lever in neutral,engage the parking brake,shut off and remove key.
malen had read and understood these admonishments,and over the next three years he operated the mower to times without incident.but then in october he was mulching leaves with the mower and wedged the right front tire over a curb.he tried without success to free the machine by rocking his weight in the seat and shifting gears between forward and reverse.at that point malen raised the cutting deck,removed his foot from the pedal which engages the blade,and started to dismount.but he did not turn off the engine or listen to confirm whether the blade had stopped spinning.it had not.as malen rose from the seat and stepped off the mower,his left foot slipped under the cutting deck and was struck by the rotating blade.the lacerations to the sole of his foot were severe,and he will not regain full use of his foot.it is undisputed that neither the opc nor the ncr functioned when the accident occurred.
the malens sued mtd products and home depot in the circuit court of cook county,illinois.donald malen asserted claims for strict products liability and negligence,and his wife claimed loss of consortium.the malens contended that the lawn mower manufactured by mtd products and sold by home depot was negligently manufactured and unreasonably dangerous because its opc was not connected and thus inoperable.they also contended that the mower was negligently designed because mtd products had shunned a fail safe system that would have made the cutting blade unusable even without the opc connected.finally,the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants had failed to warn the operator about the defects in the mower.the defendants removed the suit to federal court under diversity jurisdiction.see.
at his deposition donald malen gave the following account of his accident.when the right front tire dropped over the curb and became wedged against it,he tried to free the mower by shifting between forward and reverse and rocking in the seat with the engine running.when this effort was unsuccessful,malen decided to dismount and lift the front of the mower back atop the curb.he lifted his foot from the pedal which engages the cutting blade that effort,malen thought,had stopped the blade,but he acknowledged the possibility that the pedal had been locked into the on position and that removing his foot from the pedal had not unlocked it.it was not his practice,malen added,to dismount a riding mower with the blade spinning,but the engine was still running so he could not hear whether the blade was rotating.malen,who did not know that the mower was designed with an opc or ncr,then rose from his seat and put his left foot on the ground while swinging his right leg across the mower to the left.he slipped,and the blade caught his left foot and pulled him to the ground.he testified initially that the blade struck his boot and stopped for two to six seconds before resuming its rotation and cutting him when he tried pulling his foot away.later in the deposition,however,malen said no when specifically asked whether the blade had stopped on first contact with his boot.this apparent inconsistency was never clarified.according to malen,the entire the time he drove off the curb until his foot was cut by the between and seconds.and,he said,it was a very short time,more than the clap of a hand but probably only a couple of seconds,between the time he rose from the seat and when his foot was sliced by the blade.
the defendants dispute malen testimony.they rely on the treatment notes of narendra patel,the surgeon who repaired the lacerations on the sole of malen foot.in his notes patel wrote that malen had tried to dislodge the mower by planting his left foot on the ground,lifting the mower by the steering wheel,and stepping on the speed control.yet at his deposition patel could not recall the source of this account.and he conceded that the scenario described in his treatment notes would have resulted in lacerations to the top,not the sole,of malen foot.
malen did not recall telling patel how the accident happened.and donald pacheco,a mechanical engineer retained by malen,rejected the chain of events described by patel.pacheco opined that the riding mower could not have been lifted by simultaneously depressing the speed control what mtd products calls the go pedal and pulling on the steering wheel.the opposing forces from these actions,pacheco said,would have canceled each other.
pacheco initial inspection had verified that the mower could be operated in forward,neutral,and reverse with the cutting blade engaged and no weight in the seat.another inspection conducted jointly with personnel from mtd products reproduced this result,which,the parties agree,could not have happened if the opc and ncr were functioning.close examination disclosed that the wiring for the opc and ncr was not connected.the contacts were grimy,so pacheco knew that the wires had not been connected for some time.and after removing the dirt,he did not find scratches on any of the contacts,so he concluded that neither of the safety devices had been connected in the first place.moreover,pacheco was certain that the ncr was not connected when home depot sold the reconditioned machine,since malen had run the mower in reverse with the blade engaged while testing it at the store.during the joint inspection,the wires to the opc and the ncr were attached,and afterward both devices functioned properly.the cutting blade came to a full stop seconds after the opc was triggered,well below the existing and current ansi limit.
based on his inspections and review of malen deposition,pacheco opined that the safety interlock system on malen reconditioned mower was defective.pacheco surmised that malen had inadvertently depressed and locked the pedal which engages the cutting blade.that pedal,had it been unlocked,would have disengaged the blade when malen removed his foot.still,pacheco insisted,the opc and ncr should have protected malen against a blade that was locked in the on position.a functioning opc,he reasoned,would have killed the engine as soon as malen rose from the seat with the blade engaged.the very purpose of an opc,pacheco explained,is to safeguard an operator who neglects to stop the blade before dismounting,when clearing an obstacle from the path of the mower.likewise,pacheco continued,a functioning ncr would have shut down the engine as soon as malen put the mower in reverse without first disengaging the blade.
pacheco also reported that a fail safe version of the opc was available for this model well before malen purchased his reconditioned unit.pacheco explained that an opc employs a switch to allow or inhibit the flow of an electric current.the opc utilized when malen mower was built in was configured with a normally closed default as long as the operator weight remained in the seat,the opc switch would stay open and prevent current from passing.but if the operator rose from the seat with the blade engaged,the switch would revert to its normally closed position and allow current to pass and activate a kill switch on the engine.if an opc of this design is not connected,pacheco continued,no current will ever reach and trigger the kill switch,whether or not there is weight in the seat.in effect,an unconnected opc of this design is no different than having an operator in the seat at all times.by the time malen mower was built,pacheco noted,mtd products already had redesigned the opc to be normally open.the new version employed the operator weight in the seat to close a switch and allow current to pass if the circuit was because the operator was not in the seat or the opc was engine could not run.in june a service kit was developed to retrofit existing mowers with the new design,and after december the new design was incorporated into all newly manufactured units.mtd products did not issue a recall for the service kit.pacheco installed one on malen mower and then disconnected a wire to test whether the redesigned opc was fail safe.after the opc was disconnected,the engine died if the cutting blade was engaged.pacheco opined that malen injury could not have occurred with the new design because the cutting blade was unusable unless the opc was connected.
pacheco assessment is corroborated by deposition testimony from several employees of mtd products.mark holland,the company manager of standards compliance,tested malen mower before pacheco installed the service kit and confirmed that its engine and blade did not stop when he rose from the seat or put the machine in reverse.according to holland,if all the systems were functioning correctly,the engine should have shut down.michael miller,a vice president of product development and safety,testified that the opc was redesigned to be normally open because the normally closed version continued to draw current and drain the battery if the operator inadvertently left the key in the ignition.gunter plamper,the vice president of safety,conceded that mtd products knew that the mower as originally designed would still operate if its safety interlock system failed.he also acknowledged that the riding mower purchased by malen was designed so that users could disconnect the opc or ncr and still use the mower,but he insisted that the two devices could not accidentally become disconnected.plamper authenticated a management directive that new consumer products be evaluated before production with an eye toward possible hazards related to the use misuse of the product.
mtd products and home depot moved for summary judgment.the defendants argued that the sold to malen was not unreasonably dangerous because the source of the rotating cutting blade,according to the open and obvious to all users of the product.malen knew the inherent risk,the defendants insisted,because his normal practice after years of using riding lawn mowers was to disengage the blade before dismounting.and the particular mower was not defective,the defendants continued,because its it was connected after the in compliance with ansi standards,and malen evidence had not excluded the possibility that a third party disconnected the safety devices before malen purchased the mower.the defendants also insisted malen own conduct,not a defect in the mower,was the proximate cause of his injury.malen had testified that his foot slipped under the cutting deck within a very short period of time of touching the ground,and since the ansi standard allows five seconds for an opc to arrest the blade,the defendants reasoned that malen would have been injured even if the opc had been connected.
the malens countered that the unconnected opc,not the cutting blade,was the reason the reconditioned mower was unreasonably dangerous.that danger was concealed,the plaintiffs maintained,though they also noted that illinois does not shield against liability for injuries caused by an open and obvious hazard unless the nature of the risk outranks every other factor to be considered in weighing the inherent design risks against the utility of the product as manufactured.blue envtl.eng g.the plaintiffs insisted that the mower was defective because its opc did not work and was not designed to be fail safe,but they no longer pressed their theory that the defendants were liable for failing to warn donald malen about the missing safety devices.the plaintiffs further argued that factual questions remained in dispute concerning the cause of malen injury.
the district court granted the defendants motion.malen mtd,c,wl,at.the court accepted the defendants premise that the cutting blade,not the unconnected opc,was the source of danger in the lawn mower.id.at.the court acknowledged,however,that the defendants could not escape liability simply by asserting that all riding lawn mowers are inherently dangerous.id.yet the court reasoned that summary judgment was appropriate on the ground that malen conduct had been the sole cause of his accident.according to the district court,the undisputed evidence established that malen drove the mower off the curb,was aware of and understood the warning labels on the mower,and ignored those labels by dismounting the mower with the cutting deck raised,the engine running,and the cutting blade engaged.id.at.this view of the evidence,the court noted,was consistent with patel account of the accident.id.at.and since malen was at fault,the court continued,it was unnecessary to decide whether the mower was defective.id.at.
ii.discussion 
the malens argue on appeal that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for the defendants on the basis that donald malen actions were the sole proximate cause of his accident and injury.the malens insist that the reconditioned mower was negligently manufactured and unreasonably dangerous because it did not have a working opc.the mower was also defective in design,the malens contend,because the opc used by mtd products was not fail safe.for their part,the defendants finally acknowledge the malens theory that the mower was defective because of the design and manufacture of its opc,not because it has a cutting blade like all lawn mowers.the defendants have now abandoned their contention that the hazard was open and obvious,but they still contend that the plaintiffs evidence would not establish that the mower was defective or that its opc was a substantial cause of malen injury.according to the defendants,the plaintiffs evidence does not exclude the possibility that a third party tampered with the mower,nor does their evidence establish that a properly functioning opc would have stopped the blade quickly enough to prevent malen injury.the district court was correct to conclude,say the defendants,that malen negligence caused his injury.

a.a jury could find that the lawn mower was defective.
the defendants argued on summary judgment that malen evidence would not sustain a jury finding that his reconditioned was unreasonably dangerous,or that it was negligently designed and assembled.the district court did not reach this contention,but the defendants are free to renew it and do.see bivens trent,cir srail vill.of lisle,cir.
a jury could find that a riding lawn mower is defective if the machine lacks an opc to stop the blade should the operator lose control or disembark with the blade engaged.hubbard mcdonough power,accord norton snapper power,div.of fuqua,cir applying florida law eyre mcdonough power,cir applying louisiana law see d products design of rotary mower supp.mtd products and home depot have not questioned the plaintiffs premise that a riding mower sold without a working opc would fall short of industry standards and be defective,nor have they disputed that the reconditioned mower purchased by malen did not have a functioning opc or ncr at the time of his accident.still,the defendants maintain,a jury could not find that the mower was defective because it was designed with an opc,the device functioned within the ansi parameter when connected after the accident,and the plaintiffs did not exclude the possibility that a third party disconnected the opc after the mower was built in.
manufacturers and sellers are strictly liable for injuries caused by unreasonably dangerous products unless an unforeseen alteration by a third party introduced the unsafe condition.see peterson lou bachrodt chevrolet,brdar cottrell,monreal foundry mach,wiedemann indus.erectors.in this case mtd products and home depot speculate that at some point after assembly a nefarious even with the mower and disconnected its opc and ncr.and yet malen testified that he did not disconnect either safety device after buying the mower,and the defendants produced no evidence to the contrary.nor did they suggest that an interloper snuck into malen storage shed and disconnected these features.the principal inference the defendants seek to create is that a prior owner altered the lawn mower,but donald pacheco,malen expert,testified at his deposition that there were no scratches on the contacts where the wiring for the opc and ncr should have been connected at the factory,a fact that led pacheco to surmise that these safety devices were never connected before the accident.
the defendants did not submit much of their own evidence to directly challenge pacheco conclusion.daniel martens,the manufacturer chief engineer for product safety,testified at his deposition that quality assurance for this model was outsourced to abs technical services only a small number of units were shipped to company headquarters for an internal audit,and martens had not located evidence suggesting that malen mower was one of them.martens insisted that a written protocol governed inspections done by abs,but he did not produce a protocol and could not identify the purported document by name or even describe its contents.abs did have a form to document its inspections,but martens conceded that the form was not always used and that mtd products had not found a completed form for the mower purchased by malen.at his deposition martens authenticated a completed form corresponding to a similar mower that had passed inspection by abs,but he could not explain why the individual check box to verify testing of the opc was unmarked.nor was an explanation supplied by mark holland,who was responsible for standards compliance at mtd products.holland speculated that abs had probably been unconcerned with the little detail stuff and was focused on a bottom line determination of whether the unit had passed or failed.and yet holland was certain,he said,that abs would have tested the opc.the testimony from these witnesses does not foreclose the likelihood that the mower left the factory without a functioning safety interlock system.see united states.warner,cir excluded evidence of previous sporadic rate increases was not type of regular response to specific,repetitive situation that would allow finder of fact to infer that increase initiated by defendants was routine thompson boggs,cir under federal rule of evidence habit is established only through evidence of practice sufficiently uniform and regular that finder of fact could conclude that practice was undertaken almost always simplex,diversified energy,cir district court properly refused to admit evidence of late deliveries and defective performance on unrelated contracts as evidence that company habit was to engage in such practices.neither witness was qualified to say how abs routinely conducted its testing,and their speculation about the regularity or thoroughness of the process would not preclude a jury from inferring that malen mower was never subjected to a comprehensive inspection procedure that was uniformly applied to all production.see truhlar postal,cir speculation about motive for union representative conduct was insufficient to resolve issue at summary judgment malawy richards,manufacturer of failed medical device could not overcome summary judgment on claim for indemnity against hospital by relying on expert speculation that unknown hospital employee had mishandled device tardella rjr nabisco,summary judgment proper for candy manufacturer where company detailed evidence of procedures would preclude jury from reasonably finding that pin in plaintiff candy bar was present when it left factory.
on this record,then,a jury reasonably could find that malen mower was shipped from the factory in with its opc still unconnected.that defect would make the mower unreasonably dangerous if the theory is strict products liability.and the very nature of the safety device that would have functioned except that it was never wired during establishes a breach of the standard of care if the theory is negligent manufacture.see todd societe bic,cir en banc applying illinois law of negligent design phillips waco,same.
significantly,though,the defendants have not explained why it matters for strict liability whether the opc was connected during assembly.as noted,the exclusion of liability for unsafe conditions created by consumers does not hold for modifications that are foreseeable and easily accomplished.brdar,at davis,woods graham eng g,wiedemann,at dearmond hoover ball bearing,uniloy.during discovery mtd products disclosed that consumers easily could override the opc on the model owned by malen apparently it was enough to yank a single lead from its terminal.what more,the defendants admitted that malen lawn mower was designed to permit continued operation if the opc was unconnected.according to gunter plamper,the vice president of safety,mtd products had expected that some owners would dislike the opc and try to override it the company had feared that greater damage and further safety issues might arise if the process of defeating the opc was made complicated.perhaps this testimony was intended to bolster the inference that the opc was disconnected after the lawn mower left the factory in.
the defendants also ignore another wrinkle.what if mtd products had not anticipated tampering or had made the task of disconnecting the opc difficult with strict liability,unforeseen defects introduced by prior owners can not be attributed to manufacturers or sellers when used goods are marketed.see court grzelinksi,peterson,at timm indian springs recreation ass n,n,abel motors.but home depot did not sell the mower to malen.he bought a reconditioned unit backed by a full manufacturer warranty that much is beyond dispute because the advertisement is in evidence.what missing are details about the reconditioning.we can not tell from the record whether the defendants ever complied with a discovery demand to identify who reconditioned the mower at summary judgment mtd products simply denied performing the work and implied that it relies on authorized dealers,which home depot was not.and yet the defendants have not suggested that home depot ad was false or misleading,or that malen was told by the sales associate that reconditioned really meant something less.
we have not found a controlling illinois decision,but the defendants do not contend that illinois courts would distinguish reconditioned products from those newly manufactured.reconditioning or remanufacturing a product is different from servicing or repairing the item.reconditioning extends the useful life beyond what was contemplated at the point of manufacture and effectively creates a new product.this court and others have recognized the distinction in assessing when a product is first sold for purposes of a statute of limitations or repose.see richardson gallo equip,cir applying indiana law arnold riddell,applying kansas law divis clarklift of.the distinction was also noted in tidemann nadler golf car sales,f d,cir,a diversity action that included a claim of strict products liability under illinois law.in that case the plaintiff had argued that reconditioned products,unlike used goods marketed without alteration,should be characterized as new rather than used,in particular when advertised as like new.id.we passed on whether the illinois courts would endorse this position,id.at,but we recognized its acceptance in the restatement third of torts,which underscores that consumers expect remanufactured or reconditioned products to present no greater risk of defect than if new,restatement third of torts products liability c,cmt.i see also d products liability am.law of products liability.the restatement adopts the position that strict products liability is appropriate for remanufactured products,restatement third of torts products liability c,and the illinois courts typically endorse the restatement position in the absence of controlling authority,eckburg presbytery of blackhawk of presbyterian church usa,vena vena,randall lemke,d,pratt kilborn motors.courts in other states already have recognized that rebuilding or reconditioning a used product is akin to first manufacture and thus the commercial sale of a reconditioned product can give rise to a claim of strict liability.peterson,cal arriaga citicapital commercial,d,gaumer rossville truck tractor,michalko cooke color chem,anderson olmstead util,ohio crandell larkin jones appliance.
the plaintiffs have produced enough evidence to establish,by any of several means,that malen mower was unreasonably dangerous.and the evidence that the opc was never connected at the factory also provides the foundation for the plaintiffs claim against mtd products for negligent manufacture.what left is the plaintiffs contention that the mower was further defective in design because its opc was not fail safe.on this question,too,there is sufficient evidence for a jury to find for the plaintiffs.
to establish liability on a theory of negligent design,a plaintiff must show duty,breach,proximate cause,and damages.see,calles,at jablonski,at.although strict liability is concerned only with the condition of the product,negligence involves a defendant fault in addition to the product condition.calles,at jablonski,at henry panasonic factory automation.so in addition to showing that the product was defective,the plaintiff must show that the manufacturer knew or should have known that the product was unsafe.calles,at jablonski,at sobczak motors.
mtd products insists that the design of the could not have been negligent because the design incorporated an opc.but that contention misunderstands malen claim.he does not contend that the design was flawed because no provision was made for an opc he claims instead that mtd products should have made the opc fail safe,meaning that if and in malen case,when the opc failed,the mower should have been inoperable.a design defect is established by evidence of a practical,alternative that was technologically feasible and would have prevented malen injury.see hansen baxter healthcare,kerns engelke,stallings black decker.malen expert,pacheco,identified the service kit issued in june as a safer,readily available alternative.under this normally open design,if the safety interlock system failed,the mower became inoperable.this revision,pacheco noted,was first contemplated in october,before malen mower was constructed,and the service kit to retrofit existing units was released before malen mower was reconditioned.that the revision was mtd products very own design,was conceived before malen mower was built,and was incorporated into later models is evidence from which a jury could find that the original,normally closed design was defective.see jablonski,at concluding that whether manufacturer breached standard of care in design of gas tank was jury question where plaintiff expert stated that manufacturer upgrade kit evidenced safe and feasible alternative sobczak,at concluding that jury should decide if design of system was defective where manufacturer engineers had acknowledged that company knew of safer alternative.
mtd products countered that its redesign was not foolproof and thus could not raise an inference that the original design was defective.again the company misses the point.though pacheco acknowledged that a consumer could conceivably bypass the new,normally open design,he also testified that the design was fail safe if the redesigned opc was left unconnected at the factory or became disconnected without the consumer knowledge,the mower would not run with the cutting blade engaged.a determined consumer might have been able to rewire the mower to bypass the,the redesign was not it was undisputed that malen injury could not have occurred had he been using a with the redesigned safety interlock system.see berrier simplicity,cir applying pennsylvania law in concluding that newly designed ncr,even though it could be bypassed,could have lessened or eliminated plaintiff injury and thus evidenced that original design was defective eyre,at applying louisiana law in concluding that district court erred in setting aside verdict for plaintiff who proved that feasible redesign of opc would have prevented injuries sustained when plaintiff fell from riding mower.
based on what we have explained above,we conclude that a reasonable jury could find that the lawn mower was defective.
b.a jury could conclude that the mower was the proximate cause of the injury.
the district court concluded,however,that malen evidence establishes that he was injured because of his own negligence and not because of the defective mower the defendants press this contention on appeal.proximate cause encompasses two requirements and legal cause.young bryco arms,lee chi.transit.if multiple factors have combined to cause an injury,illinois law asks whether the defendant conduct was a substantial factor in bringing about the injury
