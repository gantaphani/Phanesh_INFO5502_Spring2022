david jessen appeals from the judgment entered after the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of mentor corporation in this product liability action.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
on october,jessen had a cancerous testicle removed and replaced with a testicular prosthesis,a class iii medical device,designed,manufactured,labeled and sold by mentor as the mentor testicular prosthesis.the prosthesis,which had been shipped unfilled,was not filled with saline solution prior to implantation as directed in the enclosed instructions.the prosthesis became deformed,causing jessen pain,and ultimately had to be replaced.
on october,jessen filed a form complaint against mentor alleging causes of action for strict liability,negligence and breach of warranty the essence of jessen claims is that mentor failed to include a warning on the outer packaging of the prosthesis that it must be filled prior to implantation on june,the trial court granted mentor motion for summary judgment on the ground jessen state law claims were preempted by federal law 
contentions 
jessen contends there is a triable issue of fact whether the testicular prosthesis is a class iii medical device subject to federal preemption and,even if it is,his claims are not preempted.

law governing federal preemption of state law claims involving medical devices 
the medical device amendments of et mda to the food,drug and cosmetic act et,enacted to provide for the safety and effectiveness of medical devices intended for human use medtronic,lohr,d medtronic,classify medical devices into three categories based on the risk they pose to the public.medtronic,at.armstrong,supra,th at,d.class iii medical devices,which pose the greatest risk,are subject to the most stringent controls.scott ciba vision th,d scott.examples of class iii devices include pacemakers,silicone inflatable breast prostheses and solid or silicone rubber prosthes es that are implanted surgically to resemble a testicle see goldsmith mentor,no triable issue of fact whether mentor large testicular prosthesis,which contained reinforced,molded silicone elastomer,was class iii medical device 
before a new class iii device may be introduced to the market,the manufacturer must provide the food and drug administration fda with a reasonable assurance that the device is both safe and effective.see d.despite its relatively innocuous phrasing,the process of establishing this reasonable assurance,which is known as the premarket approval,or pma process,is a rigorous one.manufacturers must submit detailed information regarding the safety and efficacy of their devices,which the fda then reviews,spending an average of hours on each submission.medtronic,supra,at.a product labeling is also within the purview of the pma process.d a,b,d steele collagen th,d steele fda retains rigid control over the entirety of the labeling and packaging of class iii products the product sponsor must submit a proposed label to the fda for analysis and review prior to gaining pma for the product accord,scott,supra,th at,d.
once a product has received premarket approval,it may be marketed scott,supra,th at,d but the product is subject to the federal,requirement of adhering to the standards contained in its individual,federally approved pma.see riegel medtronic,cir,cert.granted june,d.the manufacturer can not make any changes that may affect the safety or effectiveness of the device without further fda approval.any subsequent changes in the product require submission of a pma supplement application.ibid.while the design or labeling of a device may be changed to enhance the safety without prior approval from the fda,the manufacturer must submit to the fda a pma supplement and obtain acknowledgment from the fda of receipt of the supplement.the device is still subject to withdrawal from the market if the fda determines any changes have rendered it unsafe or the labeling inadequate.steele,supra,th at,d.
the mda includes an express preemption provision which prohibits states from imposing any requirement which is different from,or in addition to,federal requirements relating to the safety or effectiveness of medical devices intended for human use.evraets intermedics intraocular,th,d.the fda has promulgated an interpretative regulation providing,state or local requirements are preempted only when the fda has established specific counterpart regulations or there are other specific requirements applicable to a particular device under the act,thereby making any existing divergent state or local requirements applicable to the device different from,or in addition to,the specific fda requirements.d.a state law requirement may be established by statute,ordinance,regulation,or court decision b thus,state common law claims may be preempted by the mda.armstrong,supra,th at,d.
a majority of california and federal courts have concluded all state common law claims relating to the safety or effectiveness of a device,other than those based on a violation of fda requirements,are preempted see,blanco baxter healthcare th,d although medtronic court was fractured,five justices agreed state damages actions do impose requirements and are therefore preempted where such requirements would differ from those imposed by the mda steele,supra,th at,d state requirements in the form of standards of care or behavior are preempted and can not form the basis of a state common law claim for damages if they are different from or in addition to the specific federal requirements arising from the pma process scott,supra,th at,d r ecent cases illustrate the complete preemptive effect of the pma process on state law tort claims involving inadequate labeling or failure to warn in re sulzer hip prosthesis and knee prosthesis d,fn.cases from seven federal circuits reveal that a preempts almost every type of state law claim that seeks to hold a defendant liable for a medical device the only exception is a claim that the medical device failed to conform with the fda requirements prescribed by the pma kanter th,d substantial similarity between the premarket approval and new drug application processes compels the conclusion that the latter also establishes a federal requirement with respect to labeling that can have preemptive effect on conflicting state requirements.the design,manufacture,and labeling of the device,as approved by the fda as safe and effective after the device has undergone the pma process,are the specific federal requirements giving rise to preemption.citations.they constitute a federal regulatory standard of care.steele,at,d.the fda has also unequivocally expressed the opinion that state common law claims such as those for defective design and manufacture and failure to warn of the alleged defect against a device are preempted.horn thoratec cir,fn.because the fda is the federal agency to which congress has delegated its authority to implement the provisions of the mda,the agency is uniquely qualified to determine whether a particular form of state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress,citation and,therefore,whether it should be.medtronic,supra,at.
notwithstanding the weight of authority,jessen contends this court should follow armstrong,supra,th,d,in which division one of this court held there was no preemption of the plaintiffs state law claims for negligence,strict liability and breach of warranty arising out of the use of intraocular class iii medical device that had completed the pma cataract surgery.relying on the exception to preemption in the fda regulations for state or local requirements of general applicability where the purpose of the requirement relates either to other products in addition to devices,requirements such as general electrical codes,and the uniform commercial code warranty of fitness,or to unfair trade practices in which the requirements are not limited to devices d and its understanding of the united states supreme courts decision in medtronic,supra,division one explained,t he state law requirements imposed by the negligence claim,the duty of a manufacturer to avoid foreseeable dangers in making a product or to inform users of potentially dangerous products of the risks involved were not specifically developed with respect to medical devices.citation.rather,they are requirements of general applicability where the purpose of the requirement relates to other products in addition to medical devices.citation.these state requirements therefore escape because their generality leaves them outside the category of requirements that envisioned to be with respect to specific devices armstrong,at,d.the court further concluded armstrongs theory of strict liability was also based on general principles of state tort law that were not specifically developed with respect to medical devices,and thus was not preempted.id.at,d.
the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of mentor 
jessen claims are subject to federal preemption 
recognizing that neither the united states nor the california supreme court has given a definitive answer to the question raised by this case we conclude our third district colleagues in steele,supra,th,d,like the majority of other courts that have analyzed the issue,correctly concluded state common law tort actions relating to the safety or effectiveness of devices are preempted by the mda.as the steele court explained,in his opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment justice cast the critical fifth vote in the decision in medtronic,supra.from the plurality opinion of justice stevens to emphasize he was not convinced that future incidents of mda preemption of claims will be few or rare.id.at.conc.opn.of breyer.noting that federal preemption was triggered by state imposition of any requirement that differs from federal requirements relating to the safety or effectiveness of medical devices intended for human use,justice breyer wrote that o ne can reasonably read the word requirement as including the legal requirements that grow out of the application,in particular circumstances,of a state tort law.id.at.justice in her opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part,which was joined by the chief justice and justices scalia and thomas,agreed,if language is given its ordinary meaning,it clearly any state action that would impose a requirement different from,or in addition to,that applicable under the as it would a state statute or regulation that had that effect.id.at.conc.dis.opn.of.division one decision in armstrong,supra,th,d essentially ignores justice breyer statement in medtronic,that common law standards of care and behavior impose specific requirements,even though the general duty may not.steele,at,d accord blanco baxter healthcare,supra,th at,d.consequently,jessen state law claims are preempted unless he can demonstrate a triable issue of fact medtronic failed to adhere to federal regulatory standards 
b.the testicular prosthesis is a class iii medical device 
as a threshold matter jessen contends mentor failed to establish the testicular prosthesis is a class iii medical device because it erroneously cited code of federal regulations part a,applicable to silicone inflatable breast prostheses,in its moving mistake also made in a supporting declaration by clarke scherff,a mentor vice president responsible for the management of new product development through the manufacturing process,including compliance with fda regulations mentor and scherff failure to properly cite code of federal regulations part,which states solid or silicone rubber prosthes es that are implanted surgically to resemble a testicle are class iii medical devices,does not create a triable issue of fact whether the mentor testicular prosthesis at issue in this case is in fact a class iii device scherff set forth sufficient facts in his declaration,independent of the erroneous legal citation,describing the pma process and establishing the testicular prosthesis is a class iii medical device it could not be sold to the general public without premarket approval on january,mentor submitted a pma application and on july,after extensive review by the fda,the prosthesis received approval and could thus be sold,but only in accordance with the design,manufacture and labeling specifications approved by the fda.a declaration was submitted by jeanne wyatt,a former employee retained by mentor as a consultant to provide assistance in,among other things,the pma process,stating essentially the same thing.goldsmith mentor,supra.at brief affidavits from regulatory affairs manager describing testicular prosthesis and stating it was class iii medical device sufficient.
in the trial court jessen also attempted to dispute the testicular prosthesis qualifies as a class iii medical device by noting mentor had filed a supplement to its pma,approved on july,to add a warning to the outer packaging that it should be filled with saline prior to implantation.use of the supplement process,in fact,confirms the testicular prosthesis is a class iii medical device.mentor would not have needed a premarket approval supplement unless it had previously received fda authorization through the pma process applicable to class iii medical devices.indeed,jessen himself conceded it is such a device,stating in his opposition brief to mentor motion for summary judgment,class iii devices,of which mentor testicular implant is one,are devices that present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury.underlining in the original.
c.there is no triable issue of fact whether the prosthesis complied with fda labeling requirements imposed through the pma process 
to establish preemption,mentor was required to prove,by way of its statement of undisputed facts,that the testicular implant was designed,manufactured,and labeled according to the specifications approved by the fda.steele,supra,th at,d.mentor met its burden by submitting the declarations of scherff and wyatt,which included the necessary information regarding compliance with all fda specifications jessen,however,contends he presented evidence mentor did not actually comply with the fda requirements regarding labeling,thereby creating a triable issue of fact.objections to the evidence jessen cites were sustained by the trial court,and those rulings have not been challenged on appeal see lopez baca th,d in absence of proper challenge to trial cou
