rashidi wheeler,a football player at northwestern university,died during a team practice.his estate sued northwestern.because wheeler had ingested products on the day he died,northwestern sued the makers of those products for contribution.nutraquest,one of these defendants all of whom were ultimately sued by wheeler as well as by northwestern,filed for bankruptcy and settled with wheeler as did some of the other defendants.the district court approved the settlement,finding that it met the requirements of bankruptcy rule and the illinois joint tortfeasor contribution act,and barred northwestern contribution claims against the settling defendants.we hold that the court properly applied our court factors in approving the settlement under bankruptcy law and that it did not abuse its discretion in finding the settlement was made in good faith under illinois law.we therefore affirm.
factual background and procedural history 
wheeler was a starting safety at northwestern.during a team conditioning test,he collapsed and died.emergency medical personnel did not arrive until almost minutes after wheeler collapse.the cook county medical examiner concluded that he had died from bronchial asthma.
earlier that day,wheeler had taken two supplements containing ephedra and caffeine.one supplement was made by a company called next proteins.the made by phoenix laboratories,at the direction of nutraquest formerly cytodyne technologies.these supplements were purchased at a store owned by general nutrition corporation gnc.ephedra was banned by the food and drug administration in because of the risk of heart arrhythmia and stroke associated with it.
in august wheeler through his parents and,linda will and george wheeler,sued northwestern and its personnel in illinois state court,claiming that he died from an acute asthma attack to which the defendants failed to respond appropriately.northwestern,believing that wheeler death was related to his ingesting the products,filed a complaint seeking contribution from nutraquest,phoenix labs,next proteins,and gnc.wheeler did not initially sue any of these defendants.
in july before the statute of limitations amended his complaint to add claims against the defendants.in october nutraquest filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition under chapter in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of new jersey.five days later,wheeler voluntarily dismissed his claims against the defendants,including nutraquest.
after nutraquest chapter filing,pending and actions were transferred to the district of new jersey on the ground that they were related to the bankruptcy filing in that district.wheeler moved for a remand back to illinois state court,but the district court denied his motion.the court and the bankruptcy parties began resolving the tort claims in an organized way nutraquest retained litigation counsel,steering committees were created,and test cases were designated and set for trial in early.
in september wheeler entered into a tentative settlement agreement with nutraquest,phoenix labs,and gnc.the settlement was for in cash from each of the settling defendants and an allowed general unsecured claim against nutraquest bankruptcy estate.northwestern contrasts this comparatively small sum with the millions of dollars wheeler sought from it.nutraquest insurer is paying nutraquest and gnc shares of the cash settlement.gnc was shielded from direct liability by nutraquest insurer because nutraquest had agreed to indemnify gnc for any liability arising from nutraquest products.when the settlement agreement was executed tentatively pending court approval,wheeler was still within the period allowed by illinois law to reassert his claims against the settling defendants.but by the time the settlement became effective after receiving the required approval,wheeler time for reasserting claims against the settling defendants had expired.
the settlement was conditioned on the district court finding that it complied with the requirements for approval under bankruptcy rule a making a determination that the settlement was entered into with good faith under the illinois joint tortfeasor contribution act.comp.stat.et,and barring northwestern contribution claims against the settling defendants.northwestern objected to the settlement,but the district court approved it in november,barred and dismissed all claims under the illinois contribution act and remanded the case to illinois state court.northwestern appeals the approval of the settlement.

iv.discussion 
a.the district court approval of the settlement under bankruptcy law 
a district court has the authority to approve a compromise or settlement on the bankruptcy trustee motion.fed.a.settlements are favored,but the unique nature of the bankruptcy process means that judges must carefully examine settlements before approving them.see martin,at see also protective comm.for indep.stockholders of tmt trailer ferry,anderson,d.according to tmt trailer,settlements must be fair and equitable.at.the district court approved the nutraquest settlement under both the fair and equitable standard and under the martin test set out more fully below.
we have two issues to decide under the bankruptcy portion of this case.northwestern disputes the court use of martin as the proper test.in any event,northwestern also claims that the court incorrectly approved the settlement both under martin and under the fair and equitable standard of tmt trailer.
was martin the proper standard to use in approving the settlement 
martin provided four criteria for a court to consider when faced with a proposed settlement the probability of success in litigation the likely difficulties in collection the complexity of the litigation involved,and the expense,inconvenience and delay necessarily attending it and the paramount interest of the creditors.martin,at.we followed tmt trailer in listing these factors,id.citing tmt trailer,at,and simply fleshed out its general requirement.
northwestern disputes the use of martin.its primary argument is that martin is only useful when analyzing a settlement of a claim belonging to the debtor,not a claim against the debtor.we disagree.
we did not hold in martin that the factors were only to be used to scrutinize settlements of claims held by the debtor.in fact,martin itself involved a settlement partially of claims against the debtor.the martins contracted to sell their house to the myerses,but the myerses refused to go through with the purchase.id.at.the martins,who had been depending on the sale to go through,found themselves in dire financial straits and had to file a chapter bankruptcy petition.id.both parties filed contract suits in state court,the martins for damages and the myerses for specific performance.id.the trustee proposed settlement provided for the release of both actions.id.
two other points are worth making here.first,the martin factors have been around for a long time,far longer than martin itself or even tmt trailer.second,there are several cases applying these four factors to settlements of claims against debtors.
the martin court t ook its cue from tmt trailer,id.at,but the origin of the four factors can be traced back to a eighth circuit case.four considerations were listed in drexel loomis for scrutinizing a compromise in bankruptcy a the probability of success in the litigation b the difficulties,if any,to be encountered in the matter of collection c the complexity of the litigation involved,and the expense,inconvenience and delay necessa
