this lawsuit arises from plaintiff and appellant paula nelson use of the prescription diet drug dexfenfluramine sold as redux,which was promoted and marketed by defendant and respondent indevus.redux and a similar drug,pondimin both commonly known as were withdrawn from the market in september of,on reports that they could cause valvular heart disease.
nelson took redux for about a month,starting in january of,after she had taken other drugs for about nine months.she stopped taking redux because she was not losing weight.she first contacted an attorney in june of,after she saw the attorney television advertisement,and first had an echocardiogram the means by which valvular heart disease is diagnosed in september of that year.in july,as the result of the echocardiogram,nelson filed this personal injury lawsuit.
indevus moved for summary judgment on the ground that the complaint was barred by the statute of limitations,based in part on a theory of to use its phrase constructive suspicion.indevus contended that under california discovery rule,the statute of limitations began to ran when the dangers of were publicized.nelson argued to the contrary,that an actual suspicion of wrongdoing is required,relying on california law and on code of civil procedure section,and citing her testimony that before she saw the ad in june of,she did not know that drugs could have caused her an injury.the trial court granted the motion and entered judgment for indevus.we reverse.
discussion 
constructive suspicion 
indevus motion principally rested on its contention that under the discovery rule,the statute began to run when the danger of was publicized.that is,although it was undisputed for purposes of summary judgment that nelson did not know about the danger of drugs before the spring of indevus argues that she should have known sooner,when,through newspaper articles,television news reports,and other means,the public in general was given information sufficient to arouse suspicion,and that should have is enough 
in factual support,indevus proffered evidence about the television and newspaper coverage which began in july,when the mayo clinic reported a connection between redux and other drugs and heart disease,and which continued after those drugs were withdrawn from the market and included coverage of litigation after the withdrawal,news reports often cautioned patients to call your doctor to check for heart problems.in addition,indevus proffered evidence that when the drugs were withdrawn wyeth,which also promoted and marketed redux,sent letters to approximately doctors and pharmacists informing them of the potential association of the drugs with heart valve damage and took out ads in unspecified newspapers informing patents of the drugs withdrawal from the market indevus also proffered evidence about the publicity and legal notices surrounding and concerning the november settlement of federal court class action lawsuit against wyeth concerning those drugs.
legally,indevus relies on leading california discovery rule cases.for instance,indevus quotes jolly eli lilly cal d,for the proposition that under the discovery rule,the statute begins to run when the the plaintiff suspects or should suspect that her injury was caused by wrongdoing jolly,supra,cal d at,emphasis added,and cites sanchez south hoover hospital cal d,for its reference to presumptive knowledge,and a plaintiff opportunity to obtain knowledge from sources open to his investigation id.at.indevus concludes that under california law constructive suspicion is enough.
the quotes are accurate,but they distort the holding of the cases cited,and the conclusion indevus draws is wrong.our supreme court has never held that under the discovery rule,the suspicion necessary to trigger the statute may be imputed to a plaintiff,and we do not believe that to be the law.when the cases are read in whole,rather than in isolated quotes,it is clear that a plaintiff duty to investigate does not begin until the plaintiff actually has a reason to investigate.a plaintiff has reason to discover a cause of action when he or she has reason at least to suspect a factual basis for its elements.citations.fox ethicon,cal th,d,emphasis added.w e look to whether the plaintiffs have reason to at least suspect that a type of wrongdoing has injured them.ibid emphasis added.
the statute of limitations does not begin to run when some members of the public have a suspicion of wrongdoing,but only once the plaintiff has a suspicion of wrongdoing.jolly,supra,cal d at,emphasis added.
an examination of the cases indevus cites reveals the flaws in its analysis.
jolly eli lilly was a des case.the plaintiff knew of the des litigation and believed that des had caused her injuries,and thus had a suspicion of wrongdoing.she did not file suit because she did not know who to sue,and the holding of jolly is that the statute was triggered by the knowledge she did have.she was not held to generally available knowledge.
jolly made the should suspect statement in its discussion of another case,kensinger abbott laboratories d.kensinger considered the rule that only ignorance of a critical fact can delay the running of the statute,and determined that wrongful conduct was a critical fact,so that the statutory clock did not begin to tick until the plaintiff knew or reasonably should have known of the facts constituting wrongful conduct,as well as the fact of her injury and its relation to des.jolly,supra,cal d at.
jolly rejected that holding,and held instead that a plaintiff need not be aware of the specific facts necessary to establish the claim that is a process contemplated by pretrial discovery.once the plaintiff has a suspicion of wrongdoing,and therefore an incentive to sue,she must decide whether to file suit or sit on her rights.so long as a suspicion exists,it is clear that the plaintiff must go find the facts she can not wait for the facts to find her.jolly,supra,cal d at.
sanchez south hoover hospital,supra,cal d,is the same.in that medical malpractice case,the plaintiff had a long and difficult labor,a caesarean,a stillborn baby,and complications.by the day of her hospital discharge she suspected that malpractice had caused the stillbirth and the complications.the case held that by the date of her discharge,plaintiff had become alerted to the necessity for investigation and pursuit of her remedies,so that the statute began to run on that date.id.at.
the principle issue on appeal concerned the doctors duty of disclosure,and sanchez reference to presumptive knowledge was in its discussion of the discovery rule.in gutierrez mofid cal d,the supreme court summarized its holding in sanchez the patient is charged with presumptive knowledge of his negligent injury,and the statute commences to run,once he has notice or information of circumstances to put a reasonable person on inquiry,or has the opportunity to obtain knowledge from sources open to his investigation sanchez,supra,at,quoting witkin,cal.procedure ed.actions,citing numerous cases italics added by sanchez.thus,when the patient reasonably founded suspicions have been aroused,and she has actually become alerted to the necessity for investigation and pursuit of her remedies,the period for suit begins.cal d at.gutierrez mofid,supra,cal d at.
the supreme court recently restated the rule a plaintiff has reason to discover a cause of action when he or she has reason at least to suspect a factual basis for its elements.citations.in other words,plaintiffs are required to conduct a reasonable investigation after becoming aware of an injury,and are charged with knowledge of the information that would have been revealed by such an investigation.fox ethicon,supra,cal th at,d.
indevus argument amounts to a contention that,having taken a prescription drug,nelson had an obligation to read newspapers and watch television news and otherwise seek out news of dangerous side effects not disclosed by the prescribing doctor,or indeed by the drug manufacturer,and that if she failed in this obligation,she could lose her right to sue.we see no such obligation.instead,if a person becomes aware of facts which would make
