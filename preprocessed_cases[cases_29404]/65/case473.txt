introduction 
may novartis pharmaceuticals corporation novartis,a former manufacturer of a asthma medication,be liable in negligence for neurological injuries allegedly sustained by twin minors in utero after their mother was prescribed and consumed a generic form of the medication nearly six years after novartis sold its interests in the medication 
the minors allege novartis knew or should have known physicians prescribed its asthma medication to pregnant women for the purpose of preventing or inhibiting preterm labor.they allege studies available to novartis before it sold the rights to its product in showed the drug was not effective for tocolysis inhibiting preterm labor,it could cross the placenta,and it could interfere with fetal development.the minors more clearly contend on appeal novartis had a duty to revise the label warnings while it still owned the drug to indicate a risk to fetal development and its failure to do so contributed to their injuries years later.
we conclude the minors have demonstrated they can amend their complaint to state a claim under california law for negligent failure to warn and negligent misrepresentation based on acts or omissions by novartis prior to,which allegedly caused or contributed to the minors injuries in.in reaching our conclusion,we follow the rationale of conte wyeth,th conte,which applied common law principles of duty and foreseeability to conclude a pharmaceutical manufacturer should shoulder its share of responsibility for injuries caused,at least in part by its negligent dissemination of inaccurate information even though the patient consumed a generic version of the medication manufactured by another company.id.at.
we reject novartis invitation to follow other state authorities,which have held a manufacturer can not be held liable under any theory for an injury caused by a product other than its own.we also reject novartis contention conte is no longer viable after the supreme court decision in crane cal th,which held a pipe and valve manufacturer may not be held liable in strict liability or negligence for harm caused by separate products manufactured by other companies,even if those products were used in conjunction with the pipes and valves.the court did not mention,let alone overrule conte,supra,th,and,even if a product liability analysis could apply,the facts alleged in this case fall within an exception recognized by the supreme court for harm to which the defendant product substantially contributed.we reverse and remand with directions for the trial court to enter a new order sustaining the demurrer with leave to amend the negligence and negligent misrepresentation causes of action.
factual and procedural background 
terbutaline sulfate terbutaline was originally developed and released for use as a bronchodilator in the.it is a or drug designed to act upon the beta receptors located in smooth muscle tissue to cause muscles to relax.the united states food and drug administration fda approved the use of terbutaline for the treatment of asthma in.novartis subsequently obtained a license to manufacture and market the oral form of terbutaline under the trade name brethine and it owned the new drug application nda for this drug until.
drug manufacturers allegedly perceived an opportunity to market terbutaline as a tocolytic to relax uterine smooth muscle tissue to prevent or inhibit preterm labor.a study by a swedish physician,allegedly with ties to the original drug manufacturer,published results of a study of women indicating terbutaline was safe and effective for acute hours and maintenance after hours tocolysis.the original manufacturer allegedly promoted terbutaline as a tocolytic and its use for this purpose gained wide acceptance.however,neither the original manufacturer nor any of its successors or licensees sought fda approval for the use of terbutaline as a tocolytic.
studies began to question the safety and efficacy of using terbutaline as a tocolytic.in,a study published in the british journal of obstetrics and gynecology by researchers from johns hopkins school of public health questioned the validity of the swedish report stating relevant information about the effect of drugs on the mother and infant was too scanty to make conclusions about side effects possible.it noted d ata from other sources show that labor inhibitors are potentially dangerous and may unfavorably alter the fetal,placental,or maternal circulation.the study indicated,the role of drugs aimed at preventing or delaying premature birth is not yet established,and further good clinical trials are urgently needed.the following year,the fda ordered discontinuation of protocols for intravenous terbutaline use.a study in the journal of obstetrics and gynecology reported pregnant patients who received acute tocolysis experienced pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure and several neonatal complications were reported including hypoglycemia,hypotension,hypocalcemia,and death.
in,military clinical investigators found the swedish study could not be replicated.when they compared patients who had been given terbutaline for tocolytic therapy with patients given a placebo they found n o significant difference in prolongation of pregnancy,birth weight,development of respiratory distress syndrome,or infant survival.a study from the university of southern california found similar results.
the swedish physicians who conducted the original study acknowledged their data demonstrated a rapid transfer of t erbutaline across the human placenta and that concentrations of the drug in the fetus reached levels similar to its mother,which they concluded may help to explain fetal metabolic side effects.another study in published in the journal of pharmacology and experimental therapy found a single dose of terbutaline given to pregnant rats produced stimulation of the beta receptors in the fetal brain,which interfered with an enzyme required for neuronal development.
reports published in the regarding other drugs found children born to mothers who received the drugs for tocolysis had statistically poorer academic achievement than children born to mothers with no such treatment,children born to mothers who received tocolytic treatment were found more often to be neurotic and more likely to have impairments with vision and language development than children whose mothers did not receive tocolytic treatment,and biochemical evidence that terbutaline may interfere with fetal development.ritodrine,a similar drug approved by the fda for tocolysis,was withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer in the after the fda advised against using it for maintenance tocolytic therapy due to concerns about its toxicity and questionable efficacy.multiple other studies and trials conducted throughout the concluded maintenance tocolysis with drugs such as terbutaline provided no benefit and there were potential dangers to the mother and fetus.
the fda invited terbutaline manufacturers in to submit applications for approval of tocolytic use and to review their labeling to clarify the uses and risks of the drug.the manufacturers allegedly decided not to voluntarily seek fda review for tocolytic use.the manufacturers revised their labels distributed in the united states to warn against tocolytic use.although not pleaded in the operative complaint,the opening brief asserts the drug label revisions in the early warned against tocolytic use,but only discussed minor risks to the mother and did not mention potential harm to the fetus.
the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists acog issued a technical bulletin to its members in stating t o date,no studies have convincingly demonstrated an improvement in survival or any index of neonatal outcome with the use of tocolytic therapy.on the other hand,the potential damages of tocolytic therapy to the mother and the neonate are well documented.despite this information,researchers from the university of iowa reported in physicians were reluctant to discharge patients who received acute tocolytic treatment without medication and usually prescribed oral maintenance tocolysis because the concerned patient often pressures her doctor to prescribe medication and because these prescriptions reduce patient phone calls and complaints.
the fda associate commissioner for health affairs issued a dear colleague letter in expressing the fda concerns about the use of terbutaline as a tocolytic agent.it noted adequate data establishing the safety and effectiveness of terbutaline for this purpose had not been submitted to the fda and the information available indicated there was no documented benefit from prolonged treatment.it referred to and adopted acog warning.the fda later rejected a protest to the dear colleague letter noting,t here is no approved application for the use of t erbutalineby any route for administrationas a tocolytic agent,despite active promotion of subcutaneously administered t erbutaline for such use by some commercial parties.the fda noted its review of articles and materials suggested oral terbutaline is ineffective as a pregnancy maintenance treatment and was toxic to mother and fetus.
an evaluation of various treatments for preterm labor released by the agency for healthcare research and quality of the united states department of health and human services in concluded there was no benefit to using tocolytic for maintenance therapy.a study published in reported children exposed to tocolytic treatment had impairment in motor,and cognitive development as well as higher rates of psychiatric disorders and reading disorders.another study released the same year identified the biological mechanism by which terbutaline can injure the developing brain.a physician from duke medical center determined receptors in fetal brains do not desensitize,as mature brains would,when subjected to continuous doses of terbutaline.instead,the sensitivity to terbutaline intensified and increased the response to the drug,which warped cell development.the study noted there are liabilities of tocolysis with receptor agonists,including abnormalities of cardiovascular and metabolic function,impaired school performance,and subsequent cognitive impairment and psychiatric disorders.
novartis divested its interest in the nda for brethine in december.another pharmaceutical company became the nda holder for brethine thereafter.
over the next several years,other studies were published implicating the use of terbutaline as a tocolytic in adverse neurological effects experienced by children and explaining the mechanisms of injury.by november researchers published a study finding a significant association between continuous terbutaline exposure and autism disorders in fraternal twins.the report indicated male twins whose mothers received terbutaline therapy and were born with a sibling outside the twin set who did not have autism had more than four times the risk of developing autism than male twins born to a similar family where the mother did not receive terbutaline.
in early september the twins mother was hospitalized due to concerns she may go into premature labor.her physician prescribed oral terbutaline to be given every six hours.she was given a generic version of terbutaline.when she was discharged from the hospital at the end of september another physician instructed her to continue taking oral terbutaline every six hours until the week of her pregnancy.she filled her prescription with another generic version of terbutaline and continued taking the medication until the twins were born in early october.when the twins were approximately three years old,their pediatrician indicated they had developmental delay.they were diagnosed with autism in.
the minors,appearing by and through their father and guardian ad litem,sued novartis,other manufacturers of terbutaline,the physicians who prescribed the medication,and the hospital.the operative complaint asserts causes of action against novartis for negligence,intentional misrepresentation,concealment,and negligent misrepresentation.
novartis filed a demurrer arguing it had no duty to the minors because it did not manufacture the medication consumed by their mother and had no responsibility for the label or prescribing information in since it sold the rights to terbutaline six years earlier.it also argued the minors failed to plead with sufficient specificity any statement or misrepresentation by novartis to support its fraud causes of action and they further failed to allege reliance on any statement by novartis.
the minors opposed the demurrer arguing novartis owed a duty of care to potential patients while it did own and manufacturer the product to adequately warn physicians and their pregnant patients the use of its product was not effective for tocolysis or safe for unborn children.the minors further argued their mother physicians likely would not have prescribed her or other women terbutaline in if novartis had either not encouraged the use as a tocolytic or adequately warned of the potential risks known in.they argued the gap between when novartis owned the rights to the drug and when their mother consumed the drug did not go to the issues of duty or breach,but to causation.they argued they sufficiently pleaded the fraud causes of action.
the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend concluding novartis owed the twins no duty as a matter of law for claims that arise from the prescribing of terbutaline medication in.the court also sustained the demurrer to the causes of action for intentional misrepresentation,concealment and negligent misrepresentation because they failed to plead these claims with sufficient specificity.
discussion 
istandard of review 
a demurrer is properly sustained when the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action,or where the court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action alleged in the pleading.code civ,subds.e,a.on appeal from a dismissal following the sustaining of a demurrer,this court reviews the complaint de novo to determine whether it alleges facts stating a cause of action under any legal theory because the function of a demurrer is not to test the truth or accuracy of the facts alleged in the complaint,we assume the truth of all properly pleaded factual allegations.citation.whether the plaintiff will be able to prove these allegations is not relevant our focus is on the legal sufficiency of the complaint.debrunner deutsche bank national trust th.

negligent failure to warna 
negligence law in a case requires a plaintiff to prove that a manufacturer or distributor did not warn of a particular risk for reasons which fell below the acceptable standard of care,what a reasonably prudent manufacturer would have known and warned about.anderson owens corning fiberglas cal d.in the case of prescription drugs the physician stands in the shoes of the ordinary user because it is through the physician that a patient learns of the properties and proper use of the drug thus,the duty to warn in these cases runs to the physician,not the patient.valentine baxter healthcare th.this is known as the learned intermediary doctrine.as such,a pharmaceutical manufacturer may not be required to provide warning of a risk known to the medical community.carlin superior court cal th.
a manufacturer is not required to warn about speculative harm.knowledge of a potential side effect which is based on a single isolated report of a possible link between a prescription drug and an injury may not require a warning.if we overuse warnings,we invite mass consumer disregard and ultimate contempt for the warning process.citation.moreover,both common sense and experience suggest that if every report of a possible risk,no matter how speculative,conjectural,or tentative,imposed an affirmative duty to give some warning,a manufacturer would be required to inundate physicians indiscriminately with notice of any and every hint of danger,thereby inevitably diluting the force of any specific warning given.citations.the strength of the causal link thus is relevant both to the issue of whether a warning should be given at all,and,if one is required,what form it should take.finn searle cal d.
however,t he application of the theory to pharmaceuticals requires determinations whether available evidence established a causal link between an alleged side effect and a prescription drug,whether any warning should have been given,and,if so,whether the warning was adequate.these are issues of fact involving,inter alia,questions concerning the state of the art,what was known or reasonably knowable by the application of scientific and medical knowledge available at the time of manufacture and distribution of the prescription drug.they also necessarily involve questions concerning whether the risk,in light of accepted scientific norms,was more than merely speculative or conjectural,or so remote and insignificant as to be negligible.carlin superior court,supra,cal th at.
the issue here is whether novartis can be held liable under a negligent failure to warn theory to minors allegedly injured as a result of their mother ingestion of generic terbutaline for tocolysis years after novartis divested itself of the nda for brethine.the minors do not claim novartis had a duty to warn in the years after it divested the nda.as they have clarified on appeal,they contend novartis had sufficient information before it divested the nda in to revise the drug label,package insert and corresponding entry in the physician desk reference to include warnings of potential fetal harm when terbutaline was used as a maintenance tocolytic.the minors assert they can amend their complaint to contend if novartis had provided such warnings when it owned the nda it is probable warnings would have remained in effect,or at least as strong,until.they further assert they can amend their complaint to contend it is more likely than not their mother physicians would not have prescribed terbutaline during her pregnancy if these warnings were in place in.if the minors can in good faith amend their complaint to plead these facts,we conclude their claims for negligence and negligent misrepresentation can survive demurrer based on california law.
in conte,supra,th,a california appellate court held the common law duty to use due care owed by a prescription drug manufacturer when providing product warnings extends not only to consumers of its own product,but also to those whose doctors foreseeably rely on the manufacturer product information when prescribing a medication,even if the prescription is filled with the generic version of the prescribed drug.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the court rejected the argument that wyeth could not be liable because it did not manufacture or sell the product that caused the alleged injury.the court observed the argument would be sound if the plaintiff were pursuing a cause of action for strict product liability,but she was not.negligence and strict products liability are separate and distinct bases for liability that do not automatically collapse into each other because the plaintiff might allege both when a product warning contributes to her injury.id.at.rooting its decision in common sense and the common law of california,the court stated,w e are not marking out new territory by recognizing that a defendant that authors and disseminates information about a product manufactured and sold by another may be liable for negligent misrepresentation where the defendant should reasonably expect others to rely on that information and the product causes injury,even though the defendant would not be liable in strict products liability because it did not manufacture or sell the product.see hanberry hearst d misrepresentation claim permitted against magazine publisher that endorsed manufacturer product.id.at.
the conte court relied upon common law and civil law principles regarding foreseeability and duty noting,i n california,the general rule is that all persons have a duty to use ordinary care to prevent others from being injured as the result of their conduct.conte,supra,th at fn,citing.it also looked to the rules set forth in the restatement second of torts sections and regarding intentional and negligent misrepresentations involving risk of physical harm to others.conte,at.for conscious or intentional misrepresentation,section provides for liability if an actor makes a misrepresentation and should realize that it is likely to induce action by the other,or a third person,which involves an unreasonable risk of physical harm to the other.for negligent misrepresentations,section states o ne who negligently gives false information to another is subject to liability for physical harm caused by action taken by the other in reasonable reliance upon such information,where such harm results a to the other,or b to such third persons as the actor should expect to be put in peril by the action taken.conte,at,italics omitted.the court noted the close connection between duty and reasonable reliance.the likelihood that one statements about personal safety will be taken seriously is a primary factor in determining whether one has a duty to exercise care in making such statements.as the restatement puts it,such a duty extends to any person who,in the course of an activity which is in furtherance of his own interests,undertakes to give information to another,and knows or should realize that the safety of the person or others may depend on the accuracy of the information.ibid.
the conte court concluded it was foreseeable a patient could be injured by relying on product information provided by a drug manufacturer even though the patient took a generic form of the drug.in california,as in most states,pharmacists have long been authorized by statute to fill prescriptions for drugs with their generic equivalents unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids such a substitution.citations.it is therefore highly likely that a prescription for a drug written in reliance on the manufacturer product information will be filled with a generic drug.and,because by law the generic and versions of drugs are biologically equivalent citations,it is also eminently foreseeable that a physician might prescribe generic medication in reliance on the manufacturer representations about its drug.conte,supra,th at.
in addition to foreseeability,the court considered other policy factors such as the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury the closeness of the connection between the defendant conduct and the plaintiff injury the moral blame attached to the defendant conduct the policy goal of preventing future harm the burden to the defendant and consequences to the community of imposing a duty of care and broader consequences including the availability,cost,and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved.conte,supra,th at,citing the factors identified in rowland christian cal d,rowland.the court concluded the application of these factors did not support a departure from the general rule that all persons have a duty to use ordinary care to prevent harming others.conte,at.
the conte court considered and rejected the analysis in foster,supra.it recognized its holding was a departure from a majority of state and federal courts,but concluded california law is well established that concurrent tortfeasors whose separate acts contribute to an injury are each liable.conte,supra,th at.the court found nothing novel or unjust in applying this principle to require a manufacturer to shoulder its share of responsibility for injuries caused,at least in part,by its negligent dissemination of inaccurate information.ibid.
