this is a products liability case arising out of a helicopter accident.goodrich avionics systems,goodrich appeals the district court denial of goodrich motion for summary judgment of judy greene greene manufacturing defect claim and the district court subsequent denials of goodrich motions for judgment as a matter of law and motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict after a jury returned a verdict in favor of greene greene a order granting partial summary judgment to goodrich and an evidentiary ruling by the district court.because we find that greene failed to produce sufficient evidence to create an issue of fact for the jury that there was a manufacturing defect,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
factual background 
on the night of june,a sikorsky helicopter,aircraft registration number,owned by petroleum helicopters,phi and piloted by decedent donald greene greene,crashed into a wooded hillside near jackson,kentucky.in addition to greene,ernest jones jones and two medical technician passengers,sheila zellers and brian harden,died in the accident.
the helicopter took off from julian carroll airport just after in heavy fog.because visibility was approximately to of a mile,greene was forced to rely almost exclusively on the helicopter navigational instruments.less than two minutes after the aircraft liftoff,an exchange between greene and jones recorded on the cockpit voice recorder cvr indicated that jones told greene that the helicopter was in a turn and descending.the exchange between greene and jones continued as follows 
procedural background 
donald greene wife,judy greene,brought this suit,claiming that goodrich defectively designed or manufactured the vertical gyroscope portion of the helicopter navigation system and that goodrich was negligent in failing to warn of its defective product.
goodrich filed a motion for summary judgment.the district court granted the motion in part and denied it in part.the district court summarily dismissed greene design defect claim because she produced no evidence of a flaw in the design.with respect to greene manufacturing defect claim,the district court held that greene did not produce evidence of fault under a negligence theory,but it held that greene manufacturing defect claim sounding in strict liability could go to a jury because genuine issues of material fact remained with respect to causation.the district court also held that greene could not maintain a failure to warn claim because federal law regarding aviation standards preempted any duty imposed by state law.
at trial on the manufacturing defect claim,the jury found for greene and awarded her substantial damages.the jury also awarded damages to wausau insurance,which had been paying greene workers compensation on her husband death.goodrich now appeals the district court denial of goodrich summary judgment motion on the manufacturing defect claim the district court denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law at the end of greene case and at the end of the entire case and the district court denial of its renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law.greene,challenging the district court grant of summary judgment on her failure to warn claim and the court exclusion of evidence of gyroscope failures that occurred more than six months prior to the helicopter crash.
background on the product at issue 
before proceeding to our analysis,it is first prudent to have an overview of the product greene claims goodrich defectively manufactured the vertical gyroscopes on board the helicopter.the helicopter was equipped with two attitude display indicators adis,one standby attitude indicator,and two horizontal situation indicators hsis.adis indicate an aircraft position in relation to the earth horizon and help a pilot control the position of the aircraft relative to the earth.each adi in the helicopter displayed pitch,roll,and data.the vertical gyroscopes,model number,manufactured by goodrich,provided data to the helicopter adis which were not manufactured by goodrich.the vertical gyroscopes were housed inside the nose of the helicopter and were not visible to the pilots during flight.each adi received pitch and roll data independently from its own vertical gyroscope.each adi also received data from two other gyroscopes not manufactured by goodrich.the vertical gyroscopes in the helicopter did not provide data to any other instrument on the helicopter.pilots use hsis to determine course deviation and magnetic heading information.the hsis in the helicopter received information from other gyroscopes.the standby attitude indicator is a unit with its own gyroscope.
ii.analysis 
because this case went to trial and resulted in a jury verdict in favor of greene,we find it unnecessary to address whether the district court erred in failing to grant summary judgment in its entirety to goodrich.rather,our analysis will begin by addressing goodrich motion for judgment as a matter of law at the end of greene case.
whether the district court erred in denying goodrich motions for judgment as a matter of law and renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law 
we review a district court denial of judgment as a matter of law de novo.moore kuka welding robot,cir.in cases like this one invoking diversity of citizenship jurisdiction,the court applies the state law substantive standard for determining when judgment as a matter of law is appropriate.morales am.honda motor,cir darwish tempglass group,cir.under kentucky law,judgment as a matter of law should be granted only when there is a complete absence of proof on a material issue in the action,or if no disputed issue of fact exists upon which reasonable minds could differ.washington goodman.e very favorable inference which may reasonably be drawn from the evidence should be accorded the party against whom the motion is made.baylis lourdes.
judgment as a matter of law 
goodrich says that the district court erred by not granting its motion for judgment as a matter of law against greene both at the close of greene case and again at the close of trial.as discussed below,we find that the district court erred by not granting goodrich motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of greene case.
manufacturing defect legal standard 
under kentucky law,a manufacturing defect exists in a product when it leaves the hands of the manufacturer in a defective condition because it was not manufactured or assembled in accordance with its specifications.see ford motor mccamish.a manufacturing defect claim requires the jury to determine whether the product failed because of an error in the process of manufacture or assembly.id.with respect to greene strict liability theory,kentucky has adopted restatement second of torts.see dealers transport battery distrib.under,the defendant is held strictly liable if the plaintiff proves the product was in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer.montgomery elevator mccullough by mccullough.proceeding under a strict liability theory does not require the plaintiff to prove fault on the part of defendant.the plaintiff must,however,establish causation under the substantial factor test.king ford motor,cir.p laintiff must prove that the defendant conduct was a substantial factor in bringing about plaintiff harm.id.nothing precludes a plaintiff from using circumstantial evidence to prove a products liability case so long as the evidence is sufficient to tilt the balance from possibility to probability.id.the restatement second of torts provides that unreasonably dangerous means a product that is dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it,with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to its characteristics.restatement second of torts cmt.i.defective means that the product does not meet the reasonable expectations of the ordinary consumer as to its safety.worldwide,mullins.
b.the evidence at trial 
the vertical gyroscopes were destroyed in the crash accordingly,there was no direct evidence of vertical gyroscope failure.greene instead relied on four major pieces of evidence in an attempt to circumstantially prove a manufacturing defect in the pilot vertical gyroscope 
first,greene relied on her husband statement seconds before the crash that he thought his gyro just quit.
second,greene proffered evidence that in the period preceding the crash,there had been forty vertical gyroscope replacements on fifteen of the sikorsky helicopters owned and operated by phi.there also had been eleven adi replacements on seven phi helicopters during that same time period.the helicopter that crashed had three vertical gyroscopes and two adis replaced during the six months preceding the crash.
third,the national transportation safety board ntsb retrieved from the crash site a faceplate of one of the helicopter adis.the ntsb determined from the faceplate that,at the time of impact,the adi indicated that the helicopter was pointing to a position between level flight and a right roll the ntsb investigation of the ground damage,including the pattern of treetop leveling and jones last words,both indicated that,at impact,the helicopter was actually in a left hand turn and descending.as the district court stated,t o oversimplify,the cockpit voice recorder tape and the crash kinematics did not match the reading of the recovered adi.
fourth,greene helicopter expert,douglas herlihy herlihy,testified that it was more likely that a vertical gyroscope failure,rather than a failure of other instruments,was the cause of the crash.herlihy testified that a wiring failure between a vertical gyroscope and its adi was not as typical as a gyroscope failure itself he also testified that it was his opinion that the accident was a result of instrument confusion in the cockpit created by the loss of vertical gyro input to the flying pilot or gyro horizon.
goodrich challenge to greene statement 
as an initial matter,goodrich maintained on brief and during oral argument that greene statement as recorded on the cvr,okay i think my gyro just quit,was inadmissible hearsay.goodrich says that the vertical gyroscopes feeding the helicopter adis were located in the nose of the helicopter.thus,goodrich argues,it would be impossible for greene to see a vertical gyroscope or to know that it quit rather,he only would be able to see the adis inside the cockpit that reflected data supplied by the gyroscopes.additionally,goodrich argues that there were at least six gyroscopes on the helicopter and that it did not manufacture all of them,so admitting greene statement requires speculation as to which gyroscope greene may have been referring.
at the time the district court admitted greene statement,it did not clearly articulate the hearsay exception on which it was relying.the district court did,however,address this issue with specificity when it denied goodrich motions for judgment as a matter of law.the district court at that time found that the statement was admissible under two exceptions to the hearsay rule present sense impression and excited utterance.
we review whether the district court determination was an abuse of discretion.mitroff xomox,cir.under the federal rules of evidence,hearsay is defined as a statement,other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing,offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.c.under,the hearsay rule does not exclude a statement describing or explaining an event or condition made while the declarant was perceiving the event or condition,or immediately thereafter.the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule under.requires f irst,there must be an event startling enough to cause nervous excitement.second,the statement must be made before there is time to contrive or misrepresent.and,third,the statement must be made while the person is under the stress of the excitement caused by the event.haggins warden,fort pillow state farm,cir.
as an initial note,it is unclear from the record if greene statement was even offered at trial to prove the truth of the matter definition of hearsay.even if it was,however,the district court did not err in admitting greene statement as either a present sense impression or as an exited utterance.with respect to a present sense impression,certainly greene could not personally observe the vertical gyroscopes in the nose of the helicopter as goodrich argues.however,it is undisputed that greene could see the adis in the cockpit that reflected data supplied by the vertical gyroscopes in the nose of the helicopter.although goodrich argues that it is unclear if greene was referring to his adi in his statement or another adi in the cockpit,the fact that he said i think my gyro just quit emphasis added appears to indicate that he was referring to his adi.indeed,herlihy,greene expert,testified that it would make no difference to an experienced pilot like greene that the gyroscope is in the nose of the helicopter.herlihy testified that if a pilot like greene said my gyro just quit,he knows that the information displayed on the adi is coming from the nose of the helicopter.to suggest that a pilot who is experiencing problems with an adi display must physically view the gyroscope to reliably detect a malfunction is untenable.
the district court also did not err in concluding that greene statement was an excited utterance.certainly greene made the statement while under stress of the event that nineteen seconds later resulted in his death.to the extent that goodrich argues again that greene could not physically see the gyroscope that allegedly quit,the advisory committee notes to.provide that,with respect to a declarant perception of an event,the statement need only relate to the startling event or condition,thus affording a broader scope of subject matter coverage.overall,the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting greene statement.
whether greene evidence was sufficient to prove a manufacturing defect 
at the heart of goodrich argument is its position that greene failed to meet her burden of proof because she failed to establish an issue of fact for the jury that there was a manufacturing defect in the pilot vertical gyroscope,goodrich says that greene evidence failed to tilt the balance from possibility to probability and thus show that there was a manufacturing defect in the pilot vertical gyroscope.see king,at.after a review of the record and an examination of greene proofs at trial,we agree with goodrich that the evidence greene proffered failed to show that there was a manufacturing defect in a vertical gyroscope.
perhaps what is most problematic to us is greene heavy reliance on data indicating the number of vertical gyroscopes and adis that had been removed repaired in helicopters in the six months preceding the helicopter accident.the parties presented us with differing interpretations of this data.the ntsb report states that 
a ccording to company records,in the months that preceded the accident,fleetwide,there had been a total of vertical gyro replacements on helicopters,and a total of attitude indicator replacements on helicopters.on,the helicopter piloted by greene and jones,in the preceding months,there were two attitude indicators,and three vertical gyros replaced.according to company records,fleetwide,in the preceding months,the maximum number of attitude indicators replaced on a helicopter was three,and maximum number of vertical gyros replaced was six.
greene introduced exhibit at trial,titled vertical gyro removals and attitude director indicator removals,which purports to summarize the vertical gyroscopes and adis from phi helicopter fleet that were removed,replaced,sent to a repair facility between december,through june.our review of the data contained in this exhibit does not seem to correlate with the figures recited above from the ntsb report.our review of exhibit suggests that phi removed vertical gyroscopes and adis from some of its helicopters in the relevant period.regardless of the sum total of vertical gyroscopes and adis that were removed,replaced,or repaired during the six months preceding the accident,however,it troubles us that greene argues that the data from this exhibit suggest a large number of vertical gyroscope failures.the vertical gyroscopes and adis for which there were repair orders were not sent solely to goodrich rather,phi sent them to various facilities,including goodrich masco helicopter support,bell helicopter textron and honeywell,
the evidence in exhibit does not suggest that there was a manufacturing defect in a vertical gyroscope.indeed,including adis within the list of removals,replacements,and repairs does nothing to support greene claim that there was a manufacturing defect in a vertical gyroscope.the evidence in the exhibit could equally suggest that there was a problem with an adi.indeed,counsel for goodrich at oral argument told us that nothing in greene proofs ruled out the possibility that an adi malfunctioned.more significant,however,is the fact that greene proffered no evidence that the reason for the removal or repairs of the vertical gyroscopes was unusual.likewise,she proffered no evidence that the rate of replacement of vertical gyroscopes in the phi fleet differed from the replacement rate of vertical gyroscopes made by other manufacturers.
because of our uncertainty after studying the record,we expressed concern to counsel at oral argument about the use of greene data regarding vertical gyroscope and adi removals,replacements,and repairs.we directly asked counsel for both goodrich and greene to direct us to the place in the record that would inform us as to the expected useful life of a vertical gyroscope.both counsel,however,informed us that the record is devoid of such information this strikes us as a conspicuous omission,given the fact that without such a benchmark it is impossible to determine whether the vertical gyroscopes removed,replaced,or repaired in the phi fleet occurred at a statistically significant rate compared with the average life expectancy of a vertical gyroscope.as counsel for goodrich correctly noted during oral argument,the failure to adduce such evidence is correctly attributable to party with the burden to prove a manufacturing defect.simply put,greene statistics regarding the removal,replacement,and repairs of vertical gyroscopes and adis in the phi fleet are meaningless and are not,without more,probative of a manufacturing defect 
greene evidence also consisted of exhibit,comprising pages of work orders and inspection reports from goodrich repair station in austin,texas.this exhibit documented work orders goodrich received from phi for model vertical gyroscopes along with details of the work goodrich actually performed on each vertical gyroscope submitted to the repair station for evaluation.the documents in exhibit detail work orders from phi to goodrich for the period november through april.two of the work orders and inspection reports within six months of the accident show that phi sent two model vertical gyroscopes from the helicopter greene was piloting,registration number,to goodrich texas facility.the first work order,number,was received by goodrich on january.the reason listed on the work order for the vertical gyroscope being removed was pitch kicks in flight.the final inspection report by goodrich on january,lists as the reason for failure carbon on slip rings and brushes due to electrical contact.the inspection report states that goodrich repaired the vertical gyroscope and that it met manufacturer specifications when it was returned to phi on january.the second work order,number,was received by goodrich on april.the reason listed on the work order for the vertical gyroscope being removed was,again,pitch kicks in flight.the final inspection report by goodrich on april,states could verify customer complaint,unit performs normally.before the vertical gyroscope was returned to phi on april,the work performed on the unit was listed on the final inspection report as open checked unit,cleaned all slip ring and brushes as a precaution,calibrated,tested and inspected to current mfg spec this exhibit likewise is not probative of a manufacturing defect because it does nothing to suggest that any model vertical gyroscope listed in the series of work orders was defective at the time it left goodrich manufacturing plant.
another piece of evidence further supports our conclusion that greene failed to prove that there was a manufacturing defect in a vertical gyroscope.herlihy testified at trial that it was his opinion that the accident was a result of instrument confusion in the cockpit created by the loss of vertical gyro input to the flying pilot or gyro horizon.phi lead pilot thomas methvin,however,testified that even if one adi failed or was receiving incorrect information,greene jones should have relied upon the other adis in the cockpit to safely fly or land the aircraft.additional testimony by herlihy provided that the accident had a number of factors that caused it.herlihy testified that the factors include two primary causes,including the weather and herlihy opinion that the helicopter experienced an instrument failure.
given the evidence that it would be possible for a pilot to navigate the helicopter if an adi failed that multiple events could have caused the helicopter accident and that replacements of vertical gyroscopes on phi helicopters,including the one piloted by greene and jones,six months prior to the crash do not,standing alone,indicate a gyroscope defect,greene proofs were simply insufficient to show that there was a manufacturing defect in a vertical gyroscope.indeed,at no time did any witness identify a defect in manufacture of model vertical gyroscopes.
conclusion 
viewing the totality of the evidence at the conclusion of greene proofs leads us to conclude that the evidence amounted to featureless generality.see oliver wendell holmes,the common law mark dewolfe howe,little,brown.in the absence of evidence that one possible explanation was more probable than another,the jury was required to speculate as to whether there was a defect.it is well established that a jury verdict based on speculation,supposition,or surmise is impermissible 
although the jury may draw reasonable inferences from the evidence of a defect in manufacturing,it is incumbent on the plaintiff to introduce evidence that will support a reasonable inference that the defect was the probable cause of the accident as distinguished from a possible cause among other possibilities otherwise,the jury verdict is based upon speculation or surmise.
midwestern ringley.our view of the evidence indicates that,at best,greene only showed at trial that it was possible there was a manufacturing defect in a vertical gyroscope.she simply failed to satisfy her burden that there was such a defect.
because we conclude that the district court erred in failing to grant goodrich motion for judgment as a matter of law at the conclusion of greene case,goodrich challenge to the district court denial of goodrich motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of trial and the district court denial of goodrich renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law is moot.
whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment to goodrich on greene failure to warn claim 
greene argues in her that the district court erred when it granted summary judgment to goodrich on greene failure to warn claims.
greene argued that goodrich breached its duty to warn users of aircraft that contained a vertical gyroscope about the gyroscope manufacturing defects.greene relied on herlihy opinion that goodrich had no central database structure to track malfunctions,to register employee concerns of gyro system weaknesses,or to communicate horizontally between grand rapids manufacturing,quality assurance and its field repair facilities.greene did not allege any violations of federal law with respect to the failure to warn claim.she also did not cite any authority regarding standards that encourage or require a company like goodrich to maintain such a database.
in granting goodrich motion for summary judgment with respect to the failure to warn claim,the district court held that federal law preempts any imposed duties in the realm of aviation.the district court found it significant that
