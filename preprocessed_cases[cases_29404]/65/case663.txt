plaintiff,brenda brandt,suffered severe complications following the surgical implantation of a medical device that was later recalled by the manufacturer for being substandard.brandt filed an amended complaint that included a breach of implied warranty of merchantability claim ilcs west under the uniform commercial code ucc ilcs et west against her treating hospital,defendant sarah bush lincoln health center health center.the circuit court of coles county dismissed the claim,and the appellate court affirmed d.we granted brandt petition for leave to appeal to resolve the question whether brandt can bring a viable cause of action for breach of the ucc implied warranty of merchantability against the health center after a defective medical device was surgically implanted during her medical treatment in that hospital.
background 
brandt was admitted to the health center to receive treatment for urinary incontinence.while there,a protegen sling sling was surgically implanted on december.a charge for the sling was included in her bill from the health center.in january,the manufacturer of the sling,boston scientific corporation,issued a voluntary recall of the product because the product was causing medical complications in of patients.brandt suffered serious complications,including pain,infection,bleeding,and erosion of vaginal tissue.in response to these complications,the sling was surgically removed in november.
brandt filed a complaint in july,alleging negligence,strict liability,and breach of warranty against defendants boston scientific corporation and sarah bush lincoln health center.the health center filed a motion to dismiss counts iv through vi under section of the code of civil procedure code ilcs west because the health center was not a merchant of medical devices and because the transaction between brandt and the health center was predominantly for services instead of goods.pursuant to section of the code ilcs west,the motion alleged brandt failed to comply with the pleading requirements of section of the code ilcs west.section requires a plaintiff to attach an affidavit i n any action,whether in tort,contract or otherwise,in which the plaintiff seeks damages for injuries or death by reason of medical,hospital,or other healing art malpractice.ilcs a west.the trial court granted the motion to dismiss without prejudice for failure to comply with section.
brandt filed a amended complaint in may.the first three counts again were against boston scientific corporation and are not part of this appeal.count iv alleged a breach of warranty claim against the health center no section affidavit was attached.count iv specifically stated that the health center was engaged in the sale and distribution of medical products,including the pubovaginal sling.as for the nature of the transaction,brandt alleged 
plaintiff,brenda brandt,purchased a protegen sling catalog,lot,sold and distributed by defendant,sarah bush lincoln health center,and was implanted with the said product on or about december,at the sarah bush lincoln health center in mattoon,illinois.
the health center again filed a motion to dismiss under sections and of the code,citing the same three arguments it had raised about the original complaint.the trial court dismissed count iv with prejudice for failure to comply with the pleading requirements of section the court expressed no opinion regarding the other arguments asserted in the health center motion.
the appellate court found that the trial court erred in holding that count iv alleged a healing art malpractice claim.thus,section did not apply.d at.the appellate court affirmed the dismissal of count iv,however,because it found that the transaction between brandt and the health center was primarily for services rather than goods so that the ucc did not apply.d at.the appellate court acknowledged that garcia edgewater hospital,d,reached the opposite conclusion but expressly declined to follow garcia.d at.the appellate court concluded that garcia erroneously relied upon this court decision in cunningham macneal memorial hospital,because cunningham had been entirely overruled by subsequent legislation and,further,because cunningham involved a strict liability claim rather than a ucc claim.d at.
because brandt prevailed on the section issue before the appellate court,she only raises the arguments from the section motion to dismiss before this court.she submits that the appellate court erred in finding that her transaction with the health center was primarily for services and in asserting that cunningham was no longer good law.we now consider the propriety of the dismissal of the breach of warranty claim against the health center.
a section motion to dismiss presents a question of law,which is reviewed de novo.oliveira amoco oil.in reviewing a motion to dismiss under section,we accept as true all facts and reasonable inferences therefrom.jackson south holland dodge.we determine whether plaintiff asserts a cause of action upon which relief may be granted after considering all allegations in a light most favorable to plaintiff.jackson,at.
article of the ucc imposes the implied warranty of merchantability.ilcs west.to succeed on a claim of breach of implied warranty of merchantability,a plaintiff must allege and prove a sale of goods by a merchant of those goods,and the goods were not of merchantable quality.ilcs west see garcia,d at,malawy richards manufacturing,d.unless excluded or modified,this warranty is implied in every sale under these conditions.ilcs west.
article applies to transactions in goods.ilcs west.the ucc defines goods as all things,including specially manufactured goods,which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale.ilcs west.where there is a mixed contract for goods and services,there is a transaction in goods only if the contract is predominantly for goods and incidentally for services.belleville toyota,toyota motor sales.this analysis is known as the predominant purpose test.
the parties here do not dispute that the sling implanted in brandt satisfies the ucc definition of goods.the parties do dispute,however,whether the exchange between brandt and the health center constituted a transaction in goods the health center argues that it primarily provided medical services rather than goods to brandt.
in addition,an implied warranty of merchantability applies only to a merchant of goods of the kind involved in the contract.merchant is defined in the ucc as 
a person who deals in goods of the kind or otherwise by his occupation holds himself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to the practices or goods involved in the transaction or to whom such knowledge or skill may be attributed by his employment of an agent or broker or other intermediary who by his occupation holds himself out as having such knowledge or skill.ilcs west.
section provides,a warranty that the goods shall be merchantable is implied in a contract for their sale if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind.emphasis added.ilcs west.ucc comments explain that this language in section requires a merchant to have professional status as to a particular kind of goods,which is narrower than the general definition of merchant found in section.ilcs ann,uniform commercial code comment,at siemen alden,d.the health center disputes that it is a merchant of medical devices.
finally,a plaintiff must show that the goods in question were not of merchantable quality.merchantable means of a quality commensurate with that generally accepted within the trade under the description of the goods in the contract.ilcs ann,uniform commercial code comment,at.there is little dispute in this case that the sling was not merchantable.in its notice of voluntary recall of the sling,the manufacturer conceded as much by explaining,we can not assure ourselves that the overall experience with protegen meets our standards for product performance.
we must determine whether,accepting the truth of the complaint allegations and reasonable inferences,brandt has stated a cause of action upon which relief may be granted.jackson,at.the complaint alleged brandt
