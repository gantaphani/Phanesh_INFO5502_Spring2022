larry and debra fulgham brought products liability and negligence claims against ffe transportation services,arising out of a accident.the trial court granted a directed verdict in favor of ffe at the close of the plaintiffs,finding that ffe could not be held strictly liable and that there was no evidence to support the negligence claim.
the court of appeals reversed and remanded for a new trial,holding that strict products liability was applicable because the agreement between ffe and larry constituted a lease of the relevant trailer,that expert testimony was not necessary to establish ffe negligence,and that there was some evidence of each of the required elements of negligence.we disagree.
in resolving this case,we conclude 
strict products liability is inapplicable when,as here,a company gratuitously provides a product to an independent contractor working for the company for the sole purpose of accomplishing the company business purposes 
on appeal,a trial court determination regarding whether expert testimony is necessary to establish negligence should be reviewed de novo 
the trial court did not err in finding that the standard of care for the proper inspection and maintenance of a refrigerated trailer is beyond the experience of the layman and therefore must be established by expert testimony and 
no probative expert testimony regarding the relevant standard of care was admitted.
accordingly,we reverse the court of appeals judgment and remand to the court of appeals to consider the two points of error raised by the fulghams that were not considered by it.
ffe was in the business of transporting freight by motor vehicle.larry fulgham was a trucker.on december,ffe and larry signed a contract that was titled independent contractor agreement.the contract specified that larry use his own tractor to transport commodities in trailers owned by ffe in exchange for a percentage of the transport fee.
on march,larry was transporting a load of prepackaged meats through kentucky for hillshire farms,an ffe customer.larry had inspected the refrigerated trailer,including the connection,before leaving the hillshire farms warehouse three hours after larry picked up the trailer,as he exited an interstate highway on a curved ramp,the trailer upper coupler assembly broke loose from the trailer,causing the trailer to separate from the tractor and overturn.larry quickly lost control of the tractor,and it also overturned.as a result of the accident,larry was injured.
under the written contract between ffe and larry,larry operated his tractor and the ffe trailers assigned to him under the exclusive direction and control of ffe.as larry testified you got to be at a certain place at a certain time.they give you an appointment time,delivery time,and a time that you supposed to pick the load up.ffe instructed larry which trailer to pick up,and the trailer was usually different each time.the contract specified that larry could not use the tractor he furnished to carry ffe loads to perform work for other carriers.bill robinson,ffe director of equipment and maintenance,testified that this was ffe standard policy.the contract also stated that ffe shall have exclusive possession,control and use of larry tractor.at oral argument,the fulghams counsel acknowledged that larry was authorized only to use ffe trailers for the purpose of undertaking the deliveries that ffe had dispatched to him.
under the terms of the contract,larry was entitled to seventy percent of the freight bill for each delivery he completed.the court of appeals concluded that the contract constituted a lease of the relevant trailer,asserting that larry paid thirty percent of the transport fee to ffe as rent.at however,under the contract,larry was not required to pay any fee or other charge to ffe for the use of its trailers.instead,ffe paid larry for both his personal services and the exclusive use of his tractor.
in early,ffe arranged for loads to be carried on approximately trucks driven by like larry and on about company trucks driven by ffe employees.the were independent contractors who provided their own tractors.significantly,ffe did not lease or otherwise provide any of its trailers for use in carrying loads other than those that ffe contracted to transport.neither larry nor the other drivers for ffe had any direct contractual relationships with ffe customers.instead,all of their assignments for hauling commodities originated with ffe.larry,like the other drivers for ffe,took temporary possession of various ffe trailers,including the one at issue here,incident to his exclusive work for ffe.
it is undisputed that the specific trailer in this case,designated by ffe as trailer number,was never released by ffe to anyone except its employees and independent contractors for the sole purpose of transporting ffe loads.ffe was the owner and end user of trailer number,and larry used it only when acting as ffe paid agent.
in their third amended original petition,the fulghams alleged that trailer number was defective because the bolts and plates anchoring the upper coupler assembly to the trailer were missing or weak or both due to rust and inadequate torque the fulghams also alleged that ffe failed to timely and properly inspect and maintain the trailer,and more specifically,its upper coupler assembly.
after the fulghams rested,ffe orally moved for a directed verdict.ffe asserted that there was no evidence of duty,breach,or causation to support the negligence claim,and that the fulghams had failed to present the necessary expert testimony.as to the strict liability claim,ffe asserted that there was no evidence that it had placed the trailer into the stream of commerce.with regard to the fulghams negligence claim,the trial court concluded that expert testimony was required to establish the applicable standard of care,and that the fulghams had not presented any probative expert testimony.the trial court also determined that the fulghams products liability claim should not go to the jury.accordingly,the trial court granted ffe motion for directed verdict.
the court of appeals reversed and remanded,concluding that expert testimony on the standard of care and breach of the standard of care was not necessary to establish negligence in this case because the inspection and detection of loose and rusty bolts connecting parts of a trailer was not a factual inquiry beyond the experience of the layman.at.additionally,the court concluded that products liability was applicable because the contract between ffe and larry was a lease through which ffe had introduced the trailer into the stream of commerce.id.at.
in mckisson sales affiliates,we adopted section of the restatement second of torts on the scope of strict products liability.section provides 
one who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his property is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused to the ultimate user or consumer,or to his property,if 
a the seller is engaged in the business of selling such a product,and 
b it is expected to and does reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold.
restatement second of torts.even though section literally applies only to the sale of a defective product,mckisson concluded that strict products liability would apply to a product that was given free of charge,if the product were given with the expectation of profiting therefrom through future sales of the product.mckisson,at.
to incur strict liability in texas,it is not necessary that the defendant actually sell the product,but only that he be engaged in the business of introducing the product into the channels of commerce.armstrong rubber urquidez.where one is engaged in the business of introducing products into the channels of commerce,he will be subject to strict liability for physical harm caused by such products if they are unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer whether he sells or leases the products.rourke garza,however,we have declined to apply strict liability where there has been no sale of the product by the manufacturer but a bailment for mutual benefit,when the product bailment was to an employee of an independent contractor of the bailor for the sole purpose of accomplishing the bailor business purposes.urquidez,at.
in urquidez,the widow of a test driver employed by an independent tire testing company unsuccessfully sought to hold armstrong rubber company,a tire manufacturer,strictly liable for the death of her husband due to a tire blowout.the specific tire that blew out was never sold and,more importantly,never entered the stream of commerce,though it was identical to thousands of other tires that had been placed in the channels of commerce by armstrong rubber.id.at.the tire that blew out had been supplied by armstrong rubber to its independent contractor solely to accomplish armstrong rubber tire testing purposes.critical to our reasoning was the conclusion that armstrong never released the allegedly defective tire to an ordinary user or consumer within the meaning of the restatement.id.at.armstrong rubber did not sell the allegedly defective tire and,therefore,was not subject to strict liability for that specific product.
finally,two federal courts applying texas law have held that a company that gratuitously furnishes a product solely to accomplish its own business purposes is liable for negligence but not strict liability.see gardner chevron,cir holding that an employer is not strictly liable to an employee for a product used solely for the employer purposes dunn penrod drilling,holding that a company is not strictly liable to an employee of an independent contractor for a product used solely for the company purposes when the company maintained control of the premises on which the product was used.
we now consider how this case fits with previous texas cases.the facts in this case are analogous to the facts in urquidez,and distinct from the facts in mckisson and rourke.like in urquidez,the use of ffe trailer was incidental to the contractual relationship whereby larry transported cargo for ffe and its customer hillshire farms.the contract between ffe and larry provided for a loan of trailer number incident to larry work for ffe.unlike mckisson and rourke,respectively,ffe did not anticipate a future sale of a trailer to larry,nor was ffe in the business of leasing trailers.larry was a business agent of ffe,not a consumer of trailer number.
ffe was not in the business of selling or leasing its trailers to ordinary users or consumers per urquidez,at,but instead used its trailers solely for its own business purposes.for purposes of section,ffe was the end user and consumer of trailer number.like armstrong rubber in urquidez,ffe never released the allegedly defective product to an ordinary user or consumer within the meaning of the restatement.id.at.the material facts in this case are that larry did not pay ffe for the trailer,but rather ffe paid larry to work for it that the transfer of the trailer from ffe to larry conferred only possession of the trailer,not a right of control and that,while in possession of the trailer,larry acted solely as ffe agent to accomplish its business purposes.
in their briefing,the fulghams cite four cases that we discussed and distinguished in urquidez.see id.at.we distinguished those cases by noting that the plaintiffs in the cases were all customers of,while neither urquidez nor his employer was a customer of armstrong rubber,which neither sold nor leased the specific tire that was alleged to be defective.id.in this case,we likewise find those cases inapposite because larry was not ffe customer.
based on the foregoing,we conclude that the trial court properly dismissed the fulghams strict products liability claim.
ffe asserts that the court of appeals erred in not granting deference to the trial court determination that an expert witness was necessary to establish the fulghams negligence claim.in reversing the trial court on this issue,the court of appeals did not state whether it applied a de novo or abuse of discretion standard when reviewing the trial court determination regarding the necessity of expert testimony.
there is no texas precedent addressing what standard of review should have been applied by the court of appeals in this instance.citing honeycutt,ffe asserts that because the common knowledge of the layman is one criterion for determining whether expert testimony is admissible and trial court determinations regarding the admissibility of expert testimony are reviewed for abuse of discretion,a trial court determination regarding whether expert testimony is necessary to establish negligence should also be reviewed only for abuse of discretion.
in response,the fulghams assert the determination whether expert testimony is necessary is not an admissibility of evidence question,which admittedly would be reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard,but a question of what legal weight should be given to the evidence in the record.this is a question of law we agree and therefore conclude that de novo is the appropriate standard of review in this context.see choate san antonio ry,i t is elementary that whether there be any evidence or not to support an issue is a question of law barber.indep.sch,w e are obliged to decide de novo the issues of law.
although we have never addressed this question,we have implicitly recognized that de novo is the proper standard of review in this context.see,alexander turtur,holding,after reviewing the record in a legal malpractice case,that w ithout expert testimony,the jury had no direct evidence explaining the legal significance of the omitted evidence texarkana mem l,murdock,remanding to the trial court because,without expert testimony on medical expenses,the plaintiffs had presented no evidence in support of the trial court judgment haddock arnspiger,holding,after reviewing the evidence,that an expert was needed because the nature of the case was beyond the common knowledge of laymen melody home barnes,holding that the jurors had sufficient knowledge without expert testimony because the standard was within the common knowledge of laymen rabb coleman,holding that expert testimony is not required when the standard can be determined by a child.in none of these cases did we defer to the trial court determination regarding whether expert testimony was required accordingly,the de novo standard has always been the standard we have implicitly applied.
finally,our conclusion is consistent with those of other state supreme courts.for example,the wisconsin supreme court has held that whether expert testimony is necessary to establish negligence is a question of law.see netzel state sand gravel,see also wrangell,alaska whether expert testimony is required to show a breach of a duty of care represents a question of law to which we apply our independent judgment.vandermay clayton,or,defendant motion for a directed verdict raised a question of law for the trial court,namely,whether plaintiff was required to present expert testimony to establish that defendant had breached the standard of care.bauer white,the question here is one of law.must a patient present an expert medical opinion that unintentionally leaving a foreign body in a surgical patient violates the standard of care for physicians in this state to withstand a motion for summary judgment because the question is one of law,review is de novo.we join these other jurisdictions in reviewing de novo a trial court determination regarding whether expert testimony is necessary to prove a negligence claim.
we now review de novo the trial court determination that expert testimony was necessary in this case to establish the applicable standard of care.
expert testimony is necessary when the alleged negligence is of such a nature as not to be within the experience of the layman.roark allen,holding that diagnosis of skull fractures is not within the experience of the layman see also turbines,dardis,pet.denied holding that inspection and repair of an aircraft engine are not within the experience of the layman hager romines,worth,no writ holding that operation of an aircraft and aerial application of herbicide are not within the experience of the layman.
