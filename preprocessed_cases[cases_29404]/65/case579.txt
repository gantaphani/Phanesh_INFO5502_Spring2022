the environmental law foundation elf appeals from a summary judgment dismissing its complaint under the california safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of,health and safety code section et.proposition or the act,against wykle research,wykle.elf contends the trial court erred in holding that the warning of mercury toxicity wykle includes with the dental amalgam it manufactures comes within the safe harbor provisions of the regulations issued under proposition,conclusively establishing that the warning is clear and reasonable as required by health and safety code section.whatever shortcomings there may be in the present regulatory scheme to ensure that dental patients are advised of the possible risks arising from the presence of mercury in the amalgam,we conclude that the trial court correctly determined that wykle has satisfied its obligations under the current statutory and regulatory scheme.
background 
wykle is a nevada corporation,with no manufacturing facilities in california,which manufactures and distributes to california dentists filling material,or amalgam,used to restore teeth after the removal of tooth decay.the amalgam contains mercury,about which there is a dispute as to whether its presence creates a risk to the health and safety of a patient in whose mouth the filling material is placed.the history and contours of the dental amalgam controversy are well summarized in consumer cause,smilecare th,d.whether or not patients are in fact exposed to potentially significant levels of mercury or mercury vapors during the filling process or from subsequent leakage of mercury into the oral cavity,the state of california has classified mercury and mercury compounds,pursuant to health and safety code section,as chemicals known to the state to cause reproductive toxicity,tit,subd.c.this designation invokes the mandate of proposition that no person in the course of doing business shall knowingly and intentionally expose any individual to the chemical without first giving clear and reasonable warning to such individual.health.
elf complaint against wykle,like those it brought against other manufacturers and distributors of dental amalgam,almost all of which have been resolved by settlement,alleges that wykle has failed to provide clear and reasonable warnings,violating health and safety code section and constituting an unlawful business practice within the meaning of business and professions code section.the complaint alleges that wykle mercury products expose both the dental patients treated with these products and the dental office workers using such products to toxic mercury and mercury vapor,presenting a known risk of birth defects and other adverse reproductive effects.
wykle has included with all amalgam shipped into california since a warning intended to comply with proposition.the warning was originally placed on the outside of each box of capsules,and was later included on an insert placed inside each package.over time the insert has gone through a series of revisions.since september the warning has been included on a insert entitled instructions for capsules,a copy of which is attached as an appendix to this opinion.the left column contains a section captioned instructions,followed by helpful hints.the major portion of the right column is the material data safety sheet msds for the product,as required by the hazard communications standard established pursuant to the federal occupational safety and health act see g.this portion of the insert,which is identified as the msds in particularly small type that hardly sets it apart from the balance of the insert,consists of nine numbered sections,the heading for each of which is emphasized by placing it between horizontal lines across the length of the column.the nine sections are entitled,respectively,product identification,hazardous ingredients,physical data,fire and explosion data,health hazard data,reactivity data stability,spill and disposal procedures,safe handling and use information,and special precautions.at the top of the right column,immediately prior to the msds,is a paragraph headed ada specifications,which reads as follows 
ada specifications wykle research,amalgam is guaranteed to comply with specification for alloy of dental amalgam.mercury complies with the requirements of iso mercury.precautions in accordance with the ada specifications,we issue the following warning for the types of amalgam which contains zinc this alloy contains zinc and the amalgam made therefrom may show excessive corrosion and expansion if moisture is introduced during the mixing and condensing.in compliance with the california safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of,the following warning is issued warning this product contains a chemical known to the state of california to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm.italics added.
the italicized warning is the portion that wykle contends satisfies the requirements of proposition.
all of the text on the insert is in relatively small print,but the proposition warning is in no smaller type than used throughout the insert.the proposition message begins with the capitalized word warning,which is in the same size font as the words ada specifications and precautions that precede the information relating to the specifications of the american dental association ada.the entire insert appears on one side of a single page.
in august,the trial court granted wykle motion for summary judgment,on the grounds that pursuant to proposition,wykle did in fact provide clear and reasonable proposition warnings to dentists because all of its dental amalgam sold in california for all relevant periods of time contained package inserts that contained the proposition safe harbor warning language.see regs.the trial court order went on to observe that by operation of the doctrine of informed consent,dentists who implant dental amalgam in their patient teeth must provide their patients with all information material to their treatment,including proposition warnings so that the package inserts provide a clear and reasonable warning to the patient as a matter of law.
elf moved for reconsideration of this order based on the contention that a recent amendment to the regulations precluded reliance on the informed consent doctrine to uphold the sufficiency of warnings given to the dentists rather than to their patients.the trial court granted reconsideration but reaffirmed its original holding,observing that the adequacy of the informed consent doctrine to ensure that the warning reached the patient was but an ancillary issue to whether the warning came within the safe harbor provisions of the regulations.thereafter,judgment was entered and elf timely filed notice of appeal.
discussion 
proposition provides that n o person in the course of doing business shall knowingly and intentionally expose any individual to a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity without first giving clear and reasonable warning to such individual health,italics added such warning need not be provided separately to each exposed individual and may be provided by general methods such as labels on consumer products,posting of notices,placing notices in public news media,and the like,provided that the warning accomplished is clear and reasonable.health,subd.f,italics added.ingredient communication council,lungren th,d,fn.omitted.section of the health and safety code authorizes the lead agency designated by the governor to adopt and modify regulations,standards,and permits as necessary to conform with and implement the provisions of this chapter and to further its purposes.pursuant to this authority,implementing regulations have been promulgated by what is now the office of environmental health hazard assessment oehha.section of these regulations addresses the subject of clear and reasonable warnings.
section,subdivision a provides in general terms as follows whenever a clear and reasonable warning is required under section of the act,the method employed to transmit the warning must be reasonably calculated,considering the alternative methods available under the circumstances,to make the warning message available to the individual prior to exposure.the message must clearly communicate that the chemical in question is known to the state to cause cancer,or birth defects or other reproductive harm.subdivision b of section goes on to provide the safe harbor provisions for consumer products exposures warnings for consumer products exposures which include the methods of transmission and the warning messages as specified by this subsection shall be deemed to be clear and reasonable.the methods of transmission that qualify for safe harbor recognition are specified in subdivision b the warning may be provided by using one or more of the following methods singly or in combination a a warning that appears on a product label or other labeling.the term label means a display of written,printed or graphic matter upon a product or its immediate container.the term labeling means any label or other written,printed or graphic matter affixed to or accompanying a product or its container or wrapper.b identification of the product at the retail outlet in a manner which provides a warning.identification may be through shelf labeling,signs,menus,or a combination thereof.subdivision b of section specifies that t he warnings provided pursuant to subparagraphs a and b shall be prominently placed upon a product label or other labeling or displayed at the retail outlet with such conspicuousness,as compared with other words,statements,designs,or devices in the label,labeling or display as to render it likely to be read and understood by an ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase or use.finally,subdivision b of section specifies the language that the warning message must contain in order to qualify for recognition as a safe harbor.there is no dispute that wykle inserts use the precise terminology specified for products containing chemicals known to cause reproductive toxicity 
elf challenge to the sufficiency of wykle warning is essentially twofold.the principal thrust of its argument is that wykle has not chosen to utilize the safe harbor method of providing notice that is best suited to reach the patients who will be exposed to its product.wykle can seek to avail itself of the safe harbor regulations describing methods of warnings,it argues,but it can not choose the one least calculated actually to achieve the goal warn the exposed individual.while wykle chosen method falls far short of being the clear and reasonable warning the statute requires,wykle easily could have taken advantage of another of the regulation safe harbor provisions by giving dentists a sign to place in their office with a proposition warning.
this argument misperceives the effect of the safe harbor provisions.if a warning message in the words specified in the regulation is given in one of the methods specified by the regulation,the warning shall be deemed to be clear and reasonable,subd.b.the warning may be provided by using one or more of the methods specified,subd.b.these safe harbor warning schemes are so called because their use constitutes compliance with the act without the necessity of a factual determination.ingredient communication council,lungren,supra,th at,d.if a party subject to the requirements of proposition provides a warning in one of the specified safe harbor methods,it need not determine the efficacy of the chosen method or whether some other method would be more effective.since the act imposes civil liability where a warning is found not to be clear and reasonable,the revised final statement of reasons for adopting section recites,the agency has concluded that it is necessary to provide businesses with an opportunity to be certain that the warning which they give is reasonable or clear,or both the safe harbor is offered simply to provide the businesses choosing to use them reasonable certainty that they will not be subjected to an enforcement action over the warning they provide.oehha,final statement of reasons,div,clear and reasonable warnings.section was not intended to establish a hierarchy of required warnings,just safe harbors.further,a hierarchy would imply that the warning method used under the act be more than reasonable that it must be the best method.this is not the case.warnings must simply be clear and reasonable.id.at.a manufacturer does not have to use the best warning method to comply with proposition.people ex.rel.lungren cotter th,d.hence,whether or not posting signs in dental offices would be a more dependable means of warning patients than including inserts in the packages that may be read only by the dentists or their assistants,wykle has fulfilled its obligations if the insert that accompanies its product comes within any of the safe harbor provisions.
in this light,the disagreement between the parties over the ability to rely on dentists to warn their patients of the risks of mercury exposure is,as the trial court correctly observed,an ancillary issue.there are two potential sources of an obligation of a dentist installing amalgam in a patient mouth to warn the patient of any risk of reproductive toxicity.the first is proposition itself.health and safety code section places the duty to give a clear and reasonable warning upon any person who in the course of doing business knowingly and intentionally exposes another person to a chemical determined by the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity.every dentist is a person within the meaning of the statute health,subd.a,but a person in the course of doing business does not include one who employs fewer than employees in his or her business,subd.b.many dentists therefore may not be subject to the mandate of the statute.nonetheless,the professional duty of the dentist to obtain the patient informed consent before performing dental procedures may require the dentist to make such disclosure to the patient.cobbs grant cal d,warren schecter th,d.in the case of prescription drugs,the regulations expressly recognize the prescriber accepted practice of obtaining a patient informed consent as sufficient to ensure that drug labeling provided under federal law is deemed clear and reasonable,subd.b a.and the newly adopted provision upon which elf motion for reconsideration was based similarly acknowledges the accepted practice of obtaining the patient informed consent as ensuring that a warning is clear and reasonable in the case of exposures resulting from emergency or urgent medical or dental care in defined circumstances,subd.b b.yet,as elf argues and oehha response to comments to the proposed amendment acknowledged,there may well be situations in which proposition warnings might not otherwise be provided or required under other regulatory schemes or principles such as the tort doctrine of informed consent.oehha,final statement of reasons,supra.since those dentists with fewer than employees are not subject to the mandate that they transmit proposition warnings to their patients,elf undoubtedly is correct that it may not be assumed that wykle transmission of warnings to dentists ensures that the warning will be conveyed to all dental patients.what this proves,however,is only that for warnings included with medical and dental supplies sold to medical providers,one of the safe harbor methods of transmission may be insufficient to guaranty that the warnings reach the.this may suggest a need for revisions to the statute or to the present matter not within the province of the court,and as to which we express no it does not support the conclusion that a manufacturer who complies with the current safe harbor provisions is not protected from liability if alternative methods of transmission would be more effective.
elf second ground of attack,expressed in various ways throughout its brief,is that the warning on wykle insert is not sufficiently conspicuous to provide assurance that it will be read by those who receive it.elf acknowledges that the warning language is taken verbatim from the safe harbor regulation,subd.b b but contends that its size and placement on the instructions for capsules fails to satisfy section,subdivision b.as set forth above,this paragra
