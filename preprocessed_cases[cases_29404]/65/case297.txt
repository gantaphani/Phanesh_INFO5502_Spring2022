because we review de novo the evidence and testimony involved in a motion for summary judgment in the light most favorable to the party,we cast the facts and reasonable inferences of this case in the light most favorable to plaintiffs see hickerson pride mobility prods,cir.
a.the fire 
on the night of january,jeannine was reading and george was watching television in the den of their house.near george chair was the lakewood heater,an space heater,model,manufactured by lakewood in.george regularly used the lakewood heater to warm his feet while sitting in his den chair.according to plaintiffs expert martin gallaher gallaher,george said he used the lakewood heater on the night of january.around,jeannine went to bed.george remained in the den watching television,and went to bed around midnight.according to gallaher,in a june,letter to plaintiffs counsel gallaher letter,george said it was possible he left the lakewood heater on that night.
at around,jeannine arose to use the restroom and did not notice anything unusual in the house.at approximately,jeannine again awoke to use the restroom and,as she exited her bedroom,was engulfed in smoke.jeannine immediately woke up george,and george ran to the den to investigate the fire.jeannine saw fire coming from the kitchen of the house,called,and exited the house.george remained in the house.
the fayetteville fire department responded to jeannine call and rescued george from the house.by that time,the fire had spread throughout the house.jeannine and george were taken to the hospital where both were treated for smoke inhalation.jeannine remained in the hospital for three days,and george was released from the hospital thirteen days after the fire.the presleys home experienced extensive damage from the fire.
fire investigation 
after the fire,two fire inspectors from the fayetteville fire department,kyle curry inspector curry and dennis ledbetter inspector ledbetter,examined the presleys home and gathered evidence from the scene.in an attempt to identify the origin and cause of the fire,inspector curry and inspector ledbetter examined the burn and damage patterns on the interior and exterior of the home.the inspectors also gathered several items from around george chair for examination by an electrical engineer.the items collected included the lakewood heater,a carbon monoxide detector,several pieces of wiring,a floor lamp,candle remnants,and chair remnants.the inspectors also investigated possible electrical sources of the fire,noting there was an extension cord running from the area around george chair to an outlet on the east wall of the den into which the lakewood heater,the floor lamp,a cordless phone,and a massager were plugged.these findings were documented in a report prepared by inspector curry.
after examining the fire scene,inspector curry and inspector ledbetter concluded the fire began in the den next to george chair.however,inspector curry and inspector ledbetter could not specify an exact cause of the fire.inspector curry report stated the cause of the fire was undetermined at this time,with the evidence obtained at the scene to undergo further evaluation.
plaintiffs expert arms 
plaintiffs employed arms,a fire expert and electrical engineer,to investigate the cause of the fire and formulate a theory of fire causation.to guide his investigation and reasoning,arms generally relied upon nfpa guide for fire and explosion investigations nfpa,other treatises and handbooks,the scientific method,and his knowledge of electrical engineering and related disciplines.arms also developed his theories through his own observation and testing.
within a few months after the fire,arms personally observed the fire scene and the evidence collected by inspector curry.after observing the fire scene,arms agreed with inspector curry that the fire started in the den near george chair.arms observations also ruled out the cordless phone and massager as causes of the fire because these artifacts were not collected from the fire scene and were plugged into an extension cord outside the area of origin.further,arms examination of the lakewood heater identified acute damage at the double wire neutral connection which was unlike the damage to other connections in the heater.
in addition to his own observations,arms had metallurgical testing performed on the evidence collected from the fire scene.the metallurgical testing included macrophotography,stereoscopy,sem imagery,and eds analysis.although arms was not present for these tests,arms reviewed the results and discovered the double neutral wire connection had experienced severe corrosion from extreme heat and chlorine emitted by the heated wire insulation the double neutral wire had been improperly crimped resulting in a loose connection and production of heat the extension cord into which the lakewood heater was plugged and the male end of the lakewood heater power cord demonstrated burn patterns suggesting the lakewood heater was drawing electricity at the time of the fire and the extension cord remnants collected at the scene were not the cause of the fire because they demonstrated arc through char.
following the metallurgical tests,arms also analyzed flammability tests conducted by clayton and associates on components of an exemplar heater c a flammability tests.to conduct these tests,arms was provided exemplar heaters.during the c a flammability tests,samples of wire insulation and plastic from the exemplar heaters were suspended twelve inches above a cotton ball and subjected to a five second,inch flame.if,after applying the flame,the component burned or ignited the cotton ball by dripping,the test was concluded.however,if initially there was no sustained combustion,the flame was applied up to three times for an additional five seconds each time.after these tests had been conducted,arms discovered all of the components would burn to consumption after the heat from the flame was applied.
based upon his observation and the results of the metallurgical and c a flammability tests,arms hypothesized a manufacturing defect in the lakewood heater caused the fire.arms theory is summarized as follows 
george left the lakewood heater on when he went to bed on january,
while the lakewood heater was left on,a high resistance wire connection in the control panel on the neutral double wire became hot due to a defective crimp on the connection 
the heat from the improperly crimped connection caused wire insulation in the heater control panel to emit flammable gases,or off gas 
the released gases were then ignited through arcs created by the normal operation of the thermostat in the control panel 
the ignited gases created a fire on the insulation of the power cord in the heater control panel 
the flame on the power cord insulation ignited the insulation on a second power cord in the control panel 
the fire then burned up the insulation of the second power cord to the heater switch 
the heater switch ignited and spread the fire to the plastic around the heater lifting handle above the switch 
the fire from the lifting handle ignited the front cover of the heater 
the front cover of the heater melted away from the screw affixing it to the heater,fell on the carpet in the den,and spread the fire to other combustibles in the room including the drapes,the carpet,and george chair 
as the fire spread,it attacked the extension cord where the lakewood heater was plugged in and spread the fire down the extension cord to the south wall of the den and 
finally,the fire spread to the east wall of the den,and eventually to other parts of the house.
in an affidavit submitted to the district court,arms stated he put his theory together in pieces.arms explained he used a piecemeal approach because it would be impossible to recreate the fire scene and his ignition scenario.arms claimed the extended period of time over which the presley fire scenario developed,and the high cost of recreating the fire scene,made it impractical to sit down and develop a scenario where you actually heat up the wire with the resistance heating to cause gassing,to cause ignition,and the fire progress.thus,arms believed the fire events could not be replicated in a laboratory experiment.
arms testified no additional scientific testing was required to prove his theory,because each step of his theory was substantiated by either his observation and testing or established scientific principles.arms believed the heater was on because the metallurgical testing revealed burn patterns on the extension cord and the male end of the lakewood heater power cord which were indicative of electricity pull.further,the gallaher letter indicated george said he could have left the heater on.arms also stated,the metallurgical testing and the flammability testing support the scenario of and ignition by a competent source,the parting arc of the thermostat,the ignition of the insulation gases produced by the heated insulation,and sustained burning of the insulation until the plastic of the switch housing,the thermostat knob,and outer control cover are ignited.additionally,arms cited six nfpa sections which set forth scientific principles consistent with portions of his theory,and provided a study by john shea shea study which documented the ignition of pvc insulation by a parting arc.finally,arms stated his observations and metallurgical testing ruled out other causes for the fire and substantiated his theory of fire spread outside the heater.based on these findings and principles,arms asserted he was able to construct his theory cognitively.
district court proceedings 
after discovery,including lakewood deposition of arms,lakewood moved the district court to exclude arms testimony and grant lakewood summary judgment.lakewood argued arms failed to test adequately or provide scientific support for his causation theory,and absent arms testimony,plaintiffs lacked evidence of causation for their claims.in response to the motion,the district court conducted a hearing on arms testimony and allowed oral arguments on the motion for summary judgment.during this hearing,arms testified about his causation theory and methodology,and was subjected to examination by lakewood,plaintiffs,and the district court.at the end of the hearing,the district court made preliminary remarks that the motion to exclude arms expert opinion and the motion for summary judgment would be granted.
on december,the district court issued an order granting both of lakewood motions.the district court excluded arms expert opinion because arms failed to apply reliably the standards of nfpa to his theory,and granted summary judgment because,without arms testimony,plaintiffs could not produce sufficient evidence that the lakewood heater was either on or the cause of the fire.plaintiffs now appeal.
ii.discussion 
plaintiffs argue the district court erred in excluding arms testimony and in granting summary judgment to lakewood.we review the exclusion of expert testimony for abuse of discretion.pro service,lenan,cir.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the evidence and testimony in a light most favorable to the party and drawing all reasonable inferences of fact in that party favor.hickerson,at.
exclusion of arms expert opinion 
under federal rule of evidence,an expert opinion is admissible if the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data,the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods,and the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.
when determining the reliability of an expert opinion,the district court examines the following four factors whether it can be and has been tested whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication the known or potential rate of error and the method general acceptance.daubert,at.the above listed factors are not exhaustive or limiting,and a court must use the factors as it deems fit to tailor an examination of the reliability of expert testimony to the facts of each case.shuck cnh america,llc,cir citing jaurequi carter,cir.in addition,the district court can weigh whether the expertise was developed for litigation or naturally flowed from the expert research whether the proposed expert ruled out other alternative explanations and whether the proposed expert sufficiently connected the proposed testimony with the facts of the case.sappington skyjack,cir quoting lauzon senco,cir.while weighing these factors,the district court must continue to function as a gatekeeper who separates expert opinion evidence based on good grounds from subjective speculation that masquerades as scientific knowledge.glastetter novartis pharm,cir.
on appeal,plaintiffs argue the district court abused its discretion in excluding arms opinion because the court solely relied upon an erroneous interpretation and application of fireman fund ins.canon,cir.plaintiffs maintain the district court interpreted fireman fund to require testing at every step in fire cases.plaintiffs claim this court discussion in hickerson and shuck establish that testing is not the only way to provide reliability.plaintiffs posit our cases allow observation and expertise to be bases for reliability.thus,plaintiffs conclude the district court applied an overly rigid standard of reliability to arms opinion,and when arms opinion is analyzed under a less rigid standard,the district court abused its discretion by finding arms opinion was unreliable and similar to the expert opinions in fireman fund.
because interpretation and application of fireman fund drives plaintiffs appeal,a brief discussion of the opinion is necessary.in fireman fund,experts who claimed to follow nfpa proffered two alternative theories to support the conclusion that defendant copier caused a fire.at.in their first theory,the experts hypothesized the copier upper fixing heater assembly started on fire after the heater control circuitry and thermal fuse safety device malfunctioned.id.at.the experts claimed this theory was substantiated by tests in which the heater control circuitry in an exemplar copier was bypassed and electrical current was applied directly to the copier heating element to produce a thin brown scorch on paper affixed to the copier heating element.id.at.on appeal,our court affirmed the district court exclusion of the expert opinion.the panel stated the experts did not apply nfpa reliably to the facts of the case because the tests did not explain any malfunction sufficient to produce an open flame,the tests did not explain or replicate a specific malfunction,and the theory was inconsistent with evidence from the fire scene that the heating element was not receiving electricity at the time of the fire.id.at.
in the second theory,the experts opined the copier power supply board caused the fire.id.at.the experts based this theory on the following three factors burn patterns in the copier,new evidence obtained from two other separate incidents in which the power supply board emitted sparks and a flame,and a test which created sparks after dc voltage was applied to similar ac voltage components on the power supply board.id.at.on appeal,our court determined it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to find this theory was inconsistent with and did not reliably apply the standards of nfpa,because the experts failed to specify a specific defect,the new theory contradicted earlier explanations that the burn patterns proved the upper fixing heater caught on fire,and the experts did not explain how dc voltage would get to ac voltage components.id.at.
we agree with plaintiffs contention
