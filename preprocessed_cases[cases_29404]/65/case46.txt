plaintiff john giordano appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york jed rakoff,judge in a personal injury action filed by giordano against defendants market america,and the chemins company.giordano alleges that dietary supplements containing the substance ephedra that the defendants supplied caused his march cerebral aneurism and subsequent medical events.on april,the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on the grounds that giordano lawsuit,filed on july,was barred by the statute of limitations set forth in.see in re ephedra prods.liab,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,ephedra ii.the court concluded that the extension of the statute of limitations provided for in for situations in which the cause of the injury was not discovered during the original period to file suit was inapplicable because section is limited to latent injuries and that injuries caused by ephedra were not latent.id.
the plaintiff appealed from the district court judgment and we heard oral argument on november.on august,we remanded for the limited purpose of asking the district court to determine whether a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether an additional requirement of had been met,namely that giordano allege and prove that technical,scientific or medical knowledge and information sufficient to ascertain the cause of his injury had not been discovered,identified or determined prior to the expiration of the otherwise applicable statute of limitations.see giordano mkt,cir summary order.on february,in response to our question and with expressed doubt as to the standard to be applied under new york law,the district court concluded that under any possible standard there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether sufficient information had been discovered,identified or determined at the relevant time.see in re ephedra prods.liab,d,ephedra iii.
the applicability of to giordano claims is now before this court again.the resolution of this issue requires us to answer three separate questions of new york law are the provisions of providing for an extension of the statute of limitations in certain circumstances limited to actions for injuries caused by the latent effects of exposure to a substance can an injury that occurs within to hours of exposure to a substance be considered latent for these purposes what standards should be applied to determine whether a genuine issue of material fact exists for resolution by a trier of fact as to whether technical,scientific or medical knowledge and information sufficient to ascertain the cause of the plaintiff injury was discovered,identified or determined for purposes resolving the third question requires us to decide both the level of certainty required for knowledge to be deemed sufficient to ascertain the cause of an injury,and the community that must possess this is,whether the knowledge must be reasonably available to a plaintiff and his or her lawyers,or whether it must be reasonably available to the scientific,technical,or medical community.
in this instance,the district court found that some studies suggesting a possible connection between ephedra and injuries similar to giordano were published in reputable scientific journals that were publicly available during the period after discovery of giordano injury,but that there was a lack of awareness of the risks by even the most interested members of the public during that time.ephedra iii,d at.
the three questions of statutory interpretation raised by this appeal have not been answered conclusively by new york courts.they,in turn,implicate questions of public policy pertaining to how the new york legislature intended to balance the rights of those suffering personal injuries with the rights of defendants and with the need for judicial economy.new york courts are better situated to answer these questions than are we.we therefore certify them to the new york court of appeals.
background 
pursuant to an order of the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation,see,the district court that decided this case is charged with managing some civil actions,including this one,involving claims of personal injury or wrongful death caused by dietary supplements containing ephedra.in re ephedra prods.liab,d,ephedra i.ephedra is a plant containing ephedrine alkaloids.id.at.until relatively recently,products containing ephedra were widely used by consumers seeking weight loss,increased energy and improved athletic performance.see also id.at.
the food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca prohibits t he introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food that is adulterated a.section of the fdca provides that a food shall be deemed to be adulterated i f it is a dietary supplement or contains a dietary ingredient that presents a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury id.f a.on february,the united states food and drug administration fda effectively banned ephedra by declaring dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids adulterated under the fdca.see final rule declaring dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids adulterated because they present an unreasonable risk fda final rule.this rule became effective on april.id.
the district court opinion in ephedra i granting in part and denying in part motions to exclude expert testimony pursuant to rule of the federal rules of evidence and daubert merrell dow,d,provides background regarding the alleged effects of ephedra.
according to the consolidated plaintiffs experts 
e phedra can cause injury in susceptible people by increasing their blood pressure and heart rate a n individual blood pressure and heart rate normally vary over the course of a day,week and season,and the effects of ephedra in an individual also vary over the course of the day in relation to when it was ingested and the individual metabolism.if ephedra can sometimes be a contributing cause of heart attack,stroke,or sudden death in susceptible people,the injury might be triggered by the coincidence of peak events,such as transient peak blood pressure due to other causes occurring at the same time as peak ephedrine blood level.the longer the duration of repeated exposure,the more likely such coincidence will occur.
ephedra i,d at.
according to the fda 
people who use dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids are at increased risk for serious adverse events,including heart attack,stroke,and death.susceptible individuals,those with coronary artery disease or heart failure,many of whom may not know they have underlying illnesses,are at increased risk for adverse events because these products can cause abnormal heart rhythms effect,even when the product is ingested at recommended doses over a short course one or a few doses.over longer periods of use,the risk for adverse health effects to the general population,including susceptible individuals,increases further due to a sustained elevation in blood pressure.
fda final rule.at.
before the district court,all parties 
agree d that a recommended dose of a product containing ephedra often raises the user blood pressure heart rate during the first few hours after ingestion,and they agree d that any increase maintained over years in a person usual blood pressure or heart rate significantly increases the risk of cardiac injury and stroke.
ephedra i,d at emphasis omitted.
the district court also noted in its decision granting summary judgment to the defendants here that ephedra acts within a few hours to cause a transitory elevation of blood pressure and heart rate and a temporary constriction of certain blood vessels.ephedra ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
for approximately two years,ending on march,giordano used thermochrome,a dietary supplement containing ephedra.the chemins company,manufactured thermochrome market america,distributed it.
on march,giordano suffered a cerebral aneurysm.he underwent neurosurgery to repair it,but suffered two strokes on march,days later.he was left with substantial cognitive,motor,and visual deficits.giordano physicians were unable to determine the cause of the aneurysm or the strokes.
nearly four years later,in february,giordano became aware of news reports that the sudden death of baseball player steve bechler might have been linked to his use of an dietary supplement.according to giordano affidavit,these news reports were his first indication that thermochrome may have been a cause of his aneurysm and strokes.
some five months later,on july,giordano instituted this action in new york state supreme court.the defendants removed it to the united states district court for the southern district of new york on the basis of diversity of citizenship.see.they subsequently moved for summary judgment on grounds.on april,the district court granted the summary judgment motions.ephedra ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.giordano appealed.
after hearing argument on november,we remanded pursuant to the procedures set forth in united states jacobson,cir,for the limited purpose of having the district court decide whether a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether an additional requirement of had been met,namely that the plaintiff allege and prove that technical,scientific or medical knowledge and information sufficient to ascertain the cause of his injury had not been discovered,identified or determined prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations.see giordano.at.had the district court concluded that such knowledge had been discovered,identified or determined prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations,and had we affirmed on that issue on appeal,we would have been in a position to affirm the district court summary judgment without further addressing the other questions raised on appeal.
although it expressed doubt as to what standard to apply,the district court answered this question in the affirmative under any standard.ephedra iii,d at.it also suggested that,on further appeal,we might want to consider certification to the new york court of appeals to sort this all out.id.at.lacking the authority itself to certify questions to the court of appeals,the district court was bound to follow the interpretation of the appellate division in the absence of persuasive evidence that the new york court of appeals would rule differently if presented with the issue,id.at,which the district court did.
the defendants now seek review of the district court findings with respect to the existence of sufficient technical,scientific or medical knowledge to ascertain the cause of injury,and also seek affirmance of the district court prior holding that was inapplicable because ephedra did not cause any latent injuries.see appellee market america ltr.br.at filed,appellee chemins.ltr.br.at filed.in the alternative,the defendants seek certification of these issues to the new york court of appeals.see,appellee market america ltr.br.at.
giordano,conversely,seeks affirmance of the district court findings with respect to the existence of sufficient knowledge of causation,and reversal of the court findings regarding latency.he opposes certification to the new york court of appeals at this time.see appellant aff.in opp.to appellees ltr.br.at filed.his preference for resolution of these issues without the further expenditure of time and money with an uncertain result is understandable.
discussion 
new york civil practice law and rules extends the statute of limitations for filing a personal injury claim in specified circumstances if the cause of injury was not and could not reasonably have been discovered during the period for filing a claim that is set forth in section.applying section to the facts at hand requires answering three separate questions,the first of which is whether section is limited to injuries that are latent.provided that the answer to that question is in the affirmative,the second question is whether injuries caused by ephedra,which are typically if not universally experienced within hours of its ingestion,are or may be latent for section purposes.if so,the third question is whether a genuine issue of material fact exists for the trier of fact as to whether technical,medical,or scientific knowledge sufficient to ascertain the cause of giordano injury had been discovered,identified,or determined during the period.each of these questions involves an issue of law that has not previously been addressed by new york courts.
in addressing the third question,we must take into account that some studies suggesting a possible connection between ephedra and injuries similar to giordano were published in reputable scientific journals that were publicly available during the period after discovery of giordano injury,but that there was a lack of awareness of the risks by even the most interested members of the public during that time.ephedra iii,d at.
the third question is further complicated by two ambiguities regarding the standard that should be used in answering it.first,it is unclear what level of certainty is required for knowledge to be sufficient to ascertain the cause of an injury.second,it is unclear what relevant group must possess this knowledge,the plaintiff and his or her lawyers,or the scientific,technical,or medical community.
standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.summary judgment is warranted only where,construing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the and drawing all reasonable inferences in that party favor,there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.mcbride bic consumer prods,cir citations,internal quotation marks,and ellipsis omitted.the same standard applies whether summary judgment is granted on the merits or on an affirmative defense such as the statute of limitations.see buttry signal,cir.although summary judgment may,of course,be an appropriate means for disposing of an action that is barred by the statute of limitations,it may not be granted if there is a genuine issue of fact as to when the limitations period began or expired and that fact is material to the question of whether the statute has run.see bellsouth,grace,cir citing charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure,at,ed.
ii.new york statute of limitations 
because our jurisdiction rests on diversity of citizenship and giordano cause of action arose in new york,we apply new york substantive law and statute of limitations.see guaranty trust york.stuart am.cyanamid,cir,cert.denied,d.
new york civil practice law and rules sets forth the generally applicable limitations period for claims a n action to recover damages for a personal injury,must be commenced within three years,id,except as provided in,inter alia,section,id.
two provisions of section are relevant here.section provides 
notwithstanding the provisions of section,the three year period within which an action to recover damages for personal injury or injury to property caused by the latent effects of exposure to any substance or combination of substances,in any form,upon or within the body or upon or within property must be commenced shall be computed from the date of discovery of the injury by the plaintiff or from the date when through the exercise of reasonable diligence such injury should have been discovered by the plaintiff,whichever is earlier.
id.section provides 
notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions two and three of this section,where the discovery of the cause of the injury is alleged to have occurred less than five years after discovery of the injury or when with reasonable diligence such injury should have been discovered,whichever is earlier,an action may be commenced or a claim filed within one year of such discovery of the cause of the injury provided,however,if any such action is commenced or claim filed after the period in which it would otherwise have been authorized pursuant to subdivision two or three of this section the plaintiff or claimant shall be required to allege and prove that technical,scientific or medical knowledge and information sufficient to ascertain the cause of his injury had not been discovered,identified or determined prior to the expiration of the period within which the action or claim would have been authorized and that he has otherwise satisfied the requirements of subdivisions two and three of this section.
it is undisputed that giordano did not commence litigation within three years of being exposed to ephedra,and that his suit was thus not commenced within the general limitations period provided by section.he ingested the product containing ephedra for two years up to and likely including march.he did not file suit,however,until july,more than three but less than five years later.
moreover,giordano claim is not covered by section because he did not assert it within three years of discovering the injury alleged to have been caused by aneurysm,which occurred on march,and the strokes,which occurred two days thereafter.the question for us,then,is whether section,which in certain circumstances provides for a limitations period running from the date of discovery of the cause of an injury,saves giordano claim.
because section and its subsections provide exceptions to the general statute of limitations,giordano bears the burden of showing that one of the exceptions applies to his claim.see bano union carbide,cir burger union carbide,per curiam.
iii.the district court decisions 
the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants based on its conclusion that the foregoing exceptions to new york statute of limitations did not apply.ephedra ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
the court determined at the outset that new york courts do not allow equitable tolling of the statute of limitations,wl,at,dist.lexis,at citing in re county des.consequently,any extension of or exception to the statute of limitations must be found in section.id.giordano does not take issue with this conclusion.
the district court then noted that section,but not section,expressly applies only to injuries caused by the latent effects of exposure to a substance.despite the absence of the term latent effects in section,the section governing discovery of the cause of injury more than three but less than five years after discovery of the injury,the district court concluded that that section is also limited to injuries caused by latent effects.the district court conclusion was based primarily on the several references in section to section,the section containing the latent effects language,wl,at,dist.lexis,at citing bano,at.
the district court then concluded as a matter of law,based on the undisputed evidence before it,that ephedra alleged effects on giordano were not latent.first,the court observed that giordano discovered his stroke immediately upon its occurrence,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.second,the court noted that the evidence admitted at the daubert hearings in the consolidated cases showed that ephedra effects were,usually occurring within a few hours of ingestion,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the district court reasoned that t o hold applicable to a stroke allegedly caused by ephedra would effectively eliminate the statute limitation to latent effects,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
rather than decide the latency question unnecessarily,we remanded with instruction to the district court to determine whether there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether sufficient scientific or medical knowledge was available to giordano such that he could have ascertained the cause of his injury prior to the expiration of the limitations period provided by section.giordano.at.
in answering this question in the affirmative,the district court recognized two separate ambiguities in the statute and,as noted,suggested that certification to the new york court of approach not available to the district be appropriate.ephedra iii,d at.
first,the court viewed the statute as ambiguous as to whether sufficient knowledge to ascertain the cause of an injury requires certainty as to the cause,as suggested by the dictionary definition of the term,or requires something akin to finding a probable connection,which the court understood to be the way in which the new york appellate division,third department,had construed the term.id.at.
second,the district court viewed the statute to be ambiguous as to precisely who has to know what before applies.id.at.the court was unable to determine from the face of the statute whether the knowledge of the cause of injury needed to be reasonably available to the scientific and medical communities or reasonably available to the plaintiff.id.the court recognized that some studies did exist linking ephedra to injuries similar to giordano as early as,but also observed that most lawsuits related to these studies were not filed until after,suggesting,at least,a lack of awareness of the risks by even the most interested members of the public prior to that time.id.
despite these problematic aspects of the statute,the district court found a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the requisite knowledge existed because there are genuine issues of material fact remaining to be resolved on virtually any view one takes of the meaning of.id.at.
iv.analysis 
latent effects.the presence of a latency requirement in section.
we find insufficient guidance in the text of section,its legislative history,and the new york state case law interpreting it to decide whether there is an implied requirement that injuries be latent in order for the provision to apply.
there is indeed support for the district court conclusion that section is limited to injuries caused by the latent effects of exposure even though that subsection does not expressly use those words.the proviso clause of section permits an action to be brought if it is commenced after the period in which it would otherwise have been authorized pursuant to section and requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that he has otherwise satisfied the requirements of section.if giordano injuries were not caused by the latent effects of exposure to ephedra,then the terms of section were never applicable to him his action would not otherwise have been authorized pursuant to section and he can not be said to have otherwise satisfied the requirements of section.id.
but there are persuasive arguments to the contrary.latency was expressly made a requirement in section but omitted from section.as these sections are drafted in largely parallel fashions,with the first relating to discovery of an injury and the second relating to discovery of the cause of an injury,we find it plausible that this omission was intentional.
the notion that the legislature intentionally omitted this requirement is consistent with the differing purposes of the subsections.section governs injuries that are not discovered until after the statute of limitations.a requirement of latency serves a limiting purpose by eliminating claims where the injury could have been but was not discovered,and in so doing places an added onus on the plaintiff to comply with the statute of limitations by timely prosecuting actions based on injuries that are discoverable.were this requirement not in the statute,courts would presumably be forced to decide cases in which there was a dispute over whether a plaintiff was reasonably diligent in discovering an injury.by adding a latency requirement,courts are provided with more of a rule that serves the purpose of promoting judicial economy while nonetheless permitting suit to be brought in some circumstances for injuries that were not discoverable within the time period.
section,on the other hand,governs injuries whose causes could not have been reasonably known during the time period for filing a claim.in these cases,a requirement of latency does not promote the diligent prosecution of claims.the question under section is whether sufficient information was available regarding the cause of an injury to reasonably expect the plaintiff to have taken timely legal action.whether the injury was latent or patent is irrelevant to the answer.in contrast to the latency requirement of section,which prods plaintiffs to be diligent in discovering injuries,a latency requirement would have little effect on the purposes of section inasmuch as it has little impact on the diligence with which plaintiffs make themselves aware of scientific information concerning the cause of an injury.
