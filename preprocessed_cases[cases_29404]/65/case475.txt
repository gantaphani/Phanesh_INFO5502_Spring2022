background 
plaintiff isherwood is a canadian citizen and resident of british columbia.fox,a california corporation,manufactures bicycle parts,including front fork racing shocks.on april,plaintiff was mountain biking downhill in british columbia on a mountain bike purchased from oak bay bikes,a retail bicycle shop in british columbia.the mountain bike was assembled with specialized component parts selected by plaintiff from various manufacturers,including a frame manufactured by specialized bicycle components,specialized,a california corporation an adapter made by full speed ahead,a washington corporation a headset made by king cycle group,king,an oregon corporation and fox vanilla rc forks which a lot of professionals rode.according to plaintiff first amended complaint,the steerer tube used in the fox racing shocks broke as plaintiff landed a jump.plaintiff was thrown forward,resulting in a spinal cord injury.
plaintiff filed this action on april,alleging negligence,strict products liability,breach of the implied warranty of merchantability,and breach of the implied warranty for a particular purpose.tamara jayne bickerton,who later became plaintiff wife also alleged loss of consortium,but she subsequently obtained dismissal of her claim with prejudice.in addition to fox,plaintiff named specialized,king,and full speed ahead.
the following day,april,plaintiff filed another court action in vancouver,british columbia,naming as defendants snc cycles snc cycles and three doe corporations,as well as three individuals as john doe defendants.in this pleading plaintiff alleged that the identities of the corporate and individual doe defendants were unknown to him,even though the allegations were the same as those in the california action filed one day earlier.he also alleged that snc cycles was the owner and operator of oak bay bicycles.as in the california action,plaintiff claimed that the negligence of these defendants was responsible for the april,accident that had caused his injuries.
the caption of the british columbia pleading named peter dilwyn iserwood as plaintiff.according to fox,the misspelling of plaintiff name,together with the intentional withholding of the defendants true names,precluded discovery of this lawsuit despite multiple searches of the dockets of the vancouver courts.in addition,plaintiff had testified in his october deposition that he had never been a plaintiff in a lawsuit other than this one.he also answered no to an interrogatory question about whether,in the past years,he had filed an action or made a written claim or demand for compensation for his personal injuries.
full speed ahead obtained summary judgment in the california action on december.specialized and king likewise obtained summary judgment on february,leaving only fox as a defendant in this case.
on march,fox moved to dismiss or,in the alternative,stay all further proceedings in the california case on the ground of forum non conveniens.citing code of civil procedure section,subdivision a and section,subdivision a,fox argued that british columbia,where the canadian case was ongoing,was a suitable forum because plaintiff was a british columbia resident,the accident took place in british columbia,and all relevant evidence,medical personnel,and percipient witnesses were located there.fox believed it was at an unfair disadvantage because it had no way to compel the appearance at trial of any of the crucial canadian witnesses,whereas plaintiff would be able to obtain the cooperation of his most favorable witnesses.furthermore,oak bay bikes,the british columbia retailer,was a defendant in the canadian action.the two cases should be tried together,fox argued,to prevent piecemeal litigation,assure plaintiff a full recovery,and ensure the participation of oak bay bikes,which was potentially liable.finally,fox argued that public interests favored sending this case which could result in a lengthy,technically complex trial to canada,to avoid the further congestion of california already overburdened courts by a plaintiff with no connection to this state.fox stipulated that it would subject itself to jurisdiction in british columbia.
plaintiff responded that fox motion was precluded as a matter of law because it had already taken advantage of california legal process by conducting discovery in the case.plaintiff did not dispute that british columbia was a suitable forum,but he maintained that california was equally suitable.in his view,the private and public interest factors did not support a conclusion that california was a seriously inconvenient forum.
fox disputed plaintiff claims of discovery abuse and pointed to misstatements in plaintiff own discovery responses.it explained that despite its docket searches,it had not learned of the british columbia lawsuit until june,through its communication with oak bay bikes which had not been named in the california action.fox asserted that plaintiff had deliberately concealed the british columbia litigation.not only was plaintiff name misspelled in the caption of the british columbia complaint,but he had withheld the identities of the defendants by suing them as doe corporations and alleging that he was unaware of their identities.one of those doe defendants was fox itself,through the allegation of the negligent design or manufacture of the steerer tube fox also pointed out that even after it learned about the british columbia lawsuit,it lacked universal consensus among defendants and therefore was unable to seek a stay or dismissal until the other defendants had obtained summary judgment.
on april,the superior court denied fox motion.it rejected plaintiff theory that fox had made an untimely request after conducting extensive discovery regardless of whether plaintiff was forthcoming about having filed a lawsuit in canada,plaintiff did initiate suit there arising from the same facts,and fox could not have brought this motion sooner due to the involvement of other defendants who are no longer in the case.the court further acknowledged the parties stipulation that british columbia was a suitable forum.it then proceeded to weigh the private and public interest factors it found relevant.invoking the test articulated in ford motor insurance of north america th,ford,the court stated that t he inquiry is not whether some other state or country provides a better forum than does california,but whether california is a seriously inconvenient forum.ford motor insurance of north america th,quoting northrop american motorists ins,d.while there are some factors that weigh against maintaining this action in california,others weigh in favor of proceeding here,such as whether a california defendant is manufacturing and selling defective parts.after balancing several factors,the court concludes that california is not an inconvenient forum.on november,after receiving fox petition for writ of mandate and plaintiff preliminary opposition,we issued an order to show cause.plaintiff filed a return,followed by fox reply.

legal framework 
the doctrine of forum non conveniens is rooted in equity.it allows a court to decline to exercise its jurisdiction over a case when it determines that the case may be more appropriately and justly tried elsewhere.stangvik shiley cal d,stangvik.the legislature endorsed the application of this principle by enacting section,which states,in subdivision a,when a court upon motion of a party or its own motion finds that in the interest of substantial justice an
