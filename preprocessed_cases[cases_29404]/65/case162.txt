appellant rozlyn ackermann ackermann challenges the district court grant of summary judgment dismissing her claim that wyeth pharmaceuticals wyeth failed adequately to warn about the risk of suicide from its drug effexor,and this deficiency led to her husband suicide.because ackermann has failed to demonstrate causation under the doctrine,we affirm.
background 
in november,martin ackermann martin,a businessman,suffered from clinical depression brought on by severe business and family problems.martin initially sought treatment from his personal physicians and began taking the prescription antidepressant drug celexa.
acting on a friend advice,martin sought treatment from psychiatrist thomas sonn on january.martin saw sonn four times in the following eight days.during that time,sonn changed martin medication and gave him a sample trial of another antidepressant,effexor xr sonn instructed martin to take one pill each day as he monitored him.martin took one pill for three days,then took one pill each day from january to january.
on january,martin complained to sonn of various side effects he attributed to effexor,including and anxiety.martin announced he would no longer take the medication and terminated his relationship with sonn.nevertheless,sonn changed martin medication from effexor to celexa because of the side effects.martin continued to take celexa for five days until january,when he committed suicide with a revolver.at the time of his death,martin had detectable levels of celexa,but not effexor,in his bloodstream.
rozlyn ackermann,his widow,sued wyeth,the manufacturer of effexor,in july,pleading causes of action under strict liability,negligence including failure to warn,and implied warranty theories under common law and the texas deceptive trade protection act dtpa she also pleaded breach of express warranty,fraud,and misrepresentation.
wyeth initially moved for partial summary judgment,arguing that ackermann claims conflicted with and were preempted by federal law.sonn then testified at deposition that he believed the package insert for effexor as it existed in january adequately warned him of the risks of suicide and that he would continue to prescribe the drug to depressed patients.in june,wyeth filed a separate motion for summary judgment on all claims.regarding the claims,wyeth asserted a defense based on the doctrine and,alternatively,on the statutory presumption of created by section a of the texas civil practice remedies code.wyeth argued that summary judgment was appropriate for ackermann implied and express warranty claims under common law and the dtpa because no sale of the product had occurred,and because she had failed to identify an express warranty that had been breached.finally,wyeth argued that summary judgment was appropriate regarding her fraud and misrepresentation claims because she had failed to identify specific misrepresentations.
the magistrate judge first recommended that the district court grant wyeth motion for partial summary judgment based on preemption.subsequently,the magistrate judge recommended that the district court grant wyeth june motion for summary judgment on all claims,adopting,inter alia,wyeth doctrine theory for the claims.ackermann filed various objections.the district court overruled her objections,adopted the magistrate judge recommendation to grant summary judgment for all the claims based on the dismissed the lawsuit.the magistrate judge,in turn,vacated as moot his report recommending partial summary judgment based on preemption.
ackermann timely appealed.the only issue before this court is whether the doctrine bars her and claims.she does not challenge the district court conclusions regarding her express and implied warranty,fraud,and misrepresentation claims.wyeth responds that the district court correctly applied the doctrine,but it alternatively requests that this court affirm the district court on preemption grounds,should we hold that the doctrine is inapplicable.
ii.discussion 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.ford motor.dep t of,cir.summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.mcneil wyeth,cir quoting.c.the evidence and inferences from the summary judgment record are viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.minter great am.ins.of,cir.but w here the party fails to establish the existence of an element essential to that party case,and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial,no genuine issue of material fact can exist.whiting of,cir quoting celotex catrett,d.
the doctrine states that,in some situations,a warning to an intermediary fulfills a supplier duty to warn consumers.see alm aluminum of.in texas,the most common use of this doctrine is in prescription drug cases.labs.medrano,no writ citations omitted.under the doctrine,a doctor stands between the patient and the manufacturer,professionally evaluating the patient needs,assessing the risks and benefits of available drugs,prescribing one,and supervising its use.id.if the doctor is properly warned of the possibility of a side effect and is advised of the symptoms normally accompanying the side effect,it is anticipated that injury to the patient will be avoided.accordingly,the doctrine excuses a drug manufacturer from warning each patient who receives the product when the manufacturer properly warns the prescribing physician of the product dangers.porterfield ethicon,cir.
the doctrine is not an affirmative defense.under texas law,it delineates to whom a a prescription drug the duty to warn,but it is not used to show that the plaintiff has no valid case.medrano,at see also harrison am.home prods.in re norplant contraceptive prods.liab.litig,cir making an erie guess that the texas supreme court would hold that the doctrine is a doctrine rather than a defense.thus,when the warning to the intermediary is inadequate or misleading,the manufacturer remains liable for injuries sustained by the ultimate user.alm,at.
to recover for failure to warn under this doctrine,a plaintiff must show that the warning was defective,and the failure to warn was a producing cause of the injury.porterfield,at in other words,u nder texas law,a plaintiff who complains that a prescription drug warning is inadequate must also show that the alleged inadequacy caused her doctor to prescribe the drug for her.mcneil,at internal quotations omitted.if,however,the physician was aware of the possible risks involved in the use of the product but decided to use it anyway,the adequacy of the warning is not a producing cause of the injury and the plaintiff recovery must be denied.porterfield,at.even if the physician is not aware of a risk,the plaintiff must show that a proper warning would have changed the decision of the treating physician,that but for the inadequate warning,the treating physician would have not used or prescribed the product.dyer danek,d,quoting willett baxter int l,cir see also burton am.home prods.in re norplant contraceptive prods.liab.litig,applying the willett standard to texas law medrano,at.
in prescription drug cases involving the learned intermediary doctrine,when a warning specifically mentions the circumstances complained of,the warning is adequate as a matter of law.mcneil,at quoting rolen burroughs wellcome,writ denied.here,the january package insert warning mentions the risk for suicide twice the first instance states that suicide risk is inherent in depression and may persist until significant remission occurs,and cautions that c lose supervision of patients should accompany initial drug therapy.more importantly,the second instance identifies the frequencies of suicidal behavior observed in patients taking effexor and lists suicide attempt as occurring infrequent ly.infrequent occurrences are defined as those occurring in to patients in wyeth premarketing assessment.suicide ideation or attempts were not listed as adverse events documented in postmarketing reports 
ackermann nonetheless contends that there was nothing in the effexor label to suggest that effexor may produce suicidality or any of its known precursors,and characterizes this as a no warnings case.she is incorrect.the package insert identified the possible risk for suicide twice,including listing suicide attempt as infrequent and quantifying the risk according to its research.taken together,the insert discussions of suicide establish that at least some risk of suicide exists when a patient takes effexor.but if the manufacturer decides to label a risk as comparatively rare and also to provide a numerical quantification of that risk,that number must be within a certain degree of accuracy the issue is therefore whether there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the label was misleading.mcneil,at.
an issue of fact may exist regarding whether there were significant differences between the disclosed risk and the actual risk of suicide known by wyeth in january.we need not determine,however,whether the warning for risk level of suicide was misleading,because,as wyeth contends,this appeal is resolved on the second prong of the analysis,namely,whether any defect in the effexor warning was a substantial cause of martin death.porterfield,at.
the doctrine bars ackermann claims if she can not show that the allegedly inadequate warning was a producing cause of her husband death.there must be a genuine issue of material fact whether sonn would have prescribed effexor had the warning been adequate.to carry her burden in defeating summary judgment,ackermann first argues that sonn testimony about the certainty of his decision to prescribe effexor even with a more complete warning was inconsistent.alternatively,she contends that a texas presumption overcomes the doctor testimony by presuming that when an adequate warning is given by the manufacturer,it is heeded by the learned intermediary.we address each argument in turn.
sonn testimony 
in her opposition to wyeth summary judgment motion,ackermann proposed a specific warning for suicide risk that she contended wyeth should have provided in january because sonn had not been examined by either party regarding that proposed warning in his december deposition,wyeth obtained permission from ackermann to ask sonn ex parte to review the postulated warning sonn then executed a sworn declaration stating that he had reviewed the proposed warning and concluded 
if the proposed warning had been communicated to me effectively and in a prominent manner before i prescribed effexor xr to martin ackermann in january,i would have considered or heeded it just as i consider or heed any warning,but it would not have changed my decision to prescribe effexor xr to martin ackermann to treat his depression,beginning with pills.it also would have not changed my decision to monitor and observe martin ackermann closely for risks as i did by,among other things,a seeing him in person four times in the eight days he was my patient,and b providing contact information and asking that i be informed immediately of any changes in his behavior.
sonn continued 
if there were a legal requirement that i communicate the proposed warning directly to a patient,i would comply with that requirement.otherwise,and as i did with martin ackermann,i would address the risks reflected in that warning by close monitoring and observation,rather than through discussions with the patient expressly mentioning the risk of suicide or suicide.
ackermann relies on this court reasoning in mcneil to suggest that these statements are in conflict and create an issue of fact regarding causation.in mcneil,the prescribing doctor gave conflicting testimony regarding whether he would have prescribed reglan had he known of significant risks associated with the drug.at.he said he would have prescribed the drug and alerted the patient to significant risks had he been aware of them,but he also stated that he would not have prescribed the drug had the label stated that the benefits decrease while the risks increase with prolonged use.id.on this basis,the court held there was a genuine issue concerning whether the doctor would have prescribed reglan if given a proper warning.
sonn gave no such contradictory testimony his testimony was unequivocal.in his deposition and in his later declaration,sonn affirmed that he would have prescribed effexor to martin and adhered to the treatment regimen he used regardless whether he had received the proposed stronger warning in december,he testified that he would not have warned martin about the possibility of an increased risk of suicide primarily based on his belief that the suggestion would either plant seeds in the patient mind that suicide was an option or would discourage the patient from pursuing pharmacological treatment.he testified that his medical training regarding clinical depression and his experience from treating other patients with effexor made him aware of the need to monitor depressed patients for suicide ideation,but that he also read the warnings regarding the risk of suicide and believed they were adequate and did not provide him with new information.other than some possible future legal requirement mandating that he tell patients about potential increased risk for suicide,sonn stated that he would continue his normal practice of balancing the risks and benefits of the drug with the treatment needs of the patient when deciding what to disclose to patients 
sonn was asked to review the warning label accompanying effexor that was in effect at the time of his deposition in december,which included a black box warning for potential increased suicide in children and adolescents when asked if the black box warning would change his practice with adults,he responded that he would feel medically that providing specific suicide warnings was indicated.when asked a question in august about a proposed similar warning for adults,sonn reiterated his prior testimony and confirmed that it would not have changed his decision to prescribe effexor xr to martin ackermann to treat his depression.
ackermann argues that sonn testimony,like the doctor testimony in mcneil,is conflicting.she points to his comment if there were a legal requirement that i communicate the warning set forth directly to a patient,i would comply with that requirement.she contends that a legal requirement to communicate warnings is implicit within the doctrine.while the manufacturer can rely upon an intermediary to fulfill the manufacturer duty to warn,this reliance seems less reasonable where the learned intermediary fails to pass necessary information to the patient because the manufacturer has understated the degree of risk.mcneil,at.because she construes this as a no warnings case,she argues that wyeth completely sabotaged the intermediary,who,in turn,failed to warn martin of the risk of suicide.for this reason,she views sonn testimony that he would have given a required warning to mean,if wyeth had given me a warning,i would have warned.this interpretation,however,is incompatible with sonn testimony that his treatment protocol would not have changed and he still would have prescribed effexor regardless of the warning given by the manufacturer.ackermann interpretation fails because the warnings for effexor did include warnings of the risk of suicide,and sonn was aware of the risk for suicide,not just from reading the warning label for effexor,which mentioned the risk for suicide twice,but also from his training and experience as a psychiatrist treating depressed patients.under mcneil,no genuine issue of material fact exists regarding whether the inadequacy of the warning was a producing cause of her husband death.sonn would have prescribed effexor even had the warning been stronger.
presumption 
appellant also contends that,regardless of sonn testimony,texas law creates a presumption of supporting a causal link between wyeth inadequate warning and her husband death texas law creates no such presumption.
in general,when a manufacturer fails to give adequate warnings or instructions,a rebuttable presumption arises that the product user would have read and heeded s
