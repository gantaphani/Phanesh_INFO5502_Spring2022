this appeal requires us to consider the vitality of the idea of group or collective legal accountability in the products liability context.for well over a quarter century,courts across the nation have struggled with a variety of novel theories under which manufacturers of a defective product could assertedly be held liable in damages to plaintiffs injured by use of or exposure to it.litigation involving asbestos,tobacco,and des are prominent examples.owing to circumstances,the plaintiffs in such cases often were unable to identify the specific manufacturer of the product that allegedly produced their injuries.the rule at common law,of course,placed tort litigants under an unwaivable requirement of proving not only a compensable injury but also the identity of the offending manufacturer whose acts caused the plaintiff injury.proof of causation,in other words,is an essential condition for liability in tort.
in the struggle to adjust traditional notions of tort liability to the changing realities of national business practices,five more or less distinct theories have arisen.under all of them,product manufacturers can be held jointly and in tort without proof of causation as conventionally understood in tort law.these doctrines,going under such names as alternative liability,or enterprise liability,market share liability,concert of action and conspiracy,have received a mixed reception in american courts.we consider here whether respondent,formerly a manufacturer of friction brake products containing asbestos,can be held liable in tort to plaintiffs husband and wife for injuries caused by asbestos inhalation where,plaintiffs conceded,they possessed no evidence husband had been exposed to products manufactured by defendant.plaintiffs contend defendant manufacturer was liable to them in strict liability and for negligence on theories of civil conspiracy and concert of action,and that the trial court erred when it refused to instruct the jury on those issues.having concluded both instructions proffered by plaintiffs were inappropriate as a matter of law and that the trial court thus did not err in declining to give them,we will affirm.
factual background 
with his wife mary as coplaintiff,bernie chavers,who worked for several years as an automobile and truck mechanic repairing friction brakes,filed a complaint for damages for injuries allegedly caused by prolonged inhalation of particles brake work of the type chavers performed required that brake in part of asbestos because it resists the extreme heat generated by stopping a sanded with high speed machines,a process that gives off dust particles which,unless the operator wears a mask or other appropriate protection,are inhaled into the lungs.the theory underlying plaintiffs complaint was that while working around automotive brakes,chavers contracted a form of pulmonary by the inhalation of asbestos particles.the chaverses complaint joined as defendants scores of manufacturers,suppliers,and distributors of friction brake products containing named defendants and doe,in the fourteenth cause of action,that all were jointly and severally liable for plaintiffs injuries under two theories of group liability.prior to trial,plaintiffs reached settlement agreements with all but two of the gatke corporation gatke,a dissolved,bankrupt company that had in the past manufactured automotive brakes and clutches,and.
a jury trial of the chaverses tort claims against these two remaining defendants began in january.before trial commenced,plaintiffs conceded they possessed no evidence establishing that bernie chavers had used or worked around brake shoes manufactured by gatke,that is,plaintiffs admitted they were unable to prove that brake shoes had caused chavers injuries.in a liability wrinkle that has produced this appeal,however,the chaverses attorneys contended gatke could be held liable in tort without proof that its friction products played any role in the causal chain that led to chavers illness.specifically,during the course of the trial,plaintiffs presented testimony from an expert witness,david egilman,that beginning around a number of manufacturers whose products contained asbestos had contributed financing to the saranac laboratory,a private research facility at saranac lake,new york,for the purpose of investigating the health effects of asbestos on those who used or worked around it.according to plaintiffs theory of gatke tort liability,purportedly supported by egilman trial testimony,a decade passed before the director of the saranac laboratory reported to those financing the investigation that findings made by the researchers pointed to asbestos as having seriously harmful effects on the health of those exposed to it,including cancer.
at the behest of some of the members of the consortium funding the saranac laboratory research,plaintiffs contended through egilman testimony,all references to cancer were deleted from the report before it was released for publication.only years later did the public learn what those who financed the saranac laboratory research had long can cause serious,even fatal,harm to those exposed to it.to complete the description of plaintiffs theory of group tort liability,they asserted the suppression of the adverse saranac laboratory findings by those manufacturers responsible for funding the research amounted to a tortious failure to warn potential users of products of their adverse health effects.as a result,thousands of americans continued to use and work around asbestos for decades to come,unaware of what gatke and other manufacturers who had supported the saranac laboratory research already exposure to asbestos can cause cancer.
at the instructions conference before the trial judge,plaintiffs counsel requested the court include in its charge to the jury special instructions embodying two of the theories of group tort conspiracy and concert of action.following considerable discussion between the trial judge and counsel for the parties,the court refused to include plaintiffs special instructions in its charge to the jury.after retiring and deliberating,the jury returned with a verdict in favor of defendant.specifically,the jury answered no to the following questions on the special verdict form 
was there in existence at any time a conspiracy involving defendant gatke corporation committing concealment or intentional misrepresentation as defined in these instructions and were gatke corporation and,in the same conspiracy 
this timely appeal by plaintiffs from a final judgment in favor of gatke followed.
the trial court did not err in declining to give the jury a civil conspiracy instruction on plaintiffs negligence and strict liability tort claims.
as noted,plaintiffs asked the trial court to read to the jury instructions offered by them permitting a finding of tort liability for negligence or strict liability based on a theory of civil conspiracy.following discussion with counsel,judge mcbride refused to give the instruction proffered by plaintiffs,giving instead a conspiracy instruction involving concealment and intentional misrepresentation.plaintiffs contend the trial court instructional omission constituted reversible error.
resolution of this issue,we decide,is straightforward.the following statement appears in our high court applied equipment opinion applied equipment litton saudi arabia cal th,d,applied equipment conspiracy is not an independent tort it can not create a duty or abrogate an immunity.it allows tort recovery only against a party who already owes the duty and is not immune from liability based on applicable substantive tort law principles.citations.the unstated premise for this conclusion,or perhaps a consequence of it,is that an allegation of conspiracy itself does not lay a predicate for substantive civil liability.the supreme court applied equipment opinion plainly holds that before one can be held liable for civil conspiracy,he must be capable of being individually liable for the underlying wrong as a matter of substantive tort law.and that requirement,of course,means he must have owed a legal duty of care to the plaintiff,one that was breached to the latter injury.
in seeking to fix the operative implications of the applied equipment holding,it is helpful to go back in time to see what provoked it.that was justice sullivan opinion for the court of appeal in wise southern pacific d.wise.in that case,the court held that one party to a contract could,through use of a civil conspiracy theory,be held liable in tort for interference with contract as a result of the acts of another,a coconspirator and a stranger to the contract.the wise court termed such a liability outcome consistent with the principle that all who are involved in a common scheme are jointly and severally responsible for the ensuing wrong and also consonant with good morals.id.at.
as a matter of unqualified logic,it is not difficult to see how the wise court reached its conclusion.it is the essence of common law conspiracy doctrine that the coconspirators are liable in the same way and to the same extent as the principal who actually commits the harmful or outlawed act.the agreement of all and the overt act of one is sufficient to impose the same liability on all for the act of the one.see,mox incorporated woods cal,the major significance of the conspiracy lies in the fact that it renders each participant in the wrongful act responsible as a joint tortfeasor for all damages ensuing from the wrong,irrespective of whether or not he was a direct actor and regardless of the degree of his activity.
the erosion of the analysis and result in wise,supra,d.had been followed in a number of published court of appeal decisions see applied equipment,supra,cal th at,d,began with the supreme court opinion in gruenberg aetna ins.cal d,gruenberg a decade later.there,it was alleged the three insurance adjuster,an attorney,and the plaintiff to breach the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing by tortiously fomenting false criminal charges against the in order to evade liability under a fire insurance policy.id.at.relying in part on the established agent immunity rule,the gruenberg court declined to impose tort liability on the defendants.in addition to the agent immunity rule,however,the gruenberg court invoked a second the defendants were not parties to the agreements for insurance therefore,they are not,as such,subject to an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.id.at.
the limitation on conspiracy liability announced by the court in gruenberg was endorsed and its rationale explicated somewhat by the supreme court in doctors superior court cal d,doctors.there,a claimant,proceeding under the procedure approved in royal globe ins.superior court cal d,filed suit in tort against an insurer,its attorney,and an expert witness,contending the three had conspired to violate an insurance code statute making it an unfair business practice for an insurer to refrain from effecting a prompt and fair settlement of pending claims.doctors,supra,at.the trial court overruled a demurrer to the conspiracy count the defendants sought writ relief the supreme court vacated the order overruling the demurrer.writing for a unanimous court,justice kaufman opinion made it clear that a member of a civil conspiracy is liable in tort only if he was under a legal duty originating in some source other than the conspiracy itself.a cause of action for civil conspiracy may not arise,he wrote,if the alleged conspirator,though a participant in the agreement underlying the injury,was not personally bound by the duty violated by the wrongdoing id.at,italics added.
the line of authority may have reached a zenith of sorts with the high court opinion in applied equipment,supra,cal th,d.there,the plaintiff electronics vendor subcontracted with the defendant litton saudi arabia to procure spare electronics electron tubes manufactured by defendant varian a military communications and control system litton was building for the kingdom of saudi arabia.unhappy with plaintiff price markup under the subcontract,litton unilaterally renegotiated its purchase order with plaintiff,procuring some of the tubes directly from varian associates,varian,at a reduced markup.id.at,d.applied equipment then filed suit against litton and varian pleading,among other causes of action,the formation of a civil conspiracy by the two companies to tortiously interfere with the contract between plaintiff and litton.after a lengthy trial,the jury returned a damages award for plaintiff on its breach of contract claim against litton and million in damages on the tort claim against both defendants.id.at,d.
our supreme court reversed that judgment.reviewing the accumulated case law on civil conspiracy,including its own precedents,the court said a plaintiff invocation of a conspiracy claim allows tort recovery only against a party who already owes the duty and is not immune from liability based on applicable substantive tort law principles.citations.because a party to a contract owes no tort duty to refrain from interference with its performance,he can not be bootstrapped into tort liability by the pejorative plea of conspiracy.applied equipment,supra,at,d,italics added.the opinion went on to disapprove the contrary holding reached by the court of appeal in wise,supra,d,and those cases following it.applied equipment,supra,at,fn,d.
as we read applied equipment and the antecedent case authorities on which it builds,in california a civil conspiracy to commit tortious acts can,as a matter of law,only be formed by parties who are already under a duty to the plaintiff,the breach of which will support a cause of action against and not as tort.applied equipment,supra,cal th at,d.restated,in cases where the plaintiff alleges the existence of a civil conspiracy among the defendants to commit tortious acts,the source of substantive liability arises out of a preexisting legal duty and its breach liability can not arise out of participation in the conspiracy alone.moreover,according to these authorities,it makes no difference in the analysis whether the underlying duty is imposed by statute as in doctors or by the common law as in applied equipment.a duty,however,independent of the conspiracy itself,must exist in order for substantive liability to attach.that proposition,we conclude,applies in this case and is dispositive of the point.for on this record,it is clear respondent was under no duty to chavers for the simple reason that plaintiffs could not show he was exposed to any of gatke products.
we recognize the foregoing proposition may be challenged as lacking an impeccable logic but,as was famously written,the life of the law has not been logic it has been experience.holmes,the common law.and we think it is the distillation of experience that has produced the principle of applied equipment.moreover,we are obliged to content ourselves with the law as our supreme court has fashioned it auto equity sales,superior court cal d.that law,as we parse it,includes the principle stated just above.it is for that reason the trial court did not err when it declined to give the jury the civil conspiracy instruction offered by plaintiffs.
on this record,the trial court did not err in refusing to give the jury a concert of action instruction with respect to defendant gatke.
plaintiffs also contend the trial court erred when,in charging the jury,it declined to give a concert of action instruction proffered by them.we think the trial court stood on solid ground in so acting for the reasons given by justice mosk in the case of sindell abbott laboratories cal d,sindell.famous as the decision in which a majority of the california supreme court crafted a hybrid group liability theory christened market share liability,the high court sindell opinion also rejected application of the same concert of action theory of collective liability that plaintiffs sought to fasten on gatke at trial.in a nutshell,as the sindell opinion described them,the cases in which the concert of action theory of liability has been applied involve conduct by a small number of individuals whose actions resulted in a tort against a single plaintiff,usually over a short span of time,and the defendant held liable was either a direct participant in the acts
