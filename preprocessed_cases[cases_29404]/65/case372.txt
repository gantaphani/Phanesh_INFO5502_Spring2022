we must decide,among other things,whether the manufacturer of a machine used in the dry cleaning process may be held liable for contribution to environmental cleanup costs under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act.
plaintiff appellant team enterprises,llc team has,since,leased space in a shopping center in modesto,california,where it operates a dry cleaning store.from to,team used perchlorethylene pce,a volatile organic compound defined as a hazardous substance by the state of california,in its dry cleaning operation.team dry cleaning machines used pce as part of the cleaning process,thereby generating wastewater containing the chemical.team used puritan rescue combination equipment rescue,designed and manufactured by defendant appellee street,street,to filter and to recycle the wastewater for reuse.the rescue returned distilled pce to team dry cleaning machines and deposited the resulting wastewater into an open bucket.once in the bucket,some of the remaining pce would separate from the water,allowing team to recapture pure or visible amounts of pce for reuse.the remaining wastewater contained dissolved and invisible pce.
team disposed of this wastewater by pouring it down the sewer drain.some of the pce then leaked into the soil,and the california regional water quality control board deemed the affected property in need of cleanup,which team duly performed at its own expense.
team sued street and several other defendants in the eastern district of california for contribution under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla.team also alleged various causes of action,including claims for trespass and nuisance.
the district court granted summary judgment to street on all claims and entered final judgment as to it.team timely appealed the district court grant of summary judgment as to team cercla,trespass,and nuisance claims.
congress enacted cercla in in response to the serious environmental and health risks posed by industrial pollution.burlington santa fe ry.united states.cercla was designed to promote the timely cleanup of hazardous waste sites and to ensure that the costs of such cleanup efforts were borne by those responsible for the contamination.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the statute imposes strict liability for environmental contamination upon four broad classes of covered persons a.
once identified as a covered person,an entity may be compelled to clean up a contaminated area or reimburse the government for past and future response costs.burlington.at see also a a d describing the remediation and cleanup costs for which covered persons may be held liable.cercla further provides that a person who has incurred cleanup costs may seek contribution from any other covered person.f.team argues that street is a covered person because street allegedly arranged for disposal of hazardous substances.the section giving rise to arranger liability provides,in relevant part,that liability shall be imposed on 
any person who by contract,agreement or otherwise arranged for disposal of hazardous substances owned or possessed by such person,by any other party or entity,at any facility owned or operated by another party or entity and containing such hazardous substances 
a.arranger liability ensures that owners of hazardous substances may not free themselves from liability by selling or otherwise transferring a hazardous substance to another party for the purpose of disposal.see burlington.at arranger liability would attach if an entity were to enter into a transaction for the sole purpose of discarding a used and no longer useful hazardous substance.because there are myriad schemes by which a party may arrange for disposal of a hazardous substance,courts have recognized that determining whether a transaction gives rise to arranger liability is a inquiry.see cal.dep t of toxic substances alco,cir.
team alleges that street is subject to arranger liability under two distinct theories street took intentional steps and planned a disposal of pce,and street had authority to control and exercised control over the disposal process.
in burlington northern,the supreme court recognized that cercla does not specifically define what it means to arrang e for disposal of a hazardous substance.at.nevertheless,giving the phrase its ordinary meaning,the court explained that the word arrange implies action directed to a specific purpose.id.citing merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed.therefore,an entity may qualify as an arranger when it takes intentional steps to dispose of a hazardous substance.id.while actions taken with the intent to dispose of a hazardous substance are sufficient for arranger liability,actions taken with the mere knowledge of such future disposal are not.see id.at.as the court explained,
w hile it is true that in some instances an entity knowledge that its product will be discarded may provide evidence of the entity intent to dispose of its hazardous wastes,knowledge alone is insufficient to prove that an entity planned for the disposal,particularly when the disposal occurs as a peripheral result of the legitimate sale of an unused,useful product.
id.emphasis added.
in light of the intent requirement,we have long recognized the useful product defense to cercla claims.see alco,at.the defense prevents a seller of a useful product from being subject to arranger liability,even when the product itself is a hazardous substance that requires future disposal.id.in other words,a person may be subject to arranger liability only if the material in question constitutes waste rather than a useful product.id.citation omitted.a plaintiff can overcome the defense by showing that the substance involved in the transaction has the characteristic of waste at the time it is delivered to another party.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
the useful product doctrine serves as a convenient proxy for the intent element because of the general presumption that persons selling useful products do so for legitimate business purposes.it would be odd,for example,to say that an auto parts store sells motor oil to car owners for the purpose of disposing of hazardous waste.conversely,persons selling or otherwise arranging for the transfer of hazardous waste which no longer serves any useful purpose are more likely trying to avoid incurring liability that might attach were they to dispose of the hazardous waste themselves.in other words,the probable purpose for entering into such a transaction is to dispose of hazardous waste.
we recognize that the prototypical case applying the useful product doctrine to avoid liability involves a defendant selling products that qualify as hazardous substances,such as pesticides or batteries.see,burlington.at sale of pesticides alco,sale of dross and slag.asarco,cir sale of slag catellus dev.united states,cir sale of spent batteries.conversely,none of the parties in this appeal contend that the rescue equipment is itself a hazardous substance.nevertheless,the presumption animating the doctrine that people sell useful products for legitimate business purposes,not for the purpose of disposing of waste is applicable to this case.absent a showing that street intended for its sale of the rescue to result in the disposal of pce,we must conclude that street lacks the requisite intent for arranger liability.see burlington.at i t would be error for us not to recognize the indispensable role that state of mind must play in determining whether a party has otherwise arranged for disposal of hazardous substances.quoting united states cello foil,cir.
team insists that intent can be inferred from street designing its product in such a way as to render disposal inevitable.according to team,the rescue generated wastewater containing dissolved pce,and team allegedly had no other choice than to dispose of the contaminated waste water by pouring it down the drain.but the design of the rescue does not indicate that street intended the disposal of pce.at most,the design indicates that street was indifferent to the possibility that team would pour pce down th
