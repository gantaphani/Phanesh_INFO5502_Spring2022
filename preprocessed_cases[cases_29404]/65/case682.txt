the plaintiffs,harold and stephanie goodridge sued hyster company,nacco materials handling group,modern group,and modern handling equipment to recover damages resulting from an injury sustained in a forklift accident at harold workplace defendants successfully moved in limine to bar the expert testimony of plaintiffs only identified expert witness.the trial judge ruled that the expert was not qualified to offer an opinion about forklift design and that his proffered testimony would not assist the jury in any meaningful way.we agree and affirm.
on january,harold goodridge was injured while working as an employee of the port of wilmington.the accident occurred when a operating a forklift backed around a corner and ran over goodridge leg.the forklift was not equipped with any automatic alarm or warning light.
the forklift was designed,manufactured,and marketed by defendants hyster and nacco.defendant modern purchased the forklift and leased it to the port in.the port purchased the forklift from modern on july.goodridge sued hyster,nacco and modern alleging,inter alia,that these entities negligently designed,manufactured,and supplied a forklift to the port of wilmington without a warning device.
plaintiff expert,vincent gallagher,is a certified hazard control manager,master level i.he received an degree from the center for safety at new york university and currently does consulting work for labor organizations and industry with a concentration on safety consulting.previously,osha employed gallagher as a safety inspector for all but three years from april through november.
while with osha,gallagher visited approximately eight hundred work places.five hundred of these were manufacturing operations that contained hundreds of industrial products.he evaluated more than ten thousand products over the years and investigated more than five hundred fatal accidents.in addition,several organizations have used gallagher services to identify hazards and develop documents to assist engineers considering safety in their designs.the journal of the american society of safety engineers,professional safety,has accepted one of gallagher articles for publication.
gallagher would have testified that safety organizations,such as the national institute of occupational safety and health niosh and the national safety council nsc recognize the value of alarms on forklift trucks and recommend that forklifts used in storage areas be equipped with alarms.gallagher would also have opined that hyster violated prudent safety management under the nsc standards by failing to equip the forklift with alarms,strobe lights and rearview mirrors hyster failed to perform effective hazard identification,evaluation and selection of the most reliable controls to protect pedestrians and,hyster violated criteria concerning the design of effective warnings on industrial equipment.gallagher would ultimately conclude that hyster forklift was unreasonably dangerous and defective because it lacked fundamental safety devices and that omission proximately caused goodridge injury.
gallagher conceded,however,that hyster forklift complied with all osha regulations further,gallagher acknowledged that hyster forklift did not violate the safety standards of the american society of mechanical engineers asme or the american national standards institute ansi.
the trial judge found that,the gist of gallagher opinion is that every forklift designed and manufactured without safety features is defective and unsafe,regardless of how it is used in the field.he cited two fundamental shortcomings under.evid.that rendered gallagher proffer inadmissible 
first,by his own admission,gallagher is not qualified to offer an opinion about forklift design.he is not a forklift designer,nor is he even an engineer.at best,gallagher theoretically might offer the opinion that under the circumstances in which the forklift was used by the port,the forklift should have been equipped with safety features.it does not appear,however,that gallagher actually is qualified to offer that opinion.but even that opinion leaves open the question as to whether the forklift design was negligent,which is the issue and the reason gallagher opinion is preferred.along the same lines,gallagher opinion is based simply on his culling potentially favorable snippets from various safety publications.coupling that with gallagher general background as a safety expert does not amount to an acceptable expert opinion under rule.gallagher is not qualified based on his general experience and his review of several safety publications to opine that all forklifts,including hyster product,need safety features.
the second reason why gallagher proposed testimony falls short under daubert and bell is that it will not assist the jury meaningfully.to be sure,without gallagher testimony the jury will not know about nsc and niosh publications and he could tell the jury about them.to be meaningful,however,it is not enough simply to tell the jury about those publications and then leave the jury to its own devices.without a qualified expert testimony putting the literature into context,the jury will have to speculate in order to apply the literature to this case facts 
the trial judge found gallagher article in professional safety unimpressive,explaining that the article tends to highlight how gallagher opinions would not be helpful to a jury because it amounts to a plea to safety professionals and organizations to consider new standards 
when he is not presenting horrors about mothers,infants and workers being injured for unexplained reasons in accidents,gallagher presents various safety experts recommendations that equipment,such as forklifts,should be equipped with alarm after arguing in detail why osha,nhta and ansi are wrong for not mandating safety equipment,gallagher calls on safety professionals to advocate the use of backup alarms he concludes hopefully someday,we will look back on this safety failure as we now look back on automobiles without seat belts and air bags,construction workers without hard hats,homes without smoke detectors,
the trial judge characterized gallagher proffer as an improper attempt to move the debate over the need for new forklift safety standards into a delaware jury room.the trial judge concluded that 
this case concerns a particular forklift,the way it was operated,and the way that a particular worker at the port of wilmington was injured by it.bringing in gallagher opinion,which reflects his bias rather than scientific engineering,can only distract the jury from the real issues in this case.
goodridge claims that the trial judge erred by failing to consider fully gallagher opinions and methodology before ruling that he lacked specialized knowledge that would assist the jury to understand the factual dispute about whether hyster breached its duty of care by designing,manufacturing and marketing a forklift without a warning device.they insist that gallagher expertise in the principles and practices of hazard control and product safety management suffice to qualify him as an expert and make his proffer reliable.
hyster responds that gallagher is a professional witness with no expertise in engineering or forklift design.therefore,hyster maintains,gallagher has no reliable specialized knowledge about whether hyster negligently designed,manufactured,assembled,or marketed the forklift or that the resulting defect proximately caused goodridge injury.hyster underscores that gallagher admits he is not an expert on forklift design and has,in fact,been found unqualified under daubert and kumho to testify about forklift design in two separate factually and analytically apposite federal cases 
we review a trial judge decision to admit or exclude expert testimony for an abuse of discretion.we apply this standard to a trial judge ruling on either the reliability of an expert methodology or the reliability of an expert ultimate conclusion a witness may testify as an expert when qualified as an expert and the trial judge determines that the witness has scientific,technical or other specialized knowledge that will assist the finder of fact in understand
