a plaintiff who has resided in california for years was exposed to asbestos during the installation of a boiler in oklahoma years ago.the boiler was designed and sold by a new york company to a purchaser in oklahoma.following his diagnosis with an medical condition several years ago,the california resident brought suit in california against the new york company.
the trial court determined that oklahoma statute of repose barred the suit.contrary to that determination,we conclude that choice of law principles dictate the application of california law,which does not bar the suit.
factual and procedural background 
in the late,terry mccann was employed by a construction company at an oil refinery in oklahoma.while working at the refinery,he was exposed to asbestos during the installation of a boiler designed and manufactured by foster wheeler,a new york company.terry mccann and his wife moved to california in.in april,he was diagnosed with mesothelioma allegedly caused by his exposure to asbestos while working at the refinery in oklahoma.the mccanns collectively,mccann filed a personal injury action against foster wheeler and others.
foster wheeler moved for summary judgment on the ground that oklahoma statute of repose applied and barred the lawsuit.under the oklahoma statute of repose,a tort action for an injury arising from the design of an improvement to real property is barred if brought more than years after substantial completion of the improvement foster wheeler claimed the boiler was an improvement to real property and required specific engineering and designing to fit the needs of the customer.
mccann opposition to the summary judgment motion argued that california borrowing statute,code of civil procedure section,precluded application of oklahoma statute of repose.section provides that a cause of action that arose in another state can not be maintained in california if the other state laws bar the action due to a lapse of time.however,section allows an exception to the application of the foreign state time bar for a person who has been a citizen of this state,and who has held the cause of action from the time it accrued.
mccann further argued that even if section were not controlling,a choice of law analysis requires the application of california law.mccann asserted that california governmental interests,as expressed in section,would be significantly impaired by the application of the oklahoma statute.mccann further argued that oklahoma had no interest in barring a cause of action that arose outside of its borders and that california law should therefore apply.mccann finally argued that even if oklahoma law applied,foster wheeler was not protected by oklahoma statute of repose,because it merely manufactured the defective product and did not design an improvement to real property within the coverage of the statute.
the trial court denied foster wheeler motion for summary judgment,finding triable issues of material fact.the court determined that oklahoma law applied,but found a triable issue of fact as to whether foster wheeler was a designer of an improvement to real property and was thereby protected by the statute of repose 
after summary judgment was denied,foster wheeler sought a hearing under evidence code section to determine the applicability of the oklahoma statute of repose.foster wheeler asked the court to decide the narrow factual question as to whether foster wheeler acted as the designer of an improvement to real property under the terms of the statute.mccann joined in the request for a hearing,but asked the court to preclude foster wheeler from presenting the statute of repose defense to the jury.mccann asserted that foster wheeler could not establish one of the fundamental elements of the defense and was therefore not entitled to present the defense to the jury 
after conducting a hearing and considering the evidence presented,the trial court found that foster wheeler was a designer and that the boiler was an improvement to real property.based on these findings,the court concluded oklahoma statute of repose applied as a matter of law.
judgment was entered in favor of foster wheeler,and this appeal followed.
discussion 
mccann contends the plain language of the borrowing statute,code of civil procedure section,compelled the application of california statute of limitations the governmental interest test does not apply to the borrowing statute and even if the governmental interest test did apply,the test compels application of the california resident exception to the borrowing statute.he further argues that,even if the oklahoma statute of repose was the correct choice of law,the trial court erred in applying the statute to this case.
we conclude that,while section may not mandate the application of california law,the trial court erred,under established choice of law principles,in applying the oklahoma statute of repose.this conclusion makes it unnecessary to decide whether the trial court also erred in determining that foster wheeler was the designer of an improvement to real property,and therefore is entitled to the protection of the oklahoma statute of repose.we first discuss section,and then turn to a discussion of the appropriate choice of law.
mccann asserts we need not engage in a choice of law analysis,because a plain reading of california borrowing statute,section,expressly requires the application of california time limitations when the plaintiff is a california resident at the time the cause of action accrues.section states 
when a cause of action has arisen in another state,or in a foreign country,and by the laws thereof an action thereon can not there be maintained against a person by reason of the lapse of time,an action thereon shall not be maintained against him in this state,except in favor of one who has been a citizen of this state,and who has held the cause of action from the time it accrued.
many states have adopted similar borrowing statutes,which are designed to prevent forum shopping by plaintiffs.giest sequoia ventures,th,d b y its terms section applies whenever a cause of action arises in another state and would be stale in that state,unless the holder of the cause of action is a california citizen who has held the cause from the time of accrual.mccann argues that section unequivocally calls for the application of california law because he was a resident of california at the time his cause of action accrued.
mccann argument is unpersuasive.under the plain language of section,a california court is required to apply the law of the foreign state barring an action if the plaintiff was not a california citizen when the cause of action accrued.see also biewend biewend cal d,s ince the plaintiff has not been a citizen of this state from the time the cause of action accrued,this section has the effect of applying the missouri statute of limitations.it is equally clear that the court is not required to apply the foreign statute if the plaintiff was a california citizen when the cause of action accrued.in other words,the statute,on its face,permits the court to apply california law when the plaintiff is a citizen of california,but it does not expressly require the court to do so it merely excepts california citizens from the mandatory application of foreign law.we doubt,therefore,that the statutory exception for plaintiffs who were citizens when their causes of action accrued requires the court to apply california law,in circumstances where the application of california choice of law principles would dictate otherwise.we need not definitively determine the point,however,because california choice of law principles require the application of california law rather than oklahoma law.we turn to that analysis.
b.the choice of law analysis.
a choice of law question arises when a party before a california court contends that another state law,rather than california law,should be applied to decide the case.in that situation,the court is required to employ the governmental interest approach as announced in reich purcell cal d,reich rejecting the prior rule that in tort actions the law of the place of the wrong was
