this appeal arises from the products liability and toxic trespass claims of nine individuals who allege they were exposed to a virulent substance used as a pesticide in florida.the district court granted summary judgment to the manufacturer of the substance and its related entities following the court exclusion of expert testimony under the principles of daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d.because the district court properly executed its gatekeeping function under daubert,we find no abuse of discretion in the district court exclusion of expert testimony.further,because the requisite proof of causation was lacking without the expert testimony,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
background 
in may,a mediterranean fruit fly medfly was discovered in florida.to protect the state agricultural industry from the harmful effects of a medfly infestation,the florida department of agriculture and consumer services fdacs and the united states department of agriculture usda decided to engage in aerial and ground spraying of a mixture of protein bait and malathion,a pesticide,to eradicate the medflies.consequently,fdacs and usda purchased malathion under the trade name fyfanon from its manufacturer cheminova the fyfanon was shipped from cheminova plant in denmark to the united states where it was deposited into storage facilities in texas,georgia,and florida.the fyfanon was then transported by cheminova,from these storage sites to tampa,florida where fdacs and usda officials mixed the malathion with the protein bait and promptly sprayed the mixture over the tampa metropolitan area and the surrounding counties.shortly thereafter,certain individuals reported becoming seriously ill and subsequently brought this suit on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated in the state of florida alleging,inter alia,products liability,negligence,and toxic trespass claims as a result of their exposure to the fyfanon in the medfly spray.
the theories of liability asserted by the putative class hinged on their allegations that the fyfanon ultimately sprayed over tampa was defective and caused their injuries.the specific defect they alleged was that the fyfanon contained elevated levels of isomalathion due to improper storage.isomalathion is a malathion derivative which renders malathion particularly toxic to humans.the putative class representatives maintained that,prior to its delivery to fdacs and usda,cheminova and cheminova,allowed the fyfanon to be exposed to temperatures exceeding those recommended for safe storage which precipitated a chemical decomposition of the malathion that produced increased levels of isomalathion.
to prove these claims,the putative class representatives retained jack matson as an expert to reconstruct the temperatures to which the fyfanon was exposed and to render an opinion as to the isomalathion content in the fyfanon ultimately used by fdacs and usda over tampa.although matson held a in chemical engineering and had previously worked with pesticides,he had no experience with malathion prior to being retained as an expert in this case.matson issued reports on his findings in october,may,and july,and he opined a final conclusion in his january deposition.in the october report,he concluded that the fyfanon was stored at temperatures exceeding degrees fahrenheit.he calculated these temperature figures by starting with national weather service temperature readings of the areas near the storage sites.he used the recorded high and low temperatures as the upper and lower limits of the probable temperature to which the fyfanon was exposed.then,on the basis of some evidence that the temperature inside the texas storage facility was actually eighteen degrees higher than the ambient air temperature recorded by the weather service he added eighteen degrees to the upper limits of plausibility for each site then,matson averaged the upper and lower limits to arrive at the most probable temperature to which the fyfanon was exposed.this figure was then input into an equation which calibrated the level of isomalathion as a function of time and temperature exposure.matson utilized the same methodology to derive temperature data in his may report.in his july report,matson also claimed that eighteen degrees should be added to the upper limit of plausibility,although his explanation for the increase in this report was based on his theory of temperature increases due to the radiant energy of the sun.finally,in his january deposition,matson again concluded that the fyfanon was exposed to temperatures exceeding the recommended degrees fahrenheit,although he based his conclusions on the autocatalytic effect that dimethyl sulfide produces in malathion when it is stored for a certain period of time.
following matson deposition,cheminova filed a motion to exclude expert testimony and a daubert hearing ensued.at the conclusion of the hearing,the district court excluded matson because the methodology by which he arrived at his ultimate conclusion is fundamentally flawed because it is not based on sufficiently reliable data or facts.at.the district court found that there is simply too great an analytical gap between the data relied on by matson and his proffered opinions.at.in making this conclusion,the district court criticized matson method of extrapolating temperature data from one site to another without making particularized findings which accounted for the differences in conditions and length of storage at each site.in addition,the district court faulted matson for his lack of prior experience with malathion,his failure to visit the fyfanon storage sites,his failure to consider the testimony of workers at the various storage facilities,and his continued use of certain data in later reports that had been deemed unreliable.in discussing this fourth flaw in matson methodology,the district court noted that the unreliability of his earlier data undermined his later calculations which used different methods but arrived at similar results.after making these observations,the district court added that there was no testimony that matson method was tested,subjected to peer review,or generally accepted in the scientific community.based on all of these findings,the district court granted cheminova motion to exclude matson.in addition,the district court concluded that it necessarily followed that all the toxicology experts and treating physicians should be excluded as well because the relevance of their testimony depended on matson findings.
without the testimony of matson or any other toxicology expert,the district court found that proof of causation was lacking.particularly,the district court noted that the putative class representatives could not identify the isomalathion levels in the fyfanon when it was ultimately delivered to fdacs and usda,and the level of isomalathion at which the fyfanon becomes defective,toxic to humans.because evidence of causation was lacking,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of cheminova.in making this ruling,the district court also denied the class representatives request for a continuance to remedy the lack of causation evidence which resulted from the court exclusion of matson.
the putative class representatives make four arguments on appeal.first,they argue that the district court erred by excluding matson and their other experts.second,they contend that,even without the testimony of these experts,summary judgment was improperly granted because they did submit sufficient evidence of causation.third,they argue that the district court erred by refusing to grant a continuance following the exclusion of their experts.fourth,they argue that the district court improperly construed the requirements of.c a and therefore erred by refusing to grant class certification.we will address each argument in turn.
ii.discussion 
exclusion of expert testimony 
we review a district court decision to exclude an expert testimony under an abuse of discretion standard.see kumho tire carmichael,d.this standard of review requires that we defer to the district court ruling unless it is manifestly erroneous.quiet tech,uk,cir quoting general joiner,d.because the task of evaluating the reliability of expert testimony is uniquely entrusted to the district court under daubert,see mccorvey baxter healthcare,cir,we give the district court considerable leeway in the execution of its duty.kumho tire,at.at.
the admission of expert evidence is governed by federal rule of evidence as explained by daubert and its progeny.under rule and daubert,district courts must act as gatekeepers which admit expert testimony only if it is both reliable and relevant.see daubert,at.at.district courts are charged with this gatekeeping function to ensure that speculative,unreliable expert testimony does not reach the jury under the mantle of reliability that accompanies the appellation expert testimony.mccorvey,at.to fulfil their obligation under daubert,district courts must engage in a rigorous inquiry to determine whether the expert is qualified to testify competently regarding the matters he intends to address the methodology by which the expert reaches his conclusions is sufficiently reliable as determined by the sort of inquiry mandated in daubert and the testimony assists the trier of fact,through the application of scientific,technical,or specialized expertise,to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.city of tuscaloosa harcros,cir footnote omitted.the party offering the expert has the burden of satisfying each of these three elements by a preponderance of the evidence.see allison mcghan med,cir.
in ascertaining reliability under the second daubert prong,we have identified several factors which can be considered whether the expert methodology can be tested whether the expert scientific technique has been subjected to peer review and publication whether the method has a known rate of error whether the technique is generally accepted by the scientific community.quiet tech,at.this list of factors,however,do es not exhaust the universe of considerations that may bear on reliability.see also kumho tire,at.at daubert makes clear that the factors it mentions do not constitute a definitive checklist or test.citation omitted daubert,at.at noting that the rule inquiry is a flexible one.district courts have substantial discretion in deciding how to test an expert reliability united states majors,cir internal citation omitted.
the putative class representatives argue that matson exclusion was improper for two reasons.first,they argue that the district court improperly based its determination on matson general personal credibility,thereby assuming the role of the trier of fact.a thorough review of the record reveals that this objection is unfounded the district court exclusion of matson was grounded in its criticism of his method,not his credibility.for example,the district court faulted matson for his facile transposition of temperature data from one site to another.under matson method,temperature data from the texas storage site could be applied to the georgia and florida sites because storage conditions were supposedly similar and the sites were all in the same basic latitudinal range.transposition of data based on such conjecture and rough approximation lacks the intellectual rigor required by daubert.kumho tire,at.at.additionally,the district court critiqued matson conclusion that eighteen degrees should be added to the upper limit of the plausible temperature to which the fyfanon was exposed.whether it was based on evidence that some of the barrels at the texas site were melting or evidence of radiant energy from the sun or an autocatalytic effect,the district court found,and we agree,that matson addition of eighteen degrees required the kind of scientifically unsupported leap of faith which is condemned by daubert.see rider sandoz pharms,cir.apart from these particularized criticisms,the district court found matson methods of data transposition and temperature extrapolation failed under the reliability factors we mentioned in quiet technology because the methods were not tested,subjected to peer review,or generally accepted in the scientific community.finally,the district court criticized matson method of continuing to use data in subsequent reports which was previously found to be unreliable.the record thus reflects that the district court properly rejected matson on the basis of his flawed methodology.while the putative class representatives argue that an isolated remark by the district matson final conclusions were undermined by his previously flawed an impermissible credibility determination,we find that,because the district court evaluation was properly cabined to a critique of matson method,that argument is misplaced accordingly,we reject the argument that the district court exclusion of matson was based on his general personal credibility.additionally,we reject the argument that the district court analysis somehow invaded the province of the jury by evaluating matson method based on factors not explicitly enumerated in quiet technology because a district court has substantial discretion in how it chooses to evaluate an expert reliability,see majors,at,and the factors listed in quiet technology are not the only factors that may be considered,see quiet tech,at.
the putative class representatives second the district court improperly took issue with matson data,and not his equally without merit.while they suggest that the only methodology at issue was matson use of an equation to determine isomalathion levels,this argument belies the fact that matson employed two methodologies first,he employed certain methods of extrapolation and transposition to arrive at temperature data and second,he inserted the temperature data into an equation to arrive at the level of isomalathion in the fyfanon.as we have explained,the district court exclusion of matson was based on its rejection of his methodology to derive temperature data,not the data itself.thus,the district court exclusion of matson can be distinguished from a situation in which an exclusion is based on a district court refusal to credit hard data arrived at by unassailable methods.see id.at rejecting the argument that an expert should be excluded because the specific numbers that he used were wrong.here,the data matson produced was driven by the methodology he used,and thus the district court inquiry into how he arrived at the data is not inappropriate considering that the district court is charged with evaluating an expert methodology.see.requiring expert testimony to be the product of reliable principles and methods see also id.requiring that an expert testimony is based on sufficient data.joiner,at.at noting that a district court consideration of data is proper in the context of evaluating methodology when an analytical gap exists between the data and the opinion proffered.
based on the foregoing,we find the district court did not abuse its discretion by excluding matson.because the district court evaluation of matson methodology stayed within the limits prescribed by daubert and its progeny,its exclusion of matson was not manifestly erroneous.quiet tech,at.additionally,we find that the district court properly excluded the toxicology experts and the physicians who treated the putative class representatives.the district court found that the excluded experts relied on matson findings,which we have found to be unreliable.moreover,without matson foundational testimony that the fyfanon used in the medfly spray was defective because it contained elevated levels of isomalathion,the testimony of the the usual symptoms of isomalathion the testimony of the treating the congruence between these symptoms and the ailments allegedly suffered by the class irrelevant.accordingly,the district court exclusion of the toxicology experts and the treating physicians was not an abuse of discretion.see daubert,at.at requiring expert testimony to be relevant to be admissible allison,at affirming exclusion of expert witness on relevance grounds because two other experts which were crucial to the expert relevance were excluded.
