in the context of two lawsuits against tobacco companies by smokers leslie grisham and maria cannata,the ninth circuit court of appeals asks us to resolve two questions for the purpose of the statute of limitations period applicable under california law to a personal injury action alleging injury arising from smoking tobacco,are persons presumed to have been aware by that smoking causes addiction and other health problems if california law recognizes such a presumption,under what circumstances is it rebuttable under california law,if a plaintiff seeks damages resulting from an addiction to tobacco,does an action for personal injury accrue when the plaintiff recognizes that he or she is addicted to tobacco,if the plaintiff has not yet been diagnosed with an injury stemming from tobacco use grisham,supra,at.
the answers to these questions are better understood in the factual context in which these two cases arise.as will be explained below,grisham essentially alleges two types of claims one for physical injury in the form of respiratory and other ailments caused by smoking,and another for economic injury that resulted from becoming addicted as a minor to cigarettes,and continually being compelled by the addiction to purchase them.as to this second type of claim,we conclude that although there is no reason to judicially create a special presumption of awareness that smoking cigarettes is addictive,a plaintiff who alleges that accrual of this cause of action is delayed because of delayed discovery of her addiction must plead facts explaining the delay.as we shall see,grisham complaint admits actual or at least constructive knowledge that she was addicted to cigarettes long before filing the complaint.
we also conclude that,assuming grisham economic injury claim or claims are time barred,that bar does not extend to her causes of action based on physical injury from smoking that manifested itself after the economic injury claim was or should have been discovered.we reject the proposition advanced by defendants,based on soliman philip morris,cir soliman,that the statute of limitations should have commenced on the physical injury claims as soon as grisham discovered or should have discovered she was addicted to cigarettes.
as also explained below,we conclude that cannata has not alleged that her reliance on defendants misrepresentations continued into the limitations period,although we express no opinion on the continuing viability of her conspiracy claim based on continuing wrong.
factual background 
the cases are in federal court via diversity jurisdiction,and arise from physical and monetary injuries suffered by plaintiffs maria cannata and leslie grisham as the alleged result of smoking cigarettes manufactured and marketed by defendants,philip morris,and brown williamson tobacco corporation.hereafter sometimes philip morris.both cases come to the ninth circuit on a motion to dismiss and,like the ninth circuit,we will assume the truth of the facts asserted in the complaints.grisham,supra,at,fn.
grisham complaint 
grisham began smoking in as a young teenager.at the time she began smoking,she was unaware of the increased risk of developing emphysema from smoking,or the increased risk of developing,as she did,persistent and chronic periodontitis and gingivitis.she was induced to start smoking by the advertising and representations of cigarette manufacturers,including defendants.grisham,supra,at,fn.
grisham attempted to quit smoking unsuccessfully on a number of occasions.one such occasion was during a period in and.as she states in her complaint plaintiff,while still smoking,joined nicotine anonymous,to help her overcome her nicotine addition.one suggestion plaintiff received was to give up her regular brand of cigarettes and switch to a less desirable brand of cigarettes that were not as satisfying,but were low in tars and nicotine.for several months,on the basis of that suggestion,plaintiff stopped smoking merit and began smoking carlton,which were advertised as lower in tars and nicotine.plaintiff smoked carlton cigarettes for approximately four to six months.plaintiff then attempted,unsuccessfully,to quit smoking by obtaining a prescription for nicorette gum.the nicorette gum did not control the nicotine addiction and plaintiff began smoking again in.
grisham was diagnosed with the beginning stages of irreversible emphysema on or about march.shortly thereafter,in april,she was diagnosed with persistent and chronic periodontitis and gingivitis,leading to loss of teeth and facial disfigurement.she alleges that had she been aware of the true facts regarding the magnitude of the health risks and extent to which cigarettes were addictive,and that nicotine levels were manipulated by defendants and other cigarette manufacturers to foster the addiction,she would not have started smoking.
grisham filed suit on march,within a year of her diagnosis for emphysema and persistent and chronic periodontitis and gingivitis.she alleged negligence,strict liability,false representation,concealment,unfair competition and business practices,negligent false and misleading advertising,intentional false and misleading advertising,civil conspiracy and breach of express warranty.
throughout her complaint,grisham alleges that her addiction to cigarettes was a key link in the causal chain that led to her physical injuries.for example,in her civil conspiracy cause of action,she alleges that she has now developed the irreversible beginning stages of emphysema,she has suffered from painful chronic and persistent periodontitis and gingivitis,as well as suffered alveolar bone loss which has led to the disfiguring loss of teeth,all of which was caused by plaintiff addiction to smoking.
in at least one of grisham causes of action,however,she alleges that addiction caused not physical but economic injury.in her cause of action for unfair business practices she states as a result of the point of sale targeting of youth and minor smokers,at least of adult smokers,including plaintiff,began purchasing the cigarettes to which they became addicted while under the age of,i n reliance upon the representations and inducements of the point of sale targeting of minor smokers by the cigarette manufacturers,including defendants 
as a result of the continuing course of conduct of the defendants,and each of them,as outlined above,defendants have been unjustly enriched from the sales of addictive cigarettes,first to minors and youths,including plaintiff,to addict and ensure to the said defendants,and each of them,an ongoing flow of profits throughout the years,as the addicted smokers continued to purchase cigarettes.the true amount of unjust enrichment gained from the ongoing and continuing purchase of cigarettes by addicted smokers who began smoking as minors is as yet unknown to plaintiff,who requests leave to amend this complaint to conform to proof at the time of trial.
b.the cannata complaint 
marie cannata began smoking as a minor sometime before.cannata believed,and was induced to start smoking by,the representations of the defendants that smoking did not cause emphysema,lung problems,pulmonary disease,or any other problems.she states that b ecause plaintiff began smoking before there was substantial public information concerning the negative effects of smoking,she justifiably relied on the misrepresentations put forth by the defendants.the complaint further states that cannata just came to the realization that advertisements and cigarette company statements relating to safety of smoking were false.
cannata further states that had she known the true facts concerning the magnitude of the health risks of smoking,the addictive nature of nicotine,the intentional manipulation of nicotine levels in cigarettes,or the targeting of her and other youths like her to replace in the market those older cigarette smokers who were dying from smoking,she would never have started smoking.by the time plaintiff was aware that there were indeed deadly health risks associated with smoking,she was addicted,which addiction was maintained by the purposeful actions of cigarette defendants 
as a result of defendants conduct,plaintiff is dying and has suffered,and continues to suffer permanent injuries to the person,body and health,including but not limited to emphysema,shortness of breath,anatomical changes to her alveoli,and other lung damage.she has further suffered,continues to suffer,and will suffer in the future pain,discomfort,fears,anxiety and other mental and emotional distress directly and proximately caused by defendants conduct.the complaint does not reveal when cannata was diagnosed with the above injuries.indeed,although her complaint alleges in detail the reprehensible and duplicitous conduct on the part of the various tobacco company defendants,it tells little more about plaintiff than is set forth immediately above.
although cannata alleges a number of different causes of action,she apparently agrees that her claims are if she can not toll the statute of limitations by alleging defendants ongoing conspiracy to defraud.grisham,supra,at,fn.
proceedings in the district court 
the district court in the present case held that grisham claims were because,as explained below,under the ninth circuit decision in soliman,she was charged with constructive knowledge of the risks of smoking.further,the court pointed to grisham admission that she tried to overcome her addiction in as evidence that she was aware of her injury at that time.the court determined that grisham subsequent physical injuries stemmed from the same tortious conduct that caused her addiction,and thus her causes of action based on those injuries were also.the court also found that grisham allegations of continuing wrong could not toll the statute of limitations because the presumption of awareness established in soliman prevented a showing of justifiable reliance.the district court dismissed without prejudice grisham claims on behalf of third parties under the unfair competition law,business and professions code section et.
a different district court determined that cannata claims were under california law.as noted,cannata claimed that the applicable statutes of limitations were tolled by an alleged ongoing civil conspiracy.see wyatt union mortgage cal d,holding that the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the last overt act pursuant to the conspiracy is completed.the district court held that cannata could not show an ongoing conspiracy to defraud because she could not show the essential element of justifiable reliance.see applied equipment litton saudi arabia cal th,d,holding that there is no separate cause of action for civil conspiracy,and that to establish such an action,a plaintiff must show some other underlying tort or civil wrong see also chicago title ins.superior court d.justifiable reliance is an essential element of any cause of action for fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud.the district court considered dispositive the holding in soliman,supra,at page that california law presumes a plaintiff awareness that smoking causes addiction and other health problems.
on appeal,the ninth circuit panel recognized that at least one court of appeal decision,upholding a fraud verdict for a cigarette smoker against defendants,criticized soliman apparent holding that common knowledge of the harms of cigarette smoking would invariably defeat such a fraud action by negating the possibility of justifiable reliance.see whiteley philip morris,th,d whiteley.the court requested decisions from this court on the above issues grisham,supra,at,and we granted its request.
ii.discussion 
because each complaint requires a different analysis,we will address each complaint separately.
a.the grisham complaint 
unfair competition cause of action 
as noted,grisham cause of action for unfair business practices alleges that defendants targeted youth and minor smokers and that grisham,relying on various representations and inducements of defendants advertising,became addicted to cigarettes before the age of years.as a result,defendants have been unjustly enriched from the sales of addictive cigarettes,first to minors and youths,including plaintiff,to addict and ensure to the said defendants,and each of them,an ongoing flow of profits throughout the years,as the addicted smokers continued to purchase cigarettes.the ninth circuit first question,as rephrased by this court,is pertinent to this cause of action the question,again,is for the purpose of the statute of limitations period applicable under california law to a personal injury action alleging injury arising from smoking tobacco,are persons presumed to have been aware by that smoking causes addiction and other health problems if california law recognizes such a presumption,under what circumstances is it rebuttable 
generally speaking,a cause of action accrues at the time when the cause of action is complete with all of its elements.citation.an important exception to the general rule of accrual is the discovery rule,which postpones accrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff discovers,or has reason to discover,the cause of action.citations.a plaintiff has reason to discover a cause of action when he or she has reason at least to suspect a factual basis for its elements.citations.under the discovery rule,suspicion of one or more of the elements of a cause of action,coupled with knowledge of any remaining elements,will generally trigger the statute of limitations period.fox ethicon,cal th,d,fox.
as determined from the face of the complaint,plaintiff unfair competition cause of on the novel theory of economic injury from her addiction was caused by defendants marketing their products to young people such as she had been when she began smoking.she also alleges that defendants fraudulently concealed the danger and addictive nature of cigarettes and manipulated nicotine levels,all in order to induce a new generation of smokers to become addicted to smoking for defendants profit grisham alleges she was unaware she was addicted to cigarettes until after she contracted her serious diseases,and that this delayed discovery tolled her unfair competition cause of action if there is an unrebutted or unrebuttable presumption that by,a plaintiff was aware that cigarettes were addictive,then this fact would go at least part of the way toward establishing that her complaint was before addressing arguments for and against such a presumption,it is useful to review the nature of evidentiary presumptions.
a presumption is either conclusive or rebuttable.every rebuttable presumption is either a a presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence or b a presumption affecting the burden of proof.a presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence is a presumption established to implement no public policy other than to facilitate the determination of the particular action in which the presumption is applied.typically,such presumptions are based on an underlying logical inference.in some cases,the presumed fact is so likely to be true and so little likely to be disputed that the law requires it to be assumed in the absence of contrary evidence.recommendation proposing an evidence code cal.law revision com.on the other hand,a presumption affecting the burden of proof is a presumption established to implement some public policy other than to facilitate the determination of the particular action in which the presumption is applied.
conclusive presumptions are not evidentiary rules so much as they are rules of substantive law.citation.people mccall cal th,d.conclusive presumptions are primarily statutory in nature,although witkin cites two common law conclusive presumptions that are still operative.witkin,cal.evidence ed.burden of proof and assumptions.we have also more recently recognized certain constitutionally mandated conclusive presumptions.see id.at,citing people ortiz cal d,violation of defendant right to counsel of choice per se reversible error.
although not entirely clear,philip morris appears to be arguing both for a conclusive presumption based on statute and,failing that,a rebuttable presumption shifting the burden of producing evidence because the presumed fact is so likely to be true and so little likely to be disputed that the law requires it to be assumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary.cal.law revision com,supra.
in making the case for a statutorily based conclusive presumption,philip morris relies to a large extent on soliman.as that court stated the california legislature acknowledged some time ago that the inherent risks of smoking are commonly known to the people of the state.in,it enacted an immunity statute that shielded manufacturers and sellers of tobacco products from liability for the commonly known risks of smoking.citations.the california supreme court interpreted this statute in naegele reynolds tobacco,cal th,d,the plaintiffs in that case alleged that the tobacco industry had lied about the addictive nature of smoking,disseminate d deceptive statements about the addictive nature of cigarettes,and control led the nicotine content of their cigarettes.id.at,d,internal quotation marks omitted.the court held that the immunity statute barred these claims,reasoning that t hese allegations do not suggest that the cigarettes plaintiff smoked exposed him to dangers other than those inherent in cigarette smoking of which the public had a general understanding.id.at,d,internal quotation marks omitted.the premise of the immunity statute was that certain products are inherently unsafe,but the public wishes to have them available despite awareness of their dangers.id.at,d,
under california law,addiction is a commonly known risk of smoking and is therefore a danger of which a plaintiff is presumed to be aware.because the immunity statute was repealed in relevant part in,nicotine addiction claims are no longer categorically barred.citations.but they are still subject to limitations.for precisely the same reason a plaintiff could avoid the immunity statute by claiming ignorance of the risk of nicotine addiction,naegele,supra,cal th at,d,he ca now avoid the statute of limitations based on the same claim.soliman,supra,at,fns.omitted.
we do not believe that the legislature,which repealed the tobacco immunity statute stats,ch,intended or intends for the repealed statute to be reincarnated,as it were,as a presumption of knowledge about the hazards of smoking that serves to disqualify tobacco lawsuits as.indeed,the legislative history of the immunity repeal,recounted by the court of appeal in whiteley,demonstrates that the immunity was withdrawn in part precisely because tobacco company misrepresentations had put into question the extent to which the public had received accurate information about the dangers of smoking.the legislative history of the amendment refers to the grant of immunity in and observes,evidence has now become available showing tobacco companies may have deliberately manipulated the level of nicotine to create and sustain addiction and have systematically suppressed and concealed material information and waged an aggressive campaign of disinformation about the health consequences of tobacco use.com.on judiciary,on bill reg.sess,rules,reading analysis of bill.reg.sess.whiteley,supra,th at,d.we conclude that this repealed statute does not serve as the basis of a conclusive presumption that a particular plaintiff who was a smoker was aware or should have been aware in that cigarettes were addictive or dangerous.
as to whether we should judicially recognize a rebuttable presumption,we first note that our statute of limitations law generally has not recognized special presumptions,conclusive or otherwise,based on some presumed state of common knowledge.the cases cited by philip morris in support of its position do not employ such presumptions,but stand for a quite different proposition evidence that information of a particular hazard has received widespread publicity may under some circumstances be a basis for granting summary judgment for defendants on statute of limitations grounds and for defeating a plaintiff delayed discovery claim.see,jolly eli lilly cal d,mckelvey boeing north american,th,d.
moreover,although knowledge of smoking addiction has been widespread,grisham alleges,and other cases have found,that tobacco companies misrepresentations of the danger and addictiveness of smoking were also widespread.see whiteley,supra,th,d boeken,supra,th,d.a defendant fraud in concealing a cause of action against him will toll the statute of limitations,and that tolling will last as long as a plaintiff reliance on the misrepresentations is reasonable.see bernson industries cal th,d,brown bleiberg cal d.we can not generalize about the precise point in time when reliance on the tobacco companies misrepresentations became unreasonable.w hether reliance was reasonable is a question of fact for the jury,and may be decided as a matter of law only if the facts permit reasonable minds to come to just one conclusion.boeken,supra,th at,d,italics in original.where it is claimed that common knowledge undermines a plaintiff claimed reasonable reliance on misinformation,a should examine the extent of common knowledge in comparison to the alleged convincingness of the misrepresentation whiteley,supra,th at,d.
we therefore reject soliman to the extent that it holds that there is a special presumption under california law based on common knowledge that a plaintiff is aware that smoking is addictive or harmful.on the other hand,california law recognizes a general,rebuttable presumption,that plaintiffs have knowledge of the wrongful cause of an injury.fox,supra,cal th at,d.in order to rebut that presumption,a plaintiff whose complaint shows on its face that his claim would be barred without the benefit of the discovery rule must specifically plead facts to show the time and manner of discovery and the inability to have made earlier discovery despite reasonable diligence.citation.in assessing the sufficiency of the allegations of delayed discovery,the court places the burden on the plaintiff to show diligence conclusory allegations will not withstand demurrer.ibid.thus,if a plaintiff cause of action depends upon delayed discovery of his or her addiction to tobacco in order to be timely,he or she must plead facts showing an inability to have discovered that addiction,such as reasonable reliance on tobacco company misrepresentations.
grisham has not done so with respect to her unfair competition and related causes of action.on the contrary,as noted above,she stated in her complaint that in she joined nicotine anonymous,to help her overcome her nicotine addiction.after experimenting with cigarettes,the complaint states that she then attempted,unsuccessfully,to quit smoking by obtaining a prescription for nicorette gum.the nicorette gum did not control the nicotine addiction and plaintiff began smoking again in.plaintiff continued to smoke until april.
grisham argues before us that in fact she did not realize she was addicted to cigarettes even when she joined nicotine anonymous and failed to quit she only joined to appease her family and still believed that she could quit at will if she wanted to.assuming this to be correct,we conclude grisham at the very least had reason to suspect that she was addicted to cigarettes at this point,and therefore had reason to discover that part of her unfair competition cause of action.see fox,supra,cal th at,d.
we therefore conclude from the face of the complaint that grisham knew or should have known of her tobacco addiction and the economic injury it was causing her by at least,outside the limitations period.bus,unfair competition law claim must be brought within four years of accrual.
timeliness of grisham physical injury claims 
as noted,grisham other claims involve primarily physical rather than economic injury.although denominated under various headings such as fraud,negligence,strict liability,and breach of warranty,these claims all allege that cigarette smoking caused various serious ailments,including emphysema and persistent and chronic periodontitis and gingivitis.suit was filed within a year of the diagnosis of those ailments,and nothing on the face of the complaint appears to suggest that these claims are.in these claims,her addiction,although potentially harmful,is not alleged to have manifested appreciable physical harm until grisham contracted a serious physical ailment.
philip morris nonetheless argues that all of grisham causes of action are,inasmuch as all her causes of action began to accrue at the point she discovered that she was addicted to cigarettes.philip morris relies on soliman.in that case,the plaintiff was diagnosed in january with two respiratory ailments attributable to smoking,dyspnea and orthopnea,after having smoked cigarettes for years.he filed his complaint in march,and it was eventually removed to the federal court,which dismissed his complaint on statute of limitations grounds.soliman,supra,at.the plaintiff argued before the ninth circuit that the statute should have begun to run when he was diagnosed with respiratory ailments in january.the soliman court rejected this position the relevant date is not when soliman knew about these particular injuries,but when he should have known of any significant injury from defendants wrongful conduct.id.at.
in support,the soliman court quoted california cases.i f the statute of limitations bars an action based upon harm immediately caused by defendant wrongdoing,a separate cause of action based on a subsequent harm arising from that wrongdoing is normally barred.miller lakeside vill.condo.ass th,d a lthough a right to recover nominal damages will not trigger the running of the period of limitation,the infliction of appreciable and actual harm,however uncertain in amount,will commence the statutory period.davies krasna cal d,soliman,supra,at.the court then stated that soliman alleges that he suffered a number of significant injuries from the cigarettes he smoked.the injury he should have known about first is the one that starts the statute of limitations,fn.omitted.
the soliman court then concluded that the injury from addiction was the one the plaintiff should have known about first.although recovery of damages for addiction alone was a novel theory of recovery,the soliman court concluded it need not decide whether the theory was valid,because soliman ca claim that his addiction is an appreciable injury and,at the same time,ask us to ignore it in determining when his claim accrued.if soliman had actual or constructive knowledge of his addiction before he was diagnosed with respiratory illness,the date of actual or constructive knowledge of addiction would govern.soliman,supra,at see also spain brown williamson tobacco so d,agreeing with soliman that the statute of limitations on all claims by smokers against tobacco companies begins to run when addiction is or should have been discovered.the soliman court then concluded,for reasons discussed in part in the previous part of this opinion,that soliman did have constructive knowledge of addiction and that therefore all his claims were barred.
philip morris takes essentially the same position.it does not argue that grisham would have had a viable cause of action when she discovered,or reasonably should have discovered,her addiction to cigarettes.nor does it argue that we should recognize a cause of action against a company that causes an individual to become addicted to its products,independent of any physical injury resulting from use of the product.rather,its position,as stated in its answer brief in this court,is that w here a plaintiff alleges that addiction is a serious,severe,incapacitating condition that caused appreciable injury,actual or constructive knowledge of addiction will trigger the statute of limitations,and under the rule all claims that accrue,even if the plaintiff has not yet been diagnosed with other illnesses stemming from tobacco use.
because philip morris argument that knowledge of addiction should trigger the statute of limitations is based on grisham allegations that her addiction caused appreciable harm that predated her diagnosis with serious illnesses,our starting point in evaluating that argument must be to understand precisely what kind of appreciable harm grisham is alleging.as noted in the previous section of this opinion,the alleged injury from addiction that predated the diagnosis was economic in nature grisham was allegedly compelled by the addiction to devote a steady stream of her income to the purchase of cigarettes.we do not read grisham complaint as alleging an appreciable physical harm from addiction prior to the question then is whether,assuming grisham had discovered or should have discovered a viable unfair competition cause of action based on economic injury from addiction long before she was diagnosed with serious physical ailments,the statute of limitations began to run at that point of discovery on both her physical injury and economic injury causes of action.the argument that all her causes of action are is based on the rule against splitting a cause of action,and in order to evaluate that argument,a discussion of this rule is in order.
the longstanding rule in california is that a single tort can be the foundation for but one claim for damages.derose carswell d,fn.derose.this rule is a corollary of the primary right theory found in california law.as we have explained the primary right theory is a theory of code pleading that has long been followed in california.it provides that a cause of action is comprised of a primary right of the plaintiff,a corresponding primary duty of the defendant,and a wrongful act by the defendant constituting a breach of that duty.citation.the most salient characteristic of a primary right is that it is indivisible the violation of a single primary right gives rise to but a single cause of action.citation.a pleading that states the violation of one primary right in two causes of action contravenes the rule against splitting a cause of action.crowley katleman cal th,d,crowley.
as we further explained the primary right theory has a fairly narrow field of application.it is invoked most often when a plaintiff attempts to divide a primary right and enforce it in two suits.the theory prevents this result by either of two means if the first suit is still pending when the second is filed,the defendant in the second suit may plead that fact in abatement code civ,subd.c citation or if the first suit has terminated in a judgment on the merits adverse to the plaintiff,the defendant in the second suit may set up that judgment as a bar under the principles of res judicata citation.crowley,supra,cal th at,d.
the cases have invoked the rule against splitting causes of action in order to abate a later suit or bar it on res judicata grounds when that suit alleged a different theory of recovery for the same injury see,wulfjen dolton cal d,savage emery d,or a different remedy for the same injury see,hatch bank of america d.mccaffrey wiley d,or a somewhat greater factual elaboration of the same injury see,mccloskey carlton builders d.wick wick tool d.
the rule against splitting a cause of action is distinct from the rule,discussed above,that the infliction of appreciable and actual harm,however uncertain in amount,will commence the running of the statute of limitations.davies krasna,supra,cal d at.the rule against splitting a cause of action is neither an aspect,nor a restatement,of the statute of limitations rather,it is in part a rule of abatement and in part a rule of res judicata.hamilton asbestos,cal th,d,hamilton.these two rules may intersect,however,when a single wrongdoing gives rise to two or more different injuries,manifesting at different times,raising the question whether the two injuries are invasions of two different primary rights.some courts have held that the earlier injury,even if less serious than the later injury,sets the statute running as to both injuries,and expiration of the statute on the earlier injury bars a suit on the later one.see miller lakeside village condominium,supra,th at,d derose,supra,d,fn.other courts have found that,under various theories,suit on a later manifesting injury was not even when suit on the earlier injury would be.zambrano dorough d.see,d.
amicus curiae for grisham cites a number of cases holding that distinct injuries manifesting at different times caused by the same exposure to or ingestion of a toxic substance can give rise to more than one cause of action we confronted the same issue in hamilton,supra,cal th,d,in which the plaintiff alleged that mesothelioma is a separate and distinct injury from asbestosis,although both were caused by the same exposure to asbestos,and that therefore accrual of a cause of action for one of these injuries does not commence the running of the statute of limitations on the other.the majority never addressed the question whether the plaintiff had a separate primary right to be free of each of the two diseases instead,the court resolved the issue on statutory grounds,concluding that under the special statute of limitations for asbestos victims,code of civil procedure section,which commences with the date of disability,neither cause of action was.hamilton,supra,cal th at,d.justice brown in her concurring opinion would have resolved the issue by holding that mesothelioma and asbestosis injuries formed the basis for two separate and distinct causes of action.id.at,d,conc.opn.of brown.
we need not resolve whether and under what circumstances two different physical injuries arising out of the same wrongdoing can give rise to two separate lawsuits,or whether the two injuries in the present case can be conceived of as invading two different primary rights.here,what is alleged are two different types of injury,one serious physical injury or injuries,the other an economic injury,giving rise to two different types of action.the economic injury was a more or less immediate result of grisham addiction to cigarettes,whereas her physical injuries occurred after many years of smoking.the addictiveness of a product is distinct from its capacity to cause serious physical injury,as demonstrated by the fact that other addictive products are not associated with the same harmful consequences.see juliano,is caffeine a drug of dependence psychiatric times as of,caffeine documented as commonly creating significant physical and psychological dependence.
philip morris cites no authority,and we have found none,for the proposition that the rule that the statute of limitations commences with the infliction of appreciable injury bars suits based on a later manifesting injury of a different type.see,davies krasna,supra,cal d at,statute of limitations commences when plaintiff incurred earlier economic injury based on intellectual property theft,not later injury of the same type miller lakeside village condominium,supra,th at,d plaintiff can not sue on later developed physical injuries when earlier physical injuries are appreciable derose,supra,d,fn.recovery for intentional infliction of emotional distress based on emotional injury from childhood sexual assault barred when original injury could have given rise to the same cause of action.indeed,davies krasna,which first announced the appreciable harm rule,was concerned that a plaintiff not delay bringing an action until there was a more certain proof of damages davies krasna,supra,cal d at,and did not address whether an appreciable injury would bar a suit based on a injury of a different type.
we decline to extend the appreciable harm rule to the circumstances of this case,when there is an earlier manifesting economic injury and a later manifesting physical injury,because such an extension would be inconsistent with the discovery rule.in fox,supra,cal th,d,we faced a similar issue.the plaintiff in fox suffered serious complications after gastric bypass surgery.she sued the surgeon and hospital for medical malpractice.in the course of discovery,the plaintiff learned that the complications may have been due in part to a defective stapler manufactured by defendant ethicon.the plaintiff amended her complaint to add ethicon as a defendant and to add a products liability cause of action,and ethicon demurred on statute of limitations grounds.we upheld the court of appeal reversal of the trial court order sustaining the demurrer,holding that discovery and accrual of the medical malpractice cause of action did not necessarily mean discovery that the products liability action had accrued.
in so ruling,we rejected the holding in squibb superior court th,d,that w hen a plaintiff has cause to sue based on knowledge or suspicion of negligence the statute starts to run as to all potential defendants,regardless of whether those defendants are alleged to be wrongdoers in a different cause of action.one of the reasons for our rejection was that i t would be contrary to public policy to require plaintiffs to file a lawsuit at a time when the evidence available to them failed to indicate a cause of action.citations.were plaintiffs required to file all causes of action when one cause of action accrued,as they would be under the squibb rule,they would run the risk of sanctions for filing a cause of action without any factual support.citations.indeed,it would be difficult to describe a cause of action filed by a plaintiff,before that plaintiff reasonably suspects that the cause of action is a meritorious one,as anything but frivolous.at best,the plaintiff cause of action would be subject to demurrer for failure to specify supporting facts see,witkin,cal.procedure ed,pleading,requirement of pleading facts.in sum,the interest of the courts and of litigants against the filing of potentially meritless claims is a public policy concern that weighs heavily against the squibb formulation of the discovery rule.fox,supra,cal th at,d.
in the present case the rule proposed by philip morris,like the squibb rule we rejected in fox,would compel cigarette smokers either to file groundless tort causes of action based on physical injury against tobacco companies as soon as they discovered they were addicted to cigarettes and had an unfair competition cause of action again,assuming such a cause of action exists,or risk losing their right to sue in tort for such physical injury.this rule would violate the essence of the discovery rule that a plaintiff need not file a cause of action before he or she has reason at least to suspect a factual basis for its elements.citation.fox,supra,cal th at,d.it would directly contravene the interest of the courts and of litigants against the filing of potentially meritless claims,at,d.indeed,philip morris nowhere argues that tobacco addiction inevitably or even probably leads to serious physical ailments.see,risk and life expectancy,lung cancer and smoking statistics,cancer research uk,as of,the cumulative risk of dying of lung cancer by age for a male lifelong smoker is percent.
philip morris contends that fox is distinguishable because it involved misconduct by two different defendants.but this distinction was not a basis for our ruling.fox,supra,cal th at,d,failure to discover the identity of the second defendant does not toll statute of limitations.fox basic the discovery of one cause of action does not necessarily mean plaintiff should have discovered the factual basis for a qualitatively different type of fully applicable in the present case.if anything,its application has greater force here,where,unlike in fox,the injury that was the crucial element of the later suit had not yet manifested at the time the earlier cause of action accrued.
we therefore conclude that grisham discovery of her alleged unfair competition cause of action and related causes of action for economic injury based on smoking addiction did not start the statute of limitations running on her tort causes of action based on appreciable physical injury.rather,these latter causes of action did not begin to accrue until the physical ailments themselves were,or reasonably should have been,discovered.we leave for another day the question of whether and under what circumstances two physical injuries with different manifestation periods arising out of the same wrongdoing can be the legitimate basis for two different lawsuits.
b.the cannata complaint 
as discussed in the statement of facts pt,ante,cannata states that b ecause plaintiff began smoking in before there was substantial public information concerning the negative effects of smoking,she justifiably relied on the misrepresentations put forth by the defendants and that she just came to the realization
