while performing his job for armstrong world industries at armstrong vinyl flooring manufacturing plant in stillwater,oklahoma,jason durham was severely burned after becoming entangled in linoleum webbing being drawn onto a hot oil drum.although durham accident occurred in,the plant equipment had been installed in.the district court granted summary judgment on durham products liability claims in favor of defendant herbert olbrich gmbh,the manufacturer of the base coating production line that included the hot oil drum.the court held,as a matter of law,that the base coating line is an improvement to real property,thus qualifying olbrich for protection under oklahoma statute of repose that limits liability for persons or entities involved in the design or construction of improvements to real property.aplt.br.ex.b at,see.stat.because we conclude that the district court erred in holding that olbrich is entitled to protection from liability under section,we reverse 
standard of review 
we review the district court order granting summary judgment under the same standard employed by the district court under rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure.summary judgment is proper only if there is no genuine issue of material fact for determination,and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law we review the entire record on summary judgment de novo in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.
riley brown root,cir citations omitted.since the precise issue in this case has never been squarely resolved in oklahoma,our task is to predict how the oklahoma supreme court would answer the question.see marshall el paso natural gas,cir.in doing so,we review the district court interpretation and application of section de novo.see id.
ii.relevant facts 
in armstrong purchased a manufacturing plant that had been used for producing rubber products.the production machinery installed by the previous owner was removed because it did not suit armstrong purposes.in addition,because the floor slabs inside the plant had heaved and become uneven,armstrong tore out the slabs,hired an architect,and designed and installed a new foundation to meet its needs for the vinyl flooring production line it had from defendant olbrich.this design and construction is not at issue in this case.
olbrich designed its production line to fit inside armstrong existing building.the base coating component of the line that contains the hot oil drum is over twenty feet wide,twenty feet high,and feet long when installed.each major component of the line was assembled and tested in germany at olbrich manufacturing plant,and then disassembled and transported to oklahoma.in armstrong hired a contractor to install the line inside its plant.the assembly contractor worked with,and under the supervision of,olbrich employees.
although the machinery in the base coating line is bolted to the floor slabs so that all components maintain precise alignment,none of the machinery is attached to the walls or roof of the building itself,and each piece of equipment is designed to be totally.iii at.the line can be dismantled and removed from the armstrong facility and moved to any other suitable site or building,leaving the building intact and usable for any purpose deemed appropriate once the base coating line i s removed.id.at.the base coating line machinery in armstrong plant,although unique in the width of flooring it produces,is similar to other machinery olbrich designs,manufactures,and assembles in its business of manufacturing base coating equipment.
it is undisputed that armstrong treats the base coating line machinery as its personal property under oklahoma law.as such,the state of oklahoma taxes the machinery as personalty,and not as realty,under its ad valorem taxing scheme.
in,durham was cleaning the hot oil drum as part of its continual maintenance requirements when his arm became caught in the linoleum web being pulled around the drum for curing.he was pressed against the surface of the drum for fifteen minutes because he could not reach the emergency switch and the machinery had no mechanism for automatic and release.durham expert opined that the accident could have been prevented with inexpensive design modifications available since the early,and that the machine was defective at the time it left the manufacturer.id.at.but because the machinery had been installed in armstrong plant for more than ten years before the accident,the district court granted summary judgment to olbrich under section.
iii.discussion 
the central question on appeal is whether,after ten years from the date manufacturing machinery is installed in a building,the machinery manufacturer may totally escape liability for that product alleged defects solely because it designed and assisted in reassembling and installing the equipment.we determine whether olbrich falls under section protection by examining section language and purpose as interpreted by applicable oklahoma case precedent 
statutory language 
section provides 
no action in tort to recover damages 
i for any deficiency in the design,planning,supervision or observation of construction or construction of an improvement to real property,
ii for injury to property,real or personal,arising out of any such deficiency,or 
iii for injury to the person or for wrongful death arising out of any such deficiency,
shall be brought against any person owning,leasing,or in possession of such an improvement or performing or furnishing the design,planning,supervision or observation of construction or construction of such an improvement more than ten years after substantial completion of such an improvement.
stat.ann.tit,emphasis added.oklahoma follows the rule of construction that t he plain meaning of statutory language is conclusive except in the rare case in which literal construction will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intention of the legislature.bishop takata.w e must assume that the body intended a common word to be interpreted in its ordinary and usual parlance.reynolds porter.thus,by its plain language,section protects only those involved in designing,planning,supervising,or conducting construction of an improvement to real property.
olbrich contended,and the district court agreed,that oklahoma law does not clearly define what constitutes an improvement to real property under section.see.i,at.olbrich asserts that the machinery is a fixture that is an improvement to real property in oklahoma.the court quoted a broad definition of improvement to real property that includes any addition to real property,whether permanent or not,that increases a property value or utility or enhances its appearance.see id.quoting black law dictionary at ed.under this reading of the definition,therefore,any product that increases a piece of real property utility is an improvement to real property,and the designer or manufacturer of that product would theoretically be protected from liability under section.
but the oklahoma supreme court has given specific guidance on what constitutes an improvement to real property under section,and has rejected applying such a broad reading of the statute.
oklahoma precedent 
the seminal oklahoma case guiding our analysis is smith westinghouse electric.in smith,the oklahoma supreme court considered whether an electrical transformer constituted an improvement to real property within the meaning of section.the public service company of oklahoma had purchased the electrical transformer from the,and then housed it in a vault beneath a building in tulsa,oklahoma.when the transformer exploded a short time later,several plaintiffs brought an action against the manufacturers of the transformer and its component parts.the defendants argued that they were shielded by section because the transformer,which was more than ten years old at the time of the explosion,constituted an improvement to real property,and the trial court agreed.id.at.
the oklahoma supreme court reversed,however.in finding that section did not shield the defendants from suit,the court held that the preliminary test for determining whether machinery or equipment is an improvement to real property for purposes of section protection is derived from oklahoma ad valorem taxing scheme.id.at.because the transformer at issue had always been taxed as personalty,and not as real property,it retain ed at all times its character as the personalty of the public utility supplying the electrical power and thus was not an improvement to real property.id.at.in addition,it was significant to the court analysis that the electrical transformer had neither been purchased nor owned by the proprietor of the building where the injury occurred.id.at.
the district court in this case interpreted smith to focus its tax analysis only on the ownership aspect of the transformer,and not on whether the transformer was taxed as personalty or realty,citing harbor.see.vol.i at.but we feel compelled to give meaning to smith statement that the transformer was not an improvement to real property,at least in part,because it retained its character as personalty,having always been taxed as personalty see smith,at.thus,as we understand smith,the question of whether a particular item is an improvement to real property depends on its ad valorem tax treatment and its ownership.see riley brown root,cir applying oklahoma law,remanding case for record development regarding tax treatment and ownership branch mobil oil,in oklahoma,the question of whether structures are improvements to real property turns on who owns the structures and ad valorem tax treatment.citing smith,at.
our analysis of smith is not at an end,however.in reaching the conclusion that the electrical transformer was not an improvement to real property,smith discussed the case of mullis southern.there,the georgia supreme court applied a test for assessing what constitutes an improvement to real property namely,the permanence of the improvement,the degree to which the improvement enhances the value of the realty,and the intention of the parties to make the improvement one to the realty id.although smith did not adopt these factors or apply them to the facts before it,nor did it foreclose their use.in fact,smith gives tacit approval to these factors in factual circumstances similar to the case at bar while this may be a correct conceptual approach when the injury for which recovery is sought occurs on the public utility property,it is not persuasive where,as here,the harm is dealt by an instrumentality located on property serviced by the public utility.id.at see also.at applying mullis test.
thus,in predicting how the oklahoma supreme court would answer the question before us,we conclude that it would look to the machinery ad valorem tax status,whether the machinery was taxed as the personal property of somebody other than the owner of the real property where the accident occurred,and the factors identified in mullis this articulation,in our view,recognizes the weight given by oklahoma courts to a particular item tax and ownership status,while at the same time acknowledging that other factors such as permanence,enhanced value to the realty,and the intent of the parties can aid the court in making its decision with respect to the applicability of section.
c.the purpose of section 
in applying the factors articulated by oklahoma case law,we must be careful not to divorce the analysis from the statute purpose.as noted above,the plain language of section protects those involved in designing,planning,supervising,or conducting the construction of an improvement to real property.by its terms,then,this section does not to apply to manufacturers such as olbrich.however,as discussed below,oklahoma courts have extended section protection to manufacturers in limited circumstances.
in a case decided in the oklahoma supreme court discussed the purpose of section.it held that section is related to the legitimate government objectives of providing for a measure of security for building professionals whose liability could otherwise extend indefinitely and of avoiding the difficulties in proof which arise from the passage of time.paul fire marine ins.getty oil,emphasis added.the court noted that architects,contractors,and owners and lessees of improvements to real property are included in section protection from liability,but did not pass on whether manufacturers fall within its parameters.see id.at.the court concluded that the period struck a reasonable balance between the public right to a remedy and the need to place an outer limit on the tort liability of those involved in construction.id.at emphasis added quotation omitted.
in a case ten years later,the oklahoma supreme court again discussed the purpose of section section evinces in clear language legislative intent that persons who own,lease or possess property which has been structurally enhanced not be liable for design and construction defects in the built improvement more than ten years after substantial completion of the same.gorton mashburn,emphasis added.and the oklahoma supreme court has stated in dicta that,under section,the oklahoma legislature has given individuals a wrong against the builder for injuries sustained only in the first ten years of a building construction.rollings thermodyne,emphasis added.
in,the oklahoma supreme court decided the question of whether section protection can extend to those,like olbrich,involved in manufacturing equipment.specifically,a federal district court certified the following question whether section protection against liability applied to a manufacturer who designed a product,which,upon installation,became an improvement to real property.ball harnischfeger.the court assumed,however,for purposes of answering the certified question,that the item in question a large crane and trolley system that had been permanently installed as part of the construction of a port terminal was an improvement to real property.id.at.
in seeking to balance oklahoma law of products liability with its statute of repose protecting those who perform construction activities on improvements to real property,the court held that mere manufacturer s are not protected by our section.id.at.however,the title manufacturer does not,by itself,automatically preclude protection.instead,the court followed a majority of jurisdictions in holding that courts must look to the activity performed by the manufacturer.id.if the manufacturer was acting as a designer,planner,construction supervisor or observer,or constructor,the statute of repose will apply.it is the specialized expertise and rendition of particularized design which separates those protected from mere manufacturers and suppliers.id.furthermore,because products liability law will apply to manufacturers in most circumstances,situations in which manufacturers qualify for protection under section will only occur in a narrow line of cases.id.
in reaching its holding,the court contrasted manufactured goods that are and,which are not covered by section,with goods that are unique in design and manufactured to fit the unique specifications of a location.id.at.in addition to an item uniqueness,the court cited cases finding manufacturer protection in situations in which a crane was designed to fit a particular need in the construction of a building,id.at emphasis added,and a conveyor belt was an integral part of the building and was integrated into the construction of the new power plant.id.emphasis added.the court contrasted these cases with one in which the manufacturer was not protected by a statute of though the electrical dimmer panel in that case was an integral part of the permanent electrical system of a building because the panel manufacturer was not involved in the actual construction of the building.id.the ball court noted that p roduct design was not enough to trigger the statute the manufacturer must be involved in the designing or construction of the improvement to real estate,or of an integral component part of the improvement.id.
in sum,section was not intended to cover the broad spectrum of manufacturers who normally would be subject to the limitations statutes applicable in products liability cases.see ball,at.application of section by the oklahoma state court
