plaintiff henry hickerson lost his wife and home in a fire.he sued defendants alleging a motorized wheelchair or scooter they manufactured and sold to him,a pride jet power chair powerchair,was defective and caused the fire.hickerson designated a fire causation expert witness who offered an opinion regarding the location of the point of origin of the fire and identified the powerchair as a possible cause of the fire.the expert based these conclusions on burn patterns and damage and on the facts that the remains of the powerchair were sitting at the center of the area of origin and that no other appliance in the area of origin contained batteries or was connected to an external power source at the time of the fire.defendants moved to exclude hickerson expert witness on the basis that he was not an expert in the engineering or manufacturing of motorized chairs or scooters and was therefore unqualified to identify a specific defect in the powerchair.defendants also moved for summary judgment.the district court granted in part and denied in part defendants motion to exclude the expert witness and granted defendants motion for summary judgment.we reverse and remand.
background 
the fire consumed hickerson home in the early morning hours of october.hickerson escaped from the house,but his wife did not.that same day,two investigators from the office of the state fire marshal examined the site and interviewed the firefighters and other people at the scene.david owens,one of the state investigators,found the remnants of the powerchair in an area of a living room that he identified as the area of the most intense heat and a likely point of origin for the fire.he examined the powerchair and found that a battery cable had shorted to the metal of the chair.he could not determine whether the shorted cable was a cause or a result of the fire.he also identified the remains of a space heater near the remains of the powerchair and identified shorted wires in the home electric system.again,he could not determine if the shorted wires were a cause or a result of the fire.owens ultimately concluded that an electrical engineer should examine the powerchair.he also concluded that the cause of the fire could not be determined due to the amount of damage to the scene.
hickerson insurance company hired a consulting firm to investigate the fire.the investigator from the consulting firm was william schoffstall,and hickerson designated schoffstall as an expert witness regarding fire origin and causation.schoffstall was an experienced firefighter and a certified and experienced fire scene investigator.schoffstall arrived at the site of the remains of the hickerson home on october,the day after the fire.when he arrived,family members were already sorting through the remains and were in the process of removing items from the scene the family members complied with a request to exit the fire scene until after the investigation was complete.
in a written report,schoffstall described his examination of the interior and exterior of the home.he eliminated various rooms as possible locations for the origin of the fire based on observations of the relative degrees of damage,the pattern and direction of damage,and the type of damage,fire,smoke,or heat.he noted an oval burn pattern in an area of the living room that he identified as the area of the highest heat and the likely point of origin of the fire the same area identified by state fire marshal investigator david owens.schoffstall also noted that hickerson had said the area of the oval burn pattern was the area from which he noticed high heat as he escaped from the house.hickerson commented only as to heat because he could not see through the smoke when escaping the home.
schoffstall found no signs of faulting with the home circuit breaker box,but noted that some of the breakers appeared to have been tampered with after the fire.having found no signs of faulting,he eliminated the breaker box as a possible point of origin or cause.he also examined the furnace,the washer and dryer,the unit,the dishwasher,and some of the house wiring.he found no signs of faulting and eliminated these items as possible causes.he did note fire damage to some of the house wiring,but observed no evidence that the wiring was a cause or point of origin for the fire.there is no suggestion that the damaged wiring ran through the area of the oval burn pattern.
schoffstall examined and sifted through ashes and debris at the point of origin and identified the remains of the powerchair.schoffstall found and preserved as evidence several parts of the powerchair including wires,battery parts,parts of the seat,the base of the powerchair,and an item identified possibly as the charger.he examined the wiring of the powerchair and determined that it showed signs of faulting.
in the written report,schoffstall concluded as follows 
in the professional judgment of this investigator,this fire is classified as undetermined.the fire was found to have started in the living room area near the west end of the structure.the only source of ignition in this area was the scooter and with the damage found to the wires of the unit,it could not be ruled out as the source of the fire.
in an affidavit that he prepared later,schoffstall further stated 
the only items found in the area of origin were the remnants of plaintiff scooter,including the base of the scooter,batteries and possible charger,parts of the seat,and some wiring.
that sic the remnants of plaintiff scooter,identified in statement,were the only possible sources of ignition found in the area of origin.all of the items found in the area of origin,identified in statement,were preserved for investigation and available to defendants for inspection.
at the time of the fire,the powerchair was approximately six months old.hickerson and his wife had purchased the powerchair new from defendant the scooter city llc.defendant pride mobility products corporation had manufactured the powerchair.hickerson stated in a deposition that the space heater identified by david owens was not attached to a power source at the time of the fire.it is undisputed that the space heater contained no batteries or other independent,power source.hickerson stated in an affidavit that he had placed insulation in the crawlspace under his home,observed the floor joists,and observed that no wiring ran through the floor at the alleged area of origin.
defendants experts were francis burns,a fire investigator,and thomas bazjek,an electrical engineer.these experts were not afforded an opportunity to examine the fire scene,as defendants did not receive notice of the fire until after cleanup had occurred at the site.the preserved remains of the powerchair were available for inspection by defendants at a firm in tennessee,diversified product inspections,and,in fact,bazjek participated in a group examination of the remains.burns and bajzek also examined the photographs of the fire scene taken by schoffstall,discovery materials related to the litigation,and official reports from the state fire marshal and the local fire department.
bazjek stated that when he examined the powerchair remains,the battery cable was no longer fused to the frame of the chair,as described by the state fire marshal.however,there was evidence of electrical activity at the corresponding location of the cable.he also determined that certain pieces of debris collected by schoffstall were not part of the powerchair,but rather,were an electric plate and electric heating element consistent with the type found in portable space heaters.bazjek ultimately concluded that there was no evidence of a defect or failure in any component of the powerchair that could have caused the fire.he further stated that the damage to the powerchair was consistent with attack by an external fire,and he could not rule out two floor lamps,a table lamp,a heating pad,a television,or a vcr all purportedly in the living room,or the house wiring as possible sources of the fire.
expert francis burns concluded that nothing from the group examination of the remains of the powerchair indicated that the powerchair was a cause rather than a victim of the fire.like bajzek,he identified additional energized appliances in the living room,including the two floor lamps,the table lamp,the television and vcr,and the heating pad.in addition,he noted that hickerson was a smoker and had been smoking in the house on the night of the fire.there was no suggestion that hickerson had been smoking in the area identified as the origin of the fire,and hickerson stated in his deposition that he had not smoked in the room of origin on the night of the fire.there was also no suggestion that any appliances or devices other than the powerchair and the space heater were located in the area of the living room identified as the origin of the fire.
defendants moved to exclude schoffstall testimony and moved for summary judgment.the district court granted in part the motion to exclude.the court found that schoffstall was not qualified as an expert regarding the manufacture or failure of electric scooters,but that he was qualified as an expert regarding examination of fire scenes and identification of points of fire origin.the court ultimately stated that schoffstall could not testify that defendants powerchair was the cause of the fire,but could testify only to his report and observations he made at the scene of the fire.
the court went on to hold that,without testimony regarding the existence of a defect in the powerchair,hickerson could not establish a necessary element of his product liability claim against defendants.accordingly,the court granted summary judgment in defendants favor on all counts.hickerson appeals,alleging that under missouri law,expert testimony regarding a specific defect is not necessary if circumstantial evidence is sufficiently strong to permit the trier of fact to infer a defect and causation.under this theory,hickerson alleges that schoffstall testimony suffices to place the origin of the fire at the location of the powerchair and to eliminate other possible causes at that location with a sufficient degree of certainty to permit a jury to infer a fatal product defect.defendants argue that plaintiff expert is unqualified,his conclusions rely upon speculation,and that without a product or manufacturing expert,any inference of a defect in the present case would be unreasonable and impermissibly speculative.
ii.discussion 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the evidence and testimony in a light most favorable to the party and drawing all reasonable inferences of fact in that party favor.martin mart stores,cir.we review for abuse of discretion the district court ruling regarding the admissibility of expert testimony under daubert merrell dow,d.general joiner,d.
admissibility of expert testimony 
defendants oppose the use of schoffstall as an expert witness on two grounds.first,they argue he is not qualified as an electrical engineer or manufacturing expert and therefore not qualified to offer an opinion as to the existence of a defect in the powerchair.second,they characterize his conclusion that the powerchair was the only possible source of ignition as too speculative to satisfy the reliability requirements of daubert.regarding the first point of contention,hickerson does not offer schoffstall as an expert in the fields of electrical or mechanical design or engineering or to identify any specific,alleged defect in the powerchair.in fact,nothing in schoffstall written report or affidavit purports to describe the nature of any alleged defect or suggest an alternate design that might have been superior.hickerson offers schoffstall only as a fire cause and origin expert and relies entirely upon a res theory of an implied product defect.because hickerson is not attempting to prove a specific defect and schoffstall is not being offered as an engineering or product design expert,and does not seek to testify as to these issues,defendants argument in this regard is without merit.
regarding the second point,schoffstall has extensive experience as a firefighter and fire investigator,and he is a certified fire investigator.this experience demonstrates that he is qualified in the area of expertise for which he has been designated.in fact,defendants do not seriously contend that schoffstall is unqualified to conduct a fire scene investigation and analysis to determine a point of origin.rather,defendants contend that his conclusions regarding causation and origin are unsupported by reliable methodology.
we disagree.the methodology he used to generate his opinion is sound.he examined burn patterns,examined heat,fire,and smoke damage,considered this evidence in light of testimony regarding the fire,and identified a point of origin.he then considered as possible causes of the fire those devices that contained or were connected to a power source and that were located at the identified point of origin.he eliminated as possible sources those devices that were not in the area of origin or that were not connected to a power source and contained no internal power source.we can find nothing unreliable in this accepted and tested methodology.see,weisgram marley,cir now,as a qualified expert in fire investigation,freeman was free to he the burn and smoke patterns and other physical evidence indicated that,in his opinion,the fire started in the entryway and radiated to the sofa.
there is no suggestion that the space heater,found near the powerchair,was plugged in at the time of the fire,and hickerson stated in his affidavit that it was not plugged in.defendants experts identified other appliances in the living room that may have been connected to power sources at the time of the fire,but there is no evidence that tends to place these other powered appliances specifically in the area of origin.defendants experts also emphasized the fact that hickerson was a smoker and that he admitted smoking on the night of the fire.as already noted,however,hickerson stated that he only smoked in a different room on the night of the fire.taking the evidence in a light most favorable to the plaintiff,as we must,it does not appear that schoffstall failed to eliminate any powered device in the area of origin or any other suggested ignition source as a possible cause.based on the identification of a point of origin and the elimination of other possible causes,it is permissible for schoffstall to testify as to the point of origin and to explain that he inferred through process of elimination that the powerchair was the cause of the fire 
summary judgment 
it is under missouri law that juries may infer causation and the existence of product defects based on circumstantial evidence under a res theory such that some product liability claims may be submitted to juries without expert testimony that identifies specific product defects.fain gte sylvania,holding that,based on the elimination of other possible causes at the location of fire origin,a jury could infer that a television was the cause of a fire and could also infer that a defect existed in the television that caused the fire,because common experience tells us that some accidents do not ordinarily occur in the absence of a defect henderson haas realty,holding that a jury could infer from circumstantial evidence that wiring in a ceiling had caused a fire even though the wiring was destroyed and not available for inspection because,o f all the things which ran through the floors and walls,the only thing which was capable of starting a fire was the electrical wiring lindsay mcdonnell douglas aircraft,cir finding federal law regarding strict liability product defect claims under the death on the high seas act,et,to be congruent with missouri law and holding that a jury could infer a product defect in a mcdonnell douglas navy fighter j et based on circumstantial evidence that the jet had burst into flames during one of its maiden flights,even though the jet crashed into the ocean and experts could not examine the jet to identify a specific defect.
to prove a product liability claim by inference from circumstantial evidence without proof of a specific defect,a plaintiff must offer evidence that tends to eliminate other possible
