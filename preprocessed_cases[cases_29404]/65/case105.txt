the petitioners in this mandamus proceeding,all represented by the same counsel,are several thousand of the approximately to plaintiffs with suits currently pending before the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania the mdl court as part of the multidistrict diet drug product liability litigation.the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation jpml transferred petitioners cases to the mdl court for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings under a.petitioners contend that the generic or common discovery phase has concluded in,and thus they moved the jpml to remand their cases for discovery and trial in the federal district courts from which they were transferred the transferor courts.the jpml refused to remand because it determined that continues to promote the just and efficient conduct of proceedings in the cases,and the mdl court itself had declined to suggest the remand of petitioners cases.petitioners argue that the jpml committed a clear error of law because a remand was required under a once pretrial proceedings had concluded on issues common to all cases.petitioners ask,therefore,that we grant mandamus and direct the jpml to return their cases to the transferor courts for further proceedings 
on september,respondent wyeth then known as american home products corporation withdrew from sale on the united states market its widely prescribed appetite suppressants,or diet drugs,which were sold under the trade names of pondimin and redux.approximately six million people in the united states had taken one or both of the diet drugs,which studies have linked to,inter alia,valvular heart damage.after the diet drugs were withdrawn from the market,thousands of lawsuits were filed against wyeth in state and federal courts nationwide.
in december,the jpml created and transferred the pending federal cases to the mdl court for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.a.in early,the mdl court formed a plaintiffs management committee to coordinate discovery and other activities,and it appointed a special discovery master under federal rule of civil procedure.the mdl court also established numerous requirements for the conduct of discovery,including deposition guidelines,a requirement that plaintiffs complete a fact sheet regarding their individual claims,a list of medical providers,and the submission of medical authorizations to release patients records the mdl court created a document depository through which discovery materials are made available to transferor courts upon the remand of cases.the mdl court further established a system through which each case transferred to receives a discovery initiation date,which sets in motion a timetable for the completion of fact and expert discovery.significantly,the mdl court from its inception envisioned that the conduct of pretrial proceedings in would encompass fact and expert discovery that was both generic,of widespread application to many cases and,that pertained solely to an individual plaintiff claims.
in april,wyeth and counsel for plaintiffs in the state and federal court actions began global settlement talks.in november,after almost two years of extensive liability discovery as part of the proceedings,the parties reached a tentative nationwide class action settlement agreement settlement agreement.the proposed class of plaintiffs included all persons in the united states,including their representatives and dependents,who had ingested either or both of the diet drugs.the mdl court held a hearing on fairness,and on august,it certified the class and approved the settlement agreement with four amendments.
under the settlement terms,wyeth agreed to pay up to billion to fund benefits to class members,who agreed in return to release wyeth from all claims with one exception not relevant here arising out of their ingestion of the diet drugs.the settlement agreement was also devised to afford medically eligible class members the chance to opt out of its terms at various points in the future to pursue the alternative of filing suit against wyeth for compensatory damages.putative class members were entitled to opt out from participation in the settlement agreement by march,and thereby forego all benefits and restrictions conferred under the settlement agreement by excusing themselves from class membership.users who did not exercise this initial right became class members but were afforded subsequent opportunities,if medically eligible under criteria specified by the terms of the settlement agreement,to exercise a downstream right in re diet drugs,cir.class members who choose to opt out downstream receive no compensation under the settlement agreement but are permitted to file suit against wyeth and others with certain restrictions,the most prominent of which is a bar against seeking an award of punitive damages.in return for the limitation on available damages,wyeth agreed not to assert,inter alia,a statute of limitations defense to the actions.
the thousands of downstream petitioners presently before us filed suit against wyeth and other defendants.some petitioners filed suit individually,although many had joined in complaints.it appears that all,or almost all,of the petitioners originally filed their actions in state courts between and.wyeth removed the suits to federal court.the jpml then transferred the cases,the majority of which had been docketed in the federal district courts in texas,to.the rest of petitioners suits were transferred from federal district courts in twenty different states.
before petitioners cases arrived in,the mdl court initiated a program for suggesting the remand of actions that had completed coordinated pretrial proceedings in may,the mdl court entered pretrial order pto in which it noted that many of the cases had completed discovery on the issues amenable to resolution in.the mdl court promptly suggested approximately cases for remand.
since may,the number of plaintiffs with cases pending in has increased some in to approximately to as of january.this growth in the docket appears to have stemmed largely from the structure of the settlement agreement itself,which allows class members to opt out downstream.class members were required to exercise an intermediate right by may.prior to that time,the cases in were brought mainly by putative class members who had opted out at the initial,certification stage.after approval of the settlement agreement,tens of thousands of users exercised downstream rights and filed suit against wyeth wyeth subsequently removed a substantial number of those suits from state to federal court the jpml transferred the cases for inclusion in,which explains the increased caseload.moreover,many of the cases came to as actions.in march,as part of an effort to facilitate the administration of its docket and to resolve misjoinder issues,the mdl court ordered the severance of all suits and directed each plaintiff to file a severed and amended complaint consequently,numerous actions are now proceeding as individual suits,a fact reflected in the substantial number of pending cases.
petitioners contend that the increased caseload has rendered the mdl court unable to continue with its program of suggesting remand for cases that have completed common discovery.they argue that there is only discovery to be completed in numerous pending suits,like their own.petitioners claim that has become an inefficient vehicle for managing the cases.moreover,they argue that their suits must now be remanded to the transferor courts as a matter of law because generic liability discovery has been completed.
in may,petitioners filed a motion with both the jpml and the mdl court seeking to dissolve and asking for a remand of all pending cases to the transferor courts,including cases in which fleming associates,llp the fleming firm was not counsel on august,the mdl court rejected the motion,which it treated as a request for a suggestion of remand.the court noted that while generic liability discovery had ended,pretrial proceedings on common factual questions had yet to be completed.the mdl court observed that proceedings were ongoing in most,if not all,cases pending in,and the mdl court had recently streamlined its discovery process.furthermore,the nature of the ongoing discovery was generally similar from case to case,thereby making effective in providing consistency and reducing duplication of effort and expense.
the court added that remand,or dissolution of,would be premature because issues common to all pending cases continually arise.the court twice had enjoined downstream plaintiffs from pursuing punitive damages against wyeth in violation of the settlement agreement.if punitive damages were awarded in downstream cases,wyeth financial viability could be jeopardized,leaving many plaintiffs unable to recover compensation for their injuries.the mdl court found it critical that it continue to supervise the active cases to ensure a unified interpretation of the settlement agreement and a consistent enforcement of its terms.the court also anticipated that issues related to the eligibility of class members to opt out would arise,the resolution of which requires a uniform and consistent application of detailed medical criteria.finally,the mdl court noted that it had faced common patterns in allegations that plaintiffs had fraudulently joined defendants to defeat federal jurisdiction,raising issues that touch upon many cases.thus,the court declined to suggest either dissolution of or a remand of its pending cases.
on october,the jpml also rejected petitioners motion,noting that the plaintiffs management committee,among others,was opposed to petitioners request for a remand.the jpml found that centralization continued to serve the convenience of parties and witnesses and to promote the just and efficient conduct of the litigation.it observed that the mdl court remains in the best position to set the future course for the cases.because the mdl court had declined to suggest a remand,the jpml was unconvinced that it should compel one.
according to petitioners,they then waited eighteen months with the expectation that their cases would be suggested for remand.in november,petitioners sought another suggestion of remand,again arguing that discovery was all that remained and that retention of their cases was no longer justified.petitioners stated that w ith the exception of perhaps cardiology experts,every witness left to depose,every document left to produce and every medical record left to review are all located in plaintiffs home states,not in philadelphia,pennsylvania.app.at.unlike in their prior motion,petitioners did not request a dissolution of,and they sought a suggestion of remand in their own cases,not all pending cases.
on january,the mdl court declined to suggest a remand,concluding that petitioners request was without substance and premature.app.at.the court explained that it promptly enters a suggestion of remand when a case is ready for return to a transferor court,and that it would continue to follow that practice 
on march,petitioners filed another motion for remand with the jpml.they argued,inter alia,that the mdl court remand program was at a virtual standstill,as evidenced by its suggestion of remand in fewer than cases since app.at.
on june,the jpml denied the remand motion.it again found that a remand would be inappropriate because centralization continues to promote the just and efficient conduct of the litigation.the jpml added that the mdl court had recently overseen the institution of a new settlement process in the proceedings.app.at.absent a suggestion of remand from the mdl court,the jpml found no persuasive reason to order one,and it urged petitioners to continue to avail themselves of the efficiencies provided by inclusion in.
petitioners have turned to this court with the filing of their petition for a writ of mandamus.
the all writs act provides that t he supreme court and all courts established by act of congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.a.the supreme court has identified three conditions that a petitioner must meet before a reviewing court may issue a writ of mandamus the petitioner must establish both that there is no other adequate means to attain the relief sought and a right to the writ that is clear and indisputable and even if the first two conditions are met,the reviewing court in its discretion must conclude that the writ is appropriate under the circumstances.cheney dist.court for dist.of columbia,d citations omitted.
petitioners have satisfied the first condition to mandamus in that they have no other adequate means to attain relief from the jpml order refusing to remand their cases.mandamus is the sole means through which petitioners can seek review of the jpml order.see e no proceedings for review of the panel may be permitted except by extraordinary writ pursuant to the provisions of.this court is the proper venue for the mandamus petition.see id.petitions for an extraordinary writ to review an order to transfer or orders subsequent to transfer shall be filed only in the court of appeals having jurisdiction over the transferee district.
we have observed that because of the great weight that the jpml places upon an mdl court suggestion of remand,only those plaintiffs who actually sought suggestion of remand from the mdl court have satisfied the first prong of the mandamus inquiry.in re patenaude,cir.here,the parties do not dispute that all of the petitioners joined in the second request that the fleming firm filed in the mdl court for a suggestion of remand.the mdl court denied that request on the merits.petitioners have thus met the first condition to mandamus.we focus,then,on whether they have a clear and indisputable right to a remand of their cases.
the second condition to mandamus requires a showing that the court under review committed a clear error of law at least approaching the magnitude of an unauthorized exercise of judicial power,or a failure to use that power when there is a duty to do so.in re global,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.in addition,mandamus can apply to discretionary acts where petitioners can demonstrate a clear abuse of discretion.patenaude,at quoting mallard dist.court,d.
in arguing that the jpml committed a clear error of law by failing to order a remand,petitioners rely upon the language of a,which provides 
when civil actions involving one or more common questions of fact are pending in different districts,such actions may be transferred to any district for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.such transfers shall be made by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation authorized by this section upon its determination that transfers for such proceedings will be for the convenience of parties and witnesses and will promote the just and efficient conduct of such actions.each action so transferred shall be remanded by the panel at or before the conclusion of such pretrial proceedings to the district from which it was transferred unless it shall have been previously terminated provided,however,that the panel may separate any claim,or claim and remand any of such claims before the remainder of the action is remanded.
a emphasis added.
petitioners contend that the jpml failed to comply with a by refusing a remand at what they claim was the conclusion of coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings in.mandamus ptn.at.significantly,petitioners do not appear to dispute that the ongoing proceedings qualify as pretrial in nature,as those proceedings have primarily involved discovery in individual cases and the recent settlement process.see patenaude,at discussing the meaning of pretrial under a and holding settlement conferences are pretrial proceedings.rather,petitioners challenge is directed to whether the proceedings can be considered coordinated or consolidated in light of the fact that generic liability discovery concluded years ago.petitioners argue that the recent settlement process lacked judicial oversight,and that mdl treatment is unnecessary when remaining discovery is case specific.they contend that the mdl process only serves to delay the resolution of their cases.
although petitioners argue that our decision in patenaude supports their position,that case clearly cuts the other way.in patenaude,plaintiffs with injuries allegedly suffered from asbestos exposure had their actions transferred to a multidistrict litigation,where the cases remained for several years as part of a pretrial process that did not involve global discovery.at.the discovery in patenaude related to a pending class action,individual or groups of claims,and to litigation screening companies,the physicians they employ,and the nature of their contracts with plaintiffs firms.id.at.in addition,the mdl judge was actively engaged in the process of seeking to settle pending cases.id.at.a group of plaintiffs sought mandamus to compel a remand of their cases to the transferor courts,arguing that coordinated or consolidated under a should be interpreted to mean that pretrial proceedings are at an end when an mdl court ceases to conduct proceedings common to all.id.at.
looking to the guidance provided by the supreme court decision in lexecon,milberg weiss bershad hynes lerach,d,this court rejected the petitioners narrow reading of the statutory language,concluding instead that the phrase coordinated or consolidated is to be interpreted broadly.id.at citing lexecon,at.indeed,we observed that a proceeding that relates only to a single individual case or claim can nonetheless be coordinated,as coordination can be found even if common issues are present only in relation to cases that have already terminated.at.moreover,t o be coordinated,it is not necessary that common issues are being contemporaneously addressed or that any one issue be common to all cases,so long as issues overlap.id.at citing lexecon,at.applying these principles,we denied the mandamus petition in patenaude because,inter alia,
overlapping issues ha ve been considered the transferee court oversaw the initial attempts at global settlement and set forth procedures applicable to all regarding the mandatory exchange of information,the settlement negotiation process,and the prioritizing of cases.moreover,the transferee court continues to conduct discovery regarding the use of litigation screenings that overlaps many of the cases in.although there is no allegation that litigation screenings were conducted in any of the plaintiffs individual cases,this issue is common to many cases from many different transferor districts.
at citations omitted.we held that because individual settlement negotiations and conferences are ongoing in the plaintiffs individual cases,and because the transferee court is conducting discovery on overlapping issues that affect many asbestos cases,even if not the plaintiffs,coordinated pretrial proceedings have not concluded.id.at.
petitioners here likewise seek to equate the completion of common discovery with the end of coordinated or consolidated proceedings.as we made clear in patenaude,the test is not whether proceedings on issues common to all cases have concluded it is whether the issues overlap,either with mdl cases that have already concluded or those currently pending.moreover,the overlapping issues do not necessarily need to touch the petitioners particular cases.under this standard,we find adequate evidence that the proceedings in qualify as coordinated or consolidated.
just prior to the filing of petitioners second request for a remand with the jpml,the mdl court established a process for plaintiffs to seek an automatic stay in order to pursue settlement negotiations with wyeth.within days after commencing this mandamus proceeding,petitioners themselves committed to the process and stipulated to a stay of their cases.given its familiarity with the litigation,the mdl court was,as the jpml concluded,best positioned to aid the discussions between the plaintiffs and wyeth.while the fleming firm apparently did not settle the cases of any of the petitioners before us,wyeth has estimated that about cases were settled as a result of the process.oral arg.tr.at.
petitioners argue that no negotiations took place,a fact that they view as pertinent in distinguishing the process from patenaude.petitioners note that all settlement negotiations we re private discussions,involving discrete groups of claimants represented by separate law firms,and not overseen by the mdl court.mandamus ptn.at.in patenaude,the mdl judge was actively involved in prioritizing the cases on its docket and in directing the parties into a process for the discussion of settlement,with a focus on addressing the claims of the most seriously ill plaintiffs first.at.the court established procedures for the exchange of information and the negotiation of settlements,and if the settlement process failed,the court considered whether immediate remand to the transferor court was appropriate.id.the court active management of the settlement process resulted in numerous cases being resolved as well as the remand of a substantial number of cases to the transferor courts.id.
petitioners are correct that the mdl court here played a far less active role in the settlement process than was the case in patenaude.nevertheless,our determination in patenaude that a was satisfied did not hinge on the mdl judge having engaged in centralized management of the negotiations.rather,we held that the phase coordinated and consolidated was broad enough to include the conduct of individual,settlement negotiations,which in patenaude happened to be conducted under the close supervision of the mdl judge.
here,in addition to granting automatic stays,the mdl court authorized the special master to schedule status conferences involving wyeth,counsel for the plaintiffs,and members of the claims facilitating committee so that it could remain updated on the settlement process.because of its familiarity with the litigation,the mdl court or its special master was in a better position than any transferor court to facilitate discussions between the plaintiffs and wyeth should the need have arisen.we recognized in patenaude that a remand may be refused where the possibility exists that even individual settlement negotiations will be more efficient if facilitated by a judge who is intimately familiar with the general issues and many of the parties.at.in short,the settlement as it was facilitated by the court willingness to stay proceedings in the cases likely came about because of the existence of involved numerous plaintiffs and was highly successful in resolving a coordinated proceeding under a.
petitioners also argue that the discovery proceedings in are insufficient to satisfy a.the record reflects otherwise.the mdl court has established a comprehensive discovery schedule,which includes a procedure for the conduct of fact and expert depositions for witnesses who are expected to testify in more than cases.the special master has assigned each severed and amended complaint a discovery initiation date did and set deadlines for the completion of discovery in those cases as of september,dids were set in approximately cases with plaintiffs represented by the fleming firm.some of those cases had a did of december,or earlier,meaning they were scheduled for the completion of discovery no later than november.approximately of the cases had dids of august.
moreover,the substantive issues in discovery overlap.the fleming firm designated one medical expert,gerard polukoff,in more than of its cases.several other medical experts are designated in multiple cases.in addition,after plaintiffs argued that wyeth should be required to pay the fleming firm experts for time spent reviewing medical records prior to depositions,the special master issued a single ruling that resolved this issue and was applicable to all pending fleming cases.
wyeth also contends and petitioners do not dispute that large numbers of plaintiffs were diagnosed with valvular heart disease in mass echocardiogram screening operations organized by plaintiffs counsel law firms.the manner in which those screening operations were conducted involves common issues among all the plaintiffs screened in the same echocardiogram operation.respondent br.at.discovery on this issue is akin to the proceeding
