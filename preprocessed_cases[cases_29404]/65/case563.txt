introduction 
plaintiff alan cruz appeals from a postjudgment order of the trial court granting defendant fagor america,fagor motion to set aside default and default judgment.approximately nine months after the court entered a default against fagor for failing to defend against the action,fagor made its first appearance,moving ex parte for an order shortening time to allow it to move to set aside the entry of default and the subsequent default judgment.the trial court granted fagor ex parte motion.after a hearing on the motion to set aside the entry of the default and default judgment,the court granted fagor request for relief on the grounds that the judgment was void for lack of effective service of the summons and complaint,and extrinsic mistake warranted equitable relief.
in order to resolve the question whether service of process was effective,we must determine whether cruz met the statutory requirements for serving an corporation by mail.cruz addressed and mailed the summons and complaint,return receipt requested,to fagor president.the return receipt was signed by an individual who was not fagor president.however,cruz submitted the declaration of his counsel attesting that counsel had received confirmation from a representative of the postal service that the individual who signed the return receipt was a fagor employee who regularly received mail on fagor behalf.we conclude that cruz met all of the statutory requirements for effective service of process on a foreign corporation,and that the trial court erred in concluding that the judgment was void for lack of valid service of process.
with regard to the trial court decision to grant equitable relief on the basis of extrinsic mistake,our review turns on two findings of the trial court that fagor established a satisfactory excuse for failing to defend against the action and allowing default to be entered,and that upon learning of the default,fagor demonstrated that it acted diligently to set aside the default.we conclude that fagor failed to present a satisfactory excuse for its failure to defend against the action and to failed to show that it acted with diligence in seeking to set aside the default.the trial court thus abused its discretion in granting equitable relief.
factual and procedural backgrounda.factual background 
cruz parents purchased a pressure cooker from a vendor at the san diego county fair in the summer of.on september,cruz,who was years old at the time,suffered burns on the left side of his torso and thigh when he attempted to take the lid off of the pressure cooker.fagor is the american distributor of the pressure cooker 
on the date of the incident involving the pressure cooker,cruz parents sent an to fagor to alert the company about what had occurred.fagor forwarded cruz complaint to its insurance broker,who forwarded the complaint to fagor general liability insurer,american equity insurance company american equity.the insurer opened a file and began an investigation of cruz claim.
on june,american equity notified cruz that it was denying liability.however,american equity offered to reimburse cruz for his medical payments up to.cruz hired an attorney.in a letter dated july,cruz attorney notified american equity that he was representing cruz,and that cruz intended to recover reimbursement for all damages,sic sustained as a result of a burn incident arising from the use of fagor pressure cooker.american equity reiterated its denial of cruz claim in a letter dated august.
procedural background 
cruz filed a complaint against fagor on december,alleging causes of action for negligence and product liability.on december,cruz,through his attorney,mailed the summons and complaint to fagor by certified mail,return receipt requested.the envelope was addressed to patricio barriga,chairman of the board,fagor america,a delaware corporation,wall street,lyndhurst,nj.
the return receipt indicates that it was signed by an individual named tina hayes on december.fagor did not file an answer.on february,cruz mailed a copy of his request for entry of default to tina hayes,authorized agent for,patricio barriga,fagor america,wall,lyndhurst.the court denied cruz initial request for entry of default on the ground that cruz had not established that hayes was an authorized agent to accept service.although it is unclear from the record what,if anything,changed between cruz initial request for entry of default and a subsequent request,the court entered a default against fagor on february,after cruz submitted the new request for entry of default.
on february,a fagor employee forwarded a copy of cruz request for entry of default to fagor insurance carrier.
a default judgment in the amount of was entered against fagor on may.
fagor did not make an appearance in the matter until november,when fagor attorneys appeared ex parte seeking an order shortening time to allow fagor to file and have heard a motion to set aside the entry of default and default judgment.the record provides no indication as to why fagor failed to make an appearance in the matter between late february and late november,and fagor briefing sheds no light on this issue.
the trial court granted fagor ex parte request,and fagor filed its moving papers on november.in response to fagor motion,cruz attorney filed a declaration in which he stated that he had spoken with a united states postal service employee in lyndhurst,new jersey,who informed him that hayes was an employee of fagor,and that she regularly received mail on behalf of the corporation fagor submitted the declaration of patricio barriga in which he avers that he never received the summons and complaint.
the trial court heard fagor motion to set aside the entry of default and default judgment on january.on february,the trial court granted the motion.cruz filed a notice of appeal on february.
discussion 
the trial court granted fagor request to set aside the default and default judgment on two grounds that cruz failed to effectively serve the summons and complaint initiating this action,rendering the judgment void,and that fagor established that an extrinsic mistake had prevented it from litigating the action on the merits,such that equitable relief was warranted.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in setting aside the default and default judgment.
a.the trial court erred in setting aside the default and default judgment on the ground that the judgment was void due to ineffective service 
although a trial court has discretion to vacate the entry of a default or subsequent judgment,this discretion may be exercised only after the party seeking relief has shown that there is a proper ground for relief,and that the party has raised that ground in a procedurally proper manner,within any applicable time limits.see generally weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group et,et,describing various grounds,procedures and time limits applicable to seeking relief from default.the proper procedure and time limits vary,depending on the asserted ground for relief.
fagor sought relief from the trial court pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision d which provides in relevant part the court may,on motion of either party after notice to the other party,set aside any void judgment or order.fagor contends that cruz failed to effectuate proper service of the summons and complaint in this case,and that any default or judgment entered subsequent to the faulty service was thus void.the trial court agreed with fagor that cruz failed to effectuate proper service of process of the summons and complaint on fagor,an corporation.cruz contends on appeal that the trial court erred in its determination of the issue of the validity of service of process on fagor.we agree.
standard of review 
initially,we address fagor contention that the trial court decision to set aside a default judgment should be reviewed for an abuse of discretion.the inclusion of the word may in the language of section,subdivision d makes it clear that a trial court retains discretion to grant or deny a motion to set aside a void judgment.however,the question in this appeal is not whether or not the trial court abused its discretion when it decided to set aside the default judgment,but whether or not the default and default judgment were in fact void.a trial court has no statutory power under section,subdivision d to set aside a judgment that is not void once six months have elapsed since the entry of a judgment,a trial court may grant a motion to set aside that judgment as void only if the judgment is void on its face.dill berquist construction th,d dill.we review de novo a trial court determination that a judgment is void.
cruz properly served fagor with the summons and complaint 
a judgment or order is said to be void on its face when the invalidity is apparent upon an inspection of the.citation.in a case in which the defendant does not answer the complaint,the judgment roll includes the proof of service.citation.dill,supra,th at,d.fagor contends,and the trial court found,that service was not effected because there was no proof that the summons and complaint were served on fagor designated agent for service were delivered to the president or other officer,manager,or person authorized to receive service in accordance with section or were served in accordance with corporations code section,which provides for service on a foreign corporation by hand delivery to an officer or designated agent for service of process.
inspection of the judgment roll in this case does not establish that the judgment was invalid.rather,the proofs of service demonstrate that cruz served fagor,an corporation,in accordance with section.section provides in pertinent part 
a summons may be served on a person outside this state in any manner provided by this article or by sending a copy of the summons and of the complaint to the person to be served by mail,postage prepaid,requiring a return receipt.service of a summons by this form of mail is deemed complete on the day after such mailing.
because fagor is a corporate entity,cruz was also required to comply with the mandates of section.that section details how a plaintiff is to serve a summons on a corporate defendant and provides in relevant part 
a summons may be served on a corporation by delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint 
to the president or other head of the corporation,a vice president,a secretary or assistant secretary,a treasurer or assistant treasurer,a general manager,or a person authorized by the corporation to receive service of process,subd.b.
the trial court concluded that there was no proof that the summons and complaint were delivered to the president or other officer,manager,or person authorized to receive service in accordance with section,and that this meant that service had not been properly effected.our review of the record establishes that the trial court erred in making this determination 
section,subdivision a,outlines what proof of service is necessary when serving a nonresident pursuant to section 
proof that a summons was served on a person outside this state shall be made a if served in a manner specified in a statute of this state,as prescribed by section,and if service is made by mail pursuant to section,proof of service shall include evidence satisfactory to the court establishing actual delivery to the person to be served,by a signed return receipt or other evidence.
a number of documents in the record establish that cruz properly served fagor with process pursuant to california statutory requirements.the first is a judicial counsel of california proof of service form,completed and signed by cruz attorney,harold thompson.in that form,thompson states that the summons and complaint were addressed and mailed to patricio barriga,the president of fagor at wall street,lyndhurst,new jersey,which is the address fagor listed in with the new york state department of state,division of corporations,as its service of process address.
in johnson johnson superior court cal d,the supreme court held that a proper affidavit is one that informs the trial court that the plaintiff has completed all acts necessary to effect service.the returns of service on the corporate defendants in that case were deemed to have satisfied that standard,because each sworn affidavit of service recited the name of the person and the address to which the envelope containing the summons was directed id.at.applying that standard to the facts here,thompson declaration was properly executed because it shows that cruz addressed the summons and complaint to a person to be served,as listed under section.
cruz also submitted a signed return receipt to establish the fact of actual delivery.a return receipt attached to the proof of service form shows that the envelope was accepted at the lyndhurst address.the receipt was signed by hayes.fagor argues that cruz has not established that hayes was authorized to receive service of process on behalf of the corporation and,therefore,that cruz failed to present satisfactory evidence of actual delivery to the person to be served.however,cruz did present evidence that hayes was authorized to receive mail on behalf of the defendant.this evidence is sufficient to meet the requirements of section.
in neadeau foster d.neadeau,the appellate court concluded that there is no requirement that the return receipt be signed by the defendant,and evidence that the return receipt was signed by someone authorized to accept mail on the defendant behalf is sufficient to establish actual delivery for purposes of proof of service.the defendant in neadeau made an argument similar to the one fagor raises,which the appellate court rejected 
defendant major contention is that the default judgment is void on its face because there is no competent evidence in the record to show he was actually served with process.as will be seen,we hold that the california statutory scheme code civ,and read together permits completion of service by mail when the return receipt is signed by a person so authorized by the defendant.the personal signature of the defendant is not required.neadeau,supra,d at,fns.omitted.
in neadeau,the plaintiff presented an affidavit of an individual who worked for the plaintiff.in the affidavit,that individual attested to the fact that the person who signed the return receipt was an employee of the defendant who was authorized to sign for and accept mail on the defendant behalf.neadeau,supra,d at.
in this case,cruz submitted the declaration of his attorney,harold thompson,in which thompson states that he confirmed with a representative of the united states postal service in lyndhurst,new jersey,that hayes regularly receives mail on behalf of fagor at its lyndhurst office.this is similar to the evidence that was presented in neadeau and is sufficient to establish that an agent authorized to receive mail on the defendant behalf received the summons and complaint.
moreover,there is no evidence to the contrary.although fagor submitted a declaration of patricio barriga,notably absent from that declaration is any statement that he does not know hayes,that hayes is not employed by fagor,that hayes is not authorized to accept mail for barriga or other fagor officers,or that neither hayes or anyone else at fagor received the summons and complaint at issue.barriga also does not state that he was unaware of the action pending against fagor.
the defendant in neadeau similarly failed to present evidence sufficient to contradict the plaintiff evidence of the signatory agency 
in his declaration in support of his motion to set aside the default,defendant makes no contention that in any way factually refutes the affidavit submitted by hosey.thus,there is no assertion that angela johnson is not or was not defendant office manager or that she was not authorized to accept mail on his behalf.moreover,there is no assertion that the summons was not received by defendant,or that he was unaware of the action pending against him.defendant,having the clear opportunity to refute what otherwise appears to be competent evidence that it was served with process,has failed to do so.neadeau,supra,d at.
although barriga does state in his affidavit that he did not receive the summons or complaint,this is insufficient to take this case outside of the holding in neadeau.hayes received the summons and complaint.by virtue of her authority to accept mail on fagor behalf,hayes notice of the action is imputed to fagor and its officers.see neadeau,supra,d at.barriga statement that he did not receive the summons and complaint does not establish that service of process was invalid.barriga had constructive knowledge of the existence of the action,and of the summons and complaint,once an individual authorized to receive corporate mail acknowledged service.to hold otherwise would be to ignore the realities of corporate life,in which the duty to sign for mail received often resides with a designated mail room employee,a receptionist,a secretary,or an assistant.a plaintiff who has provided evidence that a person authorized to receive mail on behalf of a corporation in fact received an item that was mailed to an officer of the corporation should not be held responsible for any failure on the part of the corporate defendant to effectively distribute that mail.
cruz correctly addressed the summons and complaint to an appropriate individual and provided proof that the summons and complaint reached the hands of a person who was authorized to accept mail on behalf of the defendant.cruz has thus satisfied all of the elements necessary to establish effective service.fagor has presented no evidence that raises a factual issue as to the sufficiency of service of process.
fagor contends that dill,supra,th at page,d,supports its position that cruz failed to effectuate valid service of process.although dill is instructive,we disagree with fagor application of that case to the situation here.a close reading of dill establishes that the holding in that case supports cruz position,not fagor.
in dill,the appellate court concluded that a default judgment was void due to defective service of process.in reaching this conclusion,the dill court relied solely on the fact that the plaintiff had failed to meet the requirements of section because he had not addressed the envelope containing the summons and complaint to the person to be served,as is required under that section.specifically,the plaintiff failed to address the envelope to one of the corporate defendant officers or an agent designated to accept service of process on its behalf.instead,the plaintiff addressed the envelope to the corporation itself.because dill could not demonstrate that he met the statutory requirements for effective service,the appellate court went on to consider whether dill could establish that he had substantially complied with the statutes governing service of process.
the dill court noted that evidence that a mailed summons actually reached the individual to be served is sufficient to establish valid service,and thus to establish substantial compliance,even if the summons was signed for by someone who did not have the authority to do so.dill,supra,th at,d.thus,if dill had been able to provide evidence that a corporate officer or an agent for service of process had actually received the summons,this would have been sufficient to establish that the plaintiff had substantially complied with the statutes governing service of process.ibid.
dill argued that he provided sufficient evidence that an officer actually received the summons by presenting a postal receipt signed by someone other than a corporate officer.according to dill,the fact that the person signed the receipt as an agent meant that the summons had been received by a person designated as agent for service of process,subd.a or a person authorized by the corporation to receive service of process,subd.b.the appellate court disagreed,concluding that the only evidence that tended to prove agency was the signature on the postal receipt,and that an extrajudicial statement of a person claiming to be an agent was not admissible to prove the fact of agency unless the statement was made in the presence of the principal or communicated to the principal and the principal acquiesced in the statement.dill,supra,th at,d.the dill court also noted that there was no evidence that the signatory had been specifically authorized to accept service of process,as opposed to being authorized to receive mail on behalf of the corporation or its officers.id.at,d.
according to fagor,because hayes is neither an agent nor an addressee,under dill,cruz service was defective.in making this assertion,fagor fails to acknowledge that in this case,cruz properly addressed the summons and complaint to an officer of the corporation,not to the corporation itself.this fact is a ultimately between the attempted service by mail in dill and the service by mail in this case.the dill court contemplated the issue of agency in the context of determining whether dill could establish substantial compliance with the statutes governing service of process,since the court had determined that dill had not met the statutory requirements under sections and.in this case,cruz fully complied with the statutory requirements of section and.there is thus no need to determine whether he substantially complied with them.indeed,the dill court noted that in a circumstance such as exists in this case,a different result would be required 
nevertheless,the dissent worries that unless we deem receipt signers such as warner to have the ostensible authority to accept service of process,it will be difficult,if not impossible,to effectively serve foreign corporations by mail.dis.opn.of mosk,post,d.we disagree.had dill addressed the envelope containing the summons to one of the persons to be served,the service by mail would have been effective.if the names of those officers are unknown to a plaintiff,we see no problem in addressing them solely by their titles.it was dill failure to do either that resulted in the invalidity of his attempted service.dill,supra,th at,fn,d,italics added.
another distinction between dill and this case is that because the plaintiff in dill failed to comply with the requirements of the statute,the defendant was not required to present its own evidence to contradict the plaintiff evidence.specifically,because the proofs of service demonstrate that the copies of the summons were addressed solely to the corporations,rather than to any of the requisite persons to be served,the dill court concluded that the defendants in that case were not required to present any evidence in order to establish the invalidity of the service and the resulting lack of personal jurisdiction.dill,supra,th at,d.the same is not true here.cruz demonstrated that he satisfied the requirements of both section and section,and also presented evidence sufficient to meet the proof of service requirements.for this reason,it was incumbent upon fagor to present evidence that would affirmatively establish a lack of personal jurisdiction.again,fagor failed to do so.
contrary to fagor assertions,the facts of this case are also distinguishable from those in multitech d.in,the return receipt from the summons and complaint was signed by two persons other than the addressee defendant.id.at.the plaintiff in had addressed the summons and complaint to the defendant,but at an incorrect apartment number.ibid.there was no evidence as to who the signators were or what the nature of their relationship to the defendant was,if any.ibid.moreover,the defendant submitted a declaration in which he asserted that he had never been served with the summons and complaint,that he had not authorized anyone other than his wife to accept mail on his behalf,and that he did not know who had signed the return receipt.ibid.
the evidence in this case regarding hayes is that she was a fagor employee who routinely received mail on behalf of the corporation at the time she signed for the summons and complaint.fagor presented no evidence to the contrary.in fact,fagor evidence makes no mention of hayes.the only reasonable inference from the evidence in the record is that hayes was authorized to accept mail on behalf of fagor president at the time she signed the return receipt for the summons and complaint.
cruz met the requirements for service of process on an corporate defendant under sections and,and presented sufficient proof of service as required by section,subdivision a,and the rule announced in neadeau,supra,d at page.there was thus no basis for the trial court to conclude that the default judgment entered on may,was void for lack of valid service of the summons and complaint.
equitable relief on the basis of extrinsic mistake 
although it did not explicitly say so,the trial court apparently relied on the ground of extrinsic mistake as an alternative basis for granting relief in this case.extrinsic mistake refers to circumstances outside of the litigation that have prevented a party from obtaining a hearing on the merits.a trial court may vacate a default on equitable grounds even if statutory relief is unavailable.citation.rappleyea campbell cal th,d.
a challenge to a trial court order on a motion to vacate a default on equitable grounds is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.rappleyea campbell,supra,cal th at,d.cruz contends that the trial court abused its discretion in granting fagor equitable relief from the default and default judgment on the basis of extrinsic mistake.we agree.
extrinsic mistake exists when the ground for relief is not so much the fraud or other misconduct of one of the parties as it is the excusable neglect of the defaulting party to appear and present his claim or defense.see kulchar kulchar cal d,kulchar.if such neglect results in an unjust entered without a fair adversary defendant may have a basis for equitable relief.ibid.
relief on the ground of extrinsic fraud or mistake is not available to a party if that party has been given notice of an action yet fails to appear,without having been prevented from participating in the action.kulchar,supra,cal d at.to set aside a judgment based upon extrinsic mistake one must satisfy three elements.first,the defaulted party must demonstrate that it has a meritorious case.second,the party seeking to set aside the default must articulate a satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense to the original action.last,the moving party must demonstrate diligence in seeking to set aside the default once discovered.citation.rappleyea campbell,supra,cal th at,d,italics omitted.
in its order,the trial court asserts in a conclusory manner that fagor submitted evidence that it has a meritorious defense,there is a satisfactory excuse for its failure to present a timely defense,and it was diligent in seeking to set aside the default.putting aside the issue whether fagor established that it has a meritorious case,we conclude that fagor failed to articulate a satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense to the original action,and also failed to demonstrate diligence in seeking to set aside the default once it learned of it.because the record does not support the trial court assertions in this regard,we must conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in determining that equitable relief was appropriate in this case.
fagor presented no satisfactory excuse for its failure to defend against the action 
although the policy of the law is to favor a hearing on the merits of a case,courts are not required to set aside default judgments for defendants who flagrantly ignore the responsibility to present a defense.the burden of a party who has had a default entered against him is not limited to merely articulating the existence of a meritorious case.the defendant must also demonstrate a satisfactory excuse for not responding to the original action in a timely manner.citation.stiles wallis d.
it appears that the trial court relied on the declaration and the amended declaration of gisela ramos,the head of fagor claims and insurance department,and the declaration of barriga,to support its conclusion that fagor presented a satisfactory excuse.these declarations offer the excuse that fagor was unaware of the existence of the lawsuit prior to the time cruz informed it of his request for entry of default.however,neither declaration provides sufficient factual support to establish that fagor was justified in failing to defend against the action.fagor has thus failed to articulate a satisfactory excuse for failing to present a defense to the original action.
in its appellate briefing,fagor asserts that barriga statement that he did not receive the summons or complaint and ramos statement that she had no knowledge of the action,led to the conclusion that fagor was not aware the lawsuit had been filed until february when a notice of entry of default was forwarded to fagor.however,the record discloses that fagor was notified of the pending lawsuit by mail,and a fagor employee who was authorized to receive mail on fagor behalf received and accepted the summons and complaint.this evidence is sufficient to establish that,at a minimum,fagor had constructive knowledge of the fact that the lawsuit had been filed.in light of this evidence,fagor was required to present evidence sufficient to establish that through some error not attributable to its own handling of the matter,fagor did not receive actual notice of the lawsuit.it did not do so.barriga does not state in his declaration that he was unaware of the lawsuit or that he had no knowledge of the summons or complaint.instead,he simply states that he never received the summons and complaint.this statement does not establish that fagor was unable to defend against the action because of lack of notice of the lawsuit.at most,it establishes a lack of sufficient internal procedures to ensure that mail received at fagor offices is routed to the intended recipients.
the fact that ramos,the individual who is to receive all claims against fagor,attested that the first notice of the action she had was when she received the notice of request for default in late february,also does not provide fagor with a satisfactory excuse for failing to defend against the action.although fagor claimed in the trial court that certain of its officers or employees did not have notice of the lawsuit prior to fagor receipt of the notice of request for default,this is insufficient to establish that fagor did not have actual notice of the action.
because cruz satisfied his burden to establish that service of process was properly effectuated,upon the court acceptance of cruz proof of service there existed a presumption of constructive notice to the corporation and its officers.the burden thus shifted to fagor to establish that otherwise valid service of process did not result in actual notice to the corporation.again,cruz provided evidence that hayes was a fagor employee who was authorized to receive mail for the defendant.fagor did not rebut this evidence with a declaration stating that any of the evidence cruz provided relating to hayes was inaccurate,and there is no other indication in the record that hayes was not a fagor employee or that she was not authorized to receive mail on fagor behalf 
because cruz provided sufficient proof of valid service of process,barriga declaration,in which he states that he never received the summons and complaint,is insufficient to meet the burden fagor must satisfy.the legislature has determined that plaintiffs may serve foreign individuals and entities by mail and has incorporated significant safeguards into the process to create a process that is reasonably calculated to provide notice to defendants.cruz met these statutory safeguards service was thus effective.fagor and barriga must be held to have had constructive knowledge of the lawsuit.in the absence of any evidence that would suggest that the summons and complaint were not received at fagor offices by a fagor employee who was authorized to receive mail on behalf of the company,fagor has failed to come forward with a satisfactory excuse for its failure to present a defense to the action in a timely manner.the fact that the internal mail handling procedures of a company may have resulted in the misplacement of documents that the evidence establishes were delivered to the company is not a sufficient excuse 
at a minimum,fagor was made aware of cruz request for entry of default at some time bef
