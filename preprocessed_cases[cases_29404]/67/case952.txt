in this takings clause and due process case,landowners who sought to rezone their farmland for a trailer park and other residential development challenge the district court order granting the defendant township motion for summary judgment.the district court held that the plaintiffs takings clause claim was not ripe for review in the federal courts due to the rule of williamson county hamilton bank,d,which requires that a plaintiff first give the state court an opportunity to adjudicate the issue of just compensation before seeking a declaration from a federal court that the state has failed to provide just compensation.according to williamson county,a plaintiff bringing a takings claim must first be remedies in state court.the district court in the present case concluded that the plaintiffs failure to do so precludes a federal court from exercising subject matter jurisdiction over the takings claim.the district court also held that the plaintiffs contention that the defendant zoning ordinance and appeals process violated various constitutional procedural due process,substantive due process and equal ancillary to the takings claim and thus similarly unripe for review.
the plaintiffs argue in their appeal that these injuries are unrelated to the takings clause claim and must be reviewed as completed injuries.conflicting case law exists as to whether such claims are,in fact,independent.however,even assuming that the claims are not ancillary to the takings clause issue,summary judgment is nevertheless appropriate for the defendant.consequently,we affirm the grant of summary judgment for the defendants.
plaintiffs charles and catherine braun own acres of property zoned agricultural,district and an additional acres zoned single family suburban residential district plaintiffs edward and muriel pardon own acres of neighboring property that is zoned as.the two properties collectively,the property are located along the northern boundary of ann arbor city limits in michigan the home of the university of michigan,in a township with a population of 
both the brauns and the pardons had used their land for commercial farming for many years.due to the declining profitability of farming,a fact supported by expert testimony,the two families contracted to sell the property to plaintiff colt farms,colt farms,a developer.on february,the plaintiffs asked the defendant township to rezone approximately acres of the property to mobile home park residential district and the remaining acres to single family home urban residential district.in support of their application,the plaintiffs included an appraiser opinion that only residential housing would be economically viable for the property.on april,the defendant notified the plaintiffs that their petition for rezoning would be considered at a public hearing,which commenced before the planning commission on may.a second full hearing to consider the application occurred on july.afterwards,the planning commission sent the plaintiffs a request with a list of information that the commission stated was relevant to its determination,but which was not required by the zoning ordinance.the plaintiffs did not accede to this request,indicating by letter that the request was unauthorized and that they had provided all of the information required by the relevant zoning ordinance the planning commission then held a third public hearing on august,at which time it voted to deny the plaintiffs petition and submitted its recommendation to the township board.on september,the washtenaw county metropolitan planning commission also voted to recommend denial of the plaintiffs petition for rezoning.finally,on october,the defendant township board adopted a resolution denying the application for rezoning based on its conclusion that the proposed rezoning would have a on the community.see joint appendix ja describing,inter alia,the proposed rezoning impact on traffic,education,and law enforcement.
after receiving this denial,the plaintiffs asked the defendant about the possibility of receiving a variance from the zoning board of appeals.the township responded by letter,on october,stating that such an appeal was unavailable because the zoning board does not have the jurisdiction to change a zoning classification for any property,grant a use variance,or hear any other appeal from the township board.br.of plaintiffs at.this advice stemmed from the defendant interpretation of section of the applicable zoning ordinance,which reads the board of appeals shall not alter or change the zoning district classification of any property,or make any change to the terms of this ordinance,and shall not take any action that would result in making a legislative change.ja.the plaintiffs chose not to appeal to the zoning board of appeals.
on february,the plaintiffs brought suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the and district zoning restrictions for violating the takings clause,as such restrictions applied to the property.declining to reach the merits of the property owners constitutional claims,the state trial court granted the defendant motion for summary judgment after finding that the claim was not yet ripe for review.the michigan court of appeals affirmed on the same grounds,noting that the plaintiffs had not sought and been denied a use variance from the zoning board of appeals.see braun ann arbor.the michigan court stated that the finality requirement would be the claims ripe for review in state the plaintiffs were denied the minimum variance that is necessary to place the land in productive economic use within the zoning classification id.at.the plaintiffs then unsuccessfully sought leave to appeal to the michigan supreme court.braun ann arbor.
on july,the plaintiffs sought a use variance from the zoning board of appeals.the board denied this request after determining that it lacked the appropriate jurisdiction.instead of returning to state court for a ruling on the merits,the plaintiffs filed suit in federal court asserting the following claims deprivation of procedural due process deprivation of substantive due process violation of their equal protection rights violation of the takings clause and a violation of.the defendant then filed a motion for summary judgment in opposition to the plaintiffs claims.
the district court granted the defendant motion,structuring its holding around two issues.first,as to the takings clause claim,it held that the plaintiffs had not fully satisfied the supreme court williamson county rule because they had not sought or been denied just compensation in state court.braun ann arbor township,wl,dist.lexis,at,the michigan court of appeals did not address the takings clause or the right to compensation.emphasis in original.the court rejected the plaintiffs attempt to characterize their case as falling under dlx kentucky,cir,where we held that a takings claim was ripe for review despite the fact that the state courts had not reached the merits because the state procedural rules foreclosed any possibility of a remedy.braun,wl,at,dist.lexis at citing dlx,at.second,the district court held that the plaintiffs related constitutional claims were similarly unripe for review because they were all ancillary to the takings clause claim.id.at,dist.lexis at.consequently,it granted the defendant motion for summary judgment with respect to all of the plaintiffs claims.
in this appeal,the plaintiffs make two basic arguments.first,they urge us to reconsider the viability of the williamson county,of course,we may not do so long as it has not been overruled by the supreme,as in dlx,to find that the rule does not apply to their case.and second,they contend that the district court conclusion that the related constitutional claims were ancillary was incorrect as a matter of law.according to the plaintiffs,each constitutional injury is a concrete and completed injury,independent of the takings claim.
this court reviews de novo a district court grant of summary judgment for a party.solid wastes mgm t ass daviess county,cir.in williamson county regional planning commission hamilton bank,the supreme court held that the takings clause does not prohibit the government from taking private property,but only prohibits the government from taking private property without just compensation.at.citing hodel.surface mining reclamation ass,d emphasis added.a takings claim is therefore not ripe for review unless a property owner is denied just compensation.at.because the fifth amendment proscribes takings without just compensation,no constitutional violation occurs until just compensation has been denied.waste mgmt.metropolitan gov t,cir.accordingly,if a state provides an adequate procedure for seeking just compensation,the property owner can not claim a violation of the just compensation clause until it has used the procedure and been denied just compensation.coles granville,cir quoting williamson,at.thus,in order for a plaintiff to bring a takings claim in federal court,he or she must first pursue available remedies in state court.two issues inform this analysis first,whether the initial,administrative agency,has arrived at a definitive position on the issue that inflicts an actual,concrete injury the finality requirement and second,whether the state has denied just compensation based on that injury the remedies requirement.williamson,at.although the defendant argues that the plaintiffs have not satisfied the finality prong,we pretermit this question and instead focus on the second prong,which is dispositive on the issue of federal jurisdiction 
the parties agree that michigan provides an adequate just compensation procedure.see,macene mjw,cir in michigan,the doctrine of inverse condemnation is long recognized and constitutionally established.citing.and while the plaintiffs began to use that procedure,they never sought a remedy on the merits in state court and were thus not denied just compensation in state court,as required by williamson county.the plaintiffs make two arguments for why this rule should not control their situation.
first,they suggest that williamson its requirement that takings claims must first be pursued in state not good law.they note,for example,that justice rehnquist,among other jurists,has expressed skepticism that federal takings claims should be singled out to be confined to state court.san remo hotel,city and county of san francisco,d rehnquist,concurring.additionally,they argue that the williamson county rule creates a res judicata trap because federal courts must give preclusive effect to a prior state court action addressing the takings claim.see br.of plaintiffs at the barring of the federal courthouse door to takings litigants seems an unanticipated effect of williamson county,one which is unique to the takings context quoting dlx,at.in this case,however,the res judicata trap is not at if the plaintiffs had unsuccessfully pursued a remedy in state court,which was possible after being denied the variance,and then been denied review in federal court would this argument have merit similarly,the plaintiffs argument that a state court ruling might have precluded federal review under the doctrine is a hypothetical argument that is not presented by this case.see coles,at because we find that plaintiffs case as presented to both the district court and this court does not implicate,we hold that is inapplicable to plaintiffs allegations on appeal.the supreme court has yet to adopt the plaintiffs position or to overrule williamson county on other grounds consequently,we reject the plaintiffs argument that they are not bound by the requirement to pursue a remedy in state court.
second,the plaintiffs contend that they have,in fact,satisfied their obligation to pursue just compensation in state court.specifically,they claim that they sought,and were denied,state compensation,even though the state court never explicitly reached the merits of their claim.in support of this position,they cite dlx kentucky,in which we concluded that a plaintiff had satisfied williamson county second prong.at.in dlx,a plaintiff sought compensation from a kentucky court for an alleged regulatory taking resulting from the state refusal to grant mining rights over a property.the state trial court dismissed the claim for lack of ripeness the company never sought administrative review of the initial decision and the appellate court reversed.the supreme court of kentucky then granted the state petition for review,and reversed the appellate court,deciding the case on exhaustion grounds rather than ripeness.see commonwealth dlx.the plaintiff corporation then filed its takings claim in federal district court,which dismissed the claim for want of jurisdiction and specifically ripeness.we reversed,however,stating that dlx had sought compensation and none was awarded t hat the decision was not on the merits in the strictest sense does not mitigate dlx injury.at.
but the plaintiffs argument that dlx controls the instant case fails to acknowledge or to explain a key procedural aspect of the earlier case.as the district court in the instant case explained,the dlx court itself emphasized that dlx has no more remedy to seek in state court the time for application of review of the administrative decision is long past,and any action it files will be dismissed for want of exhaustion.id.emphasis added braun,wl,at,dist.lexis at.although the kentucky courts had not reached the merits of the claim,the state procedural rules operated to deny just compensation,which,according to our colleagues in dlx,made the claim eligible for review under williamson county.but in the instant case,in which the state court decision was grounded in ripeness analysis,the same problem does not exist after being denied the variance by the zoning board of appeals,the plaintiffs claim was ripe for review in state court and no procedural bar existed to prevent review.moreover,application of the williamson county rule would have deprived dlx from any review whatsoever,a problem that does not exist in the instant case.while we are sympathetic to the plaintiffs frustration regarding their inability to seek review of the merits of their takings claim,it appears that they mistakenly interpreted dlx to allow them to bypass the williamson county rule when,in fact,the dlx decision is not on point.because the plaintiffs did not fulfill their obligation of seeking just compensation in state court,we do not have jurisdiction to reach the merits of their takings claim.
the district court dismissed the plaintiffs four related constitutional and substantive due process,equal protection,and the grounds that they were ancillary to the unripe takings claim.see braun,wl,at,dist.lexis at citing peters fair,cir.according to the district court,resolution of the takings claim was necessary in order to address the attendant issues.in response to countervailing authority cited by the plaintiffs,the district court noted that those cases were not on point because none of them involved a plaintiff alleging a federal takings claim.id.at,dist.lexis at.even assuming that the claims were independent injuries,we affirm the grant of summary judgment for the defendants.
i procedural due process claim 
the plaintiffs procedural due process which they argue that the township treatment of their zoning request demonstrated an insufficiently fair defective for two alternative reasons.first,the claim is ancillary to and includes the same facts as the takings claim and should be governed by the takings claim theory requiring exhaustion of state remedies.second,the claim is without any factual basis showing the deprivation of a property right under state law or the constitution because the concept of property under state law does not include the right to have the local government rezone agricultural land to allow a trailer park.
when an individual is deprived of a protected property or liberty interest,procedural due process generally requires that the state provide a person with notice and an opportunity to be heard before such a deprivation occurs.warren city of athens,cir.where a procedural due process claim occurs alongside a takings claim,we have focused on the circumstances of the specific particularly the issue of when the alleged injuries deciding whether to appl
