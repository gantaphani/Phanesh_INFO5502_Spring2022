the fair housing act fha is one of the most important pieces of legislation to be enacted by the congress in the past years.it strikes at the heart of the persistent racism that so deeply troubles our nation.here,we deal with one aspect of that law zoning or rezoning of land as it affects the construction of housing that may be affordable by significant numbers of members of minority groups.
plaintiffs,two real estate developers developers,bring this case against the city of yuma,contending that the city refusal to rezone land to permit development violated,among other things,the equal protection clause of the united states constitution and the federal fair housing act fha.in particular,developers maintain that the city refusal stemmed from intentional discrimination against hispanics and created a disparate impact because the denial disproportionately deprives hispanic residents of housing opportunities and perpetuates segregation.the district court first dismissed developers equal protection and fha claims under rule b for failure to state a claim and denied developers motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.it then granted summary judgment in favor of the city on developers claim,rejecting both theories on which developers relied.
taking the factual allegations in the complaint as true,we first hold that developers presented plausible claims for relief for disparate treatment under the fha and under the equal protection clause.the city council denied developers request for rezoning despite the advice of its own experts to the contrary and in the context of what a reasonable jury could interpret as racially charged opposition by yuma residents.this was the only request for rezoning that the city had denied in the last three years or of the last applications.we reverse the district court because it failed to give sufficient weight to the city council alleged capitulation to the animus of the development opponents,in the face of the city own expert recommendation to approve the request and its practice of generally granting these requests.given these circumstances,the complaint passes the plausibility bar.we remand to the district court on these claims.
we also reverse and remand the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the city on developers claim and vacate its denial of the second summary judgment motion as moot.we reject the district court view that other and housing available elsewhere necessarily precluded a finding that there was a disparate impact.we remand for the district court to address the city second motion for summary judgment in the first instance

factual background 
according to the complaint,plaintiffs,avenue investments,llc and saguaro desert land,are business entities owned by members of the hall family,who develop housing in yuma,arizona.through developers and other affiliated companies,members of the hall family have developed various affordable and moderately priced housing projects in yuma.thus,developers are sometimes referred to as hall or hall construction.developers allege that even though the hall family affiliated companies build a full range of housing products,they nevertheless have a reputation as a developer of hispanic neighborhoods based upon their development of several affordable housing projects in yuma in which the majority of homes were sold to hispanics.
avenue owned acres of undeveloped land in southeastern yuma the property,and granted saguaro an option to purchase the property for the purpose of developing a moderately priced housing project.as developers state in their opening brief on appeal,their references to their proposed development as affordable and moderately priced are descriptive only and do not imply that such projects are considered affordable as defined by the united states department of housing and urban development.developers allege that the city denied a requested zoning change in september in response to animus by neighbors of the proposed development who wished to prevent the development of a heavily hispanic neighborhood adjacent to their subdivisions,in which of the population was white.
between and,the city performed two analyses specifically,the consolidated plan and analysis of impediments to fair housing choice for,as well as a version by the same name respectively,the analysis of impediments and the analysis of impediments each showing that the hispanic population in yuma was concentrated in several areas in the northern,western,and central portions of the city.the analyses show that substantially all of the available low to housing was located in those areas,and that more than of the households in that housing were hispanic.the reports found that,by contrast,whites were concentrated in separate areas in the northwest and southeast of yuma in which they comprised more than of the population.the property is on the western boundary of what was,at that time,one of the areas in the southeast portion of yuma.
the city general plan prohibits actions promoting racial segregation,and its analysis of impediments recognizes the need to encourage the development of more affordable housing choices to low and citizens outside the areas with high concentrations of hispanic households.the analysis warned,however,that residents had used nimby arguments to block or delay several affordable housing developments the analysis thus recommended an educational campaign to promote acceptance of affordable housing,neighborhoods,and cultural diversity.the general plan acknowledges that zoning raises housing costs and impairs the availability of housing affordable to low and purchasers,and identifies zoning as a means for the city to encourage desegregation.the general plan noted wealth disparities within yuma,stating that hispanic,african american and native american households are more likely to have lower income and live below the poverty line.
the city general plan designates the property for use as low density residential.this designation encompasses two permissible zoning designations r zoning,which allows development of a residential subdivision of houses placed on square foot lots,and r zoning,which requires the use of at least square foot lots.in,developers purchased the property from kdc of yuma,llc kdc,another housing developer,which had previously rezoned the property from agricultural use to r.the property is bordered on the south by the acre belleza subdivision,which consists of homes on lots exceeding square feet on the north by the country roads recreational village,consisting of square foot lots limited to persons age and over on the west by the acre terra bella subdivision owned by perricone development group ii perricone,a developer of luxury homes and to the east by a parcel the city intends to use to expand a wastewater facility and a municipal park.
in,developers determined that development of the property with r zoning was no longer financially feasible due to the collapse of the housing market and a corresponding difficulty in selling square foot lots.they determined,however,that there existed a need in yuma for more affordable housing,and designed a,moderately priced housing project for the property consistent with the city general plan and consisting of square foot lots.developers subsequently applied to rezone the property from r to r.the city staff and planning experts both recommended approval of the zoning request.
subsequently,the city planning and zoning commission held a public hearing on developers zoning application.several homeowners from the belleza subdivision wrote letters or spoke at the hearing objecting that developers catered to low to families.they complained that the people living in the hall neighborhoods tended to have large households,use homes as dwellings,allow unattended children to roam the streets,own numerous vehicles which they parked in the streets and in their yards,lack pride of ownership,and fail to maintain their residences.these characteristics,developers allege,coincide with a stereotypical description of yuma hispanic neighborhoods.the commission voted unanimously to approve the rezoning request,noting that many subdivisions with lots had previously been built adjacent to lot subdivisions without incident.the rezoning request was then forwarded to the city council with the recommendations of the planning staff and the planning and zoning commission that the request be granted.
prior to rendering its decision,the city council received complaints from landowners near the property commenting on the fact that developers build affordable housing and criticizing the proposed development in terms developers allege are in yuma as descriptive of hispanic neighborhoods.one landowner complained that developers proposal would create a low cost,high crime neighborhood.the city council held a public hearing.several landowners attending the hearing brought photographs of developers trail estate subdivision,in which of homebuyers were hispanic,which they identified as an affordable housing project.one belleza homeowner sent the following letter asking the city council to deny developers rezoning request 
we as well as many other families are very aware of the type of homes and neighborhoods the hall construction company has built in the past.if any of the council members are unaware of what i am referring to,i urge them to please drive through the many hall neighborhoods in particular the ones with the comparable price and square footage that the halls have proposed to build next to us.after doing so i ask council members to please ask themselves if they would want to live around these areas after having paid such a significant amount for their home from my first hand experience in comparing these hall subdivisions with our subdivisions particularly kerley subdivision,it is evident that the hall subdivision has a higher rate of unattended juveniles roaming the streets,as well as domestic violence,theft,burglaries,and criminal to properties.it was my experience that many owners of these homes left juveniles unattended as well as many of these homes were not single family dwellings like they were designated to be and instead turned into multifamily dwellings which in turn led to more unattended juveniles and crime we find it very disappointing that we have worked very hard to keep out children out of areas like this,as well as worked very hard to come up with the funds in order to buy the home that we live in.now we are faced with the possibility that once again the hall construction company wants to add another one of these subdivisions in yuma.
another landowner sent a letter to the council stating that 
according to the department of justice,households with incomes of less than account for of all crimes nationally as well as of all rape,murder,assault,armed robbery.the type of lots and houses that hall construction is considering will be catering to this group of people.what will this cost the city and county of yuma to patrol this area and how many innocent victims from belleza,terra bella and tillman estates will fall victim to a predator in this demographic 
a third landowner complained that graffiti is a problem in subdivisions.one councilmember described the hall companies subdivisions as having cars parked on the streets and in yards,and asked whether the garages envisioned for the property would be large enough to accommodate pickup trucks.
developers proposed creating a buffer zone of square foot lots separating the property from the belleza and terra bella subdivisions,with square foot lots placed between the buffer zone and the country roads rv park.one landowner commented that developers proposal would create a smooth transition in terms of lot size,but not of ownership demographics.reacting to the criticism of developers proposal,a city council member stated that subdivisions of different densities will inevitably abut each other,and voiced his concern that denying developers application on the basis of the community concerns would create an unsustainable precedent for future zoning decisions at the conclusion of the hearing,the city council denied developers rezoning request this rezoning request was the only one of applications considered by the city council over the preceding three years that it had rejected.
procedural background 
developers commenced this action in february,alleging a claim under for violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment and claims of disparate impact and disparate treatment under the fair housing act fha,et.in early,the district court granted the city motion to dismiss developers claims under the equal protection clause and the fha but denied the city motion as to developers claim under the fha later that year,developers filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint,which attempted,inter alia,to add additional facts,including the fact that the developers rezoning request was the only one rejected out of in the preceding three years.the district court denied this motion to amend on the ground that amendment would be futile.
after completing discovery on developers remaining claim,the claim,the city filed two motions for summary judgment regarding that claim.the first motion contended that developers could not prove disparate impact because there was an adequate supply of similarly priced and modelled housing in the southeast quadrant of yuma and that on this separate and distinct basis alone summary judgment should be granted.in that motion,the city proffered no other reason for the grant of summary judgment.four days later,the city filed the second motion,in which it contended that developers had failed to show a disparate impact on hispanics resulting from the denial of the rezoning application,and the city denied the rezoning application for legally sufficient reasons.the district court granted the city first summary judgment motion expressly stating that it did not reach the issues raised by the second motion,and then denied the second motion as moot it entered judgment,holding that the adequate supply of and modelled housing in southeast yuma foreclosed any finding of disparate impact,wl,at.the district court also rejected developers theory for its claim.it held that undisputed statistics showed that the integrative effect of that development would not have been significant enough to support a disparate impact claim based on the theory.id.at.developers timely appealed.
developers challenge the district court dismissal of their claims and grant of the city first motion for summary judgment on the claim.we first outline the avenues for relief available under the fha and then turn to the issues presented by this appeal.
enacted in the late following the assassination of martin luther king,the fair housing act came at a time of considerable social unrest.dep t of hous.cmty.affairs inclusive cmties.project.by the mid,congress had addressed discrimination in public accommodations and voting through major legislation yet,it had failed to tackle discrimination in housing,the area that determined millions of citizens daily life experiences,as well as who their neighbors would be,which schools their children would attend,and the general social environment in which they would grow up or live.combined with the advent of suburban developments across the country,various practices,sometimes with governmental support,encourage d and maintain ed the separation of the races,including racially restrictive covenants,blockbusting,and redlining.id.at.government policy,which promised not to change a neighborhood composition when constructing affordable housing,exacerbated the stark segregation in america cities.brief for housing scholars as amici curiae supporting respondents,texas dep t of hous.altogether,as the kerner commission warned,the nation was moving towards two societies,one black,one white separate and unequal.texas dep t of.at quoting report of the national advisory commission on civil disorders kerner commission.it took this grim prophecy,and the social unrest that gripped the country following the murder of king,for congress to act and pass the fha.id.at.
the fha declares that it is the policy of the united states to provide,within constitutional limitations,for fair housing throughout the united states.to achieve this goal,the fha renders it unlawful to,among other things,make unavailable or deny,a dwelling to any person because of race,color,religion,sex,familial status,or national origin.a.as relevant to this case,it provides several tools to do so.
first,and most obvious,it prohibits intentional discrimination that is,disparate treatment.a private developer or governmental body can not refuse to sell or rent housing to someone because of that person race,religion,gender,or other protected characteristic,nor can a government zone land or refuse to zone land out of concern that minorities would enter a neighborhood.see pac.shores,at noting that the fha prohibits discriminatory zoning practices.if a governmental actor engages in this discrimination,such conduct also violates the equal protection clause.arlington heights metro.hous,noting,in the context of a zoning challenge,that w hen there is a proof that a discriminatory purpose has been a motivating factor in a government decision,judicial deference to that decision is not justified under the equal protection clause.
given the long history and dire consequences of continuing housing discrimination and segregation,congress did not stop at prohibiting disparate treatment alone.indeed,in enacting the fha,congress sought to eradicate discriminatory practices within a sector of our nation economy.dep t of.at.to this end,as the supreme court recently reaffirmed,the fha also encompasses a second distinct claim of discrimination,disparate impact,that forbids actions by private or governmental bodies that create a discriminatory effect upon a protected class or perpetuate housing segregation without any concomitant legitimate reason.id.at.disparate impact provides a remedy in two situations that disparate treatment may not reach.first,i t permits plaintiffs to counteract unconscious prejudices and disguised animus that escape easy classification.see also huntington branch,huntington,cir noting that clever men may easily conceal their motivations and that analysis is needed because o ften,such facially neutral rules bear no relation to discrimination upon passage,but develop into powerful discriminatory mechanisms when applied.second,disparate impact not only serves to uncover unconscious or consciously hidden biases,but also targets artificial,arbitrary,and unnecessary barriers to minority housing and integration that can occur through unthinking,even if not malignant,policies of developers and governmental entities.dep t of.at.in this way,disparate impact recognize s that the arbitrary quality of thoughtlessness can be as disastrous and unfair to private rights and the public interest as the perversity of a willful scheme.united states city of black jack,cir.
today,the policy to provide fair housing nationwide announced in the fha remains as important as ever.while many cities have become more diverse after the passage of the fha and against the backdrop of liability in nearly every jurisdiction,texas dep t of.at,housing segregation both perpetuates and reflects this country basic problems regarding race relations educational disparities,relations,crime levels,wealth inequality,and even access to basic needs such as clean water and clean air.in this country,the neighborhood in which a person is born or lives will still far too often determine his or her opportunity for success.as the supreme court recognized,the fha must play a continuing role in moving the nation toward a more integrated society and a more just one.id.
given this context,we now turn to developers claims in this case.
ii.disparate treatment claims 
developers first bring claims under the fha and the equal protection clause,alleging that the city refused their request to rezone the property because of discrimination or animus against hispanics.the district court dismissed these claims and found the request for leave to amend futile,holding that developers did not allege plausible claims for relief in the first or seconded amended complaints.although developers appeal both the dismissal of their first amended complaint and the district court denial of their motion for leave to file a second amended complaint,we address only whether the second amended complaint stated a plausible claim for relief because the first and second amended complaints were both rejected based on plausibility and because the second amended complaint would have supersede d the original if allowed.see ramirez cnty.of san bernardino,cir see also dorf bjorklund,app x,cir ruling only on motion for leave to amend when the plaintiffs appealed the dismissal of the first amended complaint and the denial for leave to file a second amended complaint on the basis of futility.because the second amended complaint contains sufficient allegations that the city decision was driven by animus to state a plausible claim for relief,we hold that the amendment was not futile and reverse the dismissal of the claims.
arlington heights governs our inquiry whether it is plausible that,in violation of the fha and the equal protection clause,an invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor behind the city decision to deny the zoning application.arlington heights,at.under arlington heights,a plaintiff must simply produce direct or circumstantial evidence demonstrating that a discriminatory reason more likely that not motivated the defendant and that the defendant actions adversely affected the plaintiff in some way.pac.shores,f d at quoting mcginest gte serv,cir.a plaintiff does not have to prove that the discriminatory purpose was the sole purpose of the challenged action,but only that it was a motivating factor.arce douglas,cir quoting arlington heights,at.the court analyzes whether a discriminatory purpose motivated the defendant by examining the events leading up to the challenged decision and the legislative history behind it,the defendant departure from normal procedures or substantive conclusions,and the historical background of the decision and whether it creates a disparate impact.id.citing arlington heights,at,and pac.shores,at.these elements are,arlington heights,at pac.shores,at,and a plaintiff need not establish any particular element in order to prevail,see pac.shores,at stating that,for the purpose of summary judgment,any indication of discriminatory motive may suffice to raise a question that can only be resolved by a factfinder.we examine each in turn.
sequence of events leading up to the challenged decision and the legislative history 
the gravamen of developers claims is that the city discriminated against them by denying their application in order to appease its constituents,despite knowing that opposition to the application was based largely on racial animus,and despite the recommendations of its zoning commission and planning staff and its regular practice.here,the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to raise these claims.
the presence of community animus can support a finding of discriminatory motives by government officials,even if the officials do not personally hold such views.innovative health,city of white plains,cir,superseded on other grounds as recognized in zervos verizon,cir leblanc sternberg fletcher,cir plaintiff alleging a claim under the fha can establish a prima facie case by showing that animus against the protected group was a significant factor in the position taken by the municipal themselves or by those to whom the were knowingly responsive.internal quotation marks omitted.this standard recognize s the reality of such controversial proposals in the urban setting,united states city of new orleans,wl,at,in which council members may vote based on constituents concerns about an influx of undesirables into the neighborhood.smith town of clarkton,cir.
neither budnick nor arlington heights,which the city cites to support its position,holds otherwise.in budnick,the plaintiff sought a special use permit to build a retirement community and,only after the town council denied his application,raised for the first time the contention that the planned facility would serve disabled residents plaintiff in his prior declarations had asserted that residents would be limited to healthy,active,independent seniors.budnick,at.this alone undercut any finding of discriminatory intent by the town council,as the plaintiff failed to explain how the town could have discriminated against residents it did not know would be housed at the facility.here,by contrast,developers allege that their reputation as developers of subdivisions favored by hispanics,and the general demographic trends suggesting that the development they proposed would attract a greater number of hispanic homebuyers,were known prior to the denial of their application.accordingly,here,unlike in budnick,community members opposition to developers application,using language indicating animus toward a protected class,provides circumstantial evidence of discriminatory intent by the city.
the facts of arlington heights likewise do not support defendant argument.in that case,the supreme court affirmed the district court finding following a trial that,although some opponents of plaintiffs requested zoning change might have been motivated by opposition to minority groups,the evidence did not warrant the conclusion that this motivated defendants.at.unlike this case,the supreme court in arlington heights was required to review the district court factual finding for clear error after a trial,while here we must accept developers allegations as true and review the district court order de novo.see anderson city of bessemer city,newark branch,city of bayonne,cir.moreover,other facts not similar to any before the district court on the present motion to dismiss supported the district court factual finding in arlington heights.for example,as the supreme court noted,the area surrounding the site of the desired zoning change to permit zoning had been zoned for homes for more than a decade,and the zoning change would have been contrary to a buffer policy consistently applied in prior instances.at.here,by contrast,the r zoning sought by developers was entirely consistent with the city general plan.
although the relevant cases clearly hold that a city denial of a zoning change following discriminatory statements by members of the public supports a claim of discriminatory intent,the question remains whether the statements alleged in developers second amended complaint actually constituted animus.none of the alleged statements expressly refers to race or national origin rather,they raise various concerns about issues including large families,unattended children,parking,and crime.we have held,however,that the use of code words may demonstrate discriminatory intent.galdamez potter,cir citing mcginest,at.in mcginest,we adopted the reasoning of the third circuit opinion in aman cort furniture rental,cir.considering comments that plaintiff,an african american,was a drug dealer,we quoted aman at length 
a reasonable jury could conclude that the intent to discriminate is implicit in these comments.there are no talismanic expressions which must be invoked as a to the application of laws designed to protect against discrimination.the words themselves are only relevant for what they reveal the intent of the speaker.a reasonable jury could find that statements like the ones allegedly made in this case send a clear message and carry the distinct tone of racial motivations and implications.they could be seen as conveying the message that members of a particular race are disfavored and that members of that race are,therefore,not full and equal members of the workplace.
mcginest,at quoting aman,at alteration in original.the mcginest court then held that t he reference to plaintiff,an african american as a drug dealer might certainly be deemed to be a code word or phrase demonstrating animus.see also guimaraes supervalu,cir r acially charged code words may provide evidence of discriminatory intent by sending a clear message and carrying the distinct tone of racial motivations and implications.quotation marks omitted alteration in original jenkins methodist hosps.of dallas,cir citing aman,at.whether a code word evidences racial animus may depend upon factors including local custom and historical usage.ash tyson foods.although these cases involve employment rather than housing discrimination,these lessons are equally applicable to both types of cases.see texas dep t of.at.
here,construing the allegations in the complaint in favor of plaintiffs as well as drawing all inferences in their favor,the alleged statements by the neighborhood opposition submitted to city officials contained such code words consisting of stereotypes of hispanics that would be in yuma.neighbors expressed concern that the type of people living in the hall neighborhoods had large households and used homes as dwellings.these people,neighbors complained,own numerous vehicles which they park in the streets and yards,fail to maintain their residences,and lack pride of ownership.they also allow unattended children to roam the streets what some may call letting children play in the neighborhood.several landowners attending the public hearing even brought pictures of another hall subdivision,in which of the homebuyers are hispanic,to exemplify the complaints they had about the potential new development.see greater new orleans fair hous.action ctr.bernard parish,d,repeated references to village square,where village square was a local complex with a significant black population,demonstrated racial animus.after developers presented their compromise plan to transition from the foot lots down to foot lots near the rv park,another landowner noted that it would be a smooth transition in terms of lot size,but not ownership demographics,suggesting at least to a reasonable juror a change in racial composition.in sum,landowners worried that the type of people who live in hall neighborhoods create a low cost,high crime neighborhood that these landowners had worked hard to keep our children out of.see id.finding references to crime were atkins robinson,reference to an abundance of crime may be interpreted as a veiled reference to race.
taken together,these allegations,along with the allegation that developers are known to many as a developer of hispanic neighborhoods on the basis of their housing projects in yuma,provide plausible circumstantial evidence that community opposition to developers proposed development was motivated in part by animus,and that the city council was fully aware of these concerns when it took the highly unusual step of acceding to the opposition and overruling the recommendations of its zoning commission and planning staff.
city departure from its normal procedures or substantive conclusions 
developers also plausibly allege that the denial of their zoning application departed from the city normal procedures.in denying the rezoning,the city council decision ran contrary to the unanimous recommendation provided by the city planning and zoning commission,as well as the recommendation of city planning staff.a city decision to disregard the zoning advice of its own experts can provide evidence of discriminatory intent,particularly when,as here,that recommendation is consonant with the municipality general zoning requirements and plaintiffs proffer additional evidence of animus.see innovative health,at affirming grant of preliminary injunction and stating that city zoning body ignored the requirements of the hospital or sanitaria classification and did not explain why it declined to follow the corporation counsel straightforward analysis sunrise,town of huntington,d,concluding that town disregard of its citizen advisory committee recommendation suggested that defendants likely were swayed by the animus present in the community dews town of sunnyvale,d,defendant history of ignoring the recommendations of its planners and proceeding in the face of sound legal and planning advice weighed towards finding of discriminatory intent mhany.cnty.of nassau,d,city decision to disregard its own consultant zoning recommendation and the county desires supported finding of discriminatory intent but hallmark developers,at finding county board decision to ignore recommendations of approval from its staff and planning bodies was not suspect because no larger context demonstrated racial animus.developers allegation that the city prior zoning decisions permitted many examples in yuma where large lot expensive subdivisions had been built next to moderately priced small lot housing subdivisions without problems further underscores the inference that the decision to deny developers application was contrary to normal procedures.finally,this zoning request was the only request the city council denied of the considered over the three years preceding the council decision.drawing all reasonable inferences in developers favor,the city singling out of their zoning request for denial supports developers contention that the city had a discriminatory intent.
disparate impact and the historical background of the decision 
the complaint statistics on the disparate impact caused by the decision and the historical background of the decision also tend to make the claims plausible.
developers allege specific facts demonstrating city officials awareness that the effect of their denial of developers application would bear more heavily on one race than another in light of historical patterns of segregation by race and class specifically,they allege facts demonstrating that distinct areas of the city historically have been populated,respectively,by lower class hispanics and more affluent whites.they point to the and analyses of impediments,each of which shows that substantially all of the available low to housing in yuma has historically been concentrated in three areas of the city in which more than of the households are hispanic,whereas whites have been concentrated in two other areas in which the white population has been more than they also allege facts contained in the city general plan and the census identifying a direct relationship between housing density and costs,and demonstrating a significant disparity between the median income of yuma households headed by hispanics and whites.
based upon these facts,developers assert that the city denial of their application to build moderately priced housing will have a disproportionate effect on hispanics.developers allegations,accepted as true,support the inference that the city decision does arguably bear more heavily on racial minorities.arlington heights,at.drawing all inferences in developers favor,these allegations demonstrate a historical background of stratification by race and class,indicating the city denial of developers application to build moderately priced housing will have a disparate impact on hispanics by denying them affordable opportunities to move into communities long dominated by more affluent whites.
developers also allege facts suggesting a prior history of animus in yuma housing developments.specifically,they allege facts reported in the analysis of impediments demonstrating a history of nimby opposition to the development of affordable housing developments and appearing to link such opposition at least in part to animus,because the reports authors include among their recommendations that the city collaborate on community events celebrating cultural diversity.this further supports developers claims that animus helped motivate the community opposition leading to the city council decision to deny their zoning application.
citing the seventh circuit decision on remand in arlington heights and the second circuit decision in huntington branch,the city argues that the facts before us fail to demonstrate an intent to discriminate because they fall short of the facts in cases finding an intent to discriminate in municipalities with a long history of completely barring certain types of housing or restricting its development to only certain locations.see metro.hous.dev.vill.of arlington heights,cir huntington branch,huntington,cir.that the facts alleged here are not as egregious as the facts in other cases in which plaintiffs prevailed is of no consequence.developers need not demonstrate a complete absence of desired housing for hispanics to prevail discriminatory zoning practices violate the fha even if they only contribute to mak ing unavailable or deny ing housing to protected individuals.pac.shores,f d at quoting city of edmonds.state council,cir alterations in original emphasis added.moreover,at this stage of the proceedings all inferences must be drawn in the plaintiffs favor and those inferences alone are sufficient to preclude dismissal of the claims regarding disparate treatment.
conclusion 
after public hearings filled with what a reasonable jury could interpret to be racially tinged code words,the city council denied developers rezoning request,overriding the unanimous vote of the planning commission and denying a rezoning request for the first time in three years.for the reasons explained above,we hold that developers complaint sufficiently alleges claims of disparate treatment under the fha and equal protection clause.we hold that the claims of disparate treatment are,on the basis of the complaint before us,plausible and therefore reverse the district court dismissal of these claims.
iii.disparate impact claim 
developers next assert that the district court erred in granting the city first summary judgment motion as to the claim that the denial of the zoning request caused a disparate impact on hispanics.the motion was granted on the sole ground raised by the city housing was available elsewhere in southeast yuma therefore,no disparate impact could be established we reject that ground and hold that when a developer seeks to rezone land to permit the construction of housing that is more affordable,a city can not defeat a showing of disparate impact on a minority group by simply stating that other and housing is available in the general area 
developers presented a request to the city to change the zoning of their land from to housing.they did so mainly for financial reasons housing was not selling after a recession,and they believed that units might sell more easily.the city argued in its first summary judgment motion only that the availability of and modelled housing in other parts of southeast yuma necessitated summary judgment in its favor.developers statistics demonstrating that hispanics would be more likely to buy homes in the zoned area if the proposed zoning were approved were not at issue.the city,therefore,had a choice of two alternatives,each of which was permissible under its general plan one would enable more minority group members to purchase homes in an area with a white majority population than would the other.it chose the other.
as noted above,in the and earlier,national,state,and local governments had explicit or implicit policies that prevented integration even when developers had an economic rationale for wanting to build more dense or more affordable housing.in texas department of housing,the supreme court emphasized that liability was designed to reverse this pattern by allowing private developers to vindicate the fha objectives and to protect their property rights by stopping municipalities from enforcing arbitrary and,in practice,discriminatory ordinances barring the construction of certain types of housing units.at.indeed,the wisdom of liability under the fha is that it addresses local government as well as other government historical racism and the continuing persistence of housi
