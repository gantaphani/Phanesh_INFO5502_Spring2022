this appeal requires us to sort through a complicated set of commercial machinations and evaluate the soundness of an equitable accounting through which the lower court divided the surplus proceeds of a foreclosure sale.to solve this conundrum,we must answer three loosely related questions.the first concerns the applicability of the doctrine of judicial estoppel,the second concerns the way in which the methodology for calculating the equity of redemption fits within the framework of a judicial accounting,and the third concerns the propriety of a joinder of additional defendants.after careful consideration of these questions,we reject the district court proposed application of the doctrine of judicial estoppel but uphold its treatment of the equity of redemption and its joinder order.when all is said and done,we affirm in part,reverse in part,vacate the judgment,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
although there is a long,convoluted,and sometimes machiavellian history involving the protagonists,we relate here only those facts relevant to the issues presented on appeal.we supplement this account in connection with our discussion of particular issues.throughout,we accept the district court factual findings to the extent that they are not clearly erroneous.limone united states,cir cumpiano banco santander,cir.a.
michael perry and stephen yellin each hold a fifty percent interest in condominium housing,incorporated chi,which owned a large apartment complex in boston,massachusetts,known as the fenmore.chi purchased the fenmore from harold brown in.the purchase price included two promissory notes,with an aggregate face value of approximately the notes,executed by perry and yellin as.the notes were secured by first and second mortgages on the property.
over time,perry and yellin made payments on the notes.but when the boston real estate market cratered in the late,they defaulted on several obligations,including not only the notes but also an array of loans from their primary lender,capitol bank which,among other things,held a third mortgage on the fenmore.by,perry and yellin owed capitol bank more than.they negotiated a settlement with the bank in july of that year,but the settlement proved to be illusory.the bank subsequently repudiated it,and perry and yellin were forced to sue for specific performance in a massachusetts state court.
during the currency of that suit,the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic took over capitol bank as its receiver and liquidating agent.the fdic sought to collect perry and yellin indebtedness to the bank,claiming that they owed roughly in principal and accrued interest on various loans.as part of its collection effort,the fdic disavowed the earlier settlement and,in january of,filed an amended counterclaim in the state court suit.
the amended counterclaim named as defendants perry,yellin,and a number of their relatives.these additional defendants whom we shall call the perry parties and the yellin parties were allegedly involved in perry and yellin real estate enterprises as straws.in due season,the fdic removed the state court action to the federal district court.see b b.
brown fortunes also had been adversely affected by the slumping real estate market.in,he filed for bankruptcy.the bankruptcy proceedings dragged on and,in august of,he submitted an affidavit to the bankruptcy court in which he represented that the notes had an unpaid balance of and were uncollectible.the bankruptcy court granted brown a discharge from bankruptcy in september of and permitted him to retain ownership of the notes.

in june of,perry,on behalf of chi,sued the yellins and blum,individually and as trustee of moorings nominee trust,in a massachusetts state court.the suit alleged an alphabet of wrongdoing,including breach of fiduciary duty,fraud,and conversion,stemming from the purchase of the notes.in october of,after perry failed to attend a pretrial conference,the state court dismissed the suit for want of prosecution.chi blum,unpublished order.
in late,yellin,acting through blum,commenced foreclosure proceedings with respect to the fenmore.the fdic,which held junior mortgages on the property as the receiver for capitol bank,responded by bringing an action in the federal district court.in the action,the fdic sought to enjoin any foreclosure sale.the district court granted a preliminary injunction blocking the foreclosure sale.later,it consolidated the action in which it had granted the injunction with the action that the fdic had removed from the state court.
in,yellin and the yellin parties settled with the fdic for.under the terms of the settlement,the fdic permitted yellin,acting through blum,to foreclose on the fenmore and use the first of the foreclosure proceeds to fund the settlement.the district court thereafter dissolved the existing injunction and blum foreclosed on the fenmore.the apartment complex was sold at auction for ironically,to brown.the fdic and the yellin parties then jointly moved to dismiss all claims inter sese.the district court granted that motion on june,
following the foreclosure sale,perry,on behalf of himself and chi,against blum for an accounting of both the foreclosure proceeds and all rents collected between and.perry alleged that,as an equal partner in chi,he was entitled to of the fenmore equity of redemption.
in february and march of,the district court held a bench trial on the.the notes were secured by first and second mortgages on the fenmore,so blum,as the noteholder and as a straw for yellin,had a priority claim to the foreclosure proceeds.not surprisingly,then,one of the main issues at trial concerned the amount due on the notes.blum contended that was due.perry contended that the amount due was much less.the district court determined that blum was estopped from asserting that the amount due was anything other than what brown,blum,had represented in the bankruptcy court,namely.perry blum perry i,slip op.at,even though the trial had ended years earlier,the court granted perry motion to join the yellins as defendants,slip op.at.

ii.analysis 
like a milking stool,this appeal rests on three legs.the appellants blum and the yellins insist that the district court erred in i invoking judicial estoppel,ii miscalculating the equity of redemption,and iii adding the yellins as defendants after the trial had ended.we discuss each of these arguments separately.before doing so,however,we pause to make a point about choice of law.
due to the fdic involvement,this case had its roots in federal question jurisdiction.b a.but the fdic has departed from the scene,and the remaining claims are cognizable only under supplemental jurisdiction.where,as here,a federal court proceeds under supplemental jurisdiction,it is obliged to apply federal procedural law and state substantive law.hoyos telecorp commc ns,cir.to the extent that procedural issues loom,the federal rules of civil procedure provide the beacon by which we must steer.
most of the components of the appellants asseverational array raise substantive questions and,thus,require us to apply massachusetts law.withal,one of the issues presents a thorny problem of classification,which this court has not resolved is judicial estoppel procedural and,thus,governed by federal law or substantive and,thus,governed by state law 
this is an interesting rubik cube,but we need not provide a definitive answer here.the parties and the district court all assumed that federal standards of judicial estoppel governed,and the case has been briefed and argued on the same assumption.in such circumstances,we may hold the parties to their plausible choice of law,whether or not that choice is correct.see thore howe,cir alt.concepts,synopsys,cir.we follow that prudential course and apply federal law in discussing this issue.
judicial estoppel.
the appellants insist that the district court erred in invoking judicial estoppel to preclude them from showing that the amount due on the notes was anything other than what brown had represented in a prior bankruptcy proceeding.we review for abuse of discretion a district court application of judicial estoppel.global naps,verizon new engl,cir.within that rubric,we accept the trial court findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous,see limone,at cumpiano,at,and evaluate its answers to abstract questions of law de novo,see san juan cable llc,cir.we treat a material mistake of law as a per se abuse of discretion,cir.
the doctrine of judicial estoppel is equitable in nature.it operates to prevent a litigant from taking a litigation position that is inconsistent with a litigation position successfully asserted by him in an earlier phase of the same case or in an earlier court proceeding.intergen grina,cir.the purpose of the doctrine is to protect the integrity of the judicial process.it is typically invoked when a litigant tries to play fast and loose with the courts.new hampshire maine,alt.concepts,at patriot cinemas,cinema,cir.
the contours of judicial estoppel are hazy.but even though its elements can not be reduced to a scientifically precise formula,new hampshire,at,courts generally require the presence of three things before introducing the doctrine into a particular case.first,a party earlier and later positions must be clearly inconsistent.alt.concepts,at.second,the party must have succeeded in persuading a court to accept the earlier position.new hampshire,at alt.concepts,at.third,the party seeking to assert the inconsistent position must stand to derive an unfair advantage if the new position is accepted by the court.new hampshire,at alt.concepts,at.
ordinarily,the party against whom judicial estoppel is invoked must be the same party who made the prior inconsistent representation.see intergen,at explaining that judicial estoppel prevents a litigant from pressing a claim that is inconsistent with a position taken by that litigant in the same or an earlier proceeding brewer madigan,cir explaining that judicial estoppel prevents a party from taking a position inconsistent with one successfully and unequivocally asserted by that same party in a prior proceeding.courts normally refuse to apply judicial estoppel to one party based on the representations of an unrelated party.see,parker wendy int l,cir bethesda lutheran homes,born,cir ex rel.sizemore surety bank,cir see also charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure,at ed.nevertheless,courts sometimes have allowed judicial estoppel when the estopped party was responsible in fact for the earlier representation,see,ladd itt,cir,or when the estopped party was the assignee of a litigation claim or assumed the original party role,see wright et,supra,at.
in the case at hand,the district court determined that the appellants blum and the yellins should be judicially estopped from asserting that the amount due on the notes was because a third party,brown,had represented in his own bankruptcy proceeding that the unpaid balance was a mere,and had represented in chi bankruptcy that the total amount due on the notes including accrued interest was.perry i,slip op.at.the court bound the appellants to brown earlier representations primarily on the theory that the appellants,as purchasers of the notes,were subject to any defenses that perry and chi could have asserted against brown himself.id.at the court reasoned that because brown would be judicially estopped from contradicting his prior representations anent the amount due on the notes,his assignees should be similarly estopped.id.at.the appellants say that brown representations can not be imputed to them and that,therefore,judicial estoppel was incorrectly invoked.
in examining these competing contentions,we take the underlying substantive law of negotiable massachusetts.under massachusetts law,negotiable instruments,such as the notes,are governed by article iii of the uniform commercial code.see.laws ch.the states that a noteholder right to enforce a note is subject to certain defenses.id.a.these defenses include those enumerated in section a often termed real defenses,defenses specifically listed elsewhere in article iii,and defenses that would be available if the person entitled to enforce the instrument were enforcing a right to payment under a simple contract often termed personal defenses.id.if a noteholder qualifies as a holder in due course,his right to enforce the note is subject only to real defenses.id.b.
the appellants do not presume to be holders in due course.see perry ii,slip op.at.thus,they are subject to the axiom that the rights of a transferee who is not a holder in due course rise no higher than the rights of the transferor.see james white robert summers,uniform commercial code,at ed.it follows that the appellants,as transferees,are subject to the trilogy of defenses described in section a to the same extent that those defenses would have been available against the transferor brown.see see also herbert lemelman,massachusetts practice,at ed stating in essence that a holder who is not a holder in due course is treated under massachusetts law as the assignee of a contract.
this does not mean,however,that the transferor and the transferee are to be treated as one and the same for all purposes.of particular pertinence for present purposes,judicial estoppel does not fit comfortably within any of the trilogy of defenses described in section a.judicial estoppel is certainly not a real defense within the provision of the statute,nor is it a defense specifically listed anywhere in article iii of the 
this leaves only the category of personal defenses.
personal defenses typically are thought to be those based on common law contract principles.laws ch,a cmt.see fdic wood,cir personal defenses,such as failure of consideration and usury are defenses or claims stemming from the underlying transaction.judicial estoppel does not fit seamlessly into the taxonomy of personal defenses,as it is not a defense aimed directly at either the validity or the enforceability of a contract.rather,it is a doctrine designed to protect the integrity of the judicial system.see new hampshire,at.this seeming incongruence gives us some pause about trying to ram the square peg of judicial estoppel into the round hole of personal defenses.
still,we recognize that the boundaries of judicial estoppel are hazy.it is conceivable that cases may arise in which the doctrine can be considered a personal defense,used to prevent a noteholder from playing fast and loose with the courts through,say,engaging a straw to assert a payoff amount contradictory to one earlier put forth by the noteholder himself.see holdings,reliance ins,cir we will apply judicial estoppel to neutralize threats to judicial integrity however they may arise.fdic gulf life ins,cir suggesting that,for negotiable instruments,general estoppel may constitute a personal defense,to which a holder in due course would be impregnable.the combinations of possible circumstances are infinitely varied,and a flat holding that judicial estoppel can be circumvented simply by transferring property to a third party would be folly.see generally sandstrom chemlawn,cir emphasizing utility of judicial estoppel as a means of preventing a party from obtaining an unfair advantage.
here,however,we need not grapple with the admittedly difficult question of whether judicial estoppel may ever qualify as a personal defense.in our view,the district court application of judicial estoppel suffers from a different infirmity perry has failed to satisfy the second requirement for judicial estoppel.he has not shown that the bankruptcy court actually accepted brown representation of the value of the notes.
the party proposing an application of judicial estoppel must show that the relevant court actually accepted the other party earlier representation.see gens resolution trust,cir judicial estoppel is not implicated unless the first forum accepted the legal or factual assertion alleged to be at odds with the position advanced in the current forum emphasis in original.acceptance in this context is a term of art.in order to satisfy this prerequisite,a party need not show that the earlier representation led to a favorable ruling on the merits of the proceeding in which it was made,but must show that the court adopted and relied on the represented position either in a preliminary matter or as part of a final disposition.see,pennycuff fentress cnty.bd.of,cir karaha bodas perusahaan pertambangan minyak dan gas bumi negara,cir see also global naps,at finding that court accepted party first representation by relying on it in granting temporary restraining order alt.concepts,at explaining that because court relied on party initial position in denying motion to dismiss,party derived a direct if temporary benefit from its original position.
the showing of judicial acceptance must be a strong one.see sbt holdings,llc town of westminster,cir rejecting judicial estoppel argument because record was unclear as to whether court accepted plaintiff prior position united states pakala,cir upholding judicial estoppel when it was clearly obvious that the original trial court,in granting a motion,necessarily adopted the position that the movant later sought to contradict united ins.spectrum worldwide,cir authorizing judicial estoppel when trial court clearly accepted and relied upon the party assertions when it denied preliminary injunction.the need for a strong showing derives from the maxim that j udicial estoppel is applied with caution to avoid impinging on the function of the court because the doctrine precludes a contradictory position without examining the truth of either statement.teledyne,nlrb,cir accord lowery stovall,cir the insistence upon a court having accepted the party prior inconsistent position ensures that judicial estoppel is applied in the narrowest of circumstances.
it follows that a proponent of judicial estoppel must affirmatively show,by competent evidence or inescapable inference,that the prior court adopted or relied upon the previous inconsistent assertion.see united steelworkers of am.ret.income plan for emps.of asarco,cir finding that failure to demonstrate judicial acceptance precludes application of estoppel where the district court never held the notion urged by the party emphasis in original united states levasseur,cir rejecting illogical surmise about what prior court might have accepted as a basis for judicial estoppel.perry has not made the requisite showing here.
there are only two possible actions taken by the bankruptcy court that brown representation might have affected.first,in brown bankruptcy proceeding,the court allowed him to retain the notes after he stated the amount due and represented that the notes were uncollectible.second,in the chi bankruptcy in which brown intervened,the court lifted the automatic stay,allowing brown to foreclose on the fenmore.there is no evidence that either action was premised on brown statements about the amount owed on the notes,and it is implausible to infer any such nexus.
we examine these two actions in reverse order.it defies logic to deduce that the bankruptcy court granted brown relief from the automatic stay on the basis of the amount owed on the notes.a larger figure would not have supported keeping the stay in anything,a greater amount owed would have created an additional incentive for the court to allow the foreclosure to proceed.
similarly,it is utterly speculative to suggest that the bankruptcy court,in approving brown global settlement and allowing him to retain the notes,accepted each and every one of his figures.generally speaking,settlement neither requires nor implies any judicial endorsement of either party claims or theories.in re bankvest capital,cir quoting bates long island,cir.so viewed,an unexplained settlement does not provide the prior success necessary for judicial estoppel.see c m,llc burbidge,noting that t he the fact that debtor obtained confirmation of its plan does not demonstrate that the bankruptcy court was misled and thus finding that second element of judicial estoppel was not satisfied,vacated on other grounds by in re c m,cir.
perry surmises,but offers no semblance of proof,that a bankruptcy court would treat uncollectible notes worth over differently than uncollectible notes worth roughly.it is,of course,possible that,in particular circumstances,a bankruptcy court might indulge in such differential treatment.here,however,the surmised inference is simply not plausible.by definition,an uncollectible note is an uncollectible note and,thus,worthless.in any event,either of these figures pales in comparison to sum of the claims of brown creditors at the time of the settlement.in this case,then,the variation in amount is a distinction that makes no difference 
for what it may be worth,brown himself neither explicitly nor implicitly contradicted his original representation as to the amount due on the notes.he placed that figure at and later sold the notes for a figure in the same ballpark.these events do not support a suggestion that he was attempting to defraud or mislead the bankruptcy court.this is potentially important because judicial estoppel is not meant to be a trap for the unwary and should be employed sparingly when there is no evidence of intent to manipulate or mislead the courts.ryan operations lumber,cir.
to say more on this issue would be to paint the lily.conjecture,without more,can not support the application of judicial estoppel.see sbt holdings,at.put another way,remote possibilities are not enough.consequently,we hold that the district court committed legal error and,thus,abused its discretion in judicially estopping the appellants,based on a third party earlier representation,from attempting to prove that the amount due on the notes was more than.
in an effort to repair this hole in the fabric of their argument,perry and chi urge that the appellants should be judicially estopped based on yellin prior representation.the district court rejected this alternative theory,perry ii,slip op.at,and so do we.
the salient facts are as follows.in,perry,on behalf of chi,sued the appellants in a massachusetts state court.he moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent foreclosure on the fenmore.as part of his opposition,yellin filed an affidavit indicating,in its background recitals,that the amount due on the notes was.the state court denied perry motion.perry did not appeal the denial,and the court subsequently dismissed the case for want of prosecution.
in the court below,perry and chi advanced an alternative claim of judicial estoppel premised on yellin affidavit.the district court did not bite,reasoning that the state court took no action in reliance on the million figure and ultimately dismissed the case for lack of prosecution.id.perry and chi challenge this holding.noting that the state court accepted the filing of yellin affidavit and denied the preliminary injunction,they say that no more was exigible to ground a subsequent claim of judicial estoppel.we do not agree.
based on the facts recounted above,the first element needed for judicial estoppel is satisfied.the representation about the notes value,as expressed by the appellants in the district court,is inconsistent with the earlier representation that yellin made in the state court.
once again,however,the second element is more problematic.there is absolutely no basis for believing that the state court adopted or relied on the figure contained in yellin affidavit.the absence of any evidence to that effect is fatal.see sbt holdings,at levasseur,at.
perry and chi suggest that the state court may have relied on yellin representation in denying the motion for preliminary injunction.but this suggestion is woven entirely out of gossamer strands of speculation and surmise.in addition,the suggestion is counterintuitive.perry and chi sought the preliminary injunction to prevent foreclosure on the fenmore,and the amount of the indebtedness had virtually nothing to do with the question raised in that motion.in other words,whether the balance owed was or or some figure in between had no apparent bearing on whether the foreclosure should or should not be enjoined.of warwick,baccarat,cir listing factors relevant to preliminary injunction inquiry.there is simply no plausible basis for supposing that yellin representation about the amount due factored into the state court decisional calculus.
equity of redemption.
given our previous conclusion,see supra part ii a,the district court accounting will have to be reworked.once the amount due on the notes is established and all,the notes were secured by first and second mortgages on the fenmore and,thus,give rise to a equitable lien on the foreclosure question becomes how the court should treat the paid to settle the fdic claims against the yellin parties.the appellants argue that this payment extinguished the third and fourth mortgages and,thus,should be offset before calculating the equity of redemption.the district court made no such offset.the appellants assign error to this step in the progression.
the calculation of an equitable accounting is,within broad limits,committed to the district court discretion.tamko roofing,ideal roofing,cir.accordingly,we will not disturb such a calculation unless it rests on clearly erroneous findings of fact,incorrect legal standards,or a meaningful error in judgment.see in re blinds to go share purchase,cir because the district court is in a considerably better position to bring the scales into balance than an appellate tribunal,we will not normally find an abuse of discretion unless,upon review,we are convinced that the district court committed a significant error in judgment.quoting,cir en banc.
as of the foreclosed fenmore,perry and yellin are jointly entitled to the equity of redemption.stripped of rhetorical flourishes,the appellants contention is that calculating this figure is a purely mechanical exercise,which requires that payments made to extinguish liens on the property be subtracted before the can divide the remaining foreclosure surplus.building on this foundation,the appellants posit that the district court erred in refusing to offset the payment that they made to the fdic because that payment extinguished the third and fourth mortgages on the fenmore.
this argument has a patina of plausibility.under basic principles of property law,the holder of the equity of redemption does not have a property interest in foreclosure proceeds unless and until all outstanding liens on the property have been extinguished.see first colonial bank for sav.bergeron,see also restatement third of mortgages when the foreclosure sale price exceeds the amount of the mortgage obligation,the surplus is applied to liens and other interests terminated by the foreclosure in order of their priority and the remaining balance,if any,is distributed to the holder of the equity of redemption.a junior lienholder has an equitable lien,transferred from the foreclosed premises,that attaches to the foreclosure surplus.see new haven sav.bank follins,d,see also restatement third of mortgages,cmt.a explaining that the surplus stands in the place of the foreclosed real estate,and the liens and interests that previously attached to the real estate now attach to the surplus.
the appellants take these abecedarian property law principles to mean that because they settled with the fdic and thereby extinguished the fdic equitable lien on the foreclosure proceeds,the settlement amount must come off the top before the equity of redemption is calculated.the district court instead treated the as a part of the distribution of the appellants share of the equity of redemption.see appendix.
the appellants construct reflects a kind of tunnel vision.it fails to take into consideration that the challenged calculations are not entries on a closing sheet at a foreclosure but,rather,are calculations made in the context of a judicial accounting.this matters because an accounting is not a rote exercise in arithmetic.to the contrary,it is an equitable remedy,see braunstein mccabe,cir citing granfinanciera,nordberg,and equitable remedies are flexible tools to be applied with the focus on fairness and justice.demoulas demoulas,citing dan dobbs,law of remedies,at ed.
the district court understood this distinction.it refused to offset the settlement before calculating the equity of redemption.the court based this determination on a finding that the primary purpose of the settlement was not to extinguish the fdic lien,but to release the yellins from personal liability on a wide range of loans many of which were completely unrelated to the fenmore.see perry iii,slip op.at.in effect,yellin used money that otherwise would have had to be shared with perry to defray his personal obligations,leaving perry to settle separately with the fdic using his own resources.see supra note.in the district court words,yellin ha d blum conduct the fenmore foreclosure sale and hand over the first million in proceeds to the fdic to satisfy yellin personal obligations.see perry iii,slip op.at.the court found that arrangement to be the product of precisely the improper relationship and underhanded dealings that characterized the appellants course of conduct.see also perry i,slip op.at.
this finding is eminently supportable.the only reason why yellin was able to use foreclosure proceeds to fund his personal settlement was because of his relationship with blum,who,as a straw for yellin,held the senior mortgages on the fenmore.
in performing an equitable accounting,the district court is not a mere scrivener,charged with carrying out a ministerial task.instead,the court is charged with tempering arithmetic with equity,or,as we phrased it in,at,bring ing the scales into balance.in this context,we think that the district court acted within the sphere of its discretion in preventing yellin from unjustly enriching himself,to the detriment of his quondam partner,by what the district court warrantably found were underhanded dealings.see dobbs,supra,at explaining that an accounting forces the fiduciary defendant to disgorge gains received from improper use of the plaintiff property or entitlements.accordingly,we hold that the district court neither erred nor abused its discretion in refusing to subtract the payment before calculating the equity of redemption.
the yellins claim that the district court violated the due process clause by joining them as defendants after the trial had ended.a few additional facts are needed to bring the claim into perspective.
when the fdic originally filed a claim in the underlying litigation,it named the yellins,among others,as de
