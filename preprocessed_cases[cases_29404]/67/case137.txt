this case calls on us to navigate the turbulent waters of colorado river abstention.that doctrine,established in colorado river water conservation district united states,d,allows federal courts in limited instances to stay or dismiss proceedings that overlap with concurrent litigation in state court.
the plaintiffs here originally sued in federal district court,asserting diversity jurisdiction.they later commenced an identical action in a puerto rico commonwealth court during what they considered to be a burdensomely long pendency of a motion to dismiss for failure to join an indispensable party.the federal court eventually granted the motion to dismiss,leaving the action in the commonwealth court to proceed alone.the plaintiffs appealed from the federal dismissal and now ask us to reinstate the diversity suit to its parallel track alongside the ongoing commonwealth litigation.the defendants argue not only that we should affirm the dismissal for lack of an indispensable party,but also,among other things,that the action provides an alternative ground for disposing of the federal case under colorado river.we conclude that the narrow conditions for colorado river abstention are met here.we therefore stay the federal proceedings pending the outcome of the case.
background 
since the district court did not reach the merits,we provide a condensed version of the dispute.tell trs.of dartmouth,cir.on december,manuel,the plaintiffs decedent,sold the defendants of the stock in an apartment complex development known as isabela beach court.agreed to manage isabela beach court in exchange for a monthly fee and of the proceeds after the complex completion and the sale of all units.in addition,before construction began,verbally agreed to buy one of the penthouses in isabela beach court for,and the defendants reserved the unit for him.this agreement was later confirmed in writing.for reasons unspecified at this stage,the defendants dispute the scope and validity of these agreements.
on january,died.construction of isabela beach court was completed at some point after his death and all of the units were sold successfully.on march,widow,plaintiff sonia jimenez,commenced an action in the federal district court for the district of puerto rico asserting that she was entitled to half of her late husband share,which had never been paid.additionally,she sought to exercise his option on the penthouse apartment that had allegedly been reserved for him.because jimenez was a florida resident and the defendants were all puerto rico residents,she claimed that the district court had diversity jurisdiction over the matter.
the defendants moved to dismiss for failure to join an indispensable party under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.they argued that the case could not proceed without three other heirs,two of whom were also puerto rico residents.because joinder of the puerto rico heirs would defeat complete diversity,the defendants maintained,dismissal was compulsory.
on august,jimenez amended the complaint to join the one diverse heir while still excluding the heirs.she also altered her theory of the case,explaining that she was now seeking the contractual proceeds on behalf of estate rather than for herself alone.she claimed that she could adequately protect the interests of the heirs and that,as a result,the action did not depend on their joinder.the amended complaint asked the court to award any judgment to the estate,where it could be allocated to heirs and creditors by a puerto rico probate court at some later date.
the addition of the diverse heir as a named plaintiff did not,however,affect the substance of the defendants argument.the defendants renewed their motion to dismiss,maintaining that jimenez was not an adequate representative of the estate and that an adverse judgment could affect the heirs interests.according to them,neither the case new posture nor the joinder of the one diverse heir would lessen the indispensability of the heirs.the plaintiffs filed their response three days later.
over six months passed without any further action from the court.on march,the plaintiffs sought to learn the status of the pending motion to dismiss,but the docket does not indicate a response from the court.on august,after an additional five months,the plaintiffs filed a parallel complaint in the court of first instance for the commonwealth of puerto rico.unlike the federal action,this second suit joined all of heirs as parties.
on december,the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss.jimenez.this appeal followed.meanwhile,the commonwealth action has progressed in due course and is now into the discovery stage.
ii.discussion 
the present three different possible grounds to deny appellate relief to the.first,they argue that this case involves matters that fall within the probate exception to diversity jurisdiction and thus can not be adjudicated in federal court.second,they reiterate their rule claim that the heirs remain indispensable.finally,they ask us to abstain under colorado river and allow the puerto rico court to resolve the case.though we reject the first of these arguments and harbor considerable skepticism as to the second,we ultimately agree that this case warrants colorado river abstention 
a.the probate exception 
it has been said that t he probate exception is one of the most mysterious and esoteric branches of the law of federal jurisdiction.dragan miller,cir.once more unto the breach 
the probate exception is a doctrine stemming from the original conferral of federal equity jurisdiction in the judiciary act of.the ambit of that jurisdiction,coterminous with that exercised by the framers contemporaries in the english courts of chancery,did not extend to probate matters.markham allen.the supreme court accordingly held in markham that federal courts have no authority to interfere with the probate proceedings or assume general jurisdiction of the probate or control of the property in the custody of the state court.id.
yet stating the probate exception has proven easier than applying it.umsted umsted,cir.after markham,just what would constitute interfere nce with the probate proceedings proved notoriously difficult to pin down.when we last had the opportunity to consider the doctrine nearly a decade ago,we acknowledged that the precise scope of the probate exception has not been clearly established.mangieri mangieri,cir internal brackets omitted.
since then,the supreme court has revisited the issue and illuminated matters somewhat.in marshall marshall,the court explained that 
the interference language in markham is essentially a reiteration of the general principle that,when one court is exercising in rem jurisdiction over a res,a second court will not assume in rem jurisdiction over the same res.thus,the probate exception reserves to state probate courts the probate or annulment of a will and the administration of a decedent estate it also precludes federal courts from endeavoring to dispose of property that is in the custody of a state probate court.but it does not bar federal courts from adjudicating matters outside those confines and otherwise within federal jurisdiction.
d citations omitted.marshall made clear that the scope of the probate exception is distinctly limited.id.at.mooney mooney,cir noting that the supreme court in marshall also emphasized the narrow scope of the domestic relations exception.
the case before us does not fall within that limited scope.w here exercise of federal jurisdiction will result in a judgment that does not dispose of property in the custody of a state probate court,even though the judgment may be intertwined with and binding on those state proceedings,the federal courts retain their jurisdiction.lefkowitz bank of,cir.the only property at issue in this case is the proceeds from the sale of the isabela beach court units and the penthouse apartment on which allegedly held an option to purchase.because neither the money nor the apartment are yet part of the decedent estate,neither are yet in the custody of a puerto rico probate court.indeed,the very relief sought here is enlargement of the decedent estate through assets not currently within it.while divvying up an estate falls squarely within the probate exception,merely increasing it does not.gustafson zumbrunnen,cir finding that the probate exception did not apply because the judgment sought would just add assets to the decedent estate rather than reallocat ing the estate assets among contending claimants or otherwise interfer ing with the probate court control over and administration of the estate.
we review a district court rule determinations for abuse of discretion.picciotto cont l cas,cir.because the decision to dismiss for lack of an indispensable party involve s the balancing of competing interests and must be steeped in pragmatic considerations,id.at internal quotation marks omitted,we will reverse only if the district court makes an error of law or relies significantly on an improper factor,omits a significant factor,or makes a clear error of judgment in weighing the relevant factors.id.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
rule is designed to protect the interests of parties who are not yet involved in ongoing litigation.to measure how critical those interests are,the rule instructs courts to engage in a analysis.see pujol shearson am,cir.parties should be joined,when feasible,if they are necessary to the action according to the criteria laid out in rule a if a necessary party can not be joined in the action without divesting the court of jurisdiction,rule b lays out additional criteria for determining whether that party is indispensable.if the court finds that party is anything less than indispensable,the case proceeds without her.if,on the other hand,the court finds that the litigation can not proceed in the party absence,the court must dismiss the case.see fernandez hnos,kellogg usa,cir.
ultimately,the unsettled state of governing puerto rico law hampers our ability to adjudicate this issue definitively.assuming for the purposes of argument that the district court exercised its discretion properly in finding that the heirs were necessary parties under rule a,we proceed directly to the indispensability analysis under rule b.see delgado plaza las americas,cir per curiam noting that parties can not be indispensable under rule b unless they are first deemed necessary under rule a.the critical question in the rule b context is whether in equity and good conscience the action may proceed in the necessary party absence.fernandez,at quoting fed.civ b.to answer that question,the district court must consider four factors specified in the rule 
the extent to which a judgment rendered in the person absence might prejudice that person or the existing parties the extent to which any prejudice could be lessened or avoided by a protective provisions in the judgment b shaping the relief or c other measures whether a judgment rendered in the person absence would be adequate and whether the plaintiff would have an adequate remedy if the action were dismissed for nonjoinder.
the district court emphasized the first and third factors,finding that a judgment rendered in the heirs absence could potentially prejudice their interests.it reasoned that since each heir possesses a right to part of estate,any ruling on the sums due to the estate under the alleged contract would affect each heir individual portion.in order to adequately protect his or her interest in that portion,each heir was therefore entitled to participate in the litigation,even to the point of eliminating federal diversity jurisdiction.
we are not so sure.in puerto rico,the decedent undivided estate is known as a community of property.see,gonzalez tirado,d.on several occasions,the federal district court for the district of puerto rico has interpreted puerto rico law to provide that an individual participant in a community of property does not impair other participants interests merely by asserting common legal rights to the property while the other participants are absent.any judgment in favor of one or more participants benefits all other participants in a community of property whereas an adverse judgment only prejudices the one who filed the judicial action.id.internal quotation marks omitted accord rivera rios,wl,at,aqueduct sewer,d,cintron san juan gas,d.in,a rule challenge to a survivorship action,the court went on to hold that a favorable judgment to the individual heir litigating in federal court will be dispositive of the survivorship claim and benefit the absent heirs.however,an unfavorable judgment will only prejudice her and not the absent heirs,who still will have available the suit filed in state court wherein they asserted the survivorship claim.d at see also,wl at,d at cintron,d at.
taking these cases at face value,as the plaintiffs urge us to,it appears that the federal suit here is something of a free shot for the heirs.success inures to their benefit while failure is costless.surely there can be no impairment when they stand to lose nothing.if the plaintiffs are providing a correct statement of the local law,they would appear to be the best of all possible representatives for the absentees interests the kind that may very well help but can not hurt.see tell,at if an absent party interests are the same as those of an existing party,and the existing party will adequately protect those interests,this bears on whether the absent party interest will be impaired by its absence from the litigation.
at this juncture,however,we can not state this proposition as anything other than a conditional hypothetical.the plaintiffs interpretation of puerto rico community property law is far from certain.to begin with,the cases on which the plaintiffs rely sound exclusively in tort.seizing on this,the defendants have urged us to limit the applicability of those cases to wrongful death and survivorship actions.when pressed at oral argument,the plaintiffs could not cite a single authority suggesting that their interpretation of the relevant law extends to contract claims.
this puts us in an awkward position.on the one hand,we would find it somewhat strange if the rule did indeed govern actions yet had failed to produce any reported decisions to that effect.it is hard to say that the district court abused its discretion when the ostensible abuse is a matter of unsettled law.on the other hand,none of the four cases that the plaintiffs cite facially limits itself to tort claims.those cases draw their logical force not from any idiosyncrasy in puerto rico tort law,but from puerto rico law.this may make the defendants argument a good candidate for a distinction without a difference.contractual proceeds due to the decedent belong to the undivided estate just as much as a wrongful death judgment.all things considered,we have an insufficient basis to accept either the plaintiffs or the defendants readings of the case law.
a second difficulty remains.suppose that the plaintiffs here are successful in securing some monetary damages under the contract,but not the full amount that they seek.does that constitute a successful judgment sufficient to bind the heirs under the plaintiffs theory of the law,or is it instead an adverse judgment that would leave those heirs free to double down in the second suit the plaintiffs do not attempt to answer this question,and,unaware of any authority one way or the other,neither can we.
in sum,we are ill equipped to rule on this question of puerto rico law.as this question may very well determine the heirs indispensability here,we are equally ill equipped to rule on the ultimate question of joinder.under different circumstances,we would consider certifying the underlying question to the supreme court of puerto rico.see stiefel,cir.as the next section makes clear,though,that consideration is obviated by the parallel litigation ongoing in the commonwealth court.
colorado river abstention 
it has long been established that the presence of parallel litigation in state court will not in and of itself merit abstention in federal court.see mcclellan carland.stanton embrey.concurrent jurisdiction over the same controversy does not generally lessen the federal courts virtually unflagging obligation to exercise the jurisdiction given them.river,at.at the same time,the supreme court in colorado river acknowledged that this obligation is not infinite.in special cases,the pendency of a similar action in state court may merit federal abstention based on considerations of wise judicial administration that counsel against duplicative lawsuits id.internal brackets and quotation marks omitted.this fourth category of abstention has come to be known as the colorado river doctrine see fuller ramon gil,cir observing that colorado river created a fourth category of abstention beyond the three traditional branches.
the crevice in federal jurisdiction that colorado river carved is a narrow one.of all the abstention doctrines,it is to be approached with the most caution,with o nly the clearest of justifications warranting dismissal.river,at.our authority to find such a clear justification is confined by an test,moses cone mem l hosp.mercury const,d,whose list of factors we have drawn from colorado river and its progeny 
whether either court has assumed jurisdiction over a res the geographical inconvenience of the federal forum the desirability of avoiding piecemeal litigation the order in which the forums obtained jurisdiction whether state or federal law controls the adequacy of the state forum to protect the parties interests the vexatious or contrived nature of the federal claim and respect for the principles underlying removal jurisdiction.
rio grande cmty.health ctr.rullan,cir.no one factor is necessarily determinative a carefully considered judgment taking into account both the obligation to exercise jurisdiction and the combination of factors counseling against that exercise is required.river,at.furthermore,the decision whether to dismiss a federal action because of parallel litigation does not rest on a mechanical checklist,but on a careful balancing of the important factors as they apply in a given case,with the balance heavily weighted in favor of the exercise of jurisdiction.moses cone,at.unsurprisingly,the cases that satisfy this test are few and far between.
yet those cases,though exceptional,do nevertheless exist.river,at.from time to time,we have exercised our discretion or affirmed the lower court exercise of its own discretion to decline jurisdiction under colorado river,notwithstanding the presumption in favor of assuming jurisdiction.see,cir currie group ins.comm n,cir liberty mut.ins,cir.
in our view,this is such a case.applying the factors,we conclude that while some are neutral to our inquiry,the balance of them strongly favors abstention.we begin with the neutral factors,which may be summarized quickly.the federal and puerto rico forums are equally convenient second factor the puerto rico forum is well equipped to protect the parties interests sixth factor,see united states fairway capital,cir holding that the adequacy of the state forum is relevant only when it would disfavor abstention there is nothing vexatious or contrived about the plaintiffs federal lawsuit seventh factor and removal jurisdiction is irrelevant here eighth factor.
so far,so good.but the sum of the other four factors convinces us that deference to the commonwealth court is the appropriate result here.the first factor,the involvement of a res,tilts toward abstention due to the plaintiffs claim for the penthouse apartment in isabela beach court.though the plaintiffs characterize this as a suit over monetary damages,both versions of the complaint request the court to enforce the decedent alleged option on the apartment.there is therefore a possibility for inconsistent dispositions of property 
the third factor,avoidance of piecemeal litigation,also favors abstention,although it requires a bit more explanation.the piecemeal litigation to be avoided is something more than just the repetitive adjudication that takes place in all cases implicating colorado river doctrine.concurrent jurisdiction over the same action will necessarily involve some degree of routine inefficiency that is the inevitable result of parallel proceedings.villa marina yacht sales,hatteras yachts,cir.that inefficiency was not significant to the supreme court decision in colorado river and has not contributed to any of this circuit subsequent case law.were it otherwise,courts could abstain in any diversity action that overlapped with a action.piecemeal litigation must instead refer to some additional factor that places the case beyond the pale of duplicative proceedings.put differently,a duplication of effort,while wasteful,is not exceptional.gentron johnson agencies.
we have therefore held that 
d ismissal is not warranted simply because related issues otherwise would be decided by different courts,or even because two courts otherwise would be deciding the same issues.rather,concerns about piecemeal litigation should focus on the implications and practical effects of litigating suits deriving from the same transaction in two separate fora,and weigh in favor of dismissal only if there is some exceptional basis for dismissing one action in favor of the other.
kps,designs by fmc,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the canonical example of such an exceptional basis is a clear federal policy in favor of unified proceedings pursuant to a federal statute that is at issue in the case.see.river,at.finding abstention appropriate because the federal law at issue evinced a clear policy against piecemeal adjudication of river system water rights moses cone,at.finding abstention inappropriate because the federal arbitration act requires piecemeal litigation if necessary to give effect to an arbitration agreement.but there are other reasons why the piecemeal litigation factor might loom large in a given case.on multiple occasions,we have found an exceptional basis that counsels in favor of abstention,even though no particular federal policy was in play.see,at holding that in light of the many underlying unresolved issues of puerto rican law,it would be better to avoid piecemeal litigation currie,at finding a risk of piecemeal litigation that rises above routine inefficiency where parallel case was already on appeal and involved an issue of state law which could moot or otherwise inform the federal litigation liberty mut.ins,at finding an exceptional basis where there existed a real possibility that an insurance policy might be interpreted differently in each forum,leaving the insured with insufficient coverage after years of paying premiums.
we think the potential implications of proceeding in federal court without the heirs provides the requisite exceptional basis here.the absence of the additional heirs in the federal action means that in all likelihood the district court would be unable to resolve the defendants contractual liability to them if the case is allowed to continue.the district court could determine the defendants obligations to the diverse heirs,but the defendants would need to look to the commonwealth court to determine their obligations to the heirs under the same contract.the commonwealth action,by contrast,includes all of the heirs and can therefore comprehensively adjudicate the defendants liability.this disparity in inclusiveness thus creates a greater practical risk of piecemeal litigation than the baseline inefficiencies of the average exercise of concurrent jurisdiction.recognizing this,other circuits have found colorado river abstention more appropriate when parties are joined in the action but not the federal action.see sto lancaster homes,cir federated rural ins,cir cont l cas.robsac,cir,overruled on other grounds,gov t employees ins.dizol,cir.we agree.this potential for fragmented adjudication,to be distinguished from merely duplicative adjudication,warrants consideration in the colorado river analysis 
we move next to the fifth factor,whether state or federal law controls,which weighs particularly heavily here.not only does the dispute here turn entirely on issues of puerto rico law,see liberty mut.ins,at finding it significant that no federal issues are raised and no federal interest would be served by retaining jurisdiction over the case,but the issues that wo
