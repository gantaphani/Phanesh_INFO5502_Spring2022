plaintiffs,home buyers who hired chicago title trust company to record their home deeds and mortgages,sued chicago title claiming that it violated b of the real estate settlement procedures act respa,b,by unlawfully splitting fees with the cook county recorder.chicago title charged francisco and barbara echevarria to record their deed and to record their mortgage.this charge did not match the cook county recorder fees.the county recorder required to record the echevarrias deed,but only to record their mortgage.chicago title pocketed the overcharge.similarly,chicago title charged bobbie hall to record her deed and to record her mortgage.while the cook county recorder charged to record hall deed,it only required to record her mortgage.again,chicago title kept the extra.
the echevarrias and hall filed a complaint in federal court.they styled their only federal claim under respa b,accusing chicago title of splitting this amount with the cook county recorder by paying the recorder its fee and pocketing the overage.further,plaintiffs brought two state law fraud claims,which we do not address.plaintiffs then filed a motion to have the case certified as a class action.
less than a month later,chicago title asked the court to dismiss the suit under.b and b.chicago title argued that plaintiffs failed to state facts tending to prove that chicago title gave an unearned fee to a third party or received an unearned fee from a third party,an essential element of the respa claim.as support,chicago title relied on durr intercounty title,cir cert.denied,d,in which we held on very similar facts that the challenged behavior did not constitute fee splitting under respa b.believing himself to be bound by this precedent,the district judge dismissed the respa claim.in addition,he dismissed both state law claims because the parties were not diverse and,absent the respa claim,the court lacked jurisdiction.we affirm the district court dismissal.
we review de novo a dismissal for failure to state a claim.see transit express,ettinger,cir citation omitted.dismissal for failure to state a claim is proper only where the court is convinced,beyond a reasonable doubt,that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief.see szumny american,cir citation omitted.we accept factual allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.see transit express,at citation omitted.
plaintiffs appeal the dismissal of their claims,taking two approaches.first,they attempt to distinguish their case from durr and argue that they stated facts showing illegal fee splitting.second,they contend that even if they failed to state facts showing a splitting of fees,their claim should not have been dismissed because fee splitting is no longer an element of respa b.plaintiffs reason that since the events in durr,hud eliminated this element by amending regulation x,and issuing two opinion letters and one special information booklet to that effect.
durr intercounty title 
respa b states 
no person shall give and no person shall accept any portion,split,or percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a real estate settlement service in connection with a transaction involving a federally related mortgage loan other than for services actually performed.
b.plaintiffs and chicago title read the statute quite differently.chicago title urges that to avoid dismissal,plaintiffs must state facts showing that chicago title either received unearned fees from or paid unearned fees to a third party,here,the county recorder.this is the position we took in durr,at.chicago title argues that because it received the extra money from plaintiffs and kept these overcharges itself,rather than sharing them with a third party,there was no split.plaintiffs,however,focus on the whole chicago title charged as the purported mortgage filing fees.according to plaintiffs,the was illegally split when chicago title paid a third party,the county recorder,a portion of the fees and,and retained the overcharges and for itself.plaintiffs attempt to distinguish their situation from that in durr.
the facts in durr are virtually identical to the facts in this appeal.in durr,intercounty title company charged the plaintiff to record the deed and to record the mortgage of his new home,amounts which,after subtracting the county recorder fees and intercounty charge,resulted in an overcharge of roughly.see at.intercounty pocketed this overage.see id.at.because intercounty did not give unearned fees to or accept unearned fees from a third party,we held that intercounty merely received a windfall and did not violate respa b when it pocketed the overcharge.see id.we did not count the county recorder as a third party for purposes of respa b because it had no involvement whatsoever with the unearned fees.we reached the same result in mercado calumet fed.sav.loan ass n,cir affirming the dismissal under.b of a respa b claim because the complaint did not allege that the defendant gave or received any portion,split,or percentage of any charge to a third party.
we are unable to distinguish the case at hand from durr.as in that case,plaintiffs have failed to plead facts tending to show that chicago title illegally shared fees with the county recorder.the cook county recorder received no more than its regular recording fees and it did not give to or arrange for chicago title to receive an unearned portion of these fees.the county recorder has not engaged in the third party involvement necessary to state a claim under respa b.
plaintiffs also cite to united states gannon,cir en banc cert.denied,d,in which we held that under certain circumstances,one party could act as both the giver and acceptor of an illegal split for respa purposes.in gannon,an employee in the county recorder office,acting in his capacity as the county agent,charged banks a gratuity for prompt service in addition to the regular filing fee and pocketed the tip.see id.at.we found that these gratuities were an unearned regular portion of recording fees charged by the employee in his official capacity and accepted by him in his individual capacity.see id.at.the case at issue,however,is easily distinguished from gannon.here,chicago title collected the fees from plaintiffs in its capacity as a title company and retained the overcharges in that same capacity.we can not employ a legal fiction to treat chicago title as both the giver and third party receiver of unearned fees because it acted in the same legal capacity when it overcharged plaintiffs and when it retained the monies in excess of the recording fees.
plaintiffs further direct our attention to a respa b case that a district court refused to dismiss because the plaintiffs successfully marshaled evidence showing a split.see christakos intercounty title.christakos is also distinguishable.in christakos,intercounty title was responsible for handling the paperwork associated with refinancing a home loan.see id.at.the bank holding the initial mortgage agreed to file the paperwork to release the mortgage,but intercounty title charged the plaintiff to have the mortgage released twice,once by the bank and once by intercounty.see id.at.the court found that plaintiffs alleged a split because intercounty shared the fee with a third party,the bank.see id.at.the district court made a point of stating 
the weight of seventh circuit case law requires payment to a third party to trigger b to the extent plaintiff argues to the contrary,that any unearned fee violated respa,she is wrong and her argument is rejected.
id.at.there is no third party in the case before us.because plaintiffs fail to accuse a third party of accepting unearned fees,durr compels the dismissal of their respa claims.
this result makes sense considering not only respa plain language,but its intended purpose.we stated in durr 
at its core,respa is an statute.mercado calumet fed.sav.loan ass n,cir.its purpose is to prohibit all kickback and referral fee arrangements whereby any payment is made or thing of value is furnished for the referral of real estate settlement business.id.quoting senate report
