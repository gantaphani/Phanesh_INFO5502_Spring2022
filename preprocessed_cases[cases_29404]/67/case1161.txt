this appeal concerns the constitutionality of an ordinance enacted by the city of gary city affecting sexually oriented businesses.in a thorough and well reasoned opinion,magistrate judge rodovich granted summary judgment for the city on the declaratory judgment action filed by some of the businesses affected by the ordinance.we affirm.
the city adopted the challenged ordinance the ordinance on december.its preamble states the city concern that sexually oriented businesses,among other things,have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them.by enacting the ordinance,the city desire d to minimize and control these adverse effects and thereby protect the health,safety,and welfare of the citizenry and deter the spread of urban blight.the intent of the ordinance,the preamble states,is to enact a content neutral ordinance which address the secondary effects of sexually oriented business while not suppress ing any speech activities protected by the first amendment of the constitution.in support of its findings,the ordinance cites a number of federal cases dealing with similar laws affecting sexually oriented businesses and eighteen reports detailing the secondary effects of these businesses.
the ordinance defines sexually oriented business broadly,including a number of businesses separately defined by the ordinance,which,generally speaking,means all manner of adult bookstores,arcades,novelty stores,theaters,and dancing establishments.it includes operating hours of to,seven days a week,and a prohibition on any physical contact between employees appearing in a condition,dancers and customers.it also has an requirement,which prohibits the placement of doors,curtains or other materials on viewing booths so that an employee of the business is able to look into it at all times.the ordinance also contains numerous sanitation provisions,including a prohibition on rugs or carpet,a requirement of,easily cleanable surfaces,and waste disposal procedures,as well as other obligations for employees,such as ensuring that no sexual activity occurs on the premises.
all sexually oriented businesses covered by the ordinance are required to obtain a license.once an application is filed,the city comptroller shall immediately issue a temporary license to the applicant,which only expire s upon the final decision of the city to deny or grant the license.the ordinance requires that a permanent license be issued,unless the applicant is below the age of,the applicant fails to provide,or provides false information on the application,the fee is not paid,the applicant has committed certain violations of the ordinance within the last year,or the physical premises of the business do not comply with the ordinance requirements.a license can be suspended on the basis of a knowing violation of the ordinance,and revoked if a knowing violation occurs within twelve months of a suspension.
denial,suspension,or revocation of a license only occurs after a hearing at which the aggrieved party has the opportunity to be heard.if any adverse action is taken,the party must be notified of the right to appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction.during the pendency of any such appeal,the city must issue the aggrieved party a provisional license,which allows the business to stay open until final judgment is rendered by a court.
ii.analysis 
we review the district court summary judgment ruling de novo,viewing all material disputes of fact in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.moser.dep t of,cir.the plaintiffs arguments on appeal rely upon the first amendment,fourth amendment,and indiana law.
first amendment 
the plaintiffs argument can be organized as follows the ordinance discriminates on the basis of content,and,therefore,should be analyzed under strict scrutiny even when analyzed under lesser,intermediate scrutiny,the city has not met its burden of justifying the ordinance and that the ordinance acts as an impermissible prior restraint on speech.
to assess whether the ordinance violates the first amendment,both parties echo the district court analysis by relying on the analytical framework set forth by city of los angeles alameda books,d,and city of renton playtime theatres,d.the alameda line of cases deal with zoning ordinances aimed at dispersing adult entertainment businesses throughout a community,which are considered time,place,and manner restrictions.alameda books,at.plurality opinion.another line of supreme court cases,however,uses the intermediate scrutiny test of united states,d,to review public indecency statutes,which are considered laws affecting expressive conduct.see city of erie pap,d plurality opinion barnes glen theatre,d plurality opinion.
there is some confusion about which line of cases should be used in evaluating laws like the ordinance,which do not fall neatly into either category.see ben bar,village of somerset,cir expressing uncertainty as whether to analyze an adult entertainment liquor regulation as a time,place,and manner restriction under alameda or as a regulation of expressive conduct under pap barnes citing lleh,wichita county,texas,cir.and for most cases,it may not matter which test is employed.id.noting that the analysis between the two lines of cases may be entirely interchangeable.the crucial analytical step of both tests is the same which is to say,that under both lines of cases,intermediate scrutiny is applied if the challenged law is found to be either content neutral or for the purpose of decreasing secondary effects.see alameda books,at.kennedy,concurring a zoning restriction that is designed to decrease secondary effects and not speech should be subject to intermediate rather than strict scrutiny,city of rockford,cir o nly after confirming that a zoning ordinance purpose is to combat the secondary effects of speech do we employ renton intermediate scrutiny test.pap at.plurality opinion we now clarify that government restrictions on public nudity such as the ordinance at issue here should be evaluated under the framework set forth in for restrictions on symbolic speech.
we need not choose between either line of cases nor need we rule that the differences between them are immaterial because both parties proceed under the general framework of alameda,which we will employ,while referring to other case law as appropriate,as the parties do moreover,all of the issues raised by plaintiffs are clearly controlled by the court precedents or ours,and,therefore,our resolution of the issues would be same under either line of cases.
secondary neutrality 
the plaintiffs argue that the ordinance does not regulate the secondary effects of speech,but,rather,directly regulates speech this determination is crucial,because if the ordinance only combats secondary effects of otherwise protected speech,then it is considered the equivalent of content neutral,and,therefore,need only survive intermediate scrutiny.see alameda books,at.kennedy,concurring,at.pap at.plurality opinion explaining that restrictions on public nudity are content neutral and should be analyzed under intermediate scrutiny.
our inquiry in this regard is best conceived as one into the purpose behind an ordinance,at citations omitted.our task is to verify that the predominant concerns motivating the ordinance were with the secondary effects of the adult speech,and not with the content of adult speech.alameda books,at.plurality opinion quoting renton,at.federal courts evaluating the predominant concerns behind the enactment of a n ordinance may do so by examining a wide variety of materials including,but not limited to,the text of the ordinance,any preamble or express legislative findings associated with it,and studies and information of which legislators were clearly aware,at citing ben bar.
a review of those materials makes clear that the ordinance is directed toward secondary effects.the ordinance emphasizes that its purpose is to control the adverse effects of sexually oriented businesses and the reports before the council primarily addressed secondary effects.plaintiffs provide nothing of relevance in response.one argument
