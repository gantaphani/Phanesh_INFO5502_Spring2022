jay reifert claims that the defendants violated the sherman act by tying access to a real estate service mls to membership in a realtors association.the district court granted summary judgment for all defendants in this case,finding no competition in the tied market and therefore,no antitrust violation.
for the following reasons,we now affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
realtors association of south central wisconsin,rascw is a real estate trade association.its members are real estate agents and appraisers in and around madison,wisconsin.rascw offers a variety of products and services to its members,including lobbying,social functions,courses,referral programs,contract forms,conventions,publications,and legal information.
rascw is associated with the wisconsin realtors association and the national association of realtors nar.when a person pays membership dues to an association affiliated with nar,that person becomes a member of nar.normally,realtors association memberships are packaged as a group including local,state,and nar memberships.
rascw owns of the stock in the south central wisconsin mls scwmls.the mls or multiple listing service is a computerized database of homes and properties listed for sale by scwmls participants in wisconsin.access to this multiple listing service is a necessity for real estate agents and appraisers in this area.virtually all active residential real estate agents in the region subscribe to scwmls.users are charged a quarterly fee to gain access to the full database and must be a member of a realtors association affiliated with nar.the realtors association membership requirement has existed for more than fifty years.generally,any licensed real estate professional who agrees to abide by the nar code of ethics and pays the applicable fees is admitted.
article of nar code of ethics contains a rule.this article and the related standards of practice prohibit members from inducing sellers to breach listing contracts,advising sellers of superior services or prices during the time they are under contract with another realtor,and using information received through a multiple listing service to target clients of other realtors.
a board of directors sets dues for rascw.fees for scwmls are also set by members elected to a board of directors.both organizations set their fees solely to cover operational costs,with no intent.annual dues to join the nar,wisconsin association of realtors,and rascw are approximately a year.
the plaintiff,jay reifert,brings three claims against scwmls,rascw,and the directors of scwmls.first,he alleges that scwmls unlawfully ties its services to rascw.second,reifert alleges that by conditioning access to mls service on membership in rascw,an unlawful group boycott has occurred.finally,reifert alleges that article of the nar code of ethics violates the section i of the sherman act,by prohibiting competition.
reifert,is a residential real estate broker,exclusively representing buyers of real estate in south central wisconsin.reifert has been a member of rascw or its predecessor and a participant in scwmls or its predecessor since.reifert belongs to the national association of exclusive buyer agents naeba and has no desire to maintain membership in rascw or the state and national association of realtors.reifert objects to the fees he is forced to pay for unwanted services and the code of ethics he must follow to maintain his membership in rascw and nar.
reifert claims that during the four years at issue in this action,he has paid dues in excess of for an unwanted rascw membership to maintain his scwmls access.during the relevant period,there have been approximately annual and total scwmls participants.
to support an antitrust action,a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant actions have restrained competition.section i of the sherman act states,every contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states is declared to be illegal.the supreme court has long recognized that congress intended to outlaw only unreasonable restraints,not all contracts in restraint of trade.see state oil khan,d citations omitted.the clayton act allows for private suits by individuals injured by violations of antitrust laws.see.
on august,the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants and denied summary judgment to the plaintiff.a tying arrangement violates federal antitrust statutes if it has a substantial effect on interstate commerce.the district court found that there is insufficient evidence for a fact finder to find that a tie between the defendant multiple listing service and realtor membership has had an effect on interstate commerce as that element has been defined by the supreme court.
as to reifert group boycott claim,the district court again found that the plaintiff had failed to prove any anticompetitive effects resulting from the tying of realtors association memberships to mls services.accordingly,the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,taking all facts in the light most favorable to the party.see,mccoy harrison,cir citations omitted.an award of summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.c celotex catrett,d.
tying claim 
reifert claims that the defendants have engaged in an unlawful tying arrangement by limiting scwmls access to members of a relators association.thus,the alleged tying product is scwmls and the alleged tied product is membership in a realtors association.
in determining whether a violation of section i of the sherman act,has occurred as a result of a tie between two products or services,this court requires the plaintiff to prove four elements.see carl sandburg vill.condo.ass first condo.dev,cir citing imposition of the economic interest requirement by courts in the second,third,fourth,fifth,sixth,ninth,and eleventh circuits.
in order to establish the per se illegality of a tying arrangement,a plaintiff must show that the tying arrangement is between two distinct products or services,the defendant has sufficient economic power in the tying market to appreciably restrain free competition in the market for the tied product,and a not insubstantial amount of interstate commerce is affected.pac.ry.united states,d moore jas.matthews,cir.in addition,this circuit has held that an illegal tying arrangement will not be found where the alleged tying company has absolutely no economic interest in the sales of the tied seller,whose products are favored by the.mattress sealy,cir,cert.denied,d warner mgmt.consultants,data.
following this precedent,the district court correctly required reifert to prove the following four elements of a tying violation a tie exists between two separate products the tying seller scwmls has sufficient economic power in the tying product market to restrain free competition in the tied product market realtors association memberships the tie affects a amount of interstate commerce in the tied product realtors association memberships and the tying seller scwmls has some economic interest in the sales of the tied product realtors association memberships.id.at 
there is no question that reifert has satisfied the requirements for the first two elements.first,access to the service can not be obtained without purchasing the tied product,a realtors association membership.second,scwmls has sufficient market power to restrain free competition in the tied product market.
scwmls is a unique product.nearly every available home in the relevant geographic area is listed on the service.the market information created by scwmls is the result of a requirement that members place all listings in the mls within five days.the mls allows individuals with access to search and filter properties based upon detailed criteria including compensation offered to buyers agents,detailed property information,neighborhood information,prior sales history,offers made on the property,days on the market,and the sale price of comparable homes.the features and information available through scwmls are not available through any other service.in addition,the mls service targets a different estate agents and free listing services or newspapers.in short,it is impossible to perform the tasks of a real estate agent or appraiser in the relevant geographic area without using scwmls.thus,it possesses sufficient market power to restrain competition.
the third element of the sandburg test states that a tying arrangement violates antitrust law only if a substantial volume of commerce is foreclosed because of the tie.jefferson parish hosp.dist.hyde,d.this element can be broken into two is there at least one competitor in the tied product market other than the favored seller and is the quantity of interstate commerce affected 
the district court found no competition in the allegedly tied market for realtors association memberships.where there is no competition in the tied market,there can be no antitrust violation.forcing a buyer to purchase a product he otherwise would not have purchased is insufficient to establish the foreclosure of competition.id.w hen a purchaser is forced to buy a product he would not have otherwise bought even from another seller in the tied product market,there can be no adverse impact on competition because no portion of the market which would otherwise have been available to other sellers has been foreclosed.
despite reifert desire to avoid purchasing a realtors association membership,without evidence of competitors in the market for services offered by the realtors association,there can be no foreclosure of competition.see mattress sealy,cir phillip areeda herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law ed.when there are no rival sellers of the tied product to be foreclosed,then the alleged might affect a substantial volume of commerce in the tied product and yet not foreclose anyone.the district court correctly found that despite the laundry list of entities submitted by the plaintiff,there were no competitors in the tied product market.
products and services are in the same market when they are good substitutes for one another.the outer boundaries of a product market are determined by the reasonable interchangeability of use or the of demand between the product itself and substitutes for it.brown shoe united states,d.
this court requires that a plaintiff prove that products are good substitutes using economic evidence a conclusory assumption of competition where products or services appear to be similar is insufficient.see menasha news am.mktg,cir.actual data and a reasonable analysis are necessary to demonstrate that a product or service is a good substitute for another.economics,like the other social sciences,has its share of counterintuitive findings,so observing things that to the untutored eye seem to be substitutes need not mean that they are good substitutes.id.
other federal courts have held that conditioning access to a service on membership in a realtors association is not indicative of an unlawful tying arrangement.see wells real estate,greater lowell bd.of realtors,cir long island bd.of realtors.buyer corner realty,no.ass of realtors,d.one federal court has held that a tied real estate association group faced competition and therefore created an unlawful tie as explained below,however,we find that case distinguishable.see thompson metro,cir.
reifert argues that by comparing participation in realtors associations in areas where mls services are open to individuals who have not joined a realtors association with so called closed areas that require membership in a realtors association,he can demonstrate that agents have been forced to purchase realtors association memberships.this comparison is unreliable,however,because it fails to speak to the central question of whether a competitor exists in this particular closed market and does not account for other possible explanations for the observed differences.forcing individuals in reifert position to purchase a product they do not want is not a violation of antitrust law.see jefferson parish hosp.dist,at.
even without an economic analysis,it is apparent that rascw lacks competition.each of the twelve organizations cited by reifert fails to qualify as a competitor to the national or local realtors association

the district court relied heavily upon the first circuit decision in wells real estate.we believe that decision effectively captured the central flaw in reifert argument.
the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate the slightest market for membership in real estate boards that might have been affected by the defendants alleged tying arrangement.there is no evidence that any other broker would have purchased membership in any other board but for the power exerted by the lure of the defendants mls.there is no evidence that a substantial volume of commerce in board membership was foreclosed by the.the tying claim must fail absent any proof of effects in the market for the tied product.

while the organizations the plaintiff named may provide important services,they simply do not compete with rascw or any other realtors association.these niche associations lack elasticity with the national and local realtors associations,and have dissimilar purposes.these organizations are unlikely substitutes for a realtors association in wisconsin.
instead of providing the district court with the required economic analysis,reifert employs a old decision from this court,beatrice foods ftc,cir,to frame his discussion of competition.beatrice foods relied upon the supreme court decision in brown shoe,at,and set forth several practical indicia to determine a market boundaries.these indicia are the industry or public recognition of the submarket as a separate economic entity,the product peculiar characteristics and uses,unique production facilities,distinct customers,distinct prices,sensitivity to price changes,and specialized vendors.beatrice foods,at.while the practical indicia named in brown shoe and beatrice foods are important considerations in defining a market,they were never intended to exclude economic analysis altogether.both opinions recognized the importance of economic analysis,including elasticity of demand.see brown shoe,at.the outer boundaries of a product market are determined by the reasonable interchangeability of use or the of demand between the product itself and substitutes for it.see also beatrice foods,at.
this court has emphasized the use of economic analysis in the law.to demonstrate competition in an antitrust case,the plaintiff must provide an economic analysis of the relevant market.see,menasha,requiring economic evidence to prove the existence of a distinct market.lacking any economic evidence,reifert has failed to show that the tying arrangement has foreclosed any portion of the market for real estate services.
the facts of the instant case stand in contrast to the situation analyzed by the eleventh circuit in thompson.the defendants in thompson operated an mls system and tied mls access to membership in a realtors asso
