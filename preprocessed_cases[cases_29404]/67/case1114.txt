flying j purchased acres in new haven,indiana in the hopes of constructing a travel plaza and various other developments,including hotels and restaurants,on that land.unfortunately,the new haven plan commission was not as sanguine about the development plans,and after two adverse zoning decisions flying j sued new haven in indiana state court.after losing in the trial court,flying j prevailed on appeal,and the indiana supreme court decision not to review the case made flying j victory final.the victory proved to be,however.as the state court litigation was winding down,new haven amended its zoning ordinance and limited all service stations such as flying j travel plaza to two acres in size.needless to say,flying j proposed development was not permitted under the amended ordinance.flying j then filed suit in federal court,alleging that new haven actions violated their rights to equal protection and due process.new haven then filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,charging that the case was not ripe,and a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.the district court found that the controversy was ripe and thus that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the case,but granted the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.
flying j appeals this decision,and for the following reasons we affirm the district court dismissal.
background 
flying j develops travel plazas,facilities that offer food,fuel,groceries,financial services,and other services to truck drivers and other travelers.flying j was planning on constructing a new travel plaza on acres that flying j purchased in new haven,indiana.the land is designated as a p general commercial planned district,which permits a variety of uses including automobile service stations,stores,businesses,general retail,food service,motels,and various other uses.flying j proposed use of the site would include a acre travel plaza and room to expand with other developments,including hotels and restaurants.
to start the development process,in flying j made a presentation to brian yoh,the plan director and zoning administrator for the city of new haven.yoh determined that some of the proposed uses were not permitted in property with a zoning designation,and he informed flying j of this fact shortly after they gave their initial presentation.displeased,flying j appealed to the board of zoning appeals,which affirmed yoh decision.flying j then took the matter to the indiana state courts.the circuit court of allen county granted summary judgment for the board of zoning appeals on september.flying j then appealed to the indiana court of appeals,and in that court reversed the circuit court and instructed it to enter summary judgment for flying j,concluding that yoh and the board of zoning appeals had erroneously ruled that some of flying j proposed uses were not permitted in property zoned.the board of zoning appeals unsuccessfully filed petitions for rehearing and for transfer to the indiana supreme court,and the appellate court decision became final on may.
in light of this ruling,flying j representatives met with yoh and other city officials in late and to discuss how they could move forward with their development plans.at this time,and unbeknownst to flying j,the city of new haven was moving forward with plans to amend the zoning ordinance in a way that would eliminate flying j plans to construct a service center on the property.the amendment limited service stations in property zoned to two acres,an amendment that apparently would not affect any of the existing service stations in the area.the city plan commission conducted a public hearing on the change on february but did not give flying j specific notice of the hearing.the common council of the city of new haven voted to adopt the amendment on february.flying j,once again,was not given notice of this meeting.at a third meeting two weeks later,the common council again voted to adopt the amendment.again,flying j did not receive notice of the meeting.
flying j in fact learned about the ordinance through litigation,when the zoning board filed a motion to correct error with the circuit court,claiming that flying j proposed use was permitted only under the old zoning plan,in effect when they first applied in,but not the new zoning plan.the circuit court denied this motion,but nevertheless in august,yoh informed flying j that its application for development of its acre tract in new haven must comply with the amended zoning ordinance.
on appeal,flying j makes additional factual allegations,which they claim are consistent with the general tenor of the complaint and thus are appropriate to add at the appellate stage.these facts allege conflicts of interest on the part of ronald steinman,a member of the new haven common council who voted for the amended ordinance,and michelle hill,a member of the board of zoning appeals.according to the allegations,both separately own parcels of land near the acres that flying j is planning to develop.flying j argues that its proposed development would affect the value of the property owned by hill and steinman,and that this conflict explains new haven vigilance in attempting to stop the development of the travel plaza 
on september,flying j filed suit in federal court alleging that the city of new haven,yoh,and the city mayor,terry mcdonald collectively new haven had violated its rights to substantive due process,procedural due process,and equal protection under both the united states constitution and the indiana constitution,and seeking declaratory relief and damages.new haven responded by filing a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,arguing that flying j was actually positing a takings clause claim that was not yet ripe,and an alternative motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under rule b.on april,the district court granted the city rule b motion.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
this appeal involves two issues.first,new haven challenges the subject matter jurisdiction of this court,arguing that flying j constitutional claims are actually takings claims,and that because flying j has not gone through the process for receiving compensation from the city for the alleged taking the claim is not ripe.flying j challenges the district court dismissal of the case under rule b for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.we take each argument in turn.
whether the district court improperly assumed subject matter jurisdiction over the case in violation of the ripeness requirements of williamson county regional planning commission hamilton bank.
as an initial matter,new haven argues that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the case because flying j is really asserting a takings claim cloaked as an equal protection claim,and that because flying j has not exhausted its zoning application or its state remedies the case is not ripe.the supreme court decision in williamson county regional planning commission hamilton bank holds that in land use cases a claim that the application of government regulations effects a taking of a property interest is not ripe until the government entity charged with implementing the regulations has reached a final decision regarding the application of the regulations to the property at issue,d.even in cases where a developer proposed use is clearly at odds with local zoning ordinances,the developer must first seek a variance in the local zoning laws and then pursue whatever state court remedies are available before filing a takings claim in federal court.id.at.the rationale for this rule is that t he fifth amendment does not proscribe the taking of property it proscribes the taking of property without just compensation.id.at.if a state has a procedure in place to compensate landowners for takings,regulatory and otherwise,then the property owner fifth amendment rights have not been violated until the state process is completed and the owner has still been denied just compensation.id.at.
this circuit has read williamson county broadly,rejecting attempts to label takings claims as equal protection claims and thus requiring ripeness.forseth vill.of sussex,cir.this circuit also applies the ripeness requirements to most claims labeled as substantive due process or procedural due process claims.id.however,courts in this circuit have recognized an exception for bona fide equal protection claims,and held that,in some circumstances,land use cases raising equal protection issues are not subject to williamson county ripeness requirements.id.at.litigants making these claims,however,must place them into one of two categories,pleading either the malicious conduct of a government agent,in other words,conduct that evidences a spiteful effort to get him for reasons unrelated to any legitimate state objective or circumstances,such as prayer for equitable relief and a claim that would evaporate if the government body treated everyone equally that sufficiently suggest that the plaintiff has not raised just a single takings claim with different disguises.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
new haven raises this issue in their reply brief,after raising it in their motion to dismiss to the district court.the city argues that because flying j has not applied for a variance or gone through the state procedures for seeking compensation for the taking,the issue is not ripe for review and accordingly this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.flying j responds that the district court determined that the ripeness requirements of williamson county did not apply and that because new haven did not the issue they are precluded from bringing it up here.this last assertion is incorrect,however,because ripeness when it implicates the possibility of this court issuing an advisory opinion,is a question of subject matter jurisdiction under the requirement.wisconsin,shannon,cir.the point of williamson county is that there is no case or controversy within the meaning of article iii until the plaintiff has pursued all available remedies in state court,since zoning boards are capable of granting variances from the challenged zoning ordinance,and local authorities are capable of granting compensation.see sprint spectrum city of carmel,cir.new haven argument thus concerns this court subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal.we are obliged to consider that at any point in the litigation.wisconsin nation,cir.
accepting all facts as true,however,it appears that flying j has presented a bona fide equal protection claim.flying j alleges that new haven has engaged in costly and protracted litigation in an effort to draw out the application process for flying j,covertly passed an amended zoning ordinance that invalidated the results of the litigation after the city lost,and that it wrote the ordinance in such a way that it would only affect flying j and no other service station owners in the area.flying j has also presented additional allegations to the appellate court,arguing that various members of the common council and the plan commission have conflicts of interest because they own parcels of land around the proposed development.without passing judgment on the ultimate viability of these allegations,they are sufficient to allege that the ordinance was passed because of or malice toward flying j,and thus fit within the first of the two categories of bona fide equal protection violations.
new haven claims that recent decisions from this circuit,most notably patel city of chicago,cir,have further narrowed the window of equal protection claims.patel recognized the validity of bona fide equal protection claims,however.id.at.the opinion did hold that if a plaintiff only alleges an equal protection violation based on depressed property values,and the parties file suit primarily for relief from the operation of eminent domain powers,then their claim is properly labeled a takings claim rather than an equal protection claim.id.however,while the plaintiffs in patel alleged that the city ordinance singled out their parcels for acquisition through eminent domain,this court was uncertain about the precise sort of equal protection claim that the plaintiffs in that case were raising.id.at t hey appear to be claiming that the ordinance is a law that rests on wholly irrational distinctions,presumably between their properties and all others in the city.or they may in part be asserting the type of equal protection claim that arises when a party is subject to a spiteful effort to get him for reasons wholly unrelated to any government objective.internal citations omitted.we concluded,based on the asserted injury and the requested relief,that the plaintiffs were essentially asserting a takings claim recast as an equal protection claim.id.at.
the complaint in this case,however,more definitely alleges the sort of conduct that evidences a spiteful effort to get him that serves as an exception to the ripeness requirements of williamson county.specifically,flying j alleges that the city has improperly denied its development plan and covertly drafted,noticed and passed an ordinance that denies the company the right to develop its property in order to void the result of earlier indiana court case.the complaint thus alleges the sort of and spiteful conduct that brings this case within the ambit of forseth exception to the requirements of williamson county.accordingly,we affirm the district court determination that the ripeness requirements of williamson county do not apply to the present case.
whether the district court properly dismissed the case for failure to state a claim under rule b.
the next issue is whether the district court properly dismissed the suit for failing to state a claim under rule b.the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim after concluding that flying j had not pled sufficient facts to overcome the presumption of rationality attached to government action and accordingly had not pled the elements of its class of one equal protection claim.in so doing,the district court went through a analysis.first,the district court claimed that in assessing a class of one equal protection claim at the rule b stage,the court should presume the rationality of the law.wroblewski city of washburn,cir.the district court then proceeded to analyze the possible justifications for the ordinance,in particular the need to control the secondary impact of large service stations.the district court concluded that while this particular amendment to the zoning ordinance was adopted in response to flying j plans to construct a travel plaza on the land it had purchased in new haven,such a generally applicable zoning amendment could be adopted because of a single proposed development,board of commissioners of jay county,cir.the district court then proceeded to flying j complaint,and determined that rather than provide facts that negated any rational basis for the amendment,flying j had proceeded under the theory that the amended zoning ordinance was adopted out of animus for flying j and its development plans,and as a way for the city to avoid the consequences of the indiana court of appeals decision.the district court concluded,however,that because of this court precedent in lauth mccollum,cir,evidence of animus was insufficient to negate the hypothesized justifications for the zoning ordinance,and accordingly that flying j had not pled sufficient facts to overcome the presumption of rationality that accompanies the city action.
flying j now argues that the district court committed three errors when dismissing the case.first,the district court incorrectly applied the standard from flying j claims applies only to public employment cases and only at summary a rule b motion.second,the district court incorrectly assumed the truth of facts offered to establish the rational basis for the zoning amendment while ignoring evidence that the law was enacted to single out flying third,the district court ignored the facts from the complaint that established an unequal enforcement claim that is,that the amended zoning ordinance was only enforced with respect to flying j in addition to their unequal enactment claim.
new haven argues that the district court correctly applied lauth,because that case created
