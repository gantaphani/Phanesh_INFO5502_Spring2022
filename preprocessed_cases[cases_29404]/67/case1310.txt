after a fire of incendiary origin destroyed their house,jon and renea brawner sued allstate indemnity company for denying a claim on a homeowners insurance policy.allstate asserted that the brawners coverage was void because they made several material misrepresentations during allstate fire investigation.a jury in a first trial found in favor of allstate,but the district court granted a new trial.at a second trial,a jury found for allstate on the misrepresentation defense.the district denied the brawners renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial.we affirm.
as of may,the brawners resided at dakota drive in conway,arkansas.their house burned in a fire on may.renea brawner had acquired the house during her marriage to michael young.renea kept the house after she divorced young and married jon brawner in.when the fire struck,the property was titled in the names of michael young and renea young.allstate insured the property against fire loss through a policy issued to jon and renea brawner.allstate investigator concluded that the fire was the result of arson.
regions bank regions held a first mortgage on the property,based on a loan that renea brawner obtained during her marriage to young.the veterans administration va guaranteed the mortgage loan,which apparently meant that regions was protected against the loss of principal if the brawners defaulted.jon brawner was not an obligor on the loan,but the brawners assumed responsibility for the payments.at the time of the fire,the brawners had failed to make a mortgage payment since december,when they paid the amount due for october.they did not make the payment due for november or any payments after that point.as a result,before the house burned,regions initiated a foreclosure proceeding.the house was to be sold in a foreclosure sale on may.
before the fire,regions bank retained the law firm of dyke,henry,goldsholl winzerling dhg w to pursue the foreclosure.beginning with letters dated march,dhg w sent notices of the foreclosure through both certified and mail to several addresses and to several addressees.most of these notices were returned to dhg w undelivered,but five mailings were not.one notice dated march,and sent via mail to tenants at dakota drive,was not returned.four letters dated april,and addressed to the brawners post office box also were not returned.in addition to the mailings,dhg w published notice of the default in the arkansas newspaper and posted the notice at the faulkner county courthouse.
four days after the fire,allstate representative holly goodwin took recorded statements from the brawners as part of a standard fire claim investigation.the brawners suggested that they had an agreement to sell the house to jon business associate,ben eagles,and another individual for cash,and that the va had permitted the brawners to defer their recent mortgage payments until the time of the sale.they also asserted that closing on the sale was imminent.jon brawner stated that he believed that they were only a couple of months in arrears on their mortgage payments.on the same day,goodwin visited the faulkner county courthouse to check the deed on the property.there,she discovered the notice of foreclosure.
in subsequent examinations under oath,the brawners each denied knowledge of the foreclosure at the time of the fire.at his examination,jon brawner stated that he had filed what he called an addendum with the va in order to defer the mortgage payments.
on november,after an investigation led by claims adjuster sandra hendrick,allstate denied the brawners claim.the brawners filed this action in the district court,alleging several common law causes of action.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of allstate on all of the claims except breach of contract.at trial,allstate alleged that the insurance coverage was void because the brawners were responsible for the arson and had made several material misrepresentations.the jury found for the brawners on the arson defense but for allstate on the misrepresentation defense.the district court granted the brawners motion for a new trial,reasoning that evidence and argument concerning alleged arson by the brawners may have influenced the jury decision on the misrepresentation defense.
prior to the second trial,which focused solely on the misrepresentation defense,the district court ruled that the brawners would recover on their breach of contract claim if allstate failed to prove the defense.after this court decision in warren state farm fire casualty,cir,the district court denied the brawners motion for summary judgment on the misrepresentation defense,but called it a close question,and opined that warren was difficult to reconcile with willis state farm fire casualty,cir.the jury at the second trial again found for allstate on misrepresentation.the district court denied the brawners renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law and,in the alternative,for a new trial.
on appeal,the brawners contend that they are entitled to a new trial,because the district court erred in admitting four hearsay documents over their objections.in addition,they maintain that the district court erred in denying their renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law.finally,because the jury returned a general verdict in favor of allstate,the brawners argue that this court must reverse if we determine that allstate failed to prove any of the four alleged material misrepresentations.
we review the district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion,disregarding any error that does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.see mcpheeters black veatch,cir.a.we review the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo.structural polymer group,zoltek,cir.in doing so,we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,allstate,and affirm unless no reasonable juror could have reached the same conclusion.id.
the brawners first evidentiary argument is that the district court erroneously admitted two documents from regions foreclosure file.both documents were prepared by the va and then sent to regions,which kept them in its foreclosure file for the brawners residence.defendant exhibit is an unsigned acknowledgment dated february,informing regions that the va was on notice of regions intent to foreclose.defendant exhibit is a form letter dated april,and signed by va employee charles bunkers.the letter imposed a deadline by which regions was required to complete the foreclosure.although the relevance of the documents was not well articulated at trial,allstate apparently offered the two documents to prove that the va had notice of the foreclosure but did not inform regions of an alleged deferral of payments that the va supposedly granted to the brawners.both were introduced through regions foreclosure supervisor tonia moore.
according to the brawners,the district court erred in admitting exhibits and under rule of the federal rules of evidence because moore,an employee of regions,could not lay a proper foundation.the brawners assert that rule,the business records exception to the hearsay rule,requires that a representative of the entity that created the document testify for foundation.
hearsay evidence is inadmissible except as provided by the federal rules of evidence or other rules prescribed by the supreme court.rule provides that the hearsay rule does not exclude a memorandum made at or near the time by a person with knowledge,if kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity,and if it was the regular practice of that business activity to make the memorandum,report,record or data compilation,all as shown by the testimony of the custodian or other qualified witness.
although this court has not addressed the precise argument raised here by the brawners,we have established that the custodian or other qualified witness need not have personal knowledge regarding the creation of the document offered,or personally participate in its creation,or even know who actually recorded the information.resolution trust eason,cir internal quotation omitted see also united states franks,cir.several other courts have held that a record created by a third party and integrated into another entity records is admissible as the record of the custodian entity,so long as the custodian entity relied upon the accuracy of the record and the other requirements of rule are satisfied.see united states adefehinti,s everal courts have found that a record of which a firm takes custody is thereby made by the firm within the meaning of the rule air land forwarders,united states,united states childs,cir united states duncan,cir.we agree with these courts and hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that allstate was not required to produce an individual from the entity that prepared the record to establish a foundation.
tonia moore provided an adequate foundation for exhibits and under rule.regions integrated the documents created by the va into the brawners foreclosure file.moore testimony established that regions relied on the accuracy of the documents.she testified that exhibit,the acknowledgment of regions intent to foreclose,informed regions that it could begin the foreclosure process.the brawners do not dispute that allstate established that the documents were kept in the course of regions regularly conducted business.accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting exhibits and.
the brawners next contend that the district court erred in admitting two documents from allstate files.defendant exhibit is a letter dated september,from sandra hendrick of allstate to attorney david waldrop.in the letter,hendrick asked waldrop to request information from regions regarding the brawners payment history and to obtain a statement or examination under oath.she also discussed information that she had learned in the investigation.defendant exhibit is a printout of an electronic mail message dated october,from brenda ganem,waldrop secretary,to hendrick.in the message,ganem wrote i just spoke with crystal fortier at dhg w.fortier told me that she has a note in her file saying that on may,john sic brawner called and spoke to her.he told fortier that the house had burned.because hendrick was on medical leave during the trial,allstate introduced both documents through richard read,an allstate employee who worked in the same capacity as hendrick.the district court admitted each document as a business record.
the brawners argue that the district court erred in admitting exhibits and under rule for several reasons.according to the brawners,richard read failed to provide an adequate foundation because he never testified that the documents were kept in the course of allstate regularly conducted business activity.the brawners also contend that the documents were not kept in the course of regularly conducted business,because both were the products of allstate preparation for litigation.
we doubt that allstate laid an adequate foundation under rule for exhibits and.although allstate counsel asserted at a bench conference that the exhibits were documents from allstate file created in the course of investigating the brawners claim,richard read testimony is insufficient to establish whether either was kept in the course of regularly conducted business or whether,in fact,the documents were prepared in anticipation of litigation.
it is not clear that these exhibits contained hearsay,as opposed to evidence of what information allstate relied upon in its investigation,see ferguson united states,cir crimm.pac,cir,but assuming for the sake of argument that the evidence was inadmissible,we conclude that any error was harmless.the brawners contend that the admission of exhibit was prejudicial,because it said that renea brawner was supposed to get the loan changed into her name after her divorce from michael young but failed to make the request.this,according to the brawners,erroneously implied that renea had engaged in wrongdoing.they assert that the admission of exhibit was prejudicial because it helped establish that jon brawner had notice of the foreclosure before speaking with allstate investigators.we disagree.
exhibit,the letter from hendrick to waldrop,contains mostly insignificant information regarding the investigation and a request for assistance from waldrop.the statement regarding renea brawner alleged failure to change the loan into her name,even if erroneous,is not pertinent to the disputed issues at trial.the danger that a jury would find against the brawners on the misrepresentation defense because renea failed to update the loan information is too speculative to warrant setting aside the verdict.exhibit,the message from ganem to hendrick,was indeed evidence that jon brawner had notice of the foreclosure before he denied having notice of the same in his statement to holly goodwin.but crystal fortier of dhg w testified regarding the same may phone call with jon brawner,so exhibit was largely cumulative.accordingly,there is no reversible error.see hall am.bakeries,cir.
the brawners next challenge the district court denial of their motion for judgment as a matter of law.they contend that allstate presented insufficient evidence that their statements during the investigation were misrepresentations.allstate alleged at trial that the brawners misled its investigators regarding the extent of the mortgage payment arrearage,their knowledge of the foreclosure at the time of the fire,the purported sale of the house,and the alleged deferral of payments by the.the brawners also argue that even if there were proof of misrepresentations,allstate failed to prove that each misrepresentation related to a material fact or circumstance.
under arkansas law,the language of the insurance contract governs whether an insurer may withhold coverage on the basis of the insured allegedly false statements.see warren,at.the brawners policy stated that allstate d id not cover any loss or occurrence in which any insured person has concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance.appellant app.the district court instructed the jury,without objection,that to sustain its defense,allstate was required to prove that the brawners knowingly and intentionally concealed from allstate or misrepresented to allstate material facts or circumstances prior to allstate denial of the insurance claims,all with the intent to defraud allstate.see warren,at.
allstate offered evidence of several false or misleading statements made by the brawners during the investigation of the fire.when asked by holly goodwin on may,whether they were current on their mortgage and whether their payments were up to date,renea brawner answered that the last few payments were deferred for the sale of the house,which was supposed to close on the day after the fire.when asked essentially the same question,jon brawner replied,i believe we are a couple months behind or so.he went into some detail regarding the purported sale,asserting that a contract was signed approximately thirty days earlier.jon stated that it was a agreement to sell the property for,buyer to pay closing costs.he later added that it was a cash deal and that eagles had cash on hand and a line of credit,and that the only thing that was pending was getting us out,more or less.
the tenor of the brawners statements did not change at their subsequent examinations under oath.at her examination on july,renea was asked if she was aware of the planned sale of the house,and she answered yes.she stated that she would know the details regarding the financial shape they were in at the time of the fire,but acknowledged that they were behind on a couple of things,including their mortgage payments.she denied knowing at the time of the fire that the property was in foreclosure.when confronted with information that they had been seven months behind on payments at the time of the fire,renea brawner stated that she knew it was probably more than a couple months,but was unsure of the extent of the arrearage.
at his examination on september,jon was asked again about the arrearage,and he stated that he believed that they were three months in arrears at the time of the fire.he asserted that he had filed an addendum with the va abo
