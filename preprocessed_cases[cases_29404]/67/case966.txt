this case presents a familiar question in our circuit whether a plaintiff in ohio may proceed directly in federal court based on an alleged unconstitutional taking of his private property by a government entity,or whether he must first exhaust ohio state remedies.we hold that state exhaustion is required,regardless of the nature of the taking,in keeping with this court recent decisions in coles granville,cir and mcnamara rittman,cir.because plaintiff river city capital has failed to exhaust its state avenues for relief,the case is not ripe for review,and thus we vacate the order of the district court in all respects,save one minor issue that was collateral to the merits.
the majority of the facts in this case are not in dispute.on july and,there was a rain in clermont county,ohio,resulting in a flood emergency for the area.a large sinkhole began to develop at eastgate south drive,a property located in an area known as the eastgate square development.the eastgate south drive parcel is owned by river city capital,an ohio limited partnership.river city leases the property to the twins group,llp.the twins group is a franchisee of pizza huts of cincinnati,and operates a pizza hut restaurant on the property.the river city property lies between two parcels,one to the west containing a furniture store called oak express,and one to the east containing a mcdonald restaurant.the three contiguous properties are bordered on the north side by route a state road,and on the south side by eastgate south drive formerly a private road,now dedicated to the county.
a few weeks after the heavy rains,several interested parties attended a meeting to discuss responsibility for repair of the sinkhole.present at the meeting were gayle jacobs,river city property manager carl hartman,the clermont county engineer two representatives from the twins group a representative from a company called and the construction manager for oak express.by the time of the meeting,the sinkhole had enlarged to eighteen feet in diameter and was encroaching on the oak express property.the twins group and oak,the two tenants on the affected to hire and pay to investigate whether the sinkhole had been caused by a stormwater pipe running underneath the two properties.yet when jacobs spoke with the twins group about paying for any necessary repairs,twins group representatives specifically disclaimed responsibility beyond what they were paying for the investigation.
no repairs were made to the sinkhole,and on october,water backed up onto and flooded eastgate drive,forcing the county engineer to close the road.this prompted the prosecuting attorney for clermont county to send a letter to the twins group,dated november.the letter stated in relevant part 
i t is our understanding that the clermont county engineer has shared with you the fact that we searched the records and found no dedication to public use pertaining to the storm sewer easement as it runs across the following three parcels 
therefore,we are of the opinion that clermont county has no legal obligation to maintain,upgrade,repair such easement as it runs across the three parcels.
until the recent flooding occurred,we believed the situation to be a private matter.however,we are now concerned with the possible damage to the road and its underlying structures.in addition,we are concerned about issues of public safety and welfare.
consequently,we must insist that you take immediate action to repair the storm sewer system.we intend to hold you responsible for any and all damages resulting from this problem.
on november,in response both to the county prosecutor letter and to the fact that its pizza hut property was in danger,river city retained nixco plumbing to repair the damage.nixco discovered that a diameter stormwater pipe,located immediately under the river city property,had corroded and collapsed.the collapse had caused a shift in the large concrete vault to which the pipe was connected.the weight of the vault had then crushed and destroyed a portion of another pipe,this one coming from underneath the oak express property and connecting to the river city pipe via the vault.nixco replaced portions of both pipes and reoriented the concrete vault.the entire apparatus was buried approximately thirty feet underground.nixco also had to repair portions of oak express underground gas and sanitary sewer lines.when this was completed,nixco refilled the sinkhole with new soil,resurfaced the parking lot,and hired to install new power lines and a light pole that were damaged by the sinkhole.river city paid for the repairs.
the concrete vault and stormwater pipe flowing northward out of the vault comprise the funnel for a watershed.in other words,the river city property is the low point of the watershed,and thus almost every drop of stormwater runoff must at some point pass beneath it.approximately of the watershed runoff collects in a large retention pond south of eastgate south drive.the water is then released in controlled fashion from the retention pond through pipes underneath the oak express property,ultimately connecting via a pipe to the concrete vault.the remaining of the watershed runoff flows through a pipe underneath the mcdonald,ultimately connecting to the opposite side of the concrete vault after flowing out of the concrete vault and northward through the pipe along the river express boundary line,stormwater is released into pipes underneath state route,and these municipal pipes eventually empty the water into a lake.
on april,river city filed a complaint in federal district court against clermont county,stating the following causes of action taking of property without just compensation in violation of the fifth and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution denial of due process in violation of the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution nuisance and claim for writ of mandamus,a writ ordering the county to take responsibility for all subsequent repairs to the stormwater pipe on the river city property.
river city takings claim is a novel one.its primary allegation is that clermont county caused a taking by permitting commercial development on adjacent land and requiring the owners of that land to provide private storm water drainage,and further by requiring the owners to do so by diverting storm water into river city private storm sewer,at.second,river city argues that because the county took over responsibility for two roads in the south drive and eastgate square a dedication plat in,and because this responsibility included maintenance of the stormwater pipes under the roads,therefore the county allowed the storm water runoff from its streets to discharge into river city storm sewer,which caused its collapse,and that amounts to a taking.id.at.finally,river city argues in the alternative that the dedication actually effected a transfer of river city reciprocal easement to the public that is,the dedication transferred responsibility for the stormwater pipes under the river city property from river city to the county.id.at.the nub of river city takings claim was perhaps best encapsulated by anthony nickert,general partner of river city,during his testimony at trial 
w e have a piece of property that approximately one acre,and i learned during the last couple months,that or acres drain into this pipe and that all of a sudden we have become responsible for that pipe,all that other drainage that goes in there.we put a trickle into that pipe it not moral that they would expect me to bear the burden of all that water coming through that pipe on our property.
the county filed two motions in response first,to exclude river city proffered expert witness for failure to comply with disclosure provisions under fed civ.and second,to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction because river city had failed to file the proper proceeding in state court prior to initiating its fifth amendment takings claim in federal court.on december,the district court denied both motions.
in examining the county motion to exclude,the district court noted that river city had failed to comply with rule a b within the deadline set by the court.expert disclosures were due on july,but it was not until over three weeks later,on august,that river city provided its disclosures in rule form.river city did supply an expert report prior to the deadline,on july,but river city concedes that this report was deficient under rule.the district court then determined whether river city should be sanctioned for its undisputed failure to comply with rule.the court held that exclusion of river city proffered expert would be inappropriate under.c because river city failure to meet some of the technical requirements of rule in timely fashion was ultimately,clermont county was not prejudiced because it still had ample time to prepare for its deposition of river city expert.however,the district court imposed a monetary sanction on river city,ordering it to pay the incurred by the county in preparing its motion to exclude and its supporting briefs,at the court does not condone river city disregard of the expert disclosure provisions of the federal rules of civil procedure.
as to the motion to dismiss,the district court followed this court guidance in kruse village of chagrin falls,ohio,cir,which suggested that for regulatory takings,a plaintiff must first exhaust state remedies assuming they exist,whereas for physical takings,a plaintiff may file suit directly in federal court.id.at see also buckles columbus muni.airport,cir unpublished w here the landowner simply one day finds his land physically invaded and his title transferred against his will,and yet the government refuses to pay up despite explicit requests,he need not go through dickensian formalities to confirm the government obvious intentions.drawing a parallel to this circuit taking by flooding cases,see cox tennessee valley,cir,the district court ruled that river city allegations more clearly fit within the strictures of a physical takings claim,at,and it allowed river city claim to proceed.
the matter proceeded to a bench trial,held on august and.on september,the district court issued an opinion and order,ruling in favor of clermont county on all counts.on the takings claims,the court ruled that river city had failed to prove that the county had in any way invaded or taken river city property.the court similarly dismissed river city due process claims,holding that they were subsumed within its failed takings claim.
river city now appeals,citing nineteen issues for review,including the nebulous any other error as evident from the record.appellant br.at.river city nineteen issues appear to be no more than a request to review the district court decisions in their entirety.we will therefore take the liberty of focusing our review on the following two conclusions reached by the district court that river city takings claim was ripe for federal court review and that river city should be subject to sanction,in the form of attorney fees,for its failure to comply with the expert disclosure provisions of.
ripeness subject matter jurisdiction 
among its many other proscriptions against government infringement on individual rights,the fifth is made applicable against the states and their subdivisions through the fourteenth nor shall private property be taken for public use,without just compensation.const.amend.v takings clause see also lingle chevron,d.read plainly,the takings conjunction with,the remedial statute with which it is often seem to provide a clear hook for federal question jurisdiction under article iii.in other words,it would seem that if a plaintiff properly alleges a taking of his private property by a municipality,he has a cognizable claim in federal court.although this is true,the supreme court has ruled that constitutional takings claims are not ripe for federal court review until state compensation procedures,assuming they exist and are adequate,have been exhausted 
the recognition that a property owner has not suffered a violation of the just compensation clause until the owner has unsuccessfully attempted to obtain just compensation through the procedures provided by the state for obtaining such compensation is analogous to the court holding in parratt taylor,d.there,the court ruled that a person deprived of property through a random and unauthorized act by a state employee does not state a claim under the due process clause merely by alleging the deprivation of property.in such a situation,the constitution does not require predeprivation process because it would be impossible or impracticable to provide a meaningful hearing before the deprivation.instead,the constitution is satisfied by the provision of meaningful postdeprivation process.thus,the state action is not complete in the sense of causing a constitutional injury unless or until the state fails to provide an adequate postdeprivation remedy for the property loss.hudson palmer,d.likewise,because the constitution does not require pretaking compensation,and is instead satisfied by a reasonable and adequate provision for obtaining compensation after the taking,the state action here is not complete until the state fails to provide adequate compensation for the taking.
williamson county reg l planning comm hamilton bank of johnson city,d.the critical lesson to be derived from williamson is that prior to exercising jurisdiction over a takings case,a federal court must first inquire into whether or not the relevant state compensation procedures are reasonable,certain,and adequate.mcnamara,at citing williamson,at.
in ohio,at least until recently,the inquiry into the adequacy of state compensation procedures was muddled at best,primarily because many other not have an inverse condemnation or other direct,statutory cause of action for plaintiffs seeking just compensation for a taking.coles,at emphasis added see also kruse,at.instead,ohio law provides for an action in mandamus to force a government actor who is seeking to take or who is actively taking private property to first bring an appropriation proceeding against the private owner.coles,at.the courts of this circuit had for many years been uncertain as to just how adequate a procedure this action in mandamus really was.see id.at recounting the relevant decisional history involving ohio takings cases.
fortunately,this uncertainty no longer exists,because the coles court conclusively resolved the williamson issue as follows 
today,ohio has reasonable,certain,and adequate procedures for plaintiffs to pursue compensation for an involuntary taking over the last ten years ohio courts,including the ohio supreme court,have consistently recognized mandamus as the vehicle with which to contest an involuntary taking,no matter whether that taking is a regulatory or a physical one,and no matter whether the public actor is a state or local entity.
id.at emphasis added.coles thus affirmed that the primary inquiry,at least for purposes of assessing ripeness,is whether or not an ohio takings plaintiff has fully exhausted his state mandamus remedies before coming to federal court.if he has,then the case is ripe for our review.if he has not,then it is not.coles further held that in assessing the ripeness of a takings claim,it is wholly immaterial whether the alleged taking is styled as physical or regulatory.this notion is consistent with the supreme court recent recognition in lingle that the line between physical and regulatory takings is fuzzy at best.for example,while there are several different paths of inquiry in regulatory takings cases,e ach aims to identify regulatory actions that are functionally equivalent to the classic taking in which government directly appropriates private property or ousts the owner from his domain.lingle,at.
the coles holding would also seem to comport with common sense,because determination of whether there was a taking in the first which is subsumed the inquiry into whether the taking was physical or regulatory is often heavily reliant on an interpretation of state law.and if a state court correctly determines that there was no taking to begin with,there would seem to be little reason for the federal takings clause even to apply.see,stewart sterk,the demise of federal takings litigation,mary,i f federal distric
