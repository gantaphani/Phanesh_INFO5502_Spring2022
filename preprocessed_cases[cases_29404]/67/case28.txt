for purposes of summary judgment,we recite the facts in the light most favorable to young as the nonmoving party.see collazo nicholson,cir.
young bought the property where she built her home in yarmouth port,massachusetts,in september of.nine years later,in september of,she refinanced the property,obtaining an adjustable rate mortgage arm of.wells fargo is the trustee of the trust that holds her mortgage and homeward the loan servicer.
faced with financial difficulties,young fell behind on her mortgage payments in and.in august of,she noticed a mortgage payment for that she sent homeward had not been processed.at that time,she also received a notice on her door stating that her mortgage payment was late,but that she could ignore the notice if she had made the payment.young called homeward and learned that homeward refused to process her payment because her account was in foreclosure.
young asked homeward how she could avoid foreclosure.after much back and forth,homeward offered to send young a forbearance agreement if she submitted an upfront payment of before september.young did so and,when she did not receive the promised agreement,called homeward on september.a representative told young,there is no agreement.young then spoke to a supervisor,maryann connor,who informed her that,had her check for been processed in august of,her account never would have been put into foreclosure.connor also told young that homeward was handling this situation incorrectly and was at fault for not processing the agreement.
homeward faxed young a forbearance agreement on september.the agreement provided that the total sum necessary to bring the loan current was and required,among other things,that young make monthly payments of whereas her mortgage provided for initial monthly payments of.young worried that she could not afford the increased monthly payments but nevertheless signed the agreement that same day.young tried to discuss the agreement with connor but was unable to reach her.young feared that,if she did not sign the forbearance agreement immediately,homeward would refuse to work with her.
young struggled to make payments under the forbearance agreement.several months after signing the agreement,young consulted with various lawyers and learned that a mortgage modification may be available through hamp,a federal program that provides incentives for loan servicers and lenders to give permanent loan modifications to struggling homeowners with the help of a paralegal,jerry desalvatore,she applied for a hamp modification.on october,homeward sent young a letter indicating that she was eligible for a mortgage modification through hamp.the letter indicated that young needed to comply with a trial period plan tpp to receive a hamp modification.the tpp required,among other things,that she make three payments of on or before november,december,and january.according to the tpp,young would receive a mortgage modification for which her first payment would be due on the first day of the month following the month in which the last trial period payment is due,or february.

on march,young received another letter from homeward indicating that homeward had received a payment for on january and would place these funds in a suspense account.the accompanying notice provided that the loan is being reviewed for a loan modification.during the loan modification review process,homeward does not post any payments to the loan or assess late charges,to ensure the modification agreement will reflect accurate figures from the loan.
on june,homeward sent young a traditional loan modification not a hamp modification.for the modification to take effect,young was required to submit a down payment of and make monthly payments of at an interest rate of until june,at which point the monthly payments would rise to and the interest rate to.young was required to submit the down payment and executed agreement,along with several requested documents,by june.young rejected the modification because she considered the terms unacceptable.she thought the modification was a significant departure from what the original agreement was and cited the very tight deadline to accept as problematic.she was disappointed not to have received a mortgage modification through hamp,which she felt would have had more favorable terms than the modification she received.
