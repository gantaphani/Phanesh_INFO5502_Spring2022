background 
factual background 
beztak,a michigan corporation,is one of three general and limited partners of dplp.defendants james blain and j j slavik,jj slavik,a michigan corporation owned and operated by defendant ronald slavik,are dplp other partners.harold beznos and jerry luptak are the principals of beztak.at all times relevant to the present case,dplp owned a acre parcel of undeveloped real estate in detroit located at atwater street,a site that borders the detroit river.the city of detroit,however,acquired the property by eminent domain during the pendency of this appeal.
in the spring of,luptak,acting on behalf of dplp,entered into negotiations with defendant herbert strather to explore the idea of developing a casino at atwater street.strather,a local realtor with political connections to many of the city defendants,had been working to have riverboat gambling approved in detroit.according to beztak,the dplp partners unanimously agreed that the likelihood of establishing a riverboat casino at atwater would be enhanced if dplp sold or leased the property to strather.no final deal,however,was ever reached between dplp and strather.
on july,defendants blain,slavik associates ii an entity also owned by ronald slavik,strather,and nellie varner entered into an agreement to form atwater entertainment associates,aea,for the purpose of developing a riverboat casino at atwater.strather responsibilities included campaigning for passage of a voter initiative that would allow riverboat gambling at atwater,promoting aea,venture to the general public,and financing any associated lobbying efforts.blain and slavik agreed to use their best effort to deliver atwater to aea.
detroit voters approved two initiatives the following month that related to the operation of casinos in the city.the city then enacted ordinances and,both of which repealed an existing ordinance that had prohibited casino gambling.ordinance also permitted the city to enter into a contract for the establishment of an indian tribal casino in the greektown area of detroit,whereas ordinance enabled the city to enter a contract for the development of a riverboat casino to be docked at atwater,a site that was designated the atwater recreation and entertainment district.the ability to develop the sites was subject to gaining the approval of michigan legislature and governor.
in november of,michigan voters approved proposal e,a state initiative that resulted in the michigan legislature enacting the michigan gaming control and revenue act.comp.laws.this act legalized casino gambling in detroit and allowed for the establishment of three casinos within the city limits.as a prerequisite to gaining approval to operate a casino,an applicant had to first enter into a certified development agreement with the city.according to beztak,the atwater defendants played a crucial role in drafting proposal e and placing it on the ballot.
dissension between beztak and its dplp partners was apparent by june of.on june,luptak,acting on behalf of beztak,sent a letter to the detroit city planning commission advising the commission that blain had no authority to speak on behalf of dplp.attorneys representing blain and jj slavik responded by faxing a letter to the commission on june,that explained that because blain and jj slavik constituted a majority of dplp partners,those partners,rather than beztak,had the authority to represent dplp and act on its behalf.
on june,the city enacted ordinance,which amended the detroit city code by adding article xiii,titled casino development competitive selection process the selection ordinance.the selection ordinance permitted the city to enter into three development agreements with casino operators,and it established a competitive selection process for the city to use in choosing the most qualified casino developers.detroit city code.in addition to setting forth the relevant criteria for evaluating the applicants,the selection ordinance provided a preference for developers who submitted a proposal that met the city criteria,generated the voter initiative that resulted in either ordinance or ordinance,and actively promoted and supported proposal id.two of the three casino operators ultimately selected by the city qualified for these preferences,although the mayor averred that the preference benefitted only the greektown casino developer.
shortly after enacting the selection ordinance,the city issued a request for.the described the process for applying to become one of the three casino developers.applicants had to pay nonrefundable fees of for phase one and for phase two of the selection process.
in july of,blain and jj slavik entered into a settlement agreement and release settlement agreement with all of the atwater defendants.the settlement agreement enabled blain and jj slavik to become members of aea the successor in interest to aea.all named defendants other than the city defendants signed a full and unconditional mutual release in connection with the settlement agreement.this release abandoned any claims that the signatories might have had relating to numerous transactions,including any attempts to sell atwater to aea or strather,and to develop a casino at atwater or elsewhere.during the same month that they executed the settlement agreement,blain and jj slavik wrote a letter on behalf of dplp to the city law department for the purpose of disclaiming any interest that dplp had in seeking a casino gambling license for atwater.
beztak filed a lawsuit in july of against blain and jj slavik that challenges their decisions to enter into the agreement that resulted in the formation of aea,and the settlement agreement.this lawsuit is currently pending,and it will eventually determine the respective rights and liabilities as between the partners of dplp.
eleven developers submitted proposals in response to the by the august,deadline for phase one of the application process.after reviewing the proposals,detroit mayor dennis archer issued a second to seven of the developers on august,when he invited them to submit a phase two proposal.mayor archer further narrowed the field of prospective developers on november,when he announced that three of the applications were eliminated,leaving four applicants competing for the three available casinos.finally,on november,mayor archer announced that defendant detroit entertainment,one of the atwater defendants,greektown casino,and mgm grand detroit,had been selected.
detroit entertainment is an entity that the atwater defendants formed in august of in response to the city for phase one.after gaining approval from the city,detroit entertainment submitted its application to the michigan gaming control board.the board issued detroit entertainment a casino license on december.
beztak claims that the reason it did not submit an application in response to the for phase one was that it believed the city selection process to be unconstitutional.as a result,beztak was not among the initial eleven applicants that mayor archer considered.beztak did,however,file an application with the city planning commission on august,seeking approval of an amended site plan for atwater.according to beztak,its application was supported by a detailed presentation for a permanent riverboat casino,prepared in conjunction with experienced casino architects and a prominent riverboat casino operator,and was a plan which dplp was ready,willing and able to implement.dplp other two partners,however,did not join in beztak application to the commission.
the commission rejected beztak amended site plan proposal because it was not submitted in accordance with the selection ordinance and the.moreover,prior to officially rejecting beztak proposal,the commission informed beztak that it would require formal documentation to show who was authorized to speak on behalf of dplp in light of the conflicting representations that had been made by dplp partners in june of.beztak never responded with such documentation.
procedural background 
this lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan in may of.according to beztak amended complaint,the selection ordinance and the city refusal to pick atwater as a casino site violated the equal protection and due process clauses of the fourteenth amendment,deprived beztak of its property without just compensation in violation of the takings clause of the fifth amendment,infringed on its first amendment rights to freedom of speech and freedom of political association,because the preferences were allegedly rewards for providing political support,and violated beztak state constitutional rights and state law.beztak also claimed that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy to violate beztak federal and state constitutional rights.
the city defendants filed their motion for summary judgment,pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,in december of.later that same month,the atwater defendants filed their motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,or,alternatively,for summary judgment.
beztak subsequently filed an affidavit seeking additional discovery,pursuant to rule f of the federal rules of civil procedure.in a letter sent to the parties in february of,the district court informed them that it saw no need to allow for additional discovery because the city defendants had accepted as true all of the factual allegations contained in beztak amended complaint for the purpose of the motion for summary judgment.
the district court granted the defendants motions in july of.according to the court,beztak lacked standing to challenge the city preference system because beztak never submitted a proposal to apply for a casino license and failed to demonstrate that it would have applied for a license even if the selection ordinance had not contained the elements that beztak alleged were unconstitutional.with regard to beztak remaining substantive claims,the court granted summary judgment in favor of the city defendants.the court concluded that ordinance did not obligate the city to develop a casino at atwater,and that even if such a promise had been made,subsequent city ordinances resulted in a de facto repeal of ordinance.in particular,the district court noted that ordinance,which was enacted in,established an special development district for casinos that did not include atwater,and repealed any conflicting ordinances.the city subsequently amended the boundaries of the casino district when it enacted ordinance in,which again did not include atwater within the revised district.finally,having found no merit to the substantive charges that formed the basis of beztak conspiracy allegations,the court dismissed the conspiracy counts for failure to state a claim.this timely appeal followed.

standards of review 
a district court dismissal of a complaint pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure is reviewed de novo.bloch ribar,cir.in considering a motion to dismiss,t he court must construe the complaint in a light most favorable to the plaintiff,and accept all of the factual allegations as true.id.a motion to dismiss under rule b should not be granted unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.buchanan apfel,cir quoting conley gibson,d.
as with a dismissal for failure to state a claim,a district court grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.holloway brush,cir.summary judgment is proper where no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.c.in considering such a motion,the court must view the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the central issue is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.
standing to assert claims 
neither the defendants nor the district court addressed whether beztak,as a minority partner of dplp,had standing to raise any of its claims against the third parties that negotiated with dplp.although beztak lacks a controlling interest in atwater because dplp rather than beztak owns the site,michigan law allows limited partners to bring derivative actions on behalf of the partnership if the general partners refuse or are unlikely to do so.comp.laws a limited partner may bring an action in the right of a limited partnership to recover a judgment in its favor if general partners with authority to do so have refused to bring the action or if an effort to cause those general partners to bring the action is not likely to succeed.adell sommers,schwartz,silver schwartz,noting that limited partners are authorized both to commence derivative actions on behalf of the partnership if the general partners refuse to do so and to pursue their individual claims.beztak,blain,and jj slavik are all general and limited partners of dplp.given that none of the defendants challenged beztak ability to assert dplp claims against third parties,we conclude that beztak had the authority to raise claims relating to atwater because dplp other partners refused or were unlikely to do so.
both the atwater defendants and the city defendants contend that beztak lacked standing to challenge the process for selecting casino developers because beztak never submitted a proposal in response to the city.according to these defendants,this precludes beztak from raising any of its claims that are based upon the selection of detroit entertainment,greektown casino,and mgm grand detroit.counts i,ii,vi,vii,and viii of beztak amended complaint,alleging violations of the equal protection clause,the due process clause,the first amendment,and the michigan constitution prohibition against special legislation,fall within this category.beztak,on the other hand,argues that it was fully capable of submitting a proposal,but chose not to do so because participating in the city selection process would have prevented it from being able to raise its constitutional claims.
to satisfy the constitutional requirement of standing,a plaintiff must establish three elements an injury in fact that is concrete and particularized a connection between the injury and the conduct at issue the injury must be fairly traceable to the defendant action and likelihood that the injury would be redressed by a favorable decision of the court.blachy butcher,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the injury about which beztak complains is the alleged preferential treatment accorded to detroit entertainment and the greektown casino.
