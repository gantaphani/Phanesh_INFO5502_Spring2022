ogle county joined the alternative energy bandwagon in when it adopted an amendment to its zoning ordinances to allow special use permits for the construction of windmills used to generate power.in,baileyville wind farms,llc baileyville took the county up on its offer by applying for and receiving a special use permit to construct windmills.
patricia muscarello evidently did not share the county enthusiasm for wind energy.muscarello owns land adjacent to the proposed site of the baileyville wind farm.she voiced her opposition through the political process and,when that failed,she repaired to federal court.at that point,this garden variety zoning dispute morphed into a federal case against defendants,including baileyville,its corporate parents,and the various ogle county political actors involved in the decision to grant the permit.muscarello complaint invoked twelve theories of recovery,based on the constitution,the illinois constitution,illinois statutes,and the common law.in addition to objecting to the process that the county had followed,she attacked everything in the outcome or anticipated outcome from the loss of kinetic energy,to what she calls shadow flicker,to the risk of a blade being hurled onto her property.
the district court concluded that it could not reach the merits of her suit.instead,it held that the federal court was not the proper forum in which her claims could be resolved.we agree.baileyville and its corporate parents have from the district court refusal to impose a stay of administrative proceedings that might or might not have been commenced at the time the court ruled in ogle county.finding no abuse of discretion in that ruling,we affirm it also.
we rely primarily on muscarello first and second amended complaints for this account of the pertinent facts,although we have added some undisputed material from the remainder of the record where necessary.
in late,after a public hearing held by the zoning board of appeals the zba,the ogle county board of commissioners the board adopted an amendment to the county zoning ordinances providing that special use permits would be available for systems that use wind energy and thereby reduce dependence on fossil fuels the windmill text amendment.
in september,baileyville applied for a special use permit to build a system on land in ogle county adjacent to patricia muscarello property.two other muscarellos are involved in this case patricia muscarello was represented by her son,charles muscarello,and she sued,among others,her husband,marco muscarello.for simplicity we refer to patricia muscarello as muscarello and,where necessary,we refer to her husband as marco muscarello.baileyville intended to construct windmills,each of which was to be approximately feet in height to the tip of the blade and feet in diameter.the application specified the locations of the windmills on the property.
some time between november and december,the zba held public hearings on baileyville application.on december,the zba issued its findings of fact in support of the application.on december,the board issued the special use permit and adopted a home sellers property value protection plan the protection plan to provide a mechanism for residential property owners to recover any diminution of value that resulted from the windmills if and when they decided to sell their homes.nonresidential property owners were not eligible to take advantage of this procedure.
muscarello objects to every stage of the process.on january,she filed her original complaint,in which she objected to the findings of fact for the windmill text amendment,the baileyville permit application,the notice for the public hearing,the public hearing itself,baileyville evidence at the hearing,the findings of fact for the special use permit,the decision to issue the permit,and the authorization of the protection plan.at the core of her substantive allegations is an assertion that the county has condoned an impermissible taking of her property.muscarello presented a laundry list of charges in her first amended complaint as she describes it,the issuance alone of the permit will harm her in numerous ways 
i she will be deprived of the full extent of the kinetic energy of the wind and air as it enters her property.
ii she will be deprived of the full extent of the accessory use under division,section n of the zoning ordinance.
iii her property will be subject to shadow flicker and reduction of light caused by the wind energy conservation system.
iv she will have to endure severe noise caused by the wind energy conservation system.
v ice may be physically thrown onto her property by the rotating blades.
vi there is risk of what she calls blade throw,meaning that she fears that the rotor blades may come loose and be thrown onto her property.
vii the windmills will cause radar interference on her property.
viii the windmills will interfere with the reception on her cell phone network.
ix the windmills will disturb her gps service.
x her property will be subject to wireless communication interference.
xi the system will interfere with her television signals.
xii the existence of the windmills will enhance her risk of sustaining damage from lightening.
xiii she will be exposed to higher levels of electromagnetic radiation.
xiv she will suffer injury from stray voltage and 
xv the windmills will prevent her from conducting operations on her fields.
we glean from all this,taking it in the light most favorable to muscarello,that she believes that the prescribed process was not followed and that the construction of windmills will have uncompensated adverse consequences for her and her fellow nonresidential property owners.muscarello sued to stop the construction of the windmills and to require the board to revoke the permit.to date,as far as the record before us reflects,no windmills have been constructed.
muscarello complaint includes counts based on the constitution,the illinois constitution,illinois statutes,and illinois rights as we noted earlier,it names defendants.for purposes of this appeal,we can group the defendants as follows various entities and individuals acting on behalf of ogle county ogle county the parties of record in the administrative proceeding,including marco muscarello,plaintiff husband baileyville,the navitas energy,sole shareholder,member,and owner of baileyville and gamesa corporacion tecnologia,the corporate parent of navitas.baileyville,navitas,and gamesa have.
we divide our analysis of muscarello claims into three categories based on the type of jurisdiction pleaded section claims section claims and section claims.we discuss the applicable jurisdictional bases for each theory of recovery along with our discussion of the merits below.here,we briefly summarize muscarello claims and the district court disposition of them.
section claims.muscarello alleges three violations of the fourteenth amendment of the constitution count iv alleges a taking without just compensation count vi alleges a denial of due process and count viii alleges a denial of equal protection.these counts stem from ogle county grant of the special use permit to baileyville and the adoption of the protection plan that provides compensation only to residential property owners.although the permit does not directly affect muscarello land,she asserts that it represents an unreasonable and illegal taking of her property,that the process by which it was awarded was defective,and that the protection plan unlawfully discriminates against nonresidential property owners.the district court dismissed her takings and equal protection claims as unripe,and it rejected her due process claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.
section claims.two more of muscarello claims are based on state common law trespass,in count x,and nuisance,in count xi for them,she has invoked diversity jurisdiction under.in fact,she appears to be relying on alienage jurisdiction rather than diversity of citizenship,as one of the parties gamesa is a spanish corporation.we discuss the jurisdictional basis for these claims in greater detail below.on the merits,although muscarello concedes that the windmills have yet to be constructed,she takes the position that she can recover under trespass and nuisance theories based solely on the county decision to grant the permit for the future windmills.the district court twice dismissed these claims because muscarello did not properly plead citizenship.on the third try,without finding jurisdiction,the district court rejected these speculative theories of trespass and nuisance as unripe.
section claims.finally,muscarello included seven counts asserting violations of illinois law for which she relies on supplemental jurisdiction count i seeks a declaratory judgment under illinois law for violations of local and state law count ii seeks administrative review under the illinois administrative review act,ilcs,et count iii requests a writ of certiorari under illinois law count v claims an unlawful taking in violation of the illinois constitution count vii alleges a violation of due process under the illinois constitution count ix alleges a violation of equal protection under the illinois constitution and count xii seeks injunctive relief.the district court,after it dismissed the other counts for which muscarello pleaded original jurisdiction,dismissed these claims under c.
muscarello appeals the dismissal of her twelve claims.in addition,appeal the district court decision to deny their motion to stay administrative proceedings.we address the after we review muscarello arguments.
we look first at the claims that allegedly arise under the federal constitution provisions relating to takings,due process,and equal protection.the district court dismissed the takings and equal protection claims as unripe and the due process claim for failure to state a claim.our review is de novo for all three of these rulings we accept all of the,plausible factual allegations in the plaintiff complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.ashcroft iqbal,patel city of chicago,cir mccullah gadert,cir.
the core of muscarello claims is an allegation that ogle county violated the fourteenth amendment of the constitution through a violation of the fifth amendment takings clause.the takings clause provides nor shall private property be taken for public use,without just compensation.const.amend.muscarello asserts that ogle county decision to grant a permit to baileyville constituted a taking without just compensation.
in order to invoke the protections of the takings clause,muscarello must allege a taking of private property.her complaint fails to meet that requirement.muscarello does not allege any physical invasion of her property,a quintessential taking.see loretto teleprompter manhattan catv,when faced with a constitutional challenge to a permanent physical occupation of real property,this court has invariably found a taking.instead,she relies on the more elusive concept of the regulatory taking.see lucas coastal council,finding a regulatory taking only where all economically beneficial or productive use of land is denied.but here,the alleged economic effects are a far cry from the denial of all economically beneficial or productive use of the land.the lucas court was careful not to create the impression that all zoning decisions that may diminish an owner potential uses of her property,or compel a less valuable use,are takings.see covington court vill.of oak brook,cir we frequently have reminded litigants that federal courts are not boards of zoning appeals.in order to qualify as a regulatory taking,the measure must place such onerous restrictions on land as to render it useless.muscarello would have us turn law on its head by accepting the proposition that a regulatory taking occurs whenever a governmental entity lifts a restriction on someone use of land.we see no warrant for such a step.see gagliardi vill.of pawling,cir holding that residential landowners had no property interest in the enforcement of zoning laws on adjacent property.
even if we thought that ogle county might have taken muscarello property when it issued the permit to baileyville,muscarello could not seek recovery in the way she has proceeded here.as we have observed in the past,in williamson county regional planning commission hamilton bank,
the supreme court articulated a special ripeness doctrine for constitutional property rights claims which precludes federal courts from adjudicating land use disputes until the regulatory agency has had an opportunity to make a considered definitive decision,and the property owner exhausts available state remedies for compensation.
forseth vill.of sussex,cir.muscarello concedes that she did not satisfy the exhaustion requirement.therefore,her takings claim is unripe unless she is excused from that requirement.the district court found that muscarello should not be excused,and we agree.
muscarello attempts to save this part of her case through two exceptions to the exhaustion requirement one for facial challenges and one for situations in which relief is not available in state court.we conclude,however,that neither applies to this case.it is true that facial challenges to the constitutionality of a law under the takings clause are not subject to the exhaustion requirement.see san remo hotel,city county of san francisco,citing yee escondido.but muscarello claim is not a facial challenge.she has focused on the economic deprivation that she herself will suffer if and when the taking characteristic as applied challenge.although almost in passing she suggests that the alleged taking was not for a public purpose,this point is too undeveloped to require comment.
second,plaintiffs are excused from the exhaustion requirement if state law does not provide relief.daniels area plan comm n,cir.that rule does not fit muscarello case either,because illinois provides ample process for a person seeking just compensation.see peters clifton,cir.see also ilcs providing a statutory basis for inverse condemnation actions under illinois law inn of lamplighter,kramer,noting that plaintiffs properly sought a writ of mandamus to compel an eminent domain action to compensate them for their alleged loss.since illinois law provides a remedy for muscarello,her claims are not excused from the exhaustion requirement.
muscarello also invokes jurisdiction for her claims that ogle county violated the equal protection and due process clauses.the district court dismissed muscarello equal protection claim for lack of ripeness,and the due process claim for lack of a protectable property interest.we consider these in turn.
the district court found that the equal protection claim was a takings claim in disguise,and thus that it too had to satisfy williamson county.see river park city of highland park,cir labels do not matter.a person contending that state or local regulation of the use of land has gone overboard must repair to state court.the district court was correct.any equal protection claim based on a taking would be unripe and subject to all of the objections that we have just reviewed in connection with the takings claim.
even if we assumed that muscarello has pleaded an equal protection claim that is distinct from her takings theory,this would shift the focus of attention to the disparate treatment under the ordinance of residents and nonresidents.but that raises a pure question of the county was entitled to draw such a that kind of classification is subject to the deferential rational basis test.a plan to encourage alternative energy production by freeing land from existing restrictions while providing in advance for the compensation of homeowners reflects both legitimate ends and rational means.nonresidential owners still have all remedies that illinois law puts at their disposal,and so they are far from left out.muscarello therefore has not stated an equal protection claim upon which relief can be granted.
her due process theory is similarly deficient.a party must have a protectable property interest in order to state a claim for a violation of due process based on a regulatory taking.see memphis light,gas water div.craft.the district court held that muscarello does not have a property intere
