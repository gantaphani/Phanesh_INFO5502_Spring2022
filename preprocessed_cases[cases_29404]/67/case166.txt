this is an appeal by prevailing parties in civil rights litigation against the city of boston,massachusetts.the appellants have raised several claims of error,the most important of which concerns circumstances under which a rejected offer of judgment,pursuant to,will cut off a prevailing party entitlement to attorney fees.
albertha bogan and her three children brought an action against the city,mayor thomas menino,commissioner of inspectional services kevin joyce,three inspectional services employees the neighborhood development corporation of grove hall ndc,and one of its founding members,virginia morrison,claiming violations of and various torts under massachusetts law.the plaintiffs alleged that inspectional services employees illegally inspected the bogans property in the dorchester section of boston,at the behest of mayor menino,to force them to sell their property in favor of an economic development project spearheaded by the ndc.the defendants claimed that the inspection was ordered because the property was being operated as an illegal rooming house and was in disrepair.
the inspection took place in march and resulted in the issuance of fifty building code violation citations and a rooming house violation.as a result of the inspection,the city ordered the bogans to vacate the property and that it be condemned.a few days after the inspection,the city filed a complaint in the massachusetts housing court to enforce the condemnation order.the bogans resisted the housing court complaint and also litigated the validity of the code violation citations before the massachusetts building code appeals board.in june,the housing court found that the inspection of the bogans home was an illegal regulatory search and vacated virtually all of the code violations.
almost three years later,on march,the bogans filed the instant federal action,claiming damages as a result of the defendants inspection and conduct.the complaint stated claims under for violations of the fourth and fourteenth amendments,as well as trespass,conversion of real and personal property,invasion of privacy,harassment,and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
in due course,the city and individual defendants moved for partial summary judgment.the district judge granted summary judgment for the individual defendants on the claim because they were sued only in their official capacities and their presence was not necessary since the city was sued directly.the judge also granted summary judgment for the city on the tort claims on the basis of sovereign immunity.the judge did,however,permit most of the tort claims to proceed against joyce and the other inspectional services employees as for the state law claims against mayor menino,the judge granted summary judgment on the trespass,conversion,and invasion of privacy claims because the mayor was not present during the inspection,and on the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim because there was no evidence that the mayor ordered the inspection to cause the bogans distress 
on march,the city made the bogans an offer of judgment under.for,which they rejected.the district judge then ordered the bifurcation of the remaining claims so that the claims against the city and the tort claims against joyce would be tried first.see.b.
in september,the parties agreed to try the case to a jury before a magistrate judge.after an trial,the jury found in favor of the bogans on the claim against the city,but found in favor of joyce on the tort claims.the jury awarded the bogans a total of in damages the defendants then moved to dismiss the remaining tort claims on the ground that any damages award at a second trial would be duplicative because the award against the city compensated the bogans for their entire injury.the magistrate judge agreed and dismissed the remaining claims.
thereafter,the bogans moved for an award of in attorney fees and in costs under.the magistrate judge reduced the fee award to and the cost award to.the judge then entered a final judgment ordering the city to pay the bogans a total of.the bogans filed this appeal,raising a series of challenges to rulings made during the pretrial and trial proceedings and to various reductions made in their request for fees and costs.
the bogans first claim that they were prejudiced by the improper issuance of a protective order preventing them from deposing mayor menino.the district judge granted the protective order on the ground that the bogans had failed to demonstrate that the information they sought from the mayor was unavailable from other sources.the bogans contend that they should have been allowed to depose the mayor because they uncovered evidence that the mayor directly ordered the inspection of their property.they hypothesize that,if they had been permitted to depose the mayor,they may have learned that he ordered the search to intimidate them into selling their property to make way for the project.
the district court is empowered by.c to grant a protective order from discovery for good cause shown.appellate review of such orders is limited.we will intervene in discovery matters only upon a clear showing of manifest injustice,that is,where the lower court discovery order was plainly wrong and resulted in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party.bristol,cir.
the need for limited access to high government officials through the discovery process is well established.in united states morgan,the supreme court indicated that the practice of calling high ranking government officials as witnesses should be discouraged.relying on morgan,other courts have concluded that top executive department officials should not,absent extraordinary circumstances,be called to testify or deposed regarding their reasons for taking official action.simplex time recorder sec y of labor,see also in re united states holder,cir in re fdic,cir in re united states kessler,cir.this rule is based on the notion that h igh ranking government officials have greater duties and time constraints than other witnesses and that,without appropriate limitations,such officials will spend an inordinate amount of time tending to pending litigation.kessler,at.
but this limitation is not absolute.depositions of high ranking officials may be permitted where the official has knowledge related to the claim being litigated.see baine motors,church of scientology of boston irs,cmty.fed.sav.loan ass fed.home loan bank.however,even in such cases,discovery is permitted only where it is shown that other persons can not provide the necessary information.holder,at.
the parties agree that mayor menino is a high ranking government official and therefore is not subject to being deposed absent a demonstrated need.see marisol giuliani,wl,at,treating a mayor as a high ranking government official for purposes of a motion for a protective order from discovery.the question therefore is whether the bogans established sufficient need to warrant discovery directly from the mayor.the bogans rely on evidence that defendant hanson,one of the inspectional services employees,wrote a note on the day of the inspection to the effect that the mayor office had received complaints from neighbors about the bogans property and that the mayor had ordered the inspection as a result.they also rely on the fact that the inspection was ordered on the heels of their disclosing to the ndc that the property was being used as a rooming house.the bogans assert that these strands of evidence support an inference that the mayor ordered the inspection on a tip from the ndc because of their shared goal to force the bogans from the property.
the bogans argument founders because they did not pursue other sources to obtain relevant information before turning to the mayor.hanson testified that she did not recall why she had written that the mayor had ordered the inspection,and joyce testified that he ordered the inspection without a directive from the mayor.thus,the identity of the city official who ordered the inspection and the reason for the inspection were disputed issues of fact.the bogans nevertheless failed to purse discovery from other city employees who could have shed light on the mayor involvement.in particular,the bogans did not seek discovery from any of the mayor aides.it is certainly likely that at least one of these employees was involved and could have clarified the mayor role.it was therefore incumbent on the bogans to seek information from these individuals before turning to the mayor.see alexander fbi,denying a request for discovery of a high ranking government official because there are other avenues of discovery that plaintiffs may purse to establish their theory marisol,wl,at granting the mayor a protective order where relevant discovery could be obtained from other city employees.accordingly,the district judge did not abuse his discretion in issuing a protective order for mayor menino because the bogans had not exhausted other available avenues of discovery.
the bogans also claim that,even on the record as it existed without the additional discovery,summary judgment was improvidently granted on the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim against the mayor we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,construing the record in favor of the nonmoving party.see wolinetz berkshire life ins,cir.summary judgment is appropriately granted where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact,and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.
the district judge granted summary judgment for the mayor on the ground that there was no evidence that the mayor ordered the inspection of the bogans property for the purpose of inflicting emotional distress.we agree.the note written by hanson was sufficient to permit a factfinder to conclude that the mayor ordered the inspection.but there is no evidence that would permit a finding that the mayor did so to inflict emotional distress on the bogans.see conley romeri,stating that to prevail on an infliction of emotional distress claim,the plaintiff must establish that the defendant intended to inflict emotional distress,or knew or should have known that emotional distress was the likely result of the conduct.the note itself stated that the mayor ordered the inspection because of neighbor complaints about the bogans property.the bogans contend that this reason was false and that the mayor ordered the inspection because he wanted to force them from the property.this is mere conjecture.see podiatrist ass n,la cruz de,cir stating that a claim based on unsupported conjecture can not withstand summary judgment.the bogans have not identified evidence of the mayor desire to promote the proposed development project by evicting the bogans or even that the ndc and the mayor discussed the status of the bogans property.indeed,there is nothing in the record to suggest that the rationale articulated in hanson note was pretext.on this record,the district judge correctly found that mayor menino was entitled to summary judgment on the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.
the bogans next contest a series of rulings by the magistrate judge excluding the admission of various pieces of evidence at trial,but they have not filed a trial transcript.the party asserting a claim of error maintains the burden of procuring the transcript where a transcript is necessary to decide the claims.see fed.b principi,cir because the review of evidentiary rulings are typically and an erroneous evidentiary ruling does not require a new trial if harmless,see,cir,the relevant transcripts are essential to meaningful appellate review.accordingly,c hallenges to the admission of evidence will not be considered by the court of appeals in the absence of a record containing those portions of the transcript on which the appellant relies.united states davis,cir internal citation omitted see loren sasser,cir.because the bogans have not provided an adequate record to review their evidentiary challenges,we decline to consider them.see faigin kelly,cir.
finally,the bogans challenge the magistrate judge ruling that it was not necessary to try the tort claims against the remaining inspectional services employees.they argue that permitting a second trial on these tort claims could result in an award of damages for injuries that they suffered,which they contend were not encompassed in the award against the city.according to the bogans,they presented two theories of liability against the city,one based on the fourth amendment and the other based on the fourteenth amendment.the fourth amendment claim,they say,was limited to damages arising from the inspection itself,while the fourteenth amendment claim encompassed damages arising from the city conduct.the bogans interpret the modest amount awarded on the claim to mean that the jury compensated them for injuries sustained during the inspection but not for damages.
t he law abhors duplicative recoveries thus double awards for the same injury are impermissible.dopp htp,cir.compensatory damages in cases remedy only actual injuries caused by the violation,and the level of damages is ordinarily determined according to common law tort principles.see memphis cmty.sch.dist.stachura,d monroig,cir.thus,i f a claim and a state claim arise from the same operative facts,and seek identical relief,an award of damages under both theories will constitute double recovery.mason.tpk,cir internal citation omitted.
the magistrate judge concluded that the bogans trial presentation of their fourth and fourteenth amendment theories was both the city inspection and conduct and seeking all damages incurred as a result.because the bogans have not provided us with a trial transcript,we have no basis to question the magistrate judge view of the evidence.we note,however,that this view is consistent with the bogans statement at the pretrial conference that all of their claims were based on the same underlying facts.and it is also consistent with the bogans acceptance of a verdict form on the claim that did not require the jury to distinguish between the fourth amendment and fourteenth amendment theories of liability.in these circumstances,the magistrate judge correctly ruled that the jury awarded full compensation to the bogans,and therefore a subsequent trial on the remaining claims was unwarranted.see gilmere city of atlanta,cir holding that the district court properly refused to award damages for tort claims where the jury had awarded damages on claims based on identical facts.
we now turn to the bogans challenges to the award of fees and costs.we first summarize the magistrate judge ruling and then consider the bogans specific challenges.
under,the statute under which the bogans were awarded fees for prevailing on their claim,a trial court generally should employ the lodestar method to calculate fees.under this method,a court usually should begin with the attorneys contemporaneous billing records.gay officers action league puerto rico,cir.the court should then subtract hours that are duplicative,unproductive or excessive and multiply the reasonable hours billed by the prevailing attorney rate in the community.lipsett blanco,cir.the resulting amount constitutes the lodestar.after calculating the lodestar,the court may then adjust the award further for any of several reasons,including the quantum of success achieved in the litigation.coutin young rubicam,cir.
the magistrate judge employed this method in determining the appropriate fee award.the judge made several reductions from the reasonable hours expended on the litigation,including time accrued prior to the preparation of the bogans federal complaint in december,and time spent on claims dismissed at summary judgment that were severable from the successful claim.the judge also reduced the billing rate of one of the bogans attorneys,harold jacobi,from to.after accounting for these reductions,the judge calculated a lodestar including fees incurred after the bogans rejected the defendants rule offer of judgment,see.the judge then reduced this figure by fifty percent because much of the trial focused on the unsuccessful claims against joyce,and the ultimate damage award on the claim was modest.after all reductions,the judge determined that an award of in fees was reasonable.
