the city of miami filed suit against bank of america and wells fargo banks,alleging violations of the fair housing act fha or act.the fha prohibits,among other things,racial discrimination in connection with transactions,b,a,and permits any aggrieved person to file a civil damages action for a violation of the act,a a,c.the city complaints charge that the banks intentionally targeted predatory practices at and latino neighborhoods and residents,lending to minority borrowers on worse terms than equally creditworthy nonminority borrowers and inducing defaults by failing to extend refinancing and loan modifications to minority borrowers on fair terms.the city alleges that the banks discriminatory conduct led to a disproportionate number of foreclosures and vacancies in neighborhoods,which impaired the city effort to assure racial integration,diminished the city revenue,and increased demand for police,fire,and other municipal services.the district court dismissed the complaints on the grounds that the harms alleged fell outside the zone of interests the fha protects and the complaints failed to show a sufficient causal connection between the city injuries and the banks discriminatory conduct.the eleventh circuit reversed.
the city is an aggrieved person authorized to bring suit under the fha.in addition to satisfying constitutional standing requirements,see spokeo,robins,a plaintiff must show that the statute grants the plaintiff the cause of action he or she asserts.it is presumed that a statute ordinarily provides a cause of action only to plaintiffs whose interests fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.lexmark int l,static control components.
the city claims of financial injury are,at the least,arguably within the zone of interests the fha protects.association of data processing service organizations,camp.the fha defines an aggrieved person as any person who either claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice or believes that such an injury is about to occur,i.this court has said that the definition of person aggrieved in the original version of the fha showed a congressional intention to define standing as broadly as is permitted by article iii of the constitution,trafficante metropolitan life ins,and has held that the act permits suit by parties similarly situated to the city,see,gladstone,realtors village of bellwood,village alleging that it lost tax revenue and had the racial balance of its community undermined by practices.against the backdrop of those decisions,congress did not materially alter the definition of person aggrieved when it reenacted the current version of the act.
the banks nonetheless contend that the definition sets boundaries that fall short of those the constitution sets.even assuming that some form of their argument is valid,this court concludes that the city financial injuries fall within the zone of interests that the fha protects.the city claims are similar in kind to those of the village of bellwood,which the court held in gladstone,supra,could bring suit under the fha.the court explained that the defendants discriminatory conduct adversely affected the village by,among other things,producing a significant reduction in property values that directly injures a municipality by diminishing its tax base,thus threatening its ability to bear the costs of local government and to provide services.at.the city alleged economic injuries thus arguably fall within the fha zone of interests,as this court has previously interpreted that statute.stare decisis principles compel the court adherence to those precedents,and principles of statutory interpretation demand that the court respect congress decision to ratify those precedents when it reenacted the relevant statutory text.
the eleventh circuit erred in concluding that the complaints met the fha requirement based solely on the finding that the city alleged financial injuries were foreseeable results of the banks misconduct.a claim for damages under the fha is akin to a tort action,meyer holley,and is thus subject to the requirement that loss is attributable to the proximate cause,and not to any remote cause,lexmark,at.the analysis asks whether the harm alleged has a sufficiently close connection to the conduct the statute prohibits.at.with respect to the fha,foreseeability alone does not ensure the required close connection.nothing in the statute suggests that congress intended to provide a remedy for any foreseeable result of an fha violation,which may ripples of harm to flow far beyond the defendant misconduct,associated contractors of,carpenters,and doing so would risk massive and complex damages litigation,at.rather,proximate cause under the fha requires some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.holmes securities investors protection corporation.the court has repeatedly applied directness principles to statutes with foundations.anza ideal steel supply.the general tendency in these cases,in regard to damages at least,is not to go beyond the first step.hemi group,llc city of new york.what falls within that step depends in part on the nature of the statutory cause of action,lexmark,supra,at,and an assessment of what is administratively possible and convenient,holmes,supra,at.

on writs of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit 
justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
the fair housing act fha or act forbids 
discriminat ing against any person in the terms,conditions,or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling,or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith,because of race b.
it further makes it unlawful for 
any person or other entity whose business includes engaging in residential real transactions to discriminate against any person in making available such a transaction,or in the terms or conditions of such a transaction,because of race a.
the statute allows any aggrieved person to file a civil action seeking damages for a violation of the statute.a a,c.and it defines an aggrieved person to include any person who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice.i.
the city of miami claims that two banks,bank of america and wells fargo,intentionally issued riskier mortgages on less favorable terms to and latino customers than they issued to similarly situated white,customers,in violation of b and a.app.the city,in amended complaints,alleges that these discriminatory practices have adversely impacted the racial composition of the city,at,impaired the city goals to assure racial integration and desegregation,frustrate d the city longstanding and active interest in promoting fair housing and securing the benefits of an integrated community,at,and disproportionately cause d foreclosures and vacancies in minority communities in miami,at.those foreclosures and vacancies have harmed the city by decreasing the property value of the foreclosed home as well as the values of other homes in the neighborhood,thereby a reduc ing property tax revenues to the city,at,and b forcing the city to spend more on municipal services that it provided and still must provide to remedy blight and unsafe and dangerous conditions which exist at properties that were foreclosed as a result of the banks illegal lending practices,at.the city claims that those practices violate the fha and that it is entitled to damages for the listed injuries.
the banks respond that the complaints do not set forth a cause of action for two basic reasons.first,they contend that the city claimed harms do not arguably fall within the zone of interests that the statute seeks to protect,association of data processing service organizations,camp,hence,the city is not an aggrieved person entitled to sue under the act,i.second,they say that the complaint fails to draw a connection between the violation claimed and the harm allegedly suffered.in their view,even if the city proves the violations it charges,the distance between those violations and the harms the city claims to have suffered is simply too great to entitle the city to collect damages.
we hold that the city claimed injuries fall within the zone of interests that the fha arguably protects.hence,the city is an aggrieved person able to bring suit under the statute.we also hold that,to establish proximate cause under the fha,a plaintiff must do more than show that its injuries foreseeably flowed from the alleged statutory violation.the lower court decided these cases on the theory that foreseeability is all that the statute requires,so we vacate and remand for further proceedings.
in,the city of miami brought lawsuits in federal court against two banks,bank of america and wells fargo.the city complaints charge that the banks discriminatorily imposed more onerous,and indeed predatory,conditions on loans made to minority borrowers than to similarly situated nonminority borrowers.app.those predatory practices included,among others,excessively high interest rates,unjustified fees,teaser loans that overstated refinancing opportunities,large prepayment penalties,and when default loomed unjustified refusals to refinance or modify the loans,at.due to the discriminatory nature of the banks practices,default and foreclosure rates among minority borrowers were higher than among otherwise similar white borrowers and were concentrated in minority neighborhoods,at.higher foreclosure rates lowered property values and diminished revenue,at.higher foreclosure rates especially when accompanied by vacancies also increased demand for municipal services,such as police,fire,and building and code enforcement services,all needed to remedy blight and unsafe and dangerous conditions that the foreclosures and vacancies generate,at.the complaints describe statistical analyses that trace the city financial losses to the banks discriminatory practices,at.
the district court dismissed the complaints on the grounds that the harms alleged,being economic and not discriminatory,fell outside the zone of interests the fha protects the complaints fail to show a sufficient causal connection between the city injuries and the banks discriminatory conduct and the complaints fail to allege unlawful activity occurring within the act statute of limitations.the city then filed amended complaints the complaints now before us and sought reconsideration.the district court held that the amended complaints could solve only the statute of limitations problem.it consequently declined to reconsider the dismissals.
the court of appeals reversed the district court.it held that the city injuries fall within the zone of interests,lexmark int l,static control components,slip,at,that the fha protects,at,relying on trafficante metropolitan life ins,gladstone,realtors village of bellwood,and havens realty coleman,at similar.it added that the complaints adequately allege proximate cause,at,at.and it remanded the cases while ordering the district court to accept the city complaints as amended,at,at.
the banks filed petitions for certiorari,asking us to decide whether,as the court of appeals had in effect held,the amended complaints satisfied the fha and requirements.we agreed to do so.
to satisfy the constitution restriction of this court jurisdiction to cases and controversies,art.iii,a plaintiff must demonstrate constitutional standing.to do so,the plaintiff must show an injury in fact that is fairly traceable to the defendant conduct and that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.spokeo,robins,slip,at citing lujan defenders of wildlife.this court has also referred to a plaintiff need to satisfy prudential or statutory standing requirements.see lexmark,at,and slip,at,and.in lexmark,we said that the label prudential standing was misleading,for the requirement at issue is in reality tied to a particular statute.ibid.the question is whether the statute grants the plaintiff the cause of action that he asserts.in answering that question,we presume that a statute ordinarily provides a cause of action only to plaintiffs whose interests fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.at slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.we have added that w hether a plaintiff comes within the zone of interests is an issue that requires us to determine,using traditional tools of statutory interpretation,whether a legislatively conferred cause of action encompasses a particular plaintiff claim.at slip,at some internal quotation marks omitted.
here,we conclude that the city claims of financial injury in their amended complaints specifically,lost tax revenue and extra municipal expenses satisfy the or prudential standing requirement.to use the language of data processing,the city claims of injury it suffered as a result of the statutory violations are,at the least,arguably within the zone of interests that the fha protects,at emphasis added.
the fha permits any aggrieved person to bring a lawsuit.a.the statute defines aggrieved person as any person who either claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice or believes that such an injury is about to occur.i.
this court has repeatedly written that the fha definition of person aggrieved reflects a congressional intent to confer standing broadly.we have said that the definition of person aggrieved in the original version of the fha,a,stat,showed a congressional intention to define standing as broadly as is permitted by article iii of the constitution.trafficante,supra,at quoting hackett mcguire brothers,see gladstone,supra,at similar havens realty,supra,at,similar see also thompson north american stainless,lp,later opinions,we must acknowledge,reiterate that the term aggrieved in the fha reaches as far as article iii permits bennett spear,trafficante held that standing was expanded to the full extent permitted under article iii by a of the civil rights act of 
thus,we have held that the act allows suits by white tenants claiming that they were deprived benefits from interracial associations when discriminatory rental practices kept minorities out of their apartment complex,trafficante,at a village alleging that it lost tax revenue and had the racial balance of its community undermined by practices,gladstone,at and a nonprofit organization that spent money to combat housing discrimination,havens realty,at.contrary to the dissent view,those cases did more than sugges t that plaintiffs similarly situated to the city have a cause of action under the fha.post,at.they held as much.and the dissent is wrong to say that we characterized those cases as resting on dictum.post,at quoting thompson,supra,at.the dictum we cast doubt on in thompson addressed who may sue under title vii,the employment discrimination statute,not under the fha.
finally,in,when congress amended the fha,it retained without significant change the definition of person aggrieved that this court had broadly construed.compare a,stat,with b,stat.codified at i changing person aggrieved to aggrieved person and making other minor changes to the definition.indeed,congress was aware of our precedent and made a considered judgment to retain the relevant statutory text,texas of housing and community affairs inclusive communities project,slip,at.see,stating that the bill adopts as its definition language similar to that contained in section of existing law,as modified to reaffirm the broad holdings of these cases and discussing gladstone and havens realty lorillard pons,congress normally adopts our interpretations of statutes when it reenacts those statute without change.
the banks do not deny the broad reach of the words aggrieved person as defined in the fha.but they do contend that those words nonetheless set boundaries that fall short of those the constitution sets.brief for petitioners in,brief for wells fargo brief for petitioners in,brief for bank of america.the court language in trafficante,gladstone,and havens realty,they argue,was exaggerated and unnecessary to decide the cases then before the court.see brief for wells fargo brief for bank of america.moreover,they warn that taking the court words literally providing everyone with constitutional standing a cause of action under the fha would produce a legal anomaly.after all,in thompson,at,we held that the words person claiming to be aggrieved in title vii of the civil rights act of,the employment discrimination statute,did not stretch that statute zone of interest to the limits of article iii.we reasoned that such an interpretation would produce farfetched results,for example,a shareholder in a company could bring a title vii suit against the company for discriminatorily firing an employee.ibid.the banks say it would be similarly farfetched if restaurants,plumbers,utility companies,or any other participant in the local economy could sue the banks to recover business they lost when people had to give up their homes and leave the neighborhood as a result of the banks discriminatory lending practices.brief for wells fargo brief for bank of america.that,they believe,can not have been the intent of the congress that enacted or amended the fha.
we need not discuss the banks argument at length,for even if we assume for argument sake that some form of it is valid,we nonetheless conclude that the city financial injuries fall within the zone of interests that the fha protects.our case law with respect to the fha drives that conclusion.the city complaints allege that the banks intentionally targeted predatory practices at and latino neighborhoods and residents,app,at similar.that unlawful conduct led to a concentration of foreclosures and vacancies in those neighborhoods,at.those concentrated foreclosures and vacancies caused stagnation and decline in and latino neighborhoods.at.they hindered the city efforts to create integrated,stable neighborhoods,at.and,highly relevant here,they reduced property values,diminishing the city revenue and increasing demand for municipal services,at.
those claims are similar in kind to the claims the village of bellwood raised in gladstone.there,the plaintiff village had alleged that it was injured by having its housing market wrongfully and illegally manipulated to the economic and social detriment of the citizens of the village.at quoting the complaint alterations in original.we held that the village could bring suit.we wrote that the complaint in effect alleged that the racial steering affect ed the village racial composition,reduce d the total number of buyers in the bellwood housing market,precipitate d an exodus of white residents,and caused prices to be deflected downward.at.those circumstances adversely affected the village by,among other things,producing a significant reduction in property values that directly injures a municipality by diminishing its tax base,thus threatening its ability to bear the costs of local government and to provide services.at emphasis added.
the upshot is that the city alleges economic injuries that arguably fall within the fha zone of interests,as we have previously interpreted that statute.principles of stare decisis compel our adherence to those precedents in this context.and principles of statutory interpretation require us to respect congress decision to ratify those precedents when it reenacted the relevant statutory text.see supra,at.
the remaining question is one of causation did the banks allegedly discriminatory lending practices proximately cause the city to lose revenue and spend more on municipal services the eleventh circuit concluded that the answer is yes because the city plausibly alleged that its financial injuries were foreseeable results of the banks misconduct.we conclude that foreseeability alone is not sufficient to establish proximate cause under the fha,and therefore vacate the judgment below.
it is a well established principle of the common law that in all cases of loss,we are to attribute it to the proximate cause,and not to any remote cause.lexmark,at slip,at.we assume congress is familiar with the rule and does not mean to displace it sub silentio in federal causes of action.ibid.a claim for damages under the fha which is akin to a tort action,meyer holley,is no exception to this traditional requirement.analysis is controlled by the nature of the statutory cause of action.the question it presents is whether the harm alleged has a sufficiently close connection to the conduct the statute prohibits.lexmark,supra,at slip,at.
in these cases,the conduct the statute prohibits consists of intentionally lending to minority borrowers on worse terms than equally creditworthy nonminority borrowers and inducing defaults by failing to extend refinancing and loan modifications to minority borrowers on fair terms.the city alleges that the banks misconduct led to a disproportionate number of foreclosures and vacancies in specific miami neighborhoods.these foreclosures and vacancies purportedly harmed the city,which lost revenue when the value of the properties in those neighborhoods fell and was forced to spend more on municipal services in the affected areas.
the eleventh circuit concluded that the city adequately pleaded that the banks misconduct proximately caused these financial injuries,at.the court held that in the context of the fha the proper standard for proximate cause is based on foreseeability.at.the city,it continued,satisfied that element although there are several links in the causal chain between the charged discriminatory lending practices and the claimed losses,the city plausibly alleged that none are unforeseeable.at.
we conclude that the eleventh circuit erred in holding that foreseeability is sufficient to establish proximate cause under the fha.as we have explained,proximate cause generally bars suits for alleged harm that is too remote from the defendant unlawful conduct.lexmark,supra,at slip,at.in the context of the fha,foreseeability alone does not ensure the close connection that proximate cause requires.the housing market is interconnected with economic and social life.a violation of the fha may,therefore,be expected to cause ripples of harm to flow far beyond the defendant misconduct.associated contractors of,carpenters.nothing in the statute suggests that congress intended to provide a remedy wherever those ripples travel.and entertaining suits to recover damages for any foreseeable result of an fha violation would risk massive and complex damages litigation.at.
rather,proximate cause under the fha requires some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.holmes securities investors protection corporation.a damages claim under the statute is analogous to a number of tort actions recognized at common law,curtis loether,and we have repeatedly applied directness principles to statutes with foundations,anza ideal steel supply.the general tendency in these cases,in regard to damages at least,is not to go beyond the first step.hemi group,llc city of new york.what falls within that first step depends in part on the nature of the statutory cause of action,lexmark,supra,at slip,at,and an assessment of what is administratively possible and convenient,holmes,supra,at.
the parties have asked us to draw the precise boundaries of proximate cause under the fha and to determine on which side of the line the city financial injuries fall.we decline to do so.the eleventh circuit grounded its decision on the theory that proximate cause under the fha is based on foreseeability alone,at.we therefore lack the benefit of its judgment on how the contrary principles we have just stated apply to the fha.nor has any other court of appeals weighed in on the issue.the lower courts should define,in the first instance,the contours of proximate cause under the fha and decide how that standard applies to the city claims for lost revenue and increased municipal expenses.
the judgments of the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit are vacated,and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

opinion of thomas,
on writs of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit 
justice thomas,with whom justice kennedy and justice alito join,concurring in part and dissenting in part.
these cases arise from lawsuits filed by the city of miami alleging that residential mortgage lenders engaged in discriminatory lending practices in violation of the fair housing act fha.the fha prohibits discrimination against any person because of race,color,religion,sex,handicap,familial status,or national origin with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling.accord,a.miami complaints do not allege that any defendant discriminated against it within the meaning of the fha.neither is miami attempting to bring a lawsuit on behalf of its residents against whom petitioners allegedly discriminated.rather,miami theory is that,between and,petitioners allegedly discriminatory practices led to defaulted loans,which led to foreclosures,which led to vacant houses,which led to decreased property values,which led to reduced property taxes and urban blight.see.miami seeks damages from the lenders for reduced property tax revenues and for the cost of increased municipal services police,firefighters,building inspectors,debris collectors,and others deployed to attend to the blighted areas,at,at.
the court today holds that congress intended to remedy those kinds of injuries when it enacted the fha,but leaves open the question whether miami sufficiently alleged that the discriminatory lending practices caused its injuries.for the reasons explained below,i would hold that miami injuries fall outside the fha zone of interests.i would also hold that,in any event,miami alleged injuries are too remote to satisfy the fha requirement.
a plaintiff seeking to bring suit under a federal statute must show not only that he has standing under article iii,ante,at,but also that his complaint fall s within the zone of interests protected by the law he invokes,lexmark int l,static control components,slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.the requirement is root ed in the rule providing that a plaintiff may recover under the law of negligence for injuries caused by violation of a statute only if the statute is interpreted as designed to protect the class of persons in which the plaintiff is included,against the risk of the type of harm which has in fact occurred as a result of its violation.at,slip,at,quoting keeton,dobbs,keeton,owen,prosser and keeton on law of torts,ed.we have made clear that congress is presumed to legislate against the background of that rule.lexmark,at slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.we thus apply it to all statutorily created causes of action unless it is expressly negated.ibid.emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.whether a plaintiff comes within the zone of interests is an issue that requires us to determine,using traditional tools of statutory interpretation,whether a legislatively conferred cause of action encompasses a particular plaintiff claim.at slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.
nothing in the text of the fha suggests that congress intended to deviate from the limitation.the statute mechanism provides that only an aggrieved person may sue,a a,and the statute defines aggrieved person to mean someone who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice or who believes he will be injured by a discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur,i.that language does not hint much less expressly provide that congress sought to depart from the rule.
we have considered similar language in other statutes and reached the same conclusion.in thompson north american stainless,lp,for example,we considered title vii provision,which provides that a person claiming to be aggrieved may file an employment discrimination charge with the equal employment opportunity commission,at quoting b.we unanimously concluded that congress did not depart from the limitation in title vii by using that language,at.and in lexmark,we interpreted a provision of the lanham act that permitted any person who believes that he or she is likely to be damaged by a defendant false advertising to sue,at slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.even when faced with the broader any person language,we expressly rejected the argument that the statute conferred a cause of action upon anyone claiming an article iii injury in fact.we observed that it was unlikely that congress meant to allow all factually injured plaintiffs to recover,and we concluded that the test was the appropriate tool for determining who may invoke the cause of action under the statute,at,slip,at,internal quotation marks omitted.
to be sure,some language in our older precedents suggests that the fha zone of interests extends to the limits of article iii.see trafficante metropolitan life ins,gladstone,realtors village of bellwood,havens realty coleman.but we have since described that language as dictum leading to absurd consequences.thompson,at.and we have observed that the holdings of those cases are compatible with the zone of interests limitation described in thompson.ibid.that limitation provides that a plaintiff may not sue when his interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it can not be assumed that congress intended to permit the suit.at internal quotation marks omitted.it thus exclud es plaintiffs who might technically be injured in an article iii sense but whose interests are unrelated to the statutory prohibitions.ibid.
in my view,miami asserted injuries are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes of the fha that they fall outside the zone of interests.here,as in any other case,the text of the fha defines the zone of interests that the statute protects.see lexmark,supra,at slip,at.the fha permits a n aggrieved person to sue,a a,if he claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice or believes that he will be injured by a discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur,i,emphasis added.specifically,the fha makes it unlawful to do any of the following on the basis of race,color,religion,sex,handicap,familial status,or national origin refuse to sell or rent a dwelling,a discriminate in the terms,conditions,or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling,or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith,b make,print,or publish any notice,statement,or advertisement,with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference,limitation,or discrimination,c represent to any person that any dwelling is not available for inspection,sale,or rental when such dwelling is in fact so available,d induce any person to sell or rent any dwelling by representations regarding the entry or prospective entry into the neighborhood of a person or persons of certain characteristics,e or discriminate in the provision of real estate or brokerage services.the quintessential aggrieved person in cases involving violations of the fha is a prospective home buyer or lessee discriminated against during the or leasing process.our cases have also suggested that the interests of a person who lives in a neighborhood or apartment complex that remains segregated or that risks becoming segregated as a result of a discriminatory housing practice may be arguably within the outer limit of the interests the fha protects.see trafficante,supra
