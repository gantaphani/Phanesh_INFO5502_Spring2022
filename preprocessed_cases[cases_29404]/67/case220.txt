background 
settlement act 
in,congress enacted the rhode island indian claims settlement act in order to implement the joint memorandum of understanding the jmou,at,reprinted in,that resolved two lawsuits initiated by the narragansett indian tribe the narragansetts against the state of rhode island and landowners in charlestown,rhode island where the narragansetts claimed aboriginal title to approximately acres of land,at see also narragansett tribe of indians land dev.narragansett tribe of indians murphy.under the terms of the jmou and settlement act,the state donated approximately acres of land to the narragansetts,and the federal government committed to provide million to the narragansetts for the acquisition of an additional nine hundred acres.in exchange,the state sought to dispel all clouds on land title in rhode island caused by indian claims.in the settlement act,congress thus ratified any prior transfer of land or natural resources located anywhere in the state of rhode island by the narragansetts or any other indian,indian tribe,or indian nation.a,a.the settlement act also extinguished any aboriginal title to land involved in such transfers.id.a,a.the act limited challenges to the settlement by providing that n otwithstanding any other provision of law,any action to contest the constitutionality of this subchapter shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within one hundred eighty days of september.id.
factual background 
since the wampanoags are appealing the district court dismissal of their case under federal rule of civil procedure b,the facts alleged in the tribe complaint must be taken as true.cruz melecio,cir.these facts are as follows 
the wampanoag nation are an indian tribe recognized by the commonwealth of massachusetts and active in rhode island.the wampanoags are not,however,a federally recognized indian tribe.
according to the plaintiffs complaint,in june,the general court of the new plymouth colony created a formal procedure for the purchase of indian lands in order to prevent confusion and controversy over land titles.in,chief wamsutta of the wampanoags deeded land to captain thomas willett,a colonist who was authorized by the general court of new plymouth to purchase land from the indians.this transaction is generally known as the north purchase and the deed included what is now attleboro and north attleboro,massachusetts cumberland,rhode island and part of woonsocket,rhode island.this deed reserved a competent portion of the land for some of the natives at mishanegitatonett for to plant and sojourn upon.the wampanoags contend that this deed thereby afforded the tribe a coexisting right with the colonists to use the land.
on july,king charles ii granted the charter of rhode island and providence plantations the charter,which the wampanoags claim annulled all prior claims to indian lands by right of discovery or conquest.the charter recognized the responsibility of the government to oversee the conveyance of lands from the indians.in contrast to other colonies charters,the rhode island charter provided that the indians had title to indian lands and that any conveyance from the indians must be confirmed and established by royal consent 
the land that was deeded to captain willet in includes the land at issue here.the wampanoags describe the subject land as square miles in northeastern rhode island comprised of land from the pawtucket river along the expanse running from pawtucket up to woonsocket,and moving east to what is now the border between rhode island and massachusetts.this land comprises significant portions of what are now cumberland and woonsocket,rhode island.
c.the current dispute 
the wampanoags contend that they are entitled to occupy and use the land as it was reserved in the deed to captain willet in,because following that transfer,the tribe never made any treaties,deeds,or other written agreements that would have legitimately transferred their rights in the land.in the district court,the wampanoags sought a declaration that they are the lawful and equitable owners of the land in question or,in the alternative,the award of specified money damages.the state defended by moving to dismiss the case on the ground that the wampanoags claims are barred by the settlement act.in response,the wampanoags argued that their claims do not fall within the scope of the settlement act and,if they did,that the settlement act was unconstitutional as applied to their claims.the district court rejected the wampanoags arguments and dismissed the case for failure to state a claim.
ii.analysis 
on appeal,the wampanoags argue that the district court erred in considering the settlement act as an affirmative defense in a b motion to dismiss the settlement act does not apply to the wampanoags claims because their claims are based on deeded title and therefore are not claims raised by indians qua indians the settlement act does not apply to the wampanoags land claims because the wampanoags never transferred their deeded interest in land and the settlement act is unconstitutional.
we review a district court grant of a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b de novo,cir.a complaint should not be dismissed unless it is apparent beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief.conley gibson,d.we accept as true the facts in the wampanoags complaint and indulge all reasonable inferences in the their favor,at.
conversion of motion to dismiss to summary judgment 
the wampanoag tribe claims that the district court erred in considering the state affirmative the settlement act bars the tribe land converting the motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment.federal rule of civil procedure b provides that a rule b motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted shall be converted into a rule motion for summary judgment whenever matters outside the pleading are presented to and relied on by the district court.the tribe complaint did not mention the settlement act,and the state first presented the settlement act to the district court in a brief supporting the state motion to dismiss.the wampanoags therefore assign error,claiming that the court failure to convert the motion into one for summary judgment prevented them from introducing evidence intended to negate the affirmative defense.we find this challenge without merit for the following reasons.
in general,courts have interpreted the rule b conversion provision to mean that courts may consider not only the complaint but also matters fairly incorporated within it and matters susceptible to judicial notice without converting the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment.in re colonial mortgage bankers,cir.indeed,we have specifically noted that a court may look to matters of public record in deciding a rule b motion without converting the motion into one for summary judgment.boateng interamerican,cir see also watterson page,cir.such public records clearly include federal statutes,such as the settlement act at issue here.see pani empire blue cross blue shield,cir it is well established that a district court may rely on matters of public record in deciding a motion to dismiss under rule b,including case law and statutes.
we have also held that,i n an appropriate case,an affirmative defense may be adjudicated on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.colonial mortgage,at.an appropriate case is one in which two conditions are met.first,the facts that establish the defense must be definitively ascertainable from the allegations of the complaint matters of public record,and other matters of which the court may take judicial notice.blackstone realty fdic,cir.as we discussed above,the settlement act is a public record which the court may appropriately consider.second,the facts so gleaned must conclusively establish the affirmative defense.colonial mortgage,at see also blackstone realty,at charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure,at ed citing numerous cases considering affirmative defenses on motions to dismiss.thus,we now proceed to consider de novo whether,based on the facts pled,the settlement act bars the wampanoags claims.
applicability of the settlement act 
the wampanoag tribe claims that the settlement act did not extinguish their rights to the land in question because it extinguished aboriginal title in rhode island,and the tribe argues they hold something more than aboriginal title to the disputed land.in addition,the wampanoags argue that the settlement act does not apply to their claim to the land because they never transferred their rights in the disputed land.
form of title 
the tribe claims that the deed generated by the transaction between the predecessors to the wampanoag tribe and captain willett in converted their interest in the disputed land from aboriginal title to either recognized title or fee simple deeded title.as such,the tribe argues that their claim to the disputed land has not been extinguished by the settlement act,which extinguished only indian land claims by indians qua indians.see,at extinguishment of indian land claims is limited to those claims raised by indians qua indians,and is not intended to affect or eliminate the claim of any indian under any law generally applicable to indians as well as in rhode island.the tribe claims that if the colonists were given a fee simple in the land then deeded to them by willett,the indians must also have received a fee simple estate to their indian reservation,regardless of the nature of their prior holdings.in the alternative,the tribe argues that the deed should be considered a recognized treaty title of a reservation of land to the indians.upon reviewing these arguments,we find that the deed in question does not give the wampanoag tribe recognized title or fee simple title to the land in question.
an indian tribe establishes aboriginal title by showing that it has inhabited the land from time immemorial.mashpee tribe secretary of the interior,cir quoting county of oneida oneida indian nation,d.this right does not have to be traced to a written document or land grant.instead,the tribe must show historical evidence of the tribe physical possession of the land.zuni indian tribe united states.the supreme court has defined this right not as a fee simple property right,but rather as a right of occupancy which the sovereign federal government grants and protects against intrusion by third parties.indians united states.this right of occupancy may be terminated and such lands fully disposed of by the sovereign itself without any legally enforceable obligation to compensate the indians.id.
specific congressional action is necessary to recognize aboriginal title.zuni indian tribe.at.generally recognized title to indian lands is recognized via federal treaty or statute.id.while t here is no particular form for congressional recognition of indian right of permanent occupancy,it is clear that there must be a definite intention by congressional action or authority to accord legal rights,not merely permissive occupation.indians,at.there is nothing to indicate any intention by congress to grant to the wampanoags any permanent rights in the lands of rhode island.the wampanoags are not a federally recognized tribe and the house report at the time of the settlement act clearly stated that congress did not believe there were any possible indian claims in rhode island other than those of the narragansetts,at.
in addition to recognized title as a result of direct congressional action,i ndians holding recognized title to land under a foreign government may retain their title under the united states government if such is provided for by international agreement or treaty.zuni indian tribe.at.there is no indication of a treaty or agreement under which the united states would have retained recognized title for the wampanoags to lands which they do not appear to have even occupied at the time the union was formed.according to the tribe complaint,captain willett was authorized by the general court of new plymouth to negotiate the north purchase with the tribe ancestors.the area later became a part of the colony of rhode island pursuant to the charter of king charles ii,dated july.t he charter of the crown was considered as indispensable to the completion of an indian grant in order for it to constitute a complete title.johnson mcintosh,wheat.discussing the rhode island charter granted by charles ii and the charter sanction of a previous unauthorized purchase from indians the deed in question was not recorded or tendered to the court of new plymouth until april,when captain willett transferred the conveyance to the court.then,in,the transfer was confirmed in the first book of the records of the rehoboth north purchase.the book described the purchased lands,and confirmed that excepted out of this purchased land was a meete proportion of lands for the use of the indians at sinnichiteconett also known as mishanegitatonett we see nothing in this history that shows a treaty or international agreement establishing recognized title for the wampanoags by the colonial sovereign which would have been retained by the united states government upon its formation.for the above reasons,we find that the wampanoag tribe does not have recognized title to the disputed lands 
we also fail to see any indication that the deed was ever intended to convey fee simple title to the indians.as we previously noted,the deed reserved a competent portion of the land for some of the natives at mishanegitatonett for to plant and sojourn upon.this is the same as saying that captain willet took ownership to all of the land,including underlying fee title to the indian land that was reserved so that the wampanoags ancestors could continue to occupy and use the land.
what the wampanoags do have is a right that appears to fall somewhere between aboriginal title and recognized title.as we noted,recognized title is not completely separate from and a replacement of aboriginal title,but rather lends a more permanent property right to the holder of aboriginal title,resulting in a right to compensation under the fifth amendment if the property is taken.zuni indian tribe.at.the wampanoag tribe had aboriginal title to the land at the time of its negotiations with captain willet in,based on their historical presence and use of the land.while the tribe argues that the charter provided them with greater title,this can not be,because the charter was not granted until two years after the transaction creating the deed.we agree with the district court that the deed did not alter the aboriginal status of the wampanoags interest in the land.greene rhode island,d.the deed merely reserved for the wampanoags a portion of the land over which they would continue to have aboriginal title and could continue to use as they had from time immemorial.
whether the land was transferred 
in its complaint,the wampanoag tribe sought,among other things,possession of the subject land,damages,disgorgement of any unjust enrichment as a result of the illegal taking of the subject lands,and a declaration that the state authorized the taking of the subject lands from the ancestors of the tribe in violation of federal and state common law and in violation of the
