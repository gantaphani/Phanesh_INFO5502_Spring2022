section b of the real estate settlement procedures act,b,provides that no person shall give and no person shall accept any portion,split,or percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a real estate settlement service in connection with a transaction involving a federally related mortgage loan other than for services actually performed.the plaintiffs in this class action suit contend that the defendant,the closing agent in their purchase of a home,charged them for recording their mortgage yet paid the county recorder only.the plaintiffs who conceded in the district court,but forgot in this court,that they lack standing to challenge a second alleged,paid by the sellers of the house for the release of the previous mortgage claim that the difference pocketed by the defendant represented the receipt of a portion of a charge other than for a service actually performed,and so violated the statutory provision that we quoted.

when a statute administered by a federal agency is unclear and the agency is authorized to interpret it,the agency interpretation,unless unreasonable,may bind a reviewing court in accordance with chevron natural resources defense council,d.ordinarily issues of statutory interpretation are treated as pure issues of law,and no deference is given the interpretation adopted by executive or other officials.but chevron,in effect equating statutory interpretation to policymaking hans kelsen,pure theory of law max knight trans,hands over with certain qualifications interpretive responsibility to the officials responsible for making policy judgments,when the ordinary interpretive tools used by courts,such as textual interpretation,do not work well.
by taking this position the court appears to have shifted power from the legislative to the executive branch,and to the independent administrative agencies as well,by limiting judicial authority to preserve the deal struck by contending interest groups in the original legislation.for while in principle congress can step in and curb a straying agency,the practice is often different because of the obstacles to legislating that are built into the federal legislative process,including bicameralism and the presidential veto.william eskridge,dynamic statutory interpretation jonathan molot,reexamining marbury in the administrative state a structural and institutional defense of judicial power over statutory interpretation,nw,see also william eskridge,john ferejohn,the article i,section game,geo.these obstacles give agencies a degree of running room.
democrats might question chevron shift of legislative power to the bureaucracy.but realists,while acknowledging the point and also that it is a fiction to suppose chevron itself an interpretation of the statutes to which it applies or that the exercise of power by appointed officials is democratic merely because it is authorized by elected officials,will applaud the supreme court recognition that the interpretation of an ambiguous statute is an exercise in policy formulation rather than in reading.
adams fruit barrett,d,might seem to cast doubt on chevron s applicability to the real estate settlement procedures act,however,because the court said that congress has expressly established the judiciary and not the department of labor as the adjudicator of private rights of action arising under the statute a statute for the protection of farm workers.a precondition to deference under chevron is a congressional delegation of administrative authority no such delegation regarding awpa enforcement provisions is evident in the statute.rather,congress established an enforcement scheme independent of the executive and provided aggrieved farmworkers with direct recourse to federal court where their rights under the statute are violated.respa too is enforced by private actions rather than by judicial or administrative proceedings instituted by hud.but whereas the farm workers statute had not delegated to the department of labor authority to fill gaps in the statute,respa explicitly delegates such authority to the department of housing and urban development,in a,which we quoted earlier.two of the three courts to have considered the question have concluded,albeit without discussion of adams fruit,that at least some hud interpretations of respa are within the scope of chevron.heimmermann first union mortgage,cir schuetz banc one mortgage,cir.
the third court,in glover standard federal bank,cir,reached a similar result by the route,mapped in skidmore swift,of granting the degree of deference that an agency decision invites by virtue of the cogency of its reasoning in relation to the nature of the issue.the more technical the issue is,the less guidance the statute provides to its correct resolution,the more the agency decision,and the more deliberative and empirical the procedures employed in arriving at that decision,the greater the deference that a reviewing court will give it.
barnhart walton,d,the supreme court most recent decision interpreting chevron,suggests a merger between chevron deference and skidmore and glover s approach of varying the deference that agency decisions receive in accordance with the circumstances the interstitial nature of the legal question,the related expertise of the agency,the importance of the question to administration of the statute,the complexity of that administration,and the careful consideration the agency has given the question over a long period of time all indicate that chevron provides the appropriate legal lens through which to view the legality of the agency interpretation here at issue.or in the words of professor pierce,legislative rules and formal adjudications are always entitled to chevron deference,while less formal pronouncements like interpretative rules and informal adjudications may or may not be entitled to chevron deference.the deference due a less formal pronouncement seems to depend on the results of judicial application of an apparently list of factors that arguably qualify as other indication s of a comparable congressional intent to give a particular type of agency pronouncement the force of law.richard pierce,administrative law treatise,ed.supp.
we need not penetrate more deeply into this thicket for even if hud interpretations of respa are entitled to chevron deference,that deference is not total and as it happens section b of respa will not bear,as a matter of straightforward judicial interpretation for if such interpretation dissipates any possible statutory ambiguity and fills any possible gap in the statute,chevron deference is not owed,the meaning that hud wants to give it.republic title did not accept any portion,split,or percentage of any charge.no one agreed to divide a receipt with republic.the statutory language describes a situation in whic
