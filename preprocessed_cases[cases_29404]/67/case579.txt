facts and procedural history 
eileen cowell,richard cowell,and sylvester pany were owners of eastgate land development eastgate,a pennsylvania real estate development company that owned a parcel of land in palmer township,pennsylvania known as the palmer business park.in,the plaintiffs began a three phase project to improve the land for development.this project was subject to the local land use codes of palmer township.defendants robert lammi,jeffrey young,robert elliot,robert wasser,and robert daws were on the township board of supervisors at all relevant times.defendant virginia rickert was also on the board and served as the treasurer of palmer township.defendant theodore borek was the township director of planning.defendant donald himmelreich was the solicitor for palmer township,and his law firm,hemstreet,himmelreich nitchkey,served as counsel to the township.
appellants planned to sell lots to mcdonalds and kentucky fried chicken for the development of restaurants,as well as to build a shopping mall to be called eastgate mall.before contracts could be signed to finalize these plans,the township allegedly changed the zoning classification of these lots from commercial use to planned office buildings,thereby preventing the development of these commercial enterprises.eastgate sued to prevent these zoning changes from taking effect.plaintiffs allege,and defendants do not deny,that the parties reached a settlement in which eastgate agreed to cease its plans to build the eastgate mall and the township agreed to approve all projects that had already been proposed for phases i,ii,and ii a at palmer business park as well as assume responsibility for certain municipal improvements.but when eastgate proceeded with the development of phase ii,the township allegedly imposed a building moratorium in july which prohibited any and all commercial development of the property and caused severe financial hardship for eastgate.
it is the allegations of the events occurring after that are most relevant to this appeal.beginning in,the plaintiffs worked to improve lots through of palmer business park in order to sell them as buildable lots.on october,the township imposed a lien on lots and,naming richard cowell and nicholas pugliese as owners of those lots.the lien was filed on the basis of anticipated of the installation of certain municipal improvements.app.at.
the township explains that the lien was imposed pursuant to an agreement that cowell and pugliese would be responsible for paying for paving work on a subdivision called milford street,with the township serving as the guarantor.the township contends that when neither cowell nor pugliese paid the paving contractor on time,the township paid the bill and then imposed the lien.the plaintiffs respond that richard cowell had sold his interest in milford street to pugliese in and should not have been responsible for any municipal improvements.more important,they argue that the lien was unlawful under the municipal lien code.ann.et,because no improvements were made on lots and for which a lien could be legally placed.they further argue that the township imposed the lien to retaliate against them for successfully challenging the township zoning changes in and to cause financial harm to the plaintiffs.
on march,the township imposed a second municipal lien in the amount of on the subdivisions of palmer business park owned by eastgate.this lien was filed for present and future unfunded escrow review accounts and unfunded escrow accounts for municipal improvements.app.at.on march,himmelreich sent a letter to eastgate on behalf of the township explaining that the lien was intended to serve as a security for the anticipated failure by eastgate to complete municipal improvements and the unlawful depletion of funds held in an escrow account for the township benefit,accomplished by richard and eileen cowell forging signatures of various township officials in order to obtain the release of various funds held in escrow.
the cowells had indeed pled guilty to forgery and theft by receipt of stolen property.however,the plaintiffs contend that the reference to the cowells criminal conduct was a smokescreen and that the lien was imposed for the municipal improvements only.they further allege that the township refused to remove this lien even after it was informed that the plaintiffs had sufficient funds to pay for the municipal improvements.
in april,eastgate filed a chapter bankruptcy petition.as part of their plan of reorganization,eastgate agreed to pay to the township in exchange for a discharge of the lien.eileen cowell also filed for personal bankruptcy.during eileen cowell bankruptcy proceeding,the bankruptcy judge lifted and expunged the lien on july,and thereafter noted in the amended order that a municipal improvement lien can not be filed against a property not so improved.app.at specifically,the bankruptcy judge found that lot was not affected or benefitted by the improvements done on milford street,which was one mile away and in a separate development.
on june,eileen cowell,richard cowell,sylvester pany,and eastgate filed the present suit against palmer township,various township officials,and the township law firm.the complaint alleges that the imposition of the two municipal liens violated the takings clause of the fifth amendment and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,as well as various state laws.
the defendants moved to dismiss all of the claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted pursuant to fed civ.b.the defendants asserted,inter alia,that the actions alleged did not amount to a taking and that the takings claim was not yet ripe.the defendants further asserted that the due process claim was barred by the statute of limitations.in response,the plaintiffs argued that they stated a valid takings claim and that the statute of limitations should not apply because the township had continued to interfere with their development plans after the imposition of the second lien in march.the plaintiffs therefore asked the court to deny the motion to dismiss or,alternatively,to allow them to amend their complaint to include additional allegations.
in a memorandum and order dated december,the district court dismissed the takings and due process claims,declined to allow the plaintiffs to amend their complaint,and dismissed the state law claims without prejudice after declining to exercise jurisdiction over them.
the plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.we have jurisdiction under.
discussion 
a motion to dismiss pursuant to.b may be granted only if,accepting all allegations in the complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to plaintiff,the plaintiff is not entitled to relief.see maio aetna,cir.we have plenary review of a district court dismissal of a complaint pursuant to.b.see id.we review a district court refusal to allow a party to amend its complaint for abuse of discretion.see in re burlington coat factory sec,cir.
takings claim 
the plaintiffs allege that the township and various township officials violated the takings clause by imposing two municipal liens that impaired the value of the plaintiffs properties and deprived them of their right to full control of their properties.the district court ruled that the takings claim was not yet ripe because the plaintiffs had not yet availed themselves of the state procedures for seeking just compensation.in the alternative,the court held that the defendants alleged actions did not rise to the level of a taking.
the fifth amendment proscribes the taking of private property for public use without just compensation.see const.amend.v.it is that this prohibition applies to state and local governments under the fourteenth amendment.see chicago,burlington quincy city of chicago.the supreme court has recognized that just compensation need not be paid in advance of the taking all that is required is that a reasonable,certain and adequate provision for obtaining compensation exist at the time of the taking.williamson county reg l planning comm hamilton bank of johnson city,d quotation omitted.therefore,if a state has provided an adequate procedure for seeking just compensation and a landowner has used those procedures to obtain just compensation,there is no violation of the takings clause.see id.it follows that if a state provides an adequate procedure for seeking just compensation,the property owner can not claim a violation of the takings clause until it has used the procedure and been denied just compensation.id.at.
pennsylvania eminent domain code provides inverse condemnation procedures through which a landowner may seek just compensation for the taking of property.see.ann,e,indeed,many landowners have invoked these procedures to seek just compensation for takings.see,in re prop.situate along pine in earl township,gross city of pittsburgh,airport auth.wbf.
in the case at hand,the plaintiffs do not contend that they attempted to use these procedures but were denied just compensation.instead,they argue they were not required to file an inverse condemnation petition because the township did not have legal authority under the eminent domain code or any other power to impose the liens.in addition,they claim that they exhausted state remedies by raising the merits of the two liens in bankruptcy court.
we reject the plaintiffs arguments.the plaintiffs ability to file an inverse condemnation petition in state court in order to obtain just compensation was not related to the township right to impose the liens.in addition,adjudication in federal bankruptcy court is not an appropriate alternative to the state inverse condemnation procedures.as the township notes,the bankruptcy courts never determined whether there had been a taking of the plaintiffs property.because the plaintiffs have not availed themselves of the appropriate procedures under pennsylvania law to obtain just compensation,we agree with the district court that their takings claim is not ripe.
even if the plaintiffs takings claim were ripe,the defendants actions do not amount to a taking.the plaintiffs argue the two liens amounted to a regulatory taking because the liens forced them to reduce the sale price for their properties and caused them financial distress.however,a regulatory taking occurs only when the government action deprives a landowner of all economically viable uses of his or her property.see lucas south carolina coastal council,d.
a municipal lien does not deprive the landowner of all economically viable uses of the property.rather,a lien is merely a charge upon property by which a lien creditor has the right to execute on that property in order to satisfy a debt or other obligation.unity sav.ass am.urban sci.under pennsylvania law,the filing of a lien does not affect the debtor use of that property until foreclosure.see winpenny krotow,cir citing.stat.ann.though the liens in the case at hand may have prevented the plaintiffs from entering into certain transactions,they did not foreclose all economically viable uses of the land.therefore,we agree with the district court that the imposition of the liens did not constitute a taking 
due process claim 
the plaintiffs also allege that the imposition of the two liens,one for and the other for,violated their due process rights under the fourteenth amendment.the district court held that these claims were barred by the statute of limitations for claims brought under.the court specifically ruled that the continuing violations doctrine did not apply because the defendants last affirmative act occurred in with the imposition of the second lien.
as the plaintiffs concede,the applicable statute of limitations for their claims is two years.see sameric of delaware city of philadelphia,cir.they argue,however,that the continuing violations doctrine should have been applied to toll the limitations period because the defendants engaged in a continuing campaign of affirmative acts that interfered with their substantive due process rights.br.of appellants at 
the continuing violations doctrine is an equitable exception to the timely filing requirement.west philadelphia,cir.thus,when a defendant conduct is part of a continuing practice,an action is timely so long as the last act evidencing the continuing practice falls within the limitations period in such an instance,the court will grant relief for the earlier related acts that would otherwise be time barred.brenner local,united of carpenters and joiners of,cir.
in order to benefit from the doctrine,a plaintiff must establish that the defendant conduct is more than the occurrence of isolated or sporadic acts.west,at quotation omitted.regarding this inquiry,we have recognized that courts should consider at least three factors subject the violations constitute the same type of discrimination,tending to connect them in a continuing violation the acts are recurring or more in the nature of isolated incidents and degree of the act had a degree of permanence which should trigger the plaintiff awareness of and duty to assert rights and whether the consequences of the act would continue even in the absence of a continuing intent to discriminate.see id.at citing berry board of supervisors of louisiana state,cir.the consideration of degree of permanence is the most important of the factors.see berry,at.
the continuing violations doctrine has been most frequently applied in employment discrimination claims.see,west philadelphia electric,bronze shields,new jersey of civil,cir jewett int l and,cir.however,this has not precluded the application of the doctrine to other contexts.see brenner,applying the doctrine to a claim brought under the national labor relations act centifanti nix,cir applying the doctrine to a procedural due process claim brought under.
at issue in this case is whether this equitable doctrine should be applied to toll the statute of limitations for the plaintiffs substantive due process claim the plaintiffs appear to offer two theories for application of the continuing violations doctrine here.first,they argue that the two municipal liens were continuing violations of their substantive due process rights until they were either lifted or expunged.specifically,the lien remained in effect until july,when it was expunged by a bankruptcy judge.the lien was in place until july,at the earliest,when eastgate negotiated its bankruptcy reorganization plan which included a payment to the township for settlement of that lien.therefore,according to the plaintiffs,their substantive due process claim was timely raised because their complaint was filed on june.
we disagree with the plaintiffs interpretation of a continuing violation and therefore reject this theory.the focus of the continuing violations doctrine is on affirmative acts of the defendants.see delaware state college ricks,d sameric,at corporate center township of bridgewater,cir.the mere existence of the liens does not amount to a continuing violation.neither was the township refusal to remove the lien an affirmative act of a continuing violation.
the cases cited by the plaintiffs do not require a different result.in united states dickinson,a landowner brought a claim against the federal government seeking compensation for flooding of lands that had been authorized by the government.the government argued that the claim was but the supreme court disagreed.the court held that the flooding was a continuous event and therefore the limitations period began to run when the flooding had stabilized,rather than when the flooding first began
