donald weems and michael briggs,registered sex offenders living in arkansas,brought this action pursuant to.they challenged provisions of the arkansas sex offender registration act that require sex offenders to register with the state as well as a criminal statute that prohibits certain registered sex offenders from living within two thousand feet of a school or daycare center.the district court granted defendants motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim and denied plaintiffs motion for class certification.we affirm.
in,the arkansas general assembly enacted the sex child offender registration act.the general assembly determined that sex offenders pose a high risk of reoffending after release from custody,that protecting the public from sex offenders is a primary governmental interest,that the privacy interest of persons adjudicated guilty of sex offenses is less important than the government interest in public safety,and that the release of certain information about sex offenders to criminal justice agencies and the general public will assist in protecting the public safety.ann.the act,now titled the sex offender registration act,id,requires registration by any person adjudicated guilty of,or serving a sentence for,a sex offense as defined in any person who has committed a sex offense but was institutionalized or acquitted on grounds of a mental disease and any person previously required to register under the habitual child sex offender registration act.id.a.a person who sustained a conviction for a sex offense in another state and subsequently moved to arkansas is likewise required to register.id.a a.sex offenders required to register must provide name and address,employment information,a statement of the crime or crimes committed,and other demographic data.id.b.
in,the legislature amended the sex offender registration act to provide for the establishment of a sex offender assessment committee,a committee appointed by the governor and charged with promulgat ing guidelines and procedures for the disclosure of relevant and necessary information regarding sex offenders to the public.id.c a see id.the guidelines and procedures are to regulate the scope of information disclosed to the community,depending upon the sex offender level of dangerousness,the sex offender pattern of offending behavior,and the extent to which the information will enhance community safety.id.c b.
the amendments also require sex offenders to undergo a risk assessment designed to predict future risk that the offender will recidivate.the committee is charged with identifying factors relevant to a sex offender future dangerousness and likelihood of reoffense or threat to the community.id.c a.the guidelines promulgated by the committee define four levels of risk low,moderate,high,and sexually violent predator.the sex offender guidelines procedures for implementing risk assessment cmty.notification regarding sex offenders,at hereafter guidelines,reprinted in at.the guidelines provide for broader disclosure of information to the public as the risk level increases.id.at.
examiners performing risk assessments for sex offenders consider actuarial analyses,information obtained from interview,psychological testing and evaluation,review of relevant records and historical data,and a polygraph or penile plethysmograph.id.at.using information gathered from the assessment,examiners determine the applicable level of risk,with one exception.ann.b,e.examiners do not have authority to categorize sex offenders as level,sexually violent predators.this categorization can be made only by the sentencing court,id,with the examiner role limited to providing a report recommending to the court whether to categorize the offender as a sexually violent predator.id.a.
offenders may challenge their assigned risk level by submitting a written request for administrative review.id.b a.under this procedure,the offender may request copies of all documents generated by the examiners,a listing of all documents that may be available from other agencies,and a copy of the tape of the interview.id.b b.a member of the committee is assigned to conduct the administrative review within days of receiving a request for review.id.b a.the member may set aside the assigned risk level if it is not supported by substantial evidence,if the governing rules and procedures were not properly followed,or if there is new information that has a bearing on the risk that the sex offender poses to the community.id.b b.until administrative review is completed,notification to the community of an offender assigned risk status shall be made only at the level immediately below the level upon which review has been requested.id.b.community notification commences five calendar days after the committee mails the finding of the administrative review to the offender.id.a i 
if the administrative review does not alter the assigned risk level,the sex offender has the right to file a petition for judicial review in an arkansas circuit court,pursuant to the arkansas administrative procedure act.id.b a ii.the filing of a petition does not automatically stay community notification,but the reviewing court may do so upon such terms as may be just.ann.c.the arkansas apa provides that the court may reverse or modify the decision of the committee if it is in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions,in excess of the agency statutory authority,made upon unlawful procedure,affected by other error or law,not supported by substantial evidence in the record,or arbitrary,capricious,or characterized by abuse of discretion.id.h.
in,the arkansas general assembly enacted a residency restriction for level high risk offenders and level sexually violent predators.offenders in these classes are not permitted to reside within two thousand feet of the property on which any public or private elementary or secondary school or daycare facility is located.ann.a.the statute excludes from the residency restriction any level or offender residing in a property he owned and occupied before the school or daycare center opened or before july.id.b,c.but if an offender who satisfies one of the exceptions commits another sexual offense either after july,or after a new school or daycare center opens,he is no longer exempt.id.b,c.a sex offender who is required to register and knowingly violates the residency restriction is guilty of a class d felony.id.d.
weems was found guilty of indecent exposure in pulaski county,arkansas,on march.indecent exposure is a sex offense that subjects weems to the registration and assessment requirements,and an examiner assessed weems as a level,high risk offender.after serving a prison term,weems moved into housing in little rock in may.weems received a letter dated february,from the chief of police in little rock,advising him that he was in violation of the residency restriction,and ordering him to relocate.
briggs was found guilty of rape in hartford county,maryland,in.in march,after serving fifteen years of his sentence,briggs moved into his mother house,located in pine bluff,arkansas,and established permanent residence there.pursuant to the registration act,briggs registered and underwent a risk assessment,after which he was assessed as a level risk.on april,briggs received notice that by living in his mother home,he was in violation of the residency restriction and was required to relocate.
weems and briggs challenge the constitutionality of both the registration act and the residency restriction.they alleged in the district court that the statutes violate the doctrines of substantive and procedural due process.they also asserted that the registration act and guidelines are unconstitutionally vague,that the residency restriction violates their equal protection rights by treating property owners and level and sex offenders differently than owning level and offenders,and that the residency restriction violates their substantive due process rights to reside with family members and to unrestricted interstate and intrastate travel.they further alleged that the residency restriction is an unconstitutional ex post facto law that retroactively punishes sex offenders who committed their crimes before july,
the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.although it found that the plaintiffs interests in their reputation and privacy are substantial,the district court,applying mathews eldridge,d,held that the due process clause does not require the state to extend the rights to counsel and to confront witnesses to the risk assessment process,and that arkansas provided sufficient procedures.the court also concluded that the registration act is not unconstitutionally vague,that the residency restriction does not violate the equal protection rights of owning level and sex offenders,that the act and residency restriction do not violate sex offenders substantive due process rights,and that the residency restriction does not violate the ex post facto clause.
we recently considered several issues raised by weems and briggs in connection with an iowa statute that imposed a residency restriction for certain sex offenders.doe miller,cir,cert.denied,d.in miller,as relevant here,we held that an iowa statute that included a residency restriction did not violate the substantive due process rights or right to intrastate travel of sex offenders,and did not constitute an unconstitutional ex post facto law.the iowa statute differed from the arkansas law in two principal ways.the iowa statute was narrower in that it applied only to offenders convicted of sex offenses against minors,while the arkansas law applies to some sex offenses in which adults were victimized.the restrictions of the iowa statute affected offenders more broadly,however,because they applied to every sex offender convicted of an enumerated offense,without any individualized assessment.as explained,the arkansas statute provides for an administrative process to assign a risk level to each offender on a basis.despite these differences,the principles discussed in miller are highly instructive with respect to several of the claims raised by weems and briggs in this case.
like the sex offenders in miller,weems and briggs assert that the arkansas residency restriction violates their rights under the doctrine of substantive due process,because the statute,in their view,infringes on a constitutional right to reside in a certain place,with family members.in miller,we rejected a similar appeal to precedents involving intimate human relationships,see roberts united states jaycees,d griswold connecticut,d,and concluded that a comparable residency restriction did not implicate any fundamental right of the sex offenders that would require strict scrutiny of the statute.miller,at.we reasoned that because the statute did not operate directly on the family relationship,id.at,the residency restriction did not infringe upon a constitutional liberty interest relating to matters of marriage and family in a fashion that requires heightened scrutiny.id.at accord state seering,iowa see also bowen gilliard,d lyng castillo,d.
our holding in miller controls the level of scrutiny applicable to the arkansas residency restriction.because the residency restriction does not infringe upon a fundamental right,we consider only whether the statute rationally advances some legitimate government purpose.miller,at.the arkansas legislature undoubtedly has a legitimate interest in protecting children from the most dangerous sex offenders,see.dep t of pub.safety doe,d,and we believe that a residency restriction designed to reduce proximity between the most dangerous offenders and locations frequented by children is within the range of rational policy options available to a state legislature charged with protecting the health and welfare of its citizens.miller,at.indeed,weems and briggs rest their substantive due process argument entirely on the proposition that strict scrutiny should apply.we therefore conclude that the arkansas statute does not contravene the doctrine of substantive due process.
appellants next contend that the residency restriction violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment because it treats owning level and sex offenders differently from property owners or level and offenders.they argue that the residency restriction interferes with a fundamental right to acquire,enjoy,own and dispose of property,such that it is subject to strict scrutiny.the district court concluded that as long as the statute was rationally related to a legitimate state interest,the residency restriction did not deprive appellants of the equal protection of the laws.
we agree with the district court that the rational basis standard of review applies to this equal protection claim.the distinctions drawn by the arkansas statute are not based on a suspect classification such as race or religion,shelley kraemer,and the statute does not implicate a fundamental right under equal protection jurisprudence,such as the right to vote.kramer union free sch.dist,d.outside of these two categories,rationality review governs statutory classifications based on property ownership.see nordlinger hahn,d wmx technologies,gasconade county,cir.for reasons previously discussed,we further agree with the district court that the residency restriction applied to high risk offenders and sexually violent predators is rationally related to the state legitimate interest in protecting the safety of children.see miller,at.
weems and briggs also contend that the residency restriction infringes on a constitutional right to intrastate travel.we rejected an identical contention in miller,where we held that even assuming such a right is recognized,it would not be implicated by a residency restriction for sex offenders.id.at.we observed that the iowa residency restriction did not prevent a sex offender from entering or leaving any part of the state,and it did not erect any actual barrier to intrastate movement.id.
appellants contend that the arkansas law is more restrictive than the iowa statute,because the registration act defines residency to include place of employment,training,or education.ann.b.a sex offender must register if he establishes residency in arkansas.thus,if a sex offender lives in a neighboring state,but works or attends school in arkansas,then the offender must comply with the registration act.this requirement serves the purpose of notifying the community that a sex offender is within a particular municipality or county on a regular basis.
the definition of residency for purposes of registration in section b,however,appears in a different chapter of the arkansas code than the residency restriction,and the definition does not by its terms apply to the criminal statute that makes it unlawful for a sex offender to reside within feet of a school or daycare facility.ann.a.chapter does not define the term reside,and we do not assume that the general assembly and the governor necessarily intended to apply the broad definition of residency when crafting a restriction on where a sex offender may reside.there is no indication in this record that the state has moved to enforce the residency restriction to prohibit sex offenders from working or studying within feet of a school or daycare center,and we see no good reason to create more difficult constitutional questions by adopting a broad construction that the state itself eschews.we thus employ the normal rule that terms are given their ordinary and usually accepted meaning,williams state,and we construe reside to mean to dwell permanently or continuously.webster third new international dictionary.on this understanding,the residency restriction in arkansas is no broader than the restriction at issue in miller,and for the same reasons discussed there,we conclude that the arkansas law does not infringe on a constitutional right to intrastate travel.at.
weems and briggs also argue that the arkansas residency restriction constitutes an unconstitutional ex post facto law as applied to offenders who sustained convictions prior to the enactment of the statute.we addressed this same argument in miller,and concluded that iowa residency restriction was not so punitive in purpose or effect to negate the legis
