this case arises from a dispute involving indian housing block grants made under the native american housing assistance and self determination act of nahasda.since,crow tribal housing authority crow housing or the tribe located in montana,has received nahasda grant payments from the department of housing and urban development hud.in,hud realized that it had overpaid crow housing and sought to recover the overage through deductions from future grants.hud did not provide crow housing with a hearing at which these deductions could be contested,and this appeal concerns whether that was improper.the district court held that hud acted under and,and that it violated the tribe right to notice and a hearing.this appeal followed.
because the record establishes that hud actions triggered but did not violate that section hearing requirement,we reverse the district court judgment.
background 
statutory and regulatory framework 
nahasda was enacted primarily to provid e affordable homes in safe and healthy environments for members of indian tribes,in a way that recognizes the right of indian and tribal.it replaced several disparate housing assistance programs with the indian housing block grant program.the act authorizes hud to allocate grants among recipient tribes.id.a.because all tribes receive grants from the same finite pool of funds,see,overpayments to one tribe directly reduce the funds available for other tribes.
hud uses an allocation formula that considers a tribe formula current assisted stock fcas and need.the fcas is the product of multiplying a fixed subsidy by the number of housing units a tribe owns or operates.id.fcas accounts for certain housing units until a tribe no longer has the legal right to own,operate,or maintain the unit s,whether such right is lost by conveyance,demolition,or otherwise.id.a.to ensure fcas accuracy,hud requires recipient tribes to update the status of their housing units in an annual formula response form,and to remove units no longer eligible for inclusion in the formula.id.because hud uses these updates to calculate annual grants,removal of units directly reduces a tribe annual grant amount.see id.
if a tribe fails to comply with nahasda,the act provides for certain remedies.subsection a requires hud to offer reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing before finding that a tribe has failed to comply substantially and before imposing those remedies.remedial action is mandatory upon a finding of substantial noncompliance under this section.id.a.
under,hud may also adjust a tribe grant amount after an audit or review,but adjustments imposed pursuant to are not mandatory.
ii.factual background and administrative proceedings 
inspector general audit 
in august,hud office of the inspector general oig issued a report indicating that it had performed a nationwide audit to evaluate nahasda program implementation.during the audit,oig performed visits at housing entities within four of the six office of native american programs onap regions.though the audit was described as nationwide,the map of the entities visited shows that oig performed no visits in the northern plains region,which covers montana and crow housing.oig objective was not to audit the tribes but to assess nahasda program performance as a whole.during the visits,oig tested the accuracy of hud fcas data to determine if the housing entities received correct funding.oig discovered fcas inaccuracies,and determined that hud had over funded some housing entities and under funded others.the report references recommendations oig made to onap in may,when it suggested that the office a udit the fcas for all housing entities,r ecover over funding,and reallocate the recovery to recipients that were under funded.
onap responded to the recommendations within days 
the onap has taken several actions to ensure that tribes are reporting accurate information on formula current assisted stock fcas this includes guidances to both tribes and area onap staff,the annual formula response form and a letter to tribal leaders.we have incorporated the monitoring of fcas in our monitoring.however,resources are not adequate to provide monitoring to each grantee.
hud correspondence with crow housing 
the record contains no evidence that hud performed monitoring of crow housing in,or at any point before.but by some means,in hud discovered that from through,it had overpaid crow housing for units that were no longer eligible for fcas consideration.in a september letter,hud informed crow housing it had been overpaid because several units had been conveyed or were eligible for conveyance.the letter gave notice to crow housing that hud planned to recover the overpayments,and that the tribe should contact hud within days of the date of th e letter if it disagreed.
crow housing did not respond.in january,hud sent a second letter indicating it had not heard from the tribe,and that it was writing to confirm agreement with hud information and to determine a repayment plan to recover any funds.because it needed to finalize the matter,hud informed crow housing that if it did not respond within days,hud would assume it acceded to repayment.
crow housing silence persisted.in june,hud sent a third letter enclosing copies of its two previous letters and stating that the agency had updated the calculations and determined the overpayment amount.hud also set forth a schedule to recoup that amount through adjustments to crow housing grants over the course of five subsequent fiscal years.
more than a year passed.in november,crow housing provided its first response on the issue.it requested copies of the first two hud letters and indicated it would make the substantive argument against hud position upon receipt of those letters.hud supplied copies of its earlier letters and informed crow housing that although it had made deductions to the tribe and allocations,the agency failed to remove the ineligible units from its subsequent calculations,resulting in continued overpayments.hud added the additional overpayments to the balance resulting in a total of and invited crow housing to establish a new repayment plan within days.
on site review and administrative appeal 
crow housing met with hud in april and asked the agency to suspend the repayment schedule until hud performed an review.hud agreed.in august it conducted a monitoring review of the tribe fcas,and determined a new outstanding balance of for crow housing overpayments.in october,hud informed crow housing of its decision and of the tribe right to appeal.crow housing asked hud to reconsider,claiming that the agency unlawfully sought to terminate,reduce limit the tribe federal funding.crow housing did not argue that hud deprived it of a hearing,nor did it request one.
hud denied crow housing request for reconsideration.
iii.district court proceedings 
crow housing filed a complaint in the district of montana,alleging that hud violated nahasda by finding the tribe to be in substantial noncompliance with the act provisions without offering an opportunity for hearing.both parties agreed there had been no hearing,and in february the district court ruled on the parties for summary judgment.
first,the district court granted partial summary judgment to hud,holding that the agency acted within its statutory authority when it adjusted crow housing fcas account.the court concluded hud properly reduced the number of units under crow housing has not appealed that decision.
second,the district court granted partial summary judgment to crow housing,ruling that hud acted under and when it sought to recover the overpayments.the district court concluded that hud action was arbitrary and capricious because it violated crow housing right to nahasda notice and hearing requirements for substantial noncompliance.notably,the district court held that hud violated the notice and hearing requirements under both a and and remanded the matter to hud for a hearing 
hud timely appealed the second portion of the district court summary judgment ruling.hud argues that it may recover overpayments without a formal hearing if it does not rely on a finding of substantial noncompliance under,and further argues that it did not act under or because it exercised its common law authority to recover payments made by mistake.in the alternative,hud asserts that even if it did act under,crow housing was not entitled to a hearing.
hud recovery of the overpayments it made to crow housing is on hold,pending the outcome of this litigation.

discussion 
this appeal poses a single question was crow housing entitled to a hearing before hud took action to recover its overpayments of nahasda funds the answer to this question depends on the authority hud invoked when it sought to recover the overpayments.hud letters cited a and a for the authority to adjust fcas counts,but they did not indicate the source of hud authority to recover the overpayments.the district court concluded that hud invoked its authority under and,and that it violated notice and hearing requirements under both sections.the two sections are the only ones cited by the parties in the district court and on appeal,and we know of no other hearing provisions relevant to this case.we assess the applicability of each section in turn.
hud did not act under.
on appeal,crow housing relies on the district court determination that hud acted under.when hud acts under that section,a grantee tribe is plainly entitled to a hearing.subsection a requires that hud take action if,after notice and an opportunity to be heard,it makes a finding that a grant recipient is in substantial noncompliance 
i f the secretary finds after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing that a recipient of assistance under this chapter has failed to comply substantially with any provision of this chapter,the secretary shall 
a terminate payments under this chapter to the recipient 
b reduce payments under this chapter to the recipient by an amount equal to the amount of such payments that were not expended in accordance with this chapter 
c limit the availability of payments under this chapter to programs,projects,or activities not affected by such failure to comply or 
d in the case of noncompliance described in section b of this title,provide a replacement tribally designated housing entity for the recipient,under section of this title.
emphasis added.
in,congress added another subsection to a the failure of a recipient to comply with the requirements of section b of this title regarding the reporting of dwelling units shall not,in itself,be considered to be substantial noncompliance for purposes of this subchapter.id.a emphasis added.the senate report makes clear that the amendment was a clarification,not a substantive change to the statute 
clarification on availability of administrative hearing amends section a of current law under this amendment,if a grant recipient is required to relinquish overpaid funds due to the inclusion of housing units deemed ineligible under section,the action does not constitute substantial by the grantee and does not automatically trigger a formal administrative hearing process.the amendment has been included due to the significant amount of time and resources involved in a hearing,which may not be necessary when a grant recipient is otherwise in compliance with the requirements of the act.
at emphasis added.we have long recognized that clarifying legislation is not subject to any presumption against retroactivity and is applied to all cases pending as of the date of its enactment.abkco music,lavere,cir.we honor congress s clarification label and accept a as a statement of what the statute has meant all along.id.at alterations omitted quoting beverly cmty.hosp.ass belshe,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we therefore apply a to hud actions in this case,and analyze with the understanding that failure to update fcas counts shall not,in itself,be considered to be substantial noncompliance.
the record contains no evidence that hud found crow housing to be in substantial noncompliance.see fort belknap hous.dep t office of pub.indian,cir holding hud did not act under where there was no evidence hud found substantial noncompliance.instead,the agency correspondence to crow housing repeatedly indicated that the overpayments were the result of errors,without attributing those errors to the tribe.in correspondence dated september,january,and june,hud stated that the tribe may have incorrectly received funding for units under the formula current assisted stock fcas component of the indian housing block grant ihbg formula.even after its review,hud continued to indicate that the tribe incorrectly received credit,without attributing fault.hud letters did not state that the tribe had failed to substantially comply with nahasda.in fact,hud february letter asserted that the agency itself was partly at fault for the continuation of the overpayments after a repayment schedule had been put in place w e discovered that there was an error made in data entry and,as a result,the units were not removed from the fy and allocations.
all of hud letters cited,but that regulation merely defines when units no longer qualify as fcas none of hud letters mention or substantial noncompliance with nahasda and none of them seek to impose the remedies and sanctions listed in.the record contains no evidence that hud tried to terminate payments,reduce payments in an amount equal to payments not properly expended limit the availability of payments for other programs or projects,or provide a replacement housing entity.see fort belknap,at holding hud administrative offset does not constitute a a remedy.hud only attempted to recover the overpayments through a reduction to future grant distributions a remedy consistent with.
we conclude that hud did not act under,and,accordingly,could not have violated a hearing requirement under that section.we therefore turn to whether hud actions fell under its authority.
ii.hud actions were consistent with.
hud disputes that it acted under,but the record in this case compels the conclusion that hud actions triggered the opportunity for a hearing under this statutory provision.
subsections b and d permit hud to adjust a tribe grant amount after conducting a review or audit 
b additional reviews and audits 
in general 
in addition to any audit or review under subsection a of this section,to the extent the secretary determines such action to be appropriate,the secretary may conduct an audit or review of a recipient in order to

d effect of reviews
