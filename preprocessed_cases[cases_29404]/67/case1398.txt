the plaintiffs,alvin and linda phipps phipps,john and elizabeth clair,and shawn and lorene starkey starkey filed a putative class action lawsuit in missouri state court,seeking to recover allegedly unlawful fees charged on second mortgage loans by guaranty national bank of tallahassee gnbt.gnbt and other defendants removed to the federal district court which denied the plaintiffs motion to remand and granted the defendants motions to dismiss.we affirm.
background 
the plaintiffs purport to represent a class of missouri borrowers who took out second mortgage loans from gnbt,a federally chartered national bank located in florida and regulated by the office of the comptroller of currency occ the plaintiffs filed a putative class action in missouri state court against gnbt,and also against funding corporation rfc,household finance corporation iii household,and other defendants.the plaintiffs alleged gnbt charged them unlawful fees on their second mortgage loans,in violation of missouri second mortgage loan act smla,and later sold the second mortgage loans to the other defendants,including rfc and household.the plaintiffs claim gnbt unlawfully charged loan origination,loan discount,underwriting,and application fees settlement fees abstract fees title search and examination fees and document review fees,together with charging high interest rates all as part of a scheme to make loans to missouri borrowers,as well as borrowers across the country.the plaintiffs also claim the loan origination and loan discount fees actually were finder fees paid to a third party,equity guaranty llc equity,although the plaintiffs signed settlement statements with the department of housing and urban development hud stating these fees were paid to gnbt.the plaintiffs further claim gnbt and equity conspired to give the appearance of making these loans through a national bank to avoid the consumer protection laws of the states.
in their state court petition complaint,the plaintiffs sought a refund of the allegedly unlawful fees and interest paid and also sought to enjoin the defendants from collecting interest on the loans.phipps allege they were charged interest on a loan,and clair and starkey claim they were charged interest on and loans,respectively.the district court noted missouri usury law currently caps interest rates at.see.however,the plaintiffs strenuously argue their claims are based on unlawful fees charged,not unlawful interest.
the defendants removed the case to federal court based on federal question jurisdiction.the plaintiffs sought remand,claiming they had not stated a claim for excessive interest against the defendants,so federal jurisdiction did not exist.in response,the defendants argued the plaintiffs claims are usury claims against a national bank.the defendants contended federal law preempts the claims,because the fees charged were actually interest under the broad definition afforded that term under federal law.thus,the defendants argued the federal court had jurisdiction.further,the defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs claims,because the complaint did not state a claim for which relief could be granted.household also moved to dismiss,claiming the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue household,as it did not hold any of the plaintiffs mortgages.
the district court denied the plaintiffs motion to remand,concluding the loan origination and discount fees fit within the occ definition of interest,so under federal law,the plaintiffs claims were for interest,not fees.the court ruled federal statutes governing national banks create an exclusive cause of action against national banks for usury thus,no state law cause of action exists.next,because the plaintiffs attempted to assert a usury claim against a national bank based upon the smla,a missouri statute,the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim for which relief could be granted.finally,the court concluded household motion to dismiss was moot,but granted the motion,because the claims against household derived from those against gnbt.

preemption 
a defendant may remove a state law claim to federal court when the federal court would have had original jurisdiction if the suit originally had been filed there.see b.removal based on federal question jurisdiction is usually governed by the complaint rule.krispin may dep t stores,cir.this rule provides that federal jurisdiction may be invoked only where a federal question is presented on the face of the plaintiff properly pleaded complaint.id.the rule also makes the plaintiff the master of the claim,allowing the plaintiff to avoid federal jurisdiction by exclusive reliance on state law.caterpillar williams,d.an independent corollary to this general rule is the complete preemption doctrine,under which the preemptive force of certain federal statutes is deemed so extraordinary as to convert complaints purportedly based on the preempted state law into complaints stating federal claims from their inception.krispin,at citing caterpillar,at.only claims falling within the preemptive scope of a federal statute are considered to invoke federal question jurisdiction,and the presence of even a single federal claim gives the defendant the right to remove an entire case to federal court.gaming of am.dorsey whitney,cir.
the national bank act nba,authorizes a national bank to charge interest at the rate allowed by the laws of the state in which the bank is located.krispin,at citing the nba preempts actions challenging the lawfulness of the interest charged by a national bank.in beneficial national bank anderson,d,the supreme court held sections and of the nba supersede both the substantive and the remedial provisions of state usury laws and create a federal remedy for overcharges that is exclusive,even when a state complainant relies entirely on state law.the court reasoned u niform rules limiting the liability of national banks and prescribing exclusive remedies for their overcharges are an integral part of a banking system that needed protection from possible unfriendly state legislation.id.at.citation omitted.because and provide the exclusive cause of action for such claims,there is,in short,no such thing as a claim of usury against a national bank.even though the complaint makes no mention of federal law,it unquestionably and unambiguously claims that petitioners violated usury laws.id.at.see also krispin,at we have held that sections and completely preempt state law claims of usury brought against a national bank.
as the district court observed,the remand issue here boils down to whether the plaintiffs brought a claim of unlawful interest charged by the defendants,notwithstanding the plaintiffs protestations their claims focused on unlawful fees.the plaintiffs argue the loan origination and discount fees were merely finder fees paid to equity,which they contend are excluded from the occ definition of interest.however,we are required to look beyond the plaintiffs artful attempts to characterize their claims to avoid federal jurisdiction,nahas,first bank of hot springs,cir,to determine whether the plaintiffs actually allege unlawful interest claims without expressly using the word interest.
