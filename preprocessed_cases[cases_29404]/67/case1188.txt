when norwest mortgage,failed properly to pay two tax installments on property mortgaged by marshall and cindy parks,a bureaucratic snarl ensued.the parkses,along with norwest,became enmeshed in a legal fight to avoid losing their home.although they eventually succeeded in defeating the claim of a tax scavenger who had fraudulently obtained a tax deed on the parkses home,the parkses blamed norwest for allowing the situation to get out of hand.they sued norwest now part of wells fargo home mortgage,for breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,and violation of duties imposed by the illinois consumer fraud act cfa,ilcs,invoking the federal court diversity jurisdiction.norwest was a minnesota corporation with its principal place of business in that state wells fargo is incorporated in california and has its principal place of business in iowa the parkses,who originally alleged only that they are residents of illinois,have now made it clear on the record that they are citizens of illinois.we refer to the as norwest,in keeping with the usage in the district court opinion.
the parkses prevailed on all points in the district court a jury found in their favor on their breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty claims and awarded emotional distress and punitive damages totaling over million the court found norwest liable under the cfa and gave the parkses additional damages as well as attorneys fees.norwest appeals,arguing that the breach of contract and fiduciary duty claims can not support emotional distress and punitive damages.it also contests its liability under the cfa.although we sympathize with the parkses frustration,we conclude that the law is on norwest side.we therefore vacate the award of damages for emotional distress and the punitive damages and reverse the district court finding of liability under the cfa.
the parkses owned two adjacent properties,each with its own tax identification number.in,the parkses obtained a mortgage from norwest on one of the two lots.illinois law provides for two methods of paying one property taxes the property owner may pledge assets and be responsible for paying taxes herself or she may set up an escrow account with the mortgagee,who in that case is responsible for paying the taxes out of the escrow account.the parkses chose to use the second method and had norwest handle their property taxes.
in,the parkses combined the two lots.the combined parcel was given a new tax identification number.when the service company norwest used to administer its property tax obligations paid the taxes for the first installment of which was due in may,the company found the new parcel number and paid accordingly.by the time the second installment was due august,however,norwest had stopped using that facility.norwest did not detect the change in tax identification numbers instead,it erroneously made the payment using the prior,number.because of the error,that tax payment was returned to norwest.norwest redeposited the payment into the escrow account and the second payment was never made.norwest claimed that it sent a letter to the parkses advising them about the refund and asking for any information about it the parkses denied ever receiving any such letter,and apart from a computer log indicating that the letter was sent,no evidence of the letter ever turned up.
in the meantime,because the august payment was never properly made,the tax authority considered the parkses taxes delinquent in that amount.kathy artman,an alert tax scavenger,spotted the fact that the county records showed no august payment for the taxes.she moved,as it turned out,too purchased the taxes at a december tax sale.she gave no notice to either the parkses or to norwest local office.it does appear that in february,artman sent a notice to norwest national headquarters,but that notice was never routed to the appropriate office.
after the glitch,norwest continued to pay the taxes on the parkses property,using the correct tax identification number from may through august.the true situation emerged with the second installment of the taxes for,which was due in september.both artman and norwest paid the taxes.ironically,this seems to have been only the second time artman had paid taxes on the property.the county received artman payment first.when norwest payment arrived,it was again returned and credited to the parkses escrow account.
the period of redemption associated with the tax sale ended on december.the parkses failed to redeem,and the tax deed was awarded to artman on december.once again,artman did nothing to notify the parkses of this event,but she falsely verified in state court that she had given notice of her acquisition of the deed to the parkses through personal service.
on saturday,january,artman appeared at the parkses residence and claimed that she owned the property.on monday,the parkses notified norwest,which immediately put two researchers on the job to find out what could be going on.their investigation revealed at last that the second tax payment had been returned and that norwest had contacted the county in december after it failed to hear from the parkses.according to norwest notes,the county informed them that the first half was also paid by customer.norwest thought that the county must have meant the second half had that been so,it was understandable that norwest payment was returned,because it would have been duplicative.the county,however,meant what it said.it was artman who had made the second payment,not the parkses.norwest tax department also discovered the february take notice letter from artman that had been misrouted and never sent to the tax department.at that point,norwest retained counsel to fight the execution of the tax deed.
on february,the parkses filed an emergency motion to stay execution of the tax deed judgment in state court.the next day the court stayed the order of possession and gave leave to norwest to intervene.norwest and the parkses moved to vacate the tax deed on the basis that artman had fraudulently procured the deed by lying about the notice.the court agreed and vacated the deed judgment,finding that artman had committed actual fraud in falsely swearing in her petition that she had caused the sheriff to make personal service on parties residing in the county,when she did not.
norwest redeemed the taxes and the tax deed was vacated in august.five months later,the court issued an order stating that it vacate d and extinguish ed all right,title,interest,claim or demand,whatsoever that kathy artman may have acquired in the parkses property.the parkses also negotiated an agreement with artman whereby she paid part of the parkses legal expenses.unsatisfied,the parkses then brought the present lawsuit against norwest.the breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty claims were tried to a jury,which found for the parkses on january.the jury awarded the parkses in compensatory damages,in emotional distress damages,and million in punitive damages.the illinois consumer fraud act claim was tried to the court,which found in favor of the parkses on march,awarding damages,attorneys fees,and costs.norwest moved for a new trial,or in the alternative,for remittitur of the punitive damages.the district court denied the new trial but did reduce the punitive damages to.norwest appeal covers everything except its liability for the in compensatory damages.
we consider first norwest challenge to the emotional damage component of the jury verdict in the breach of contract and breach of fiduciary part of the case.illinois,whose law applies to this case,does not ordinarily allow punitive and emotional distress damages for breaches of contract.see morrow goldschmidt,holding that a plaintiff must prove an independent tort to recover exemplary damages.d amages for breach will not be given as compensation for mental suffering,except where the breach was wanton or reckless and caused bodily harm,or where defendant had reason to know,when the contract was made,that its breach would cause mental suffering for reasons other than mere pecuniary loss.maere churchill,d.even in cases where plaintiffs have sued builders and contrac
