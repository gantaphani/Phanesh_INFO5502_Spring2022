tylene and larry coonts collectively referred to as the coontses and individually by their first names appeal the district court summary judgment in favor of gary koop,vernon johnson,trampus taylor,hobie johnson,and john potts collectively referred to as appellees and individually by their last names.the coontses sued the appellees on claims for violation of their civil rights,trespass,illegal arrest,malicious prosecution,and conversion revolving around the seizure of several pieces of furniture.the coontses and their attorney also appeal the district court assessment of sanctions against counsel under federal rule of civil procedure.we affirm the district court decision.
the essential facts are not in dispute.this action stems from the appellees retrieval through a writ of execution of furniture and appliances purchased on credit by the coontses from potts business,long dollar furniture and appliance long dollar,between december and april.at the initial purchase in december,the coontses agreed that they would make payments of a week on the debt.on april,tylene signed a new sales contract that included all of the items purchased by the couple in december along with other newly purchased items.the total cost of the items purchased was,and at the time of signing the new agreement,the coontses had paid approximately half of the debt.the contract stated that the coontses would continue to pay a week and that potts and long dollar retained a purchase money security interest in all of the items until the debt was paid in full.
in the spring of,the coontses defaulted by failing to make several payments.potts then filed a petition against tylene in state court.the complaint requested the return of the items or payment of the remaining balance due thereon and late charges.in both a trial and a subsequent circuit court trial,the courts awarded judgment to potts and long dollar.tylene failed to satisfy the judgment in full and filed no further application for relief from the judgment or notice of appeal.thereafter,potts submitted to the circuit court clerk an application and order along with a copy of the judgment.the clerk completed the writ of execution,signed it on behalf of the court as required by statute,and forwarded it to the douglas county sheriff office to levy on the property.
on july,sheriff koop called potts to inform him that deputies would be serving the writ that day and collecting the items listed.however,the sheriff indicated that his office did not have the means to transport or store the items.sheriff koop asked potts to transport and store the items for the sheriff department until they could have an auction to sell the items at a later date.the group then proceeded to the coontses residence to collect the items.to obtain access to the property,the group cut a padlock on the entry gate.as they neared the residence,tylene refused them entry to collect the items.consequently,johnson arrested and handcuffed her,charging her with interference with legal process pursuant to.she was taken to the police station and charged however,she was never prosecuted for this violation.the property was not collected at that time.
the group returned to the coontses residence on august,to levy on the property and serve an unrelated eviction notice on the coontses.the group again cut the gate lock,and upon entering the property,they encountered tylene.upon informing her that they were there to take the property,tylene refused to allow them inside,and they again arrested her.she fought,kicked,hit,and attempted to bite the officers until they handcuffed her and placed her in a police car.larry arrived at the house soon after and did not resist the levy.at that point,the officers released tylene from the police car.when she reentered the home,she grabbed a candle and threw it at the television,one of the items the coontses purchased from long dollar,and destroyed the screen.she was then arrested for interference with judicial process,resisting arrest,assault on a police officer,and property damage.at that point,the officers moved the items listed on the writ of execution from inside the coontses home to the porch,where potts employees took the items and loaded them on a moving truck.
after retrieving the items,potts transported them to his store where he stored the property in the basement and marked the items with signs indicating that the property belonged to the douglas county sheriff department.potts later contacted sheriff koop to inquire about the status of the items and when an auction might be held.sheriff koop indicated that he should continue to hold the items for the sheriff department until the legal issues had been resolved.the items remain at the warehouse.
after the levy,the coontses filed this lawsuit on february.they raised a civil rights claim under,as well as other state law claims.the parties ultimately filed for summary judgment.in an order issued december,the district court granted the sheriff and deputies motion for summary judgment against the coontses,and denied the coontses motion for summary judgment against the officers.the court issued a order to the coontses attorney and received his brief on the issue of rule sanctions.thereafter,the district court issued an order on january,assessing sanctions under rule b in the amount of against the coontses attorney for asserting frivolous claims for malicious prosecution,excessive force,and trespass,none of which counsel addressed in his briefs for summary judgment.thereafter,on january,the district court rendered the final order in the case by granting potts motion for summary judgment against the coontses.the coontses and their counsel appealed these orders on january.
summary judgment is proper when the record,viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and giving that party the benefit of all reasonable inferences,shows that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c.we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.burk beene,cir.when considering whether to grant summary judgment,a court must examine all pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories admissions on file and affidavits.c.we review de novo the district court interpretation of missouri law.see salve regina college russell,d first bank of marietta hogge,cir.
the coontses raise nineteen points on appeal in a page brief.it is unnecessary,however,to address all of these issues separately.the gravamen of the coontses appeal is whether the appellees violated their civil rights under by seizing the property via the writ of execution.they allege that enforcement of the writ of execution violated their fourth amendment right to be free from an unreasonable seizure because the writ was not signed by a judge because it was not,the coontses contend it was issued without probable cause and is,thus,invalid.additionally,they argue that the sheriff,the deputies,and potts are not entitled to the protection of qualified immunity for their acts in enforcing the writ.as developed in this record,the coontses arguments are unavailing.
in a action against public officials or those acting with public officials,a plaintiff must show that the defendants violated clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.however,before reaching the issue of whether such a right is clearly established,the inquiry must first focus on whether the plaintiffs have actually asserted a violation of a constitutional right at all.see siegert gilley,d.
