this appeal provides us with an opportunity to clarify the requirements of the interstate land sales full disclosure act ilsa,a statute that,while enacted more than forty years ago,has received little attention from the federal courts until recently.in basic terms,ilsa protects individual buyers or lessees who purchase or lease lots in large,uncompleted housing developments,including condominiums,by mandating that developers make certain disclosures.if a developer fails to provide these disclosures,ilsa permits buyers or lessees,under certain circumstances,to revoke their purchase or lease agreements within a designated period from the date of signing.d.as one of our sister circuits observed recently,it is this feature of ilsa that has made the statute an increasingly popular means of channeling buyer remorse into a legal defense to a breach of contract claim.stein paradigm mirasol,llc,cir.

background 
the facts are undisputed.the brompton condominium brompton is a luxury condominium building located at street and third avenue in manhattan,new york.defendant owner,llc the sponsor sells,offers,and advertises units in the brompton,and defendant appellant michael,levitt rubinstein,llc the escrow agent is the sponsor escrow agent for all purchases of units in the building.consistent with its obligations under ilsa,see,the sponsor previously filed with the united states department of housing and urban development hud a statement of record containing the property report,and,as required by statute,the property report provided all potential purchasers of units,including plaintiffs,with certain information and warnings about the brompton in addition,the sponsor previously filed the condominium offering plan the plan with the office of the new york state attorney general pursuant to new york general business law e eeee.attached to the plan were drafts of a unit deed and the sponsor declaration of condominium draft declaration the plan contained a detailed description of each unit in the brompton,identifying the dimensions and locations of all rooms and windows,the floor plan,the location of the unit within the building,and the direction the unit faced.the draft declaration included a metes and bounds description of the brompton and indicated,inter alia,the specific tax lots on which the building was to be erected.
at some time prior to may,plaintiffs received from the sponsor the property report and the plan for the brompton.in may,plaintiffs entered into an agreement the agreement with defendants to purchase unit in the brompton for million.at the time plaintiffs executed the agreement,the brompton was under construction the building was not finished until january.the agreement incorporated by reference the plan as well as the draft declaration.under the agreement terms,plaintiffs were to pay upon signing,another by november or on the date of closing,whichever was earlier,and the balance of the price at closing.the agreement indicated that these two sums constituted the deposit.in the event of plaintiffs default,section b of the agreement stated that the sponsor could cancel the agreement and,as its sole remedy,shall have the right,subject to the provision of section d below,to retain,as and for liquidated damages,the deposit and any interest earned on the deposit.section d of the agreement provided 
notwithstanding the foregoing,if and only to the extent that the sale of the residential units is not exempt from the provisions of ilsa,the amount of the deposit to be retained by sponsor upon purchaser failure to cure a default will be the greater of i fifteen percent of the purchase price excluding any interest owed or ii the amount of damages incurred by sponsor due to the default 
section specifically prohibited plaintiffs from recording the agreement.
in december,the parties amended the agreement to permit the second deposit to be paid in two separate installments of.plaintiffs paid the first installment but failed to pay the second.in aggregate,therefore,plaintiffs paid as a deposit,or of the purchase price.in march,the sponsor notified plaintiffs by letter that it was exercising its right to cancel the agreement and to retain the deposit,which the sponsor demanded be released by the escrow agent.plaintiffs objected and challenged the sponsor cancellation with the office of the new york attorney general.see regs.tit,o viii a.in january,the attorney general issued a decision finding that plaintiffs had defaulted on the agreement and that the sponsor was entitled to the release of plaintiffs deposit.that same month,the escrow agent released the deposit to the sponsor.in july,however four months after the sponsor had informed plaintiffs of its cancellation of the agreement plaintiffs had notified the sponsor that they were revoking the agreement pursuant to ilsa.plaintiffs asserted that the agreement failed to provide an adequate description of the property in violation of d,and contained an invalid liquidated damages clause in violation of d.defendants rejected plaintiffs purported revocation.
in august,plaintiffs brought the present action seeking both a declaration that they had validly revoked the agreement pursuant to d and also an award of in money damages,the amount paid as a deposit.following discovery both parties moved for summary judgment.in october,the district court entered judgment for plaintiffs,holding that they were entitled to revoke the agreement.the court reached this conclusion on grounds not explicitly advanced by the parties.relying exclusively on the language of d,the court held that r ead in context,the statute requires that the description of the lot be included in a document that is in a form capable of being recorded,and because here,plaintiffs agreement for the purchase of unit in the brompton was not recordable under new york law,the court concluded that the agreement was subject to revocation under ilsa.defendants appealed.
discussion 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo and will affirm only where,construing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the and drawing all reasonable inferences in that party favor,there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.mcbride bic consumer prods,cir internal quotation marks and alteration omitted see.a.
although plaintiffs prevailed below,they do not expend considerable effort defending the lower court interpretation of d,which,as already noted,did not rest on any argument squarely advanced by plaintiffs.instead,plaintiffs reiterate the same points they raised below namely,that the agreement is revocable because it failed to provide an adequate description of the property in violation of d and because it contained an invalid liquidated damages clause in violation of d.defendants,by comparison,object to both the district court and plaintiffs construction of d and assert that the agreement satisfied fully the requirements of ilsa.the parties do agree that if we reject the district court construction of d,we should nonetheless reach the merits of their other arguments.we turn first to the district court construction of d,and then address the parties competing interpretations of the statute.
i.the district court decision 
the district court holding rested solely on the language of d,which provides 
any contract or agreement which is for the sale or lease of a lot and which does not provide 
a description of the lot which makes such lot clearly identifiable and which is in a form acceptable for recording by the appropriate public official responsible for maintaining land records in the jurisdiction in which the lot is located 
may be revoked at the option of the purchaser or lessee for two years from the date of the signing of such contract or agreement.
d.the district court interpreted this language to require that the description of the lot be included in a document,the contact or agreement that is in a form capable of being recorded.it reasoned that because no provision of new york law would permit the recording of a description of real property,congress must have intended that the form acceptable for recording clause in d refers to the underlying contract or agreement,not to the description of the lot itself.the court observed that under new york law,however,for an executory contract for the sale of real property,like the agreement,to be recordable,it must,inter alia,be acknowledged or proved.see real prop.because it is undisputed that the agreement failed to satisfy this requirement,the court held that the agreement,containing the description,was not in recordable form and wa s subject to rescission under section d of ilsa.the court noted as well that the provision in section of the agreement confirmed that the agreement was not recordable.
with great respect to the district court,we reject this interpretation.the phrase which is in a form acceptable for recording in d modifies the word description at the beginning of that same sentence,not the more distant nouns contract or agreement located in the prior section.see barnhart thomas,observing that under the grammatical rule of the last antecedent,any limiting clause or phrase should be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows accord allard lowenstein int l human rights project dep t of homeland,cir holding that under basic rules of grammar and punctuation,the qualifying phrase in question modified only the immediately antecedent clause and not the more remote clause.the most natural reading of d,therefore,is that a contract or agreement may be revocable within two years of the date of signing if that document does not include a description of the lot in question which makes such lot clearly identifiable and is in a form acceptable for recording.whether the contract or agreement itself is in a form acceptable for recording is immaterial.
additionally and contrary to the district court reasoning,that a description of a lot standing alone may not be recordable under new york law does not compel a different construction of d.the district court read into the statute language that is not there.section d does not require that the description of the lot be a recordable document,only that it be in a form acceptable for recording.congress could have mandated more clearly that revocation of a purchase agreement under ilsa turns on the recordability of the lot description for example,by including language that the description must be in a recordable document but it chose not to.see dodd united states,observing that courts must presume that congress says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says quoting.bank germain,accord phong thanh nguyen chertoff,cir.congress required instead that the lot description be in a form acceptable for recording,a phrase to which we turn and interpret in the next section.the district court interpretation fails to give effect to this plain language.
finally,reading d to require that the description of a lot and not the agreement or contract be in a form acceptable for recording aligns with ilsa underlying purpose.one of the core functions of ilsa is to prevent false and deceptive practices in the sale of land by requiring developers to disclose information needed by potential buyers.flint ridge dev.scenic rivers ass of,see bodansky fifth on the park condo,llc,cir observing that ilsa was enacted in response to an epidemic of unscrupulous marketing and sale of undeveloped subdivided land and was designed to require full disclosure to buyers of such land accord long merrifield town ctr,cir winter hollingsworth,cir.construing d to mandate that the description of a lot in a contract or agreement be clear and specific enough to satisfy generally the local recording statutes in the jurisdiction in which the lot is located,d,furthers this goal because it guarantees that developers provide potential buyers with the information they need to make an informed decision about their purchase.see long,at.by comparison,interpreting the statute to require that the contract or agreement satisfy the technical requirements for recordability in the applicable local jurisdiction does not further this purpose.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that under d,the description of the lot in the underlying contract or agreement and not that contract or agreement itself must be in a form acceptable for recording in the jurisdiction in which the lot is located.
ii.whether the agreement satisfies ilsa 
although we could,at this juncture,remand to the district court for further proceedings,the parties urge us to rule on whether under d the description of unit in the agreement was in a form acceptable for recording and whether the agreement liquidated damages clause violates d issues that were left unresolved below.while generally we decline considering arguments not addressed by the district court,see singleton wulff,this is a prudential rule we apply at our discretion,see booking star mgmt.co,cir it follows therefore that we have discretion to consider issues that were raised,briefed,and argued in the district court,but that were not reached there.in determining whether to consider such issues,we rely on a number of factors,including the interests of judicial economy,see petrosino bell,cir,and whether the unaddressed issues present pure questions of law,see booking,at.both factors are satisfied here.remanding the matter for further consideration would be inefficient because the issues were fully briefed and argued in the district court.in addition,these issues present clear questions of law concerning the proper statutory interpretation of ilsa.we thus turn to the merits of the parties arguments.
plaintiffs advance a novel but ultimately unavailing argument for why the description of unit in the agreement failed to satisfy d.relying principally on congress use of the word form in the phrase,in a form acceptable for recording,plaintiffs contend that,to comply with d,the description of the lot must be set forth in a specific document a form that is recordable in the relevant jurisdiction.they maintain that,in new york,that form is the unit deed which they identify as new york unit description clause,and because new york condominium act mandates that a condominium unit deed contain the liber,page and date of recording of the declaration,real prop.l o,for a description of the lot to be in a form acceptable for recording,the description must include this particular information.because the draft unit deed attached to the plan and incorporated by reference in the agreement did not contain this information,plaintiffs assert that the agreement failed to comply with d.alternatively,plaintiffs argue that even if the description of the lot need not contain the information required for recording a unit deed under state law,the description provided in the agreement was insufficient because it inaccurately described the brompton and the unit that plaintiffs agreed to purchase.defendants counter that plaintiffs con
