the united states brought this civil in rem forfeiture action,under d,for the forfeiture of firearms involved in a g violation,nearly five years after the property originally was seized.in response,larry zane short short,the owner of the seized property,moved to dismiss the action on both statutory and constitutional grounds.the district court denied short motion to dismiss and granted the government motion for summary judgment.on appeal,short argues that the district court erred in finding that the judicial proceeding was timely under d and in applying the statute of limitations in.short also argues that his due process rights were violated by the delay in bringing the action and the delay in service of process.finally,short insists that the district court erred by failing to inform him,a pro se litigant,of the requirements and consequences of a summary judgment motion.
we hold that either an administrative or a judicial forfeiture action brought within days of the seizure will toll the d deadline.in addition,the government delay in bringing proceedings and its delay in serving short with process did not rise to the level of a due process violation.finally,in this circuit,nonprisoner pro se litigants are not entitled to notice of the consequences and requirements of a summary judgment motion.even if short is considered a prisoner pro se litigant and,therefore,is entitled to notice of the requirements in responding to a summary judgment motion,any alleged error was harmless.accordingly,we affirm the district court decision.
background 
on august,bureau of alcohol,tobacco,and firearms batf and drug enforcement administration dea agents executed a search warrant at short home and seized assorted firearms and ammunition.at the time this search warrant issued,short was prohibited from possessing firearms or ammunition pursuant to g because he was previously convicted for violations of the gun control act.the firearms possessed in violation of g therefore were subject to seizure and forfeiture under d.in just over a month time,batf commenced administrative forfeiture proceedings against these firearms by publication in usa today on october,and.on august,the batf interpreted a letter filed by short in november requesting the return of the property as a petition for remission or mitigation and denied this request.
meanwhile,on october,short was indicted by a grand jury on four counts of possessing an unregistered firearm in violation of d one count of possessing unregistered firearm silencers in violation of d and one count of possession of a firearm after conviction of a felony in violation of g.on march,short entered a conditional guilty plea to two counts involving possession of unregistered firearms and one count of possessing unregistered firearm silencers.his sentencing hearing was held in abeyance while he was turned over to the bureau of prisons bop for psychological evaluations.the sentencing hearing was finally conducted on september,and short received a month sentence and three years of supervised release.on direct appeal,we affirmed his conviction and sentence.
on august,almost five years after the original seizure,the government instituted a judicial forfeiture action under d seeking forfeiture of the firearms seized in the search.short filed a motion to dismiss on the basis that the complaint was untimely pursuant to d,the delay violated his due process right to a prompt hearing,and the action violated the excessive fines clause.the district court partially denied the motion but ordered the government to show cause for the untimely complaint.in response to the order,the government admitted that it did not issue service of process within the time demanded under the federal rules of civil procedure,but indicated that after the entry of the order a copy of the complaint was served upon short attorney,logan sharp sharp,who agreed to accept service on behalf of his client.a few days later,sharp filed an affidavit with the court,swearing that he did not agree to accept service on behalf of short,that he did not accept service on his behalf,and that he did not represent short in the forfeiture action.
on june,the government sent requests for admission to short at the place of his incarceration.the requests asked him to admit that he was previously convicted for violations of the gun control act which are punishable by a prison term of over one year,that he was aware that due to this conviction he could not possess firearms,and that the defendant firearms were in his possession on the date of seizure.short did not respond to these requests within the period,nor did the court or parties agree to an extension of time thus,short failure to respond served as a constructive admission.on july,short was released from prison.a few months later,on october,short requested that the court appoint him counsel.noting its broad discretion to appoint counsel for indigent civil litigants,the district court denied short motion for appointment of counsel because he had not shown exceptional circumstances.the government successfully moved for summary judgment,and this timely appeal followed.

timeliness of the forfeiture action 
the first question presented on this appeal is whether administrative forfeiture actions brought within the time period sufficiently comply with the letter of the law,as provided in d,when the judicial proceedings are not brought also within the permissible days.section d provides,in part any action or proceeding for the forfeiture of firearms or ammunition shall be commenced within one hundred and twenty days of such seizure.d.although this is a question of first impression in the courts of appeals,a number of district courts have published opinions addressing this very question.see,united states assorted firearms,d,noting that where administrative proceedings are timely instituted,a subsequent judicial action need not be instituted within days of the seizure united states sixty firearms,d,stating that administrative proceedings would be foiled by a process requiring the judicial action to be commenced within the same period united states miscellaneous firearms,explosives,destructive devices ammunition,d,holding that a forfeiture action is timely so long as at least an administrative action is filed within the statutory period united states twelve firearms,d,aff,fed.appx,wl,at cir,concluding that the statute required either an administrative forfeiture proceeding or a judicial forfeiture action within days of a seizure united states fourteen various firearms,holding that the district court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case because both the administrative and the judicial forfeiture actions were not commenced within the timeframe united states twelve miscellaneous firearms,deciding that although the phrase any action or proceeding includes both judicial and administrative actions,the statute was satisfied so long as either action was brought within days.in the instant case,the district court agreed with the rationale from twelve firearms that taking an administrative forfeiture action alone was sufficient compliance with the requirement and granted summary judgment for the government.on appeal,short urges us to accept the rationale of fourteen various firearms and dismiss this case for lack of jurisdiction based on the government failure to file a judicial action within the requirement.short contends that the statute meaning is plain and unambiguous and that any means both administrative and judicial proceedings,and thus,in order to comply with d,both actions must be brought within days of the seizure.
in its opinion,the district court first recognized the general rule that seized property,other than contraband,should be returned to its rightful owner at the completion of criminal proceedings.see united states lafatch,cir.with respect to firearms,a potential claimant has no right to contest seizure of weapons intrinsically illegal in character because he would have no property right in such a weapon.cooper city of greenwood,cir.on the other hand,the district court noted,a claimant may have an ownership interest in firearms,not intrinsically illegal.joint appendix at.according to the district court,because d explicitly provides that firearms and ammunition involved in a knowing violation of g are subject not only to seizure and forfeiture but also to relevant provisions of the internal revenue code which contain a statute of limitations,the judicial action was timely brought as long as the administrative action tolled the deadline.persuaded by the rationale of twelve firearms,the district court found that the government met d requirements because commencing an administrative forfeiture proceeding is sufficient for compliance with the requirement.see generally twelve firearms,d at commenting that any requirement that both proceedings be initiated within this brief period defeat s the purpose of simplified administrative proceedings.
the key to this case turns on statutory interpretation.we begin our analysis by looking at the language of the statute itself to determine if its meaning is plain.dep t of the treasury fabe,d united states choice,cir,cert.denied,d.plain meaning is examined by looking at the language and design of the statute as a whole.choice,at quoting united states meyers,cir,cert.denied,d.when interpreting the plain language of a statute,we mak e every effort not to interpret a provision in a manner that renders other provisions of the same statute inconsistent,meaningless or superfluous.cafarelli yancy,cir quotation omitted.however,if the textual analysis is unclear or leads to ambiguous or unreasonable results,legislative history may be used to guide our interpretation of a statute.the limited,commissioner,cir.moreover,j udicial perception that a particular result would be unreasonable may enter into the construction of ambiguous provisions,but can not justify disregard of what congress has plainly and intentionally provided.commissioner asphalt prods,d.we review de novo questions of statutory interpretation.choice,at.
the first court to address the question of whether timely administrative forfeiture actions without concurrent judicial proceedings comply with d determined that the filing of an administrative forfeiture within the period was adequate to confer jurisdiction.see twelve miscellaneous firearms.at.in twelve miscellaneous firearms,the court determined that the statutory phrase any action or proceeding included both judicial and administrative actions,and therefore bringing either within the timeframe was sufficient for compliance with the statute.id.following the logic of twelve miscellaneous firearms,the district court in twelve firearms concluded that the government satisfied the time limit of d by timely bringing an administrative forfeiture action.see twelve firearms,d at.twelve firearms interpreted the absence of more specific language in d as intentional 
first,if congress had intended that the time limit provided in d should always apply to the filing of a judicial complaint for forfeiture of firearms,even when an administrative proceeding has also been initiated,it could have easily specified so in the statute,as it did in c with respect to forfeitures.
id.as a secondary rationale,the twelve firearms court commented that dual proceedings would defeat the purpose of simplified administrative proceedings.id.
we are convinced that the approach taken by twelve miscellaneous firearms,twelve firearms,and other district courts that followed their lead,is correct.beginning with the statute language itself we first assess whether its meaning is plain.see the limited,at.we agree that the meaning of the word any in d is ambiguous.twelve firearms,d at.as the government points out,the proof of the ambiguity is evidenced by the disagreement over its meaning some district courts have read any to mean,whereas at least one district court has interpreted any to mean all or every.compare id.the time limitation in d merely requires the united states to initiate either an administrative forfeiture proceeding or a judicial forfeiture action within days of a seizure,with fourteen various firearms.at deciding that the word any made it imperative that,irrespective of which type of proceeding was at issue,any administrative proceeding or judicial action for the forfeiture of the firearms had to begin within days and that a judicial action brought after days was too late.because the statutory language is ambiguous,we engage the entire text and structure of the statute,being careful not to interpret it in a way that renders other provisions of the same statute inconsistent,meaningless or superfluous.cafarelli,at quotation omitted.
interpreting the statute in its entirety,we can not ignore that d expressly incorporates provisions of the internal revenue code relating to forfeiture.see d all provisions of the internal revenue code relating to the seizure,forfeiture,and disposition of firearms,shall,so far as applicable,extend to seizures and forfeitures under the provisions of this chapter.one such provision,incorporates the provisions of the customs forfeiture laws which provide in for a statute of limitations for bringing a judicial forfeiture action.see the provisions of law applicable to the remission or mitigation by the secretary of forfeitures under the customs laws shall apply to forfeitures incurred or alleged to have been incurred under the internal revenue laws.because we assess the plain meaning by looking at the language and design of the statute as a whole,we must consider d express language applying provisions in the internal revenue code to forfeitures under d when we attempt to discern the statute meaning.see choice,at citation omitted.surely d inclusion of relevant internal revenue code provisions,and hence,the statute of limitations for judicial forfeiture actions,must have some bearing on judicial forfeiture actions in the firearm context.in our estimation,this statute of limitations becomes applicable once an administrative action has tolled the requirement for initiation of an administrative forfeiture action or a judicial forfeiture proceeding.
a requirement that both administrative and judicial proceedings be initiated within the same period does not make sense for two primary reasons administrative forfeitures are favored,and the opportunity for bringing a judicial forfeiture action could be lost while the parties await a decision on the administrative forfeiture proceeding.see generally united states eight thousand eight hundred fifty dollars in united states currency,d noting that permitting the government to wait for a decision on an administrative forfeiture action is beneficial to the claimant,government,and court system sixty firearms,d at stating that because administrative forfeiture proceedings alleviate the need for judicial action,i t makes little sense to require the government to initiate both an administrative proceeding and a judicial forfeiture action within days of seizure of the property.the purpose of administrative proceedings,as stated by the twelve firearms court,is to provide,if possible,a mechanism for the government and private parties to resolve their disputes without the need for judicial actions.twelve firearms,d at.as the supreme court noted in a decision involving the filing of a judicial forfeiture action 
an important justification for delaying the initiation of forfeiture proceedings is to see whether the secretary decision on the petition for remission will obviate the need for judicial proceedings.this delay can favor both the claimant and the government.in many cases,the government entitlement to the property is clear,and the claimant only prospect for reacquiring the property is that the secretary will favorably exercise his discretion and allow remission or mitigation.if the government were forced to initiate judicial proceedings without regard to administrative proceedings,the claimant would lose this benefit.further,administrative proceedings are less formal and expensive than judicial forfeiture proceedings.given the great percentage of successful petitions,allowing the government to wait for action on administrative petitions eliminates unnecessary and burdensome court proceedings.finally,a system whereby the judicial proceeding occurs after administrative action spares litigants and the government from the burden of simultaneously participating in two forums.
at.citations omitted.
consistent with the supreme court analysis in,we believe that d does not mandate that judicial actions be brought within days of the seizure,as long as an administrative proceeding has been brought within that timeframe.as the court suggests in,permitting the government to await a decision on the administrative forfeiture proceeding protects the courts from overly burdensome litigation,conserves economic resources,and preserves a claimant opportunity for remission or mitigation.see id.if parties were required to bring both proceedings within the period,a claimant awaiting a response on the administrative action and eagerly anticipating remission may have to forego his chance to challenge the forfeiture in a court of law.see id.in a situation where a statutory provision is ambiguous,our perception that a particular result would be unreasonable must play an important role in our interpretation process.asphalt prods,at.thus,after considering the the language and design of the statute as a whole,meyers,at,and after making every effort to interpret a provision in a manner consistent with the rest of the statute,cafarelli,at,we conclude that d ambiguous statutory language any action or proceeding should not be interpreted to mean every but rather either a judicial action or an administrative proceeding.furthermore,we agree that because the administrative forfeiture proceeding was brought within days,a judicial forfeiture action brought within five years,as provided in,was within the statute of limitations.this interpretation allows for consideration of the statute language in its entirety,gives meaning to internal revenue code provisions,and fosters the favored status of administrative actions.
short criticizes the district court reliance on twelve firearms as error because that decision considered d language ambiguous but nevertheless failed to consider legislative history.short,citing fourteen various firearms,posits that the legislative history supports his argument that both administrative and judicial proceedings must commence within the period.the fourteen various firearms court noted that the sponsor of the firearms owners protection act fopa,the statute creating d,criticized its alternative,the hughes bill,because the latter did not require an agency to bring judicial actions within days,or any other limit,of a seizure.at citing cong.rec.april.what short fails to realize is that this court has stated that legislative history is used when textual analysis is unclear,or leads to ambiguous or unreasonable results.the limited,at.although the word any in d is ambiguous,the textual analysis of the entire statute combined with an assessment of the statute structure leads us to a reasonable,not unreasonable,result one that upholds the favored status of administrative proceedings and allows for judicial proceedings still to be brought after an administrative forfeiture has failed.moreover,as previous courts have indicated,if congress had intended that the time limit provided in d should always apply to the filing of a judicial complaint for firearms,even when an administrative proceeding has also been initiated,it could have easily specified so in the statute.twelve firearms,d at.short reliance on one stray comment in the legislative history can not override the statute structure,meaning,and purpose congress votes on the statute in its entirety,not on the house sponsor comments alone.moreover,the sponsor comment is not at odds with our interpretation.the comment emphasis is on the timing of judicial proceedings,recognizing that such proceedings need some time limit.our holding today also recognizes fopa concern with bringing timely proceedings and determines that the limit will apply to judicial proceedings when no administrative forfeiture action was brought to toll the requirement.
on a final note,short argues that the statute of limitations in,when properly applied,runs from the date the alleged offense was discovered,not the date of seizure as in d.short then proceeds to argue,without citing any authority,that an earlier date of discovery should apply in his case because the government knew he had a felony conviction for possession of firearms in and was aware that he possessed firearms in advance of the execution of the search warrant.short suggests that because he openly purchased his firearms through registered dealers,the government was constructively aware that he had these weapons well before august.the record is entirely void of any evidence in support of this argument.moreover,short waived this argument by failing to raise it before the district court.this court has repeatedly held that it will not consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal unless our failure to consider the issue will result in a plain miscarriage of justice.in re hood,cir quotation omitted.here,our decision not to address short factually and legally unsupported argument does not result in a miscarriage of justice.
due process 
short next alleges that the government delay in bringing the judicial forfeiture action violated his right to due process.he relies on the government failure to give any reason for its delay after he asserted a right to the property in.the government,on the other hand,argues that it was justified in waiting for a decision on short remission petition and that it properly awaited the termination of short criminal proceedings.the government concludes that even if the remaining delay was not justified,it did not rise to the level of a due process violation.the district court,citing,found short due process claim to be devoid of merit.at.we review de novo a district court legal conclusions as to whether a claimant constitutional rights were violated.see schroyer frankel,cir.
as we stated previously,the firearms at issue were seized on august.that same year,short filed his petition for remission,asserting his right to the firearms,which was denied.the government did not begin its judicial forfeiture action until august,after nearly five years had elapsed since seizure.although short criminal trial was pending during a portion of this period,once the supreme court denied his petition for certiorari on june,those proceedings came to a close.after the criminal trial ended,and thus the need for the firearms as evidence of the crime had ceased,the government delayed another two years before instituting judicial forfeiture proceedings.
