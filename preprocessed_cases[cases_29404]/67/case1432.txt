jeffrey aaron,adtar,and hampton village associates brought this action under against target corporation,the city of louis,and the land clearance for redevelopment authority of the city of louis redevelopment authority.plaintiffs sought to enjoin condemnation proceedings involving their property,which they allege was to be taken for a private use.the district court granted a temporary restraining order tro and later converted it sua sponte into a preliminary injunction,enjoining defendants from taking ownership,possession,or control of the subject property and from going forward with condemnation proceedings in state court.target,the city,and the redevelopment authority appeal from the order for preliminary injunction we reverse.
the property which is the subject of the condemnation proceeding is located at the intersection of hampton and chippewa avenues in louis,missouri.appellees own the building which houses a target store and the property on which it and the adjoining parking lots are located.target corporation entered into a long term lease with them in october for a period of twenty five years,with five renewal options of five years each.the lease covers a store building which was previously leased to arlans department stores,a discount retailer.target agreed to maintain the property and its improvements and had the right to make alterations,additions,or changes to the building.
in march target contacted the owners about its interest in replacing what it regarded as an obsolete store with a larger facility.target proposed to demolish the existing store and to build a new one.in may appellees responded that they were not opposed to demolition of the existing store,but they wanted more rent,to be partially based on sales at the new facility.no further proposals were exchanged,and no agreement was reached.
alderman james shrewsbury represents the ward in which the property is located.he became concerned in september that target would close its store if the property owners would not agree to terms it considered acceptable,and he initiated discussions with target.he also raised the possibility of using the city eminent domain power to facilitate redevelopment of the property,and he asked the redevelopment authority to conduct a study to determine whether the property was blighted.the redevelopment authority hired a private consulting company,pgav urban consulting pgav,to analyze the property.pgav prepared a qualifications analysis pgav study which was issued on october.the study found that the property was physically deteriorated,unsafe,and dangerous and concluded that it was blighted or insanitary within the meaning of chapter of the revised statutes of missouri.
a public hearing was scheduled for november,at which the louis city board of aldermen would consider the pgav study.the study had been introduced by alderman shrewsbury as board bill to initiate condemnation proceedings for the property.he believed that target redevelopment would benefit his ward and the city as a whole.the city sent written notice of the public hearing to the aaron trust and adtar,care of target minneapolis headquarters which was the address on file for the property at the assessor office.notice of the hearing was also placed in the louis post dispatch,but apparently the only plaintiff actually receiving notice before the november hearing was hampton associates,which declined to attend.the board of aldermen passed board bill on december,and it later became ordinance.
the redevelopment authority published notices in the louis post dispatch on december and,seeking redevelopment proposals for the property.only target submitted a proposal,and the redevelopment authority selected target as the redeveloper on december.attorneys for the property owners first appeared to oppose condemnation of their property at the december meeting of the redevelopment authority.
on december,the louis mayor signed ordinance.the ordinance declared the subject property blighted,approved target redevelopment proposal,authorized the redevelopment authority to acquire the property by eminent domain,and authorized a tax abatement for target.the redevelopment authority and target then entered into a redevelopment agreement on january,which officially granted target redevelopment rights over the property.on january,the board of the redevelopment authority met to discuss the use of its eminent domain power to acquire the property.representatives of the property owners appeared and raised objections,but the board approved the use of eminent domain for the property.
before initiating a condemnation action in state court,the redevelopment authority made an offer on march,to purchase the property from the owners,as required by state eminent domain law.see res.lcra see also.the offer totaled million and was based on an independent real estate appraisal.the property owners were informed that the offer would remain open until april,but they never responded to it.instead,they filed this action on april and a preliminary injunction motion on april.
the redevelopment authority filed a condemnation action against the property owners and target in the circuit court of the city of louis on april.a trial was initially set in the circuit court for may,but it was later rescheduled to june,because the property owners requested a change in judge.on may the property owners requested expedited discovery in the condemnation action,and on may they moved to dismiss the eminent domain case on the basis that the taking was for a private purpose.a discovery schedule was set by the circuit court on june it gave the parties two weeks for production of public records and for seven depositions.a protective order was also issued.
on june,the property owners moved for a tro in federal court.the redevelopment authority and target submitted memoranda in opposition to the tro on june,which included an argument for abstention.the district court set the motion for hearing on june,the day before the state condemnation trial was to begin.the parties argued their positions at the hearing,but they did not call witnesses or offer other evidence.at the hearing the district court stated that it would grant a tro to give myself some time to look at this matter because i not sure about it.a written order was issued the same day,restraining appellants from taking the plaintiffs property and from pursuing the state court condemnation action.the court stated that the property owners had shown they were likely to succeed on their constitutional claims,that defendants had acted in concert to take their property for purely private use,and that they faced irreparable harm.the tro provided that it would remain in full force and effect until such time as the matter of a permanent injunction is heard by the court,or this dispute is otherwise finally resolved.
the parties furnished additional materials to the district court on june,including affidavits and memoranda in which appellants elaborated on their argument that the court should abstain in favor of the state eminent domain proceedings.the district court issued a written memorandum and order on july,to more fully set out the court decision in granting the motion for temporary restraining order.in addition to discussing the factors for injunctive relief under dataphase,c l,cir en banc,the court gave its reasons for declining to abstain from exercising jurisdiction.aaron target,d.then on july,without advance notice to the parties or further hearing,the district court sua sponte converted the tro into a preliminary injunction which shall remain in effect pending a final decision on the merits or further order of the court.the short order incorporated the court memorandum and order of july by reference and simply stated that the court had concluded that the tro should be converted to a preliminary injunction.
in explaining its decision not to abstain the court stated that there was no ongoing state judicial proceeding until after this case was initiated and plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction was filed,and that filing of that motion commenced proceedings on the merits in this case.id.at.the court went on to conclude that plaintiffs do not have an adequate opportunity to litigate their constitutional claims in the state court proceeding,because it was summary in nature,with limited scope and duration of discovery,and did not permit counterclaims or crossclaims.id.at.perhaps most importantly the court concluded,this is a case fitting the bad faith exception to the younger doctrine.id.at.
the court order on july converting the tro into a preliminary injunction did not itself recite what it enjoined.rather,it referred to the content of its july memorandum and order which stated its reasons for the tro and enjoined target,the city,and the redevelopment authority from taking ownership,possession,or control of the federal plaintiffs property pursuant to city ordinance and from initiating or pursuing any condemnation or other proceeding in the state courts seeking to take ownership,possession,or control of the property.
target,the city,and the redevelopment authority appeal from the preliminary injunction issued on july.they contend that the district court should have abstained under the younger doctrine,that this case is not ripe,that the property owners did not make a sufficient showing for an injunction under dataphase,and that the court sua sponte conversion of the tro into a preliminary injunction without notice or hearing violated.a.the property owners respond that the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to abstain or by granting the preliminary injunction.they maintain this case is ripe and also seek to raise a new argument on appeal that a federal court need not abstain for state judicial review of legislative and administrative action,citing new orleans pub,city of new orleans nopsi,d.
a district court has broad discretion when ruling on a request for preliminary injunction,and it will be reversed only for clearly erroneous factual determinations,an error of law,or an abuse of its discretion.united indus.clorox,cir.a district court abstention decision is also reviewed for abuse of discretion,but the underlying legal determinations receive plenary review.cedar rapids cellular,miller,cir citing beavers arkansas state bd.of dental exam rs,cir.the abuse of discretion standard means that a court has a range of choice,and that its decision will not be disturbed as long as it stays within that range and is not influenced by any mistake of law.verizon communications,inverizon int l,cir citing kern txo prod,cir.an abuse of discretion occurs if a relevant factor that should have been given significant weight is not considered,if an irrelevant or improper factor is considered and given significant weight,or if a court commits a clear error of judgment in the course of weighing proper factors.id.
the threshold question in this case is whether the district court abused its discretion by declining to abstain and instead proceeding to enjoin the parties from going forward with the eminent domain action.under younger harris,d,federal courts should abstain from exercising jurisdiction in cases where equitable relief would interfere with pending state proceedings in a way that offends principles of comity and federalism.accord night clubs,city of fort smith,cir.the motivating force behind younger abstention is the promotion of comity between state and federal judicial bodies.see cedar rapids cellular,at.the younger doctrine was originally applied to state criminal proceedings,see,hicks miranda,d,and later extended to civil cases.see,moore sims,d child abuse litigation trainor hernandez,d welfare fraud action huffman pursue,d obscenity regulation.
in middlesex county ethics comm.garden state bar ass n,d,the supreme court identified several factors that should lead to abstention under younger the existence of an ongoing state judicial proceeding,which implicates important state interests,and which provides an adequate opportunity to raise constitutional challenges.see also silverman silverman,cir.
whether there is an ongoing state judicial proceeding that would be disrupted by the federal action is the first middlesex inquiry.see alleghany mccartney,cir.permitting issues before a state court to be litigated in a federal forum instead could be quite costly to the comity and federalism interests which younger seeks to protect.huffman,at.see also pennzoil texaco,d yamaha motor riney,cir.appellants argue that the district court erred by not considering the actual status of the state eminent domain proceedings and by applying a simple first filed rule.they contend that this federal case was only in an embryonic stage at the time the state court action was initiated and that the state eminent domain process had begun with the passage of ordinance in december.the property owners counter that no state judicial proceedings were ongoing until almost two weeks after they filed for injunctive relief in federal court on april.
there is no fixed requirement in the law that a state judicial proceeding must have been initiated before the federal case was filed for abstention to be appropriate,and a court should examine what was actually taking place in both settings to decide whether to abstain.see wright miller,federal practice procedure ed commencement dates of the state and federal actions are less significant than apparent right after younger.whether proceedings of substance have taken place in either court is a key factor.in hicks,for example,the supreme court ruled that the federal court should have abstained even though its case was filed before state criminal proceedings had been initiated.the reason was that no proceedings of substance had yet occurred in federal court,and a failure to abstain under such circumstances would trivialize younger principles.hicks,at.see also doran salem inn,d abstention warranted in first filed federal litigation where it was in embryonic stage with no contested matter decided anderson schultz,cir abstention appropriate where federal claim filed the same day as state charges.this inquiry also applies in the civil context if important state interests are at stake.see morales trans world airlines,d noting younger relevance to pending or about to be pending civil action involving important state interests.
the condemnation proceeding against appellees property had been initiated under chapter of the missouri statutes by passage of ordinance on december,see.the subject property was declared to be blighted or insanitary and the redevelopment authority was authorized to exercise its duties,powers,and functions,see,to prepare and carry out plans of redevelopment and to determine a fair sales price.see state ex rel.dalton land clearance for redev.on january,the redevelopment authority acquisition of the subject property by the exercise of the power of eminent domain was authorized in accordance with.on march,the redevelopment authority fulfilled its statutory duty to make a good faith offer to purchase appellees property.
state litigation was certain to follow if the property owners did not respond affirmatively to the purchase offer the property owners filed their federal complaint on april,approximately a week before the expiration of the redevelopment authority purchase offer which was required by state law to remain open until april.see.they filed their preliminary injunction motion in the district court on april,the last day on which they could be sure no action would be started in the state court because the redevelopment authority could not file suit until after its purchase offer had expired.see id.at that time the eminent domain proceedings had been ongoing for more than five months,and the property owners were on notice that state judicial proceedings were the next stage of the process.
missouri law provides that eminent domain proceedings culminate in condemnation actions in state court,and the state action here was filed by the redevelopment authority on april.trial was set for may in the state case,and the property owners filed two motions.on may they moved for expedited discovery,and on may they filed a motion to dismiss on the merits.a request by the property owners for a different judge delayed the state trial date to june,but in the meantime the state court ruled on permissible discovery,set deadlines,and issued a protective order.the state eminent domain case was thus developing for some six weeks after it was filed,while the property owners did not seek a tro from the federal court until june.then on june the federal district court halted any further developments in the state case by issuing a tro the day before the continued trial was to begin.the injunction which is the subject of these appeals was not issued until july,approximately eleven weeks after the state case had been filed.at that point in time the substantive issues in the state court action could have been well developed absent the federal tro.
at the time the court issued its tro on june the only developments in federal court had been the filing of motions for injunction and tro and the tro hearing.the only further acts in this case before the injunction which is the subject of these appeals were the submission of memoranda and affidavits and the court memorandum and order of july.the state action on the other hand had been scheduled for trial the morning after the tro was issued,and discovery and motions had preceded.we conclude that the federal case was not really advanced in proceedings of substance on the merits.see hicks,at.id.at.stewart,dissenting tro motion and response filed with twelve affidavits and additional documents and tro hearing did not commence proceedings of substance on the merits.the supreme court approach to the issue is illustrated in doran,where abstention was held necessary even though the federal district court had denied a tro and set a hearing date for a preliminary injunction motion before the state action was started.at.
in this case the district court concluded in its july order incorporated into the injunction order of july,that the mere filing of a preliminary injunction motion in federal court on april amounted to proceedings on the merits occurring before the state action was filed on april we disagree.we conclude that the district court erred by concentrating on filing dates rather than by examining all the facts and context of the two actions and by concluding that there was no ongoing state judicial proceeding within the meaning of middlesex.
the second middlesex requirement is that the ongoing state proceeding involve an important state interest.eminent domain proceedings have long been recognized as an important state interest.see louisiana power light city of thibodaux,d eminent domain is intimately involved with state prerogative.see also edwards arkansas power light,cir important state interests in eminent domain proceedings make abstention particularly appropriate.there is no dispute here that condemnation proceedings meet this test,and the district court properly so held.
the third middlesex factor is whether the state proceedings are adequate.appellants argue that the missouri eminent domain proceedings are adequate because they provide sufficient discovery rights and permit the raising of all claims plaintiffs assert in this federal action.the property owners disagree and argue that discovery is limited in the state case in which they would be unable to raise all of their issues,especially the claim that the private use taking was unconstitutional.
the argument that the state proceedings are inadequate because of limited discovery is not persuasive.missouri courts consider the purpose of requested discovery and the circumstances of the case before deciding whether to permit discovery at the initial stage of a condemnation proceeding.see state ex rel.rantz sweeney.discovery is allowed on whether the state has the right to condemn a particular property,id.at,but reasonable limits on discovery can prevent a single objecting landowner from delaying the commencement of a project for months or years by interrogatories,depositions,discovery or dilatory practices.state ex rel.missouri highway transp.comm anderson,banc.the condemnation process is designed to guarantee the public early commencement of a project while preserving to the individual landowners the right at a later date to extensively and thoroughly litigate all issues relating to damages for the taking.id.in this case,the property owners were given up to two weeks to conduct discovery,the opportunity to take seven depositions,and the right to obtain all of the redevelopment authority relevant and nonprivileged documents.they have not shown that their discovery opportunities were inadequate or unreasonable.
also relevant is whether the property owners would have an adequate opportunity to raise their constitutional challenge in the state action.under missouri law the circuit court must determine at the outset whether the condemnation is authorized by state law,that is,whether there is jurisdiction over the condemnation proceeding.anderson,at state ex rel.devanssay mcguire.this determination may involve an assessment of whether there is constitutional,statutory,or ordinance authority for the exercise of eminent domain,whether the taking is for a public use,and whether the condemning authority complied with the conditions precedent to bringing the court action.devanssay,at.the landowner damages from the taking are determined at a second stage when either side may request a jury trial,and the case may be appealed after the damages phase is complete.anderson,at.
since missouri statutes and case law contemplate that constitutional challenges will be raised as defenses to a condemnation,appellees will have an adequate opportunity in the state condemnation proceedings to assert their claim that the taking of their property is for a private use.see glueck realty city of louis.accord lia redev,allegations raised against a condemnation ordinance could also be raised as defenses in any future condemnation action.there is an extensive body of missouri appellate cases deciding whether a taking is for a private purpose.see,state ex rel.clothier yeaman,banc state ex rel.gove tate,banc annbar assocs.west side redev.we conclude that the court erred in finding that the property owners did not have an adequate opportunity to raise their principal claim,that the taking is for a private use,in the state court eminent domain proceedings.
federal abstention in this case would permit missouri condemnation procedures to run their course.eminent domain is an appropriate tool to help neighborhoods remain economically viable,attract industry,and encourage future growth.see generally dolan city of tigard,d thomas merrill,the economics of public use,cornell.missouri has adequate judicial procedures for consideration of the parties competing interests.land use policy is an area in which federalism principles are particularly strong as we recognized in night clubs,at enforcement and application of zoning ordinances and land use regulations is an important state and local interest.we conclude that all the middlesex factors are satisfied here and that the district court erred in its conclusion that the state procedures are inadequate.
even if the middlesex factors are met,federal courts should not abstain under younger if bad faith,harassment,or some extraordinary circumstance would make abstention inappropriate.night clubs,at quoting middlesex,at.the district court concluded that the bad faith exception applies here because the state court condemnation action did not result from a legitimate legislative or municipal finding of blight,but rather from the defendants conspiring to take plaintiffs property for a private use.appellants argue the facts do not fit the exception,while the property owners assert that appellants wrongfully conspired to take their land for a private use.
while the supreme court has not ruled out use of the bad faith exception in civil cases,see huffman,at,it has never directly applied the exception in such a case,and we have only recognized it in the criminal context.see lewellen raff,cir.such an exception must be construed narrowly and only invoked in extraordinary circumstances.younger,at.after studying the record,we conclude there was insufficient evidence her
