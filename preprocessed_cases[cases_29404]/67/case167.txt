restrictions often set neighbor against neighbor,and can be a source of considerable turmoil in otherwise tranquil communities.so it is here barbara and her husband john allen the allens are landowners in the cape cod town of truro,massachusetts the town.they own a waterfront lot and wish to improve it.they have thus far been stymied in their efforts by a series of zoning,environmental,and licensing restrictions.
the allens accuse the town of singling them out for unfavorable treatment and thwarting their plans.the town,with equal fervor,accuses the allens of seeking advantages to which they are not entitled.the ill will has spread like a malignant growth and has come to envelop several of the allens neighbors.
after many years of travail,the allens elevated the feud to constitutional proportions they condensed their grievances into a class of one claim,alleging that the disparate treatment they had received infringed their rights under the equal protection clause.see const.amend.xiv.the town heatedly denied these allegations.the district court sided with the town and granted summary judgment in its favor.see conlon,wl,at.july.
we are called upon to review that order.in doing so,we take the supported facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovants here,the allens.cabán hernández philip morris usa,cir.
the events surrounding this case are byzantine,and a full recitation would serve no useful purpose.thus,we offer only a decurtate summary,supplemented as needed in the course of our analysis of the relevant legal issues.we urge readers who hunger for more detailed information to consult the district court comprehensive opinion which even the allens,at oral argument before us,commended as doing a good job of gleaning the facts.
this controversy dates back to march of,when the allens purchased a piece of waterfront property in truro.the parcel abuts properties owned by brooke newman,sarah landis,and the pamet harbor yacht club.other neighbors in relatively close proximity include the sextons and the perrys.
the allens lot is undersized.the only improvements on it as of the date of acquisition were a small cottage and a short pier the allens aspired to build a compound.their plans contemplated erecting a new dwelling with an attached garage on a solid foundation with crawl space drainage expanding the existing cottage originally built as a boathouse into a residence and installing a large swimming pool with adjacent decks.to top matters off,the allens proposed to install floats as a means of extending their existing pier.
a number of disagreements arose with respect to the allens plans.these included disputes about the interpretation and application of zoning laws and environmental restrictions.the controversy soon extended to the licensing of the proposed floats.
the allens characterize all of this as obstructive behavior.they protest that it stands in stark contrast to the accommodations lavished on other residents.their neighbor,newman,is the poster child for the claim of unequal treatment.in addition,they insist that landis,the sextons,and the yacht club all have received more favorable receptions from the town.
frustrated by these perceived inequities,the allens filed suit in a massachusetts state court in february of.their complaint contained five counts.the first,third,fourth,and fifth counts are not relevant here.the sole count with which we are and alleged that the town had denied the allens equal protection of the laws.
on the basis of the equal protection claim,the defendants removed the case to the federal district court.see.in due course,the town moved for summary judgment with respect to count.see.the district court concluded that the allens had not shown that the town had treated them differently from similarly situated parties and entered judgment on the equal protection claim.see,wl,at.it then remanded the remaining counts to the state court.see see also c.
this timely appeal ensued.we have appellate jurisdiction notwithstanding the remand.the rule is that when a district court enters a final judgment on all the federal claims then pending in a civil action and contemporaneously remands all remaining claims to a state court,immediate appellate review of that collateral order is available.see christopher,cir per curiam.
the applicable standard of review is familiar.we appraise a grant of summary judgment de novo.galloza foy,cir.we are not wed to the district court rationale but,rather,may affirm its order on any independent ground made manifest by the record.houlton citizens coal.town of houlton,cir.
to warrant affirmance of an order for summary judgment,the record must disclose no genuine issue as to any material fact and show conclusively that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c.an issue is genuine if,on the evidence presented,it may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party at trial.garside osco drug,cir.by like token,a fact is material if it possess es the capacity to sway the outcome of the litigation under the applicable law.cadle hayes,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in the final analysis,then,t he nonmovant may defeat a summary judgment motion by demonstrating,through submissions of evidentiary quality,that a trialworthy issue persists.iverson city of boston,cir.
in applying these tenets,we take the facts in the light most hospitable to the nonmovant and draw all reasonable inferences in that party favor.galloza,at.when doing so,however,we give no weight to conclusory allegations,unsupported conjecture,or invective.id.
this is a appeal the only assignment of error advanced by the allens is that the district court blundered in concluding that they had not adduced facts sufficient to survive summary judgment on their equal protection claim against the town that theory runs along the line that the allens constitute a class of one,impermissibly singled out for unfavorable treatment by the town.see vill.of willowbrook olech,d per curiam.such a claim is cognizable only plaintiff alleges that she has been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment.id.at the summary judgment stage,of course,this allegation must be backed by competent evidence.
the allens maintain that they have offered probative evidence on all the elements that are necessary to forge such a cause of action the district court rejected the allens importunings it concluded that while the allens had presented a plethora of evidence concerning a number of other landowners,they had failed to show that these landowners were similarly situated to them.the main thrust of the allens appeal is the claim that the district court erred in placing a burden on the allens that should have been placed upon the moving party with respect to this issue.appellants br.at.
in evaluating this argument,we do not write on a pristine page.although t he formula for determining whether individuals or entities are similarly situated for equal protection purposes is not always susceptible to precise demarcation,barrington cove.hous.mortg.fin,cir,the case law makes clear that the burdens of production and persuasion must be shouldered by the party asserting the equal protection violation.thus,p laintiffs claiming an equal protection violation must first identify and relate specific instances where persons situated similarly in all relevant aspects were treated differently.buchanan maine,cir emphasis in original internal quotation mark omitted.
the allens also argue that,regardless of the allocation of burdens,the district court demanded more of them than the law allows.in their view,the degree of similarity between their situation and the situations of the landowners whom they identified as comparators was,on the evidence adduced,a question of material fact that should have been left to a jury.this argument can not withstand scrutiny.
to be sure,the ultimate determination as to whether parties are similarly situated is a inquiry and,as such,is normally grist for the jury mill.but that does not mean that every case,regardless of the proof presented,is a jury case.to carry the burden of proving substantial similarity,plaintiffs must show an extremely high degree of similarity between themselves and the persons to whom they compare themselves.clubside,valentin,cir.while the applicable standard does not require that there be an e xact correlation,tapalian tusino,cir,there must be sufficient proof on the relevant aspects of the comparison to warrant a reasonable inference of substantial similarity thus,the proponent of the equal protection violation must show that the parties with whom he seeks to be compared have engaged in the same activity the government entity without such distinguishing or mitigating circumstances as would render the comparison inutile.see perkins brigham women,cir.
the similarly situated requirement must be enforced with particular rigor in the context because zoning decisions will often,perhaps almost always,treat one landowner differently from another.olech,at.breyer,concurring.given this template,virtually every zoning the absence of a sensible limiting be a candidate to find its way to federal court in the guise of an equal protection claim.creative env ts,estabrook,cir warning that e very appeal by a disappointed developer from an adverse ruling by a local planning board necessarily involves some claim that the board exceeded,abused or distorted its legal authority in some manner and can be given a constitutional label emphasis in original.the similarly situated requirement furnishes the limiting principle that guards against such a devolution.
this requirement demands more than lip service.it is meant to be a very significant burden.discovery house,consol.city of indianapolis,cir see creative env ts,at explaining that it is not enough to give land use claims constitutional labels such as due process or equal protection in order to raise a substantial federal question under section.it is inadequate merely to point to nearby parcels in a vacuum and leave it to the municipality to disprove conclusory allegations that the owners of those parcels are similarly situated.
seen against this background,a court can properly grant summary judgment where it is clear that no reasonable jury could find the similarly situated prong met.harlen assocs.vill.of mineola,cir see mcdonald vill.of winnetka,cir.that principle may apply even though,as in this case,the plaintiffs have presented copious evidence concerning a multiplicity of possible comparisons.see,bell duperrault,cir barrington cove,at upholding grant of rule b motion to dismiss when plaintiff failed to establish similarity with reasonable particularity and the facts alleged suggested entirely reasonable grounds for disparate treatment.
with this framework in place,we return to the case at hand.the allens emphasize that they are subject to the same zoning and environmental strictures as their neighbors and argue that any material discrepancy in outcomes must,a fortiori,be a result of unequal application of the law.but casting the argument in those terms oversimplifies the analysis and fails to account for the fact that v arious factual traits,circumstantial nuances,and peculiarities can set entities apart,rendering them,by virtue of their differences,amenable to disparate treatment.racine charter one,racine unified sch,cir.
the burden that a class of one plaintiff must carry at the summary judgment stage is considerably heavier than a mere showing that others have applied,with more auspicious results,for the same benefit that he seeks.see jennings city of stillwater,cir see also clubside,at describing a plaintiff burden at summary judgment in a class of one case as more stringent than that used at summary judgment in the employment discrimination context.were the law otherwise,the federal court would be transmogrified into a supercharged version of a local zoning zoning board on steroids,as it were.
thus,the order to show that other parties were similarly situated to to adduce evidence sufficient to establish factual as well as regulatory similarity.close perscrutation of the record readily indicates that they failed to fulfill this obligation.we explicate this conclusion by specific reference to the four principal instances upon which the allens rely in their effort to show that the town singled them out for disparate treatment.
first,the allens lament that the town counsel informed them that,due to their undersized lot,they would be required to seek a variance or special permit as a precondition to proceeding with the construction of their planned compound they contrast this with the town issuance of a building permit to newman for her undersized lot without first requiring a similar dispensation from the zoning board.
this comparison is inapt the scale of the two projects was dramatically different.the allens proposed improvements were much more ambitious than those undertaken by newman,and materially different projects may be treated differently by zoning or planning boards without raising constitutional concerns.in this instance,it was not irrational for a municipality to conclude that a proposal to relocate an existing residence while expanding the footprint by square feet as newman desired should be treated differently than a proposal involving the construction of a structure,the substantial expansion of an existing building,and the installation of a large pool and deck area.see campbell rainbow city,cir noting that the degree of with a zoning rule is a valid basis for classifying properties as not similarly situated barstad murray county,cir distinguishing the expansion of an existing use from the construction of a new facility see also bell,at observing that the construction of new structures may be dissimilar from the replacement of existing structures.this is especially true in a community which,like truro,has a zoning rule that allows for the issuance of a building permit without leave from the zoning board when the building commissioner determines that a proposed change will not increase the nature or extent of the nonconformity.truro zoning bylaw 
we add a coda.in the context,timing is critical and,thus,can supply an important basis for differential treatment.since zoning bylaws,environmental standards,and licensing criteria may change over time,courts must be sensitive to the possibility that differential differential treatment following a time indicate a change in policy rather than an intent to discriminate.see purze vill.of winthrop harbor,cir.consequently,the most reliable comparisons are likely to be from roughly the same time frame.
there is reason to think that temporal disparities may be relevant here.newman received her building permit in,whereas the allens were referred to the zoning board in.moreover,landis also the owner of an undersized lot,constructed a addition to her home only after obtaining a special permit from the zoning board in.this chronology weakens the inference that newman and the allens are fair congeners.
a second exemplar put forth by the allens involves the truro conservation commission.the commission determined that the allens property rests on a coastal dune.the allens contrast this designation with the town designation of newman abutting property as being located on a coastal bank 
the difference in nomenclature is not inconsequential the presence of a coastal dune imports stringent environmental safeguards and building restrictions.among other things,the designation negates a landowner ability to build on a solid foundation rather than on pilings a course that the allens wished to pursue and adversely affects the landowner right to install certain types of septic systems.
once again,the allens plaint is without merit.while it is true that the town allowed newman to proceed on the basis that her property was situated on a coastal bank and,thus,could be constructed with a drainage system rather than on pilings,the town subsequent conduct has been consistent with its treatment of the allens.in particular,the landis,sexton,and perry additions all have been required to employ pilings as opposed to solid foundations.because the town opposition to the allens efforts to build on a solid fo
