latif khan is a landlord in champaign,illinois,who began renting properties under the section housing choice voucher program in through the housing authority of champaign county hacc.khan relationship with the hacc began to deteriorate in when khan evicted a section tenant from one of his units and edward bland,the executive director of hacc,became aware that khan had entered into a side lease with the tenant for the basement of the unit.bland believed the side lease was a violation of khan section housing assistance payment hap contract and a violation of department of housing and urban development hud regulations.at a meeting with khan and his attorney,bland informed khan that he was going to terminate all of khan existing hap contracts and debar him from doing business with hacc section program in the future because of the violation.bland refused to consider khan explanation of the side lease.a subsequent meeting between bland and khan attorney had the same outcome.at the time,khan had four hap contracts hacc terminated two of those contracts,but allowed two to continue.khan was later informed by a prospective section tenant that pam presley,hacc section coordinator,told her that khan was an undesired person,that he was not good to rent from,and that she could not rent from him.
kahn brought suit against bland,hacc section manager tosha leshure,hacc,and secretary of hud alphonso jackson who is not a party this appeal for violation of his substantive and procedural due process rights under the fourteenth amendment pursuant to.he contends that bland and hacc wrongfully terminated his existing hap contracts and debarred him from the section program without due process.although leshure is a named party on appeal,khan has not appealed the district court ruling dismissing her from the lawsuit.
khan presented evidence of his claims some of which are not at issue here to a jury,and at the close of his case,the appellees moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure.the district court granted the appellees motion,finding that khan had no property right in the renewal of his hap contracts or future contracts and at most,had a state law breach of contract claim for the termination of his existing contracts.khan declined the court invitation to amend his complaint to assert a breach of contract action.khan appeals,contending that the district court erred in granting judgment as a matter of law.
we affirm.khan does not have a property right in his expectancy to enter into new contracts under the section program.he has not pointed to any provision of the hap contract,federal law,or state law that would entitle him to continued participation in the program,and the relevant regulations state that are not entitled to continued participation.while he may have property rights in his existing hap contracts and extensions of those contracts,he was afforded all the process that was due by his available remedy of a state law breach of contract action.because khan was not denied a present entitlement,the due process clause does not require a hearing to interpret the terms of the hap contracts and incorporated federal regulations.
further,although khan argues that he has a liberty interest at stake,he has forfeited this argument by failing to raise it below.even if we assume that khan preserved this line of argument and accept his contention that presley allegedly defamatory statements were directed by bland,khan can not meet the test set forth in paul davis,because he has not shown an alteration of his legal plus prong of the test.in accordance with this court holding in medley city of milwaukee,cir,khan has no liberty interest in participating in the section government assistance program designed to provide benefits to third party participants.
finally,khan can not make out a substantive due process claim for his property interest in existing contracts.a mere breach of contract does not support a substantive due process claim.khan can not show that a fundamental right was implicated by the alleged breach,nor can he show that appellees violated some other substantive constitutional right or that state law remedies were inadequate to redress the alleged violation.
khan asserted seven counts in his complaint the only counts at issue in this appeal are counts i procedural due process claim against bland,iii substantive due process claim against bland,and vi due process claim against the hacc.more specifically,in count i,khan alleged that bland,as executive director of the hacc,deprived him of valuable property rights,his contracts with the hacc and his expectancy to continue to contract in the future,without due process of law.in count iii,khan alleged that bland debarred him from doing business with the hacc and that bland actions were done arbitrarily and capriciously,with malice in retaliation against khan for evicting a tenant who had violated his lease.in count vi,khan alleged that bland was in a position to make and enforce policies on behalf of the hacc and that his actions in terminating khan contracts with the hacc without due process were the actions of hacc.
this court reviews de novo the district court grant of a motion for judgment as a matter of law.greene potter,cir.rule authorizes the entry of judgment as a matter of law if a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue.a.in other words,the question is simply whether the evidence as a whole,when combined with all reasonable inferences permissibly drawn from that evidence,is sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to find in favor of the plaintiff.hall forest river,cir.
a.the section housing choice voucher program 
before exploring the details of this case,we begin by discussing some general aspects of the federal housing subsidy program.the section housing choice voucher program provides rental assistance to families to enable them to participate in the private rental market.this program is administered by hud.o pt.although funded by the federal government,it is generally administered by state or local government entities known as public housing agencies phas.a.a pha must comply with hud regulations and other hud requirements for the program.a.federal regulations require phas to adopt written administrative plans that establish local policies for administration of the program in accordance with hud requirements.
the hacc is the local pha that administers the section program for champaign county,illinois.the hacc board of commissioners establishes the policies under which the hacc conducts business.the principal staff member of the hacc is executive director edward bland.bland reports to the board and is responsible for carrying out hacc policies and managing its operations.bland can draft written policies for hacc,but he must take them before the board for approval.the hacc administrative plan and local policies are not part of the record in this case.
eligibility for the section housing voucher is determined by income.qualified participants pay a percentage of their income toward rent and utilities and receive subsidies for the balance of the rental payment.the participant portion of the rent can not exceed forty percent of his or her monthly adjusted income.a.the subsidized portion of the rent is paid by the pha to the rental property owner the person with the legal right to lease a unit to a participant under the program,pursuant to an hap contract.once a pha determines that a participant is eligible and that there is available space in the program,the pha issues the participant a voucher and the participant can search for housing.
if a property owner agrees to lease a unit to a tenant under the program,he must enter into an hap contract with the pha.the hap contract is prescribed by hud and specifies the maximum monthly rent an owner may charge.c.before the pha enters into an hap contract,the pha must determine that the cost of the unit is reasonable and meets hud prescribed housing quality standards hqs.o a.the hap contract provides that it shall be interpreted and implemented in accordance with hud requirements,including the hud program regulations at code of federal regulations part,part b,b.
the section participant enters into a separate lease with the owner that must meet certain requirements pursuant to o.for example,the lease must include the required tenancy addendum.a.the housing must also be inspected annually to ensure that it continues to meet the hqs.u.o b d.tenants must also family income and composition annually to continue in the program.
factual background 
and now for the details specifically pertinent to this appeal.khan began participating in the section program in through the hacc.up until when khan evicted andrew washington,a tenant participating in the section program,khan had a seemingly good relationship with the hacc.khan first began renting to washington in.the house khan rented to washington had a basement that was not part of the subsidized rental unit and could not be rented as living space.washington asked to rent the basement for storage.khan testified that he called nancy,an hacc inspector who did the for the unit rented to washington,and asked if he could rent the basement as a storage unit to washington under a separate unsubsidized lease.according to khan,said that since the basement was a separate unit and was not part of the subsidized unit,he could rent it as storage.testified that she worked for hacc until,but khan did not rent to washington until,so she would not have been an employee of hacc at the time.the testimony at trial,however,indicates that she was employed at hacc when khan contacted her neither party addressed this inconsistency.in any event,after speaking with,we presume as an employee of hacc,khan entered into a separate unsubsidized lease with washington for the basement as storage.
khan then began having problems with washington as a tenant.he suspected that there were illegal activities going on at the premises and observed that there were inoperable cars and dangerous dogs on the property,smoke detectors and screens that were missing,some windows that were broken,and pests due to uncleanliness.washington also fell behind on his payment for the storage and apartment leases.khan sued to evict washington for late payment of rent and prevailed in december.around that time,washington brought the side lease to bland attention.bland called khan attorney who brought the eviction action to inform him that khan was in violation of hud rules for entering into a side lease with washington and that khan could lose all his section payments.
a meeting was held between bland,khan,and khan attorney a different attorney from the one handling the eviction proceeding later that month.bland informed khan attorney that he believed khan was attempting to get more rent than was allowed under the hap contract and that he did not think the basement was being rented as storage,but instead was used as a way to get around the rent regulations.bland said that khan was not the type of person they wanted in the program.bland informed khan that he was terminating all of his hap contracts and that khan was being debarred from the program.khan was not given the opportunity to explain his position.
khan attorney asked about an appeal process and bland said,well,if he wants to follow that process,i have the inspector general come in and investigate for fraud.khan similarly testified that bland never told him he had a right to a hearing or to an appeal and instead said that i f you do not listen to what i have said,if you ever contest it,i will have you prosecuted criminally.bland told khan he had the authority to debar khan,that he had debarred people before,and that khan would not be the last person he debarred.bland testified at trial that an owner can appeal bland decisions to the board and stated that the hacc has a grievance process in place.nothing in the record describes the process bland only testified that a landlord could write a letter requesting to speak to the board.as noted,neither khan nor his attorney were informed of such a process.
on february,irma harris,hacc section coordinator,sent a letter notifying khan section tenants that khan hap contracts would be terminated effective march,and that they could move to new units effective april.on march,khan received a letter from tosha lesure spelled leshure in the pleadings,hacc section manager,explaining that the hacc recently sent letters to his tenants informing them that it would be terminating his hap contracts and that tenants were also informed that they would need to move from their current units by april.lesure further explained that the hacc was made aware that moving would cause a hardship for some tenants,so f or those tenants who would face a hardship by moving,the hacc will allow them to remain in their current units,but that khan must comply with all housing quality standards hqs and maintain the units in habitable condition.emphasis in original.lesure testified that bland made the decision to terminate khan contracts.
khan retained yet another attorney who scheduled a second meeting with bland around the end of march.khan did not attend this second meeting.bland informed khan attorney that he was not going to allow khan to continue in the program and if khan continued to fight this contract termination that he was simply going to go to hud and report some violations that he alleged existed for khan.khan attorney tried to find out what violations bland was referring to,but bland would not give any specifics.instead he said that if khan continued to push the issue,he would seek criminal charges against him,either through hud or the federal level presumably through other federal authorities.
at this time,khan had four section tenants eddie jackson,caroline hill,carol dorsey,and melody decker.testimony at trial revealed that dorsey and hill were allowed to stay in khan units,his hap contracts for those tenants were not terminated,and he continued to receive section payments for them.khan hap contract for the jackson rental was terminated pursuant to the february letter jackson moved out on april.khan hap contract for the decker rental was terminated,according to the appellees,but disputed by khan,for failing to pass the annual hqs inspection.
khan and decker received a letter from hacc on january,informing them that the annual hqs inspection was scheduled for february.the decker unit failed the first inspection and a second inspection was scheduled for march.after the unit purportedly failed the second inspection,the hacc sent khan a letter dated march informing him that as of april,the contract would be terminated for failure to correct noted deficiencies and decker would be allowed to move immediately.decker moved from the property but testified that she wanted to stay.
khan testified that the inspection of the decker rental was done differently than the ones previously done by the hacc.he stated that his contractor fixed everything on the list from the february inspection and that during the march inspection,the hacc only noted minor repairs that were needed,such as a loose toilet base and two inoperable electrical outlets.until this point,khan never had a property that was terminated for failing an inspection.the year before,rent for the same property was going to be abated meaning no hap payments until repairs are made,but khan fixed the problem before abatement.there was one other instance where khan received a letter from hacc stating that he had to do emergency repairs on one of his units or his hap payments would be abated.although not clear from the testimony,it appears that this issue was resolved without abatement.
monique hassan,a prospective section tenant,testified that she had a voucher for section housing and wanted to rent from khan around the end of.she spoke with pam presley,hacc section,about renting the property.presley told her that khan was an undesired person,that he was good to rent from,and she could not rent from him.hassan informed khan of her conversation with presley and found another unit to rent.
khan alleges that bland and the hacc violated his procedural and substantive due process rights under the fourteenth amendment.he asserts that he had property rights in his existing hap contracts and his expectancy to contract in the future and that bland and hacc terminated his contracts and debarred him from the program without due process.khan also alleges that the termination of his contracts,debarment from the program,and presley statement to hassan that he was undesirable and unfit for the program constituted a deprivation of his liberty interest.he further alleges that his substantive due process rights were violated when bland debarred him from the section program arbitrarily and capriciously with malice in retaliation for evicting a tenant.these theories are discussed below.
procedural due process 
the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment forbids a state from depriving any person of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law.const.amend.xiv.an essential component of a procedural due process claim is a protected property or liberty interest.minch city of,cir.if the plaintiffs can establish such a loss,we then must determine what process was due regarding that loss.belcher norton,cir.
property interest 
to demonstrate a procedural due process violation of a property right,the plaintiff must establish that there is a cognizable property interest a deprivation of that property interest and a denial of due process.hudson city of,cir citation omitted.accordingly,a plaintiff asserting a procedural due process claim must have a protected property interest in that which he claims to have been denied without due process.barrows wiley,cir.khan has no protected property interest in future hap contracts with hacc,so his procedural due process claim on that basis fails.assuming khan has a protected property interest in his existing hap contracts,his due process rights were satisfied by his ability to bring a state law breach of contract action to remedy any alleged violations.
to claim a property interest protected by the fourteenth amendment,a person must have more than a unilateral expectation of the claimed interest.he must,instead,have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.bd.of regents of state colls.roth.a legitimate claim of entitlement to warrant a due process hearing occurs only when the statutes or regulations in question establish a framework of factual conditions delimiting entitlements which are capable of being explored at a due process hearing.fincher south bend heritage,cir internal quotations and citations omitted.a property interest of constitutional magnitude exists only when the state discretion is clearly limited such that the plaintiff can not be denied the interest unless specific conditions are met.brown city of michigan city,cir internal quotations and citation omitted.
using these guideposts,we have held that participants who have been issued a certification for rent assistance have a property interest in the assistance and must be heard before being expelled from the program,simmons drew,cir,but section housing applicants who have been deemed eligible do not have a protected right that entitles them to due process when they are denied a specific section housing unit because landlords have considerable discretion in making final tenancy decisions,fincher,at.the issue here is whether under relevant statutes,regulations,rules,policies or contracts,section landlord,rather than a a legitimate claim of entitlement to continue his existing hap contracts and enter into future contracts.
we begin our analysis with khan claim of debarment.khan argues that bland debarred him from the section program so he could not enter into future hap contracts or participate in any government programs,including research grants.the record contains no evidence that khan was actually debarred from other federal programs or was denied any research grants.debarment is a sanction that excludes an individual from conducting business with any federal agency.see pt.explaining debarment process as conducted by federal agency see also pt.formerly pt.hud debarment procedure.arthur orton,director of compliance for the departmental enforcement center for hud,attested through an affidavit admitted at trial that khan was never debarred by hud.
further,bland,despite his threatening statements,did not have authority to officially debar khan from participation in federal programs.in fact,khan continued to participate in the section program through the hacc with respect to two of his properties.if khan was officially debarred,suspended,or denied participation in a hud program,the regulations set forth procedures for contesting the imposed sanction.see,formerly procedures for contesting a limited denial of participation from hud program.khan did not contact hud to determine whether he was officially debarred,nor does he argue on appeal that the procedures set forth in the applicable regulations should have been followed.this is probably because the regulations apply to debarment by hud and as noted,khan was not debarred by hud and so,was not denied participation in other government programs.
bland,however,effectively debarred khan from the section program administered in champaign county by declining to enter into new contracts with him.so we consider whether khan had a property interest in his expectancy to enter into new hap contracts.to establish such a property interest,khan must show that he has an entitlement to participate through regulations,rules or understandings,such that if certain substantive predicates are met,a particular outcome necessarily follows.see kim const,bd.of trs.of vill.of mundelein,cir finding that a disappointed bidder had no property interest in a contract for a municipal sewer project even though he was the low bidder where the relevant statute and regulations gave the municipality the right to reject any and all bids see also perry sindermann,stating that a person interest in a benefit is property under the fourteenth amendment if there are such rules or mutually explicit understandings that support a claim of entitlement that may be invoked at a hearing.
khan has not shown that the relevant regulations established eligibility criteria that,if satisfied,entitled him to participation in the section program.the regulations prescribe seven reasons why a pha may,in its administrative discretion,disapprove an owner and deny the owner a lease under the program,including an owner violation of his obligations under an hap contract.c.that section also plainly states that n othing in this rule is intended to give any owner any right to participate in the program.e emphasis added.when issuing final implementing regulations in,hud responded to a public comment suggesting an appeal process for owners prohibited from participating in section.hud stated owners have no statutory or regulatory right to participate in the housing choice voucher program,and consequently have no due process right to a hearing on a pha decision to disapprove owner participation.there is no federal mandate for phas or hud to grant owners a process for appeal of a pha decision to disapprove owner participation.section assistance.in dicta,the fifth circuit has noted congress plainly expressed its intent to provide housing assistance for the benefit of the families participating in the program it would be absurd to treat the voucher program as a landlords relief act johnson hous.auth.of jefferson parish,cir.
khan has not pointed to any provision of the contract,federal law,or state law that would entitle him to continued participation in the section program beyond performance of his existing contracts.the regulations themselves state that owners are not entitled to participation.compare talley lane,cir finding that applicant for subsidized housing program for the disabled had no constitutionally protected property interest in the program where housing authority had discretion to establish tenant selection criteria and to determine that applicant was undesirable because of his extensive criminal record,with cont l training,cavazos,cir finding that plaintiff had property interest as a vocational school to participate in the federal student financial aid program under the higher education act for the benefit of its students because the eligibility standards in the act provided the sort of substantive predicate the courts have required before finding that property interests exist.citations omitted,and easter house felder,cir en banc finding that statutory and regulatory limitations upon the illinois department of children and family services authority to deny license renewals to child welfare agencies created a legitimate claim of entitlement and thus,a property interest.because khan is not afforded a substantive right to participate in the program,he is not afforded procedural due process rights upon denial.
khan may,however,have a property right in his existing contracts with hacc.see.waste,city of gary,cir if a contract creates rights specific enough to be enforced in state court by awards of damages or specific performance,then it creates a legitimate claim of entitlement and if it creates such a claim,it is property.this right appears to include the continuation of these contracts beyond a term.the hap contract states that t he term of the hap contract begins on the first day of the initial term of the lease,and terminates on the last day of the term of the lease including the initial lease term and any extensions,part b,a emphasis added see also a the term of the hap contract is the same as the term of the lease.jackson lease stated that t his lease is for one year and extends automatically for another year after that unless terminated by either party at one month notice before the end of the year.pl ex.decker lease provided that t his lease agreement extend s automatically for another year if not terminated by either side before the expiration of the current lease by certified mail.pl ex.
although the defendants presented evidence that the initial lease terms typed on the front of the hap contracts were for twelve months,the term of the hap contract includes the initial lease term and any extensions.while the applicant must undergo and the rental unit must pass an hqs inspection annually to continue the hap contract,if those conditions are met,the term of the hap contract,by its express provisions,includes any extensions of the lease.further,lesure testified that a landlord could expect that as long as he complied with hqs inspections and cooperated with the annual process,the hap contract would renew.the hacc,however,can terminate hap contracts if it determines that the unit does not meet all requirements of the hqs,or if the owner has otherwise breached the contract,part b,b,a and c.
whether khan existing hap contracts were wrongfully terminated requires an evaluation of the terms of the contract and incorporated federal regulations.the hap lists actions by the owner that constitute a breach,including 
if the owner has violated any obligation under the hap contract,including the owner obligation to maintain the unit in accordance with the hqs.
if the owner has violated any obligation under any other housing assistance payments contract under section.
if the owner has committed fraud,bribery or any other corrupt or criminal act in connection with any federal housing assistance program 
part b,a see also.when the hacc determines that a breach has occurred,it shall notify the owner of such determination,including a brief statement of the reasons for the determination,part b,b.any notice must be in writing,part b.
bland testified that he is authorized to terminate hap contracts when he believes the owner has violated the terms of the agreement.he terminated the hap contract for the decker rental because of alleged hqs failures.he terminated the jackson rental because of khan alleged violation of his hap contract on the washington unit,but did not provide khan with the required written notice.khan contends that the hap contract on the decker rental should not have been terminated for such minor hqs violations that khan was ready,able,and willing to fix.khan testified that he repaired the items noted from the february inspection and the march inspection only revealed minor items that he could have fixed yet,the hacc terminated his contract.the regulations,however,provide that the owner must maintain the unit in accordance with hqs and if he fails to do so,the housing authority must take prompt and vigorous action to enforce the owner obligations,such as termination of the hap contract.a and see also b stating that the owner is responsible for m aintaining the unit in accordance with hqs,including performance of ordinary and extraordinary maintenance.
even assuming the hap contract for decker was properly terminated for hqs violations,khan contends that the hap contract for jackson should not have been terminated.if,however,khan violated the hap contract on the washington rental by entering into a side lease for storage space,then the hacc could terminate his other hap contracts pursuant to,part b,a.at trial,the parties disputed whether the side lease was a violation of the hap contract.
under the hap contract,the owner certifies that e xcept for the rent to owner,the owner has not received and will not receive any payments or other consideration for rental of the contract unit during the hap contract term,part b,d emphasis added see also b i and ii the part of the rent to owner which is paid by the tenant may not be more than a the rent to owner minus b the pha housing assistance payment to the owner and t he owner may not demand or accept any rent payment from the tenant in excess of this maximum see also,part c,e the owner may not charge or accept,from the family or from any other source,any payment for rent of the unit in addition to the rent to owner.emphasis added.the rent includes all housing services,maintenance,utilities and appliances to be provided and paid by the owner in accordance with the lease and the owner may not charge the tenant extra amounts for items customarily included in rent to owner in the locality,part c,e and c see also c.
the tenancy addendum further states that if the tenant and the owner agree to any changes in the lease,such changes must be in writing,and the owner must immediately give the hacc a copy of such changes,part c,a.any changes must be in accordance with the requirements of the tenancy addendum,part c,a.the owner must notify the hacc of any changes in the amount of the rent to owner at least sixty days before any such changes go into effect,and the amount of the rent to owner following any such agreed change may not exceed the reasonable rent for the unit as most recently determined or redetermined by the hacc,part c,d emphasis added.
khan contends that he did not violate these provisions because he was renting a different unit,not for housing,but for storage.he points to the definition of c ontract unit under the hap the housing unit rented by the tenant with assistance under the program,part c.because the storage space was not part of the housing unit rented under the program,khan asserts that his side lease did not violate the hap.he further asserts that,hacc inspector,confirmed that he could enter into the side lease.
however,we need not decide whether the side lease was a breach of the hap contract because khan could have asserted his rights under the contract through a breach of contract action.due process does not necessarily require that khan be given a predeprivation hearing where there is no present entitlement and the issue is an ordinary state law claim of breach of contract by a public body.where a postdeprivation hearing not only is feasible but will give the deprived individual a completely adequate remedy due process does not necessarily require a predeprivation hearing.see,chi.united,city of,cir quoting ellis sheahan,cir.t he adequacy of litigation as a means to determine the meaning of a contract is a premise of our legal system.id.quoting.waste,at see also indiana land city of greenwood,cir all states provide judicial remedies for breach of contract and these remedies will almost always provide all the process that is constitutionally due.
