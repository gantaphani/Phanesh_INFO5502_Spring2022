oti kaga appeals the district court grant of summary judgment dismissing its complaint against the south dakota housing development authority sdhda and its board.the complaint alleges sdhda discriminated against oti kaga by rejecting its applications for tax credits under internal revenue code irc,and for funding under the home investment partnership act home program.we affirm.
oti kaga is a corporation established by the cheyenne river sioux tribal government pursuant to the united states housing act of.oti kaga purpose is to acquire,construct,and operate rental housing and related facilities on the cheyenne river sioux indian reservation.
sdhda is an independent public instrumentality exercising essential public functions under codified laws.sdhda is responsible for,among other things,adopting and implementing a tax credit allocation plan pursuant to irc,as well as administering the state home program in south dakota.appellees william earley,john rothstein,kevin culhane,lynn hager,thomas schramm and leland kleinsasser are members of sdhda board of commissioners,and appellee darlys baum is sdhda executive director.baum and the board members were sued individually and in their official capacities.
oti kaga claims arise out of sdhda administration of two federal housing programs.the first,the tax credit allocation program,is authorized by irc,and encourages investment in housing projects.under the tax credit allocation program,state housing agencies are responsible for allocating tax credits for the construction of housing.irc h limits the total number of housing credits a state may allocate annually,and irc m requires the credits to be allocated in accordance with a qualified allocation plan.the annual plan must be prepared by the state housing agency and approved by the governmental unit of which the agency is a part.irc m a i.sdhda is the authorized housing agency for south dakota.codified laws.
the second program at issue is the home program.the home program provides federal housing funds directly to participating jurisdictions.the jurisdictions disburse those funds in the form of loans and grants to provide incentives to develop and support affordable rental housing and home ownership affordability.a.prior to,states,certain municipalities,and indian tribes were participating jurisdictions in the home program.a.accordingly,each indian tribe in south dakota could apply directly to the department of housing and urban development hud for an indian home program allocation.indian tribes could also apply to the state housing development authority for state home program funds.according to hud regulation part,a state may fund projects on indian reservations located within the state provided that the state includes indian reservations in its consolidated plan.because of the separate allocation existing prior to,sdhda adopted annual home program plans which included reservation demographics but precluded the use of state home program funds for tribal projects.
in,congress enacted the native american housing and act nahasda.in conjunction with nahasda,congress terminated several programs which had provided indian housing assistance,including the indian home program.thereafter,indian housing assistance was funded directly through indian housing block grants ihbg,and disbursed to recipients on the basis of indian housing plans ihp prepared by the tribes and submitted to hud.unlike home program funding,which is based on a competitive process,ihbgs are entitlement funds which tribes use to meet locally identified needs.b.
notwithstanding consolidation of programs under nahasda,hud regulations implementing the home program continue to allow states the discretion to fund projects on indian reservations provided the state includes the reservations in its annual home program plan.prior to passage of nahasda,sdhda chose to include reservations in its annual plan but did not award state home program funds to indian reservations or other jurisdictions receiving separate allocations of funds after nahasda became effective sdhda continued this practice.
in march,oti kaga,with the assistance of david bland submitted an application for tax credits to sdhda in connection with a proposed housing development elk view i located on the cheyenne river sioux indian reservation.of the applications for tax credits received by sdhda in,four came from indian tribes.sdhda considered the applications and ranked them from one to according to its tax credit allocation plan,with one being the highest rated and the lowest rated application.oti kaga application was ranked six out of but,as with other higher ranked applications,it did not receive an award of tax credits.only one of the tax credit awards went to an indian sponsor.in addition to ranking criteria set out in irc m c,sdhda considered the extent to which the sponsor of the application was ready to proceed.one member of sdhda testified this factor weighed heavily against oti kaga.another board member stated the board decided it should award one tax credit to an indian tribe,and a lower ranked application was selected.in october,oti kaga was subsequently awarded the tax credits after a successful applicant declined its award.oti kaga contends it was discriminated against because the decision to initially deny tax credits was based on race.
oti kaga intended to build elk view i using tax credits and indian home program funding obtained in.it intended to build the second phase of the elk view project elk view ii using tax credits and indian home program funding awarded in.oti kaga contends it suffered distinct and palpable injuries in connection with those planned projects caused by the delay in awarding tax credits in.oti kaga alleges it was told indian home program funding would not be awarded in unless tax credits were also awarded.because it was initially denied tax credits,oti kaga ignored the indian home program application deadline.as a result,elk view i was delayed until and ran into cost overruns.oti kaga alleges it was further harmed because it was forced to use indian home program funds obtained in,which had been earmarked for elk view ii,to construct the delayed elk view i project,thereby in turn delaying elk view ii.oti kaga also alleges a price quote it obtained for an environmental assessment for elk view i increased significantly from to.
oti kaga also claims discrimination resulting from sdhda decision not to award state home program funds in.as previously noted,oti kaga alleges it was forced to use indian home program funds to build elk view i.as a result,it had to seek alternative funding for elk view ii.thus,in oti kaga applied to sdhda for state home funding to finance elk view ii.its application for state home program funding was denied.among the reasons given for denying the application were sdhda belief that housing projects on indian reservations were provided for under nahasda,and state home program funds were no longer available for indian projects.as with the denial of tax credits,oti kaga argues the decision to deny its application for state home program funding was based on race.oti kaga contends it was harmed by the discriminatory refusal to award state home program funds because the lack of funding delayed construction of elk view ii.
oti kaga brought suit against sdhda and its board members claiming disparate treatment under the fair housing act of fha,disparate impact under the fair housing act of,violation of the right to contract,violation of the property rights of citizens,disparate under the civil rights act of,and negligent performance of statutory obligations discrimination in the allocation of home program funds,discrimination in title vi programs disparate treatment,improper allocation of tax credits,irc m state fair housing act violation,codified laws ch.and deprivation of rights under color of law.appellees moved for summary judgment on the basis of standing,political question doctrine,mootness,qualified immunity,the inability of a corporation to recover damages for personal injury,statute of limitations,the inability to prove intentional discrimination,a failure to exhaust state administrative remedies,and failure to join indispensable parties.the district court granted summary judgment finding oti kaga lacked standing to bring any claims arising from the denial of its application for tax credits because it sustained no injury and,alternatively,the claims were barred by expiration of the statute of limitations.the district court also dismissed oti kaga claims arising out of the denial of its application for state home program funding,finding oti kaga could not make out a prima facie showing of intentional discrimination or disparate impact.oti kaga,housing dev,d.

standing to assert denial of tax credits 
the district court granted summary judgment and dismissed oti kaga claims arising from denial of tax credits finding it failed to allege any injury in fact.we review the district court grant of summary judgment based on standing de novo.national fed of the blind of cross,cir.
the question of standing involves constitutional limitations on jurisdiction.bennett spear,d quoting warth seldin,d.
to satisfy the case or controversy requirement of article iii,which is the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing,a plaintiff must,generally speaking,demonstrate that he has suffered injury in fact,that the injury is fairly traceable to the actions of the defendant,and that the injury will likely be redressed by a favorable decision.

oti kaga claims the delay in awarding tax credits caused it to forego applying for indian home program funding in,thereby delaying elk view i and resulting in cost overruns.oti kaga further claims it was harmed by having to use indian home program funds to construct the elk view i project,leaving it without a funding source for the elk view ii project.finally,it contends the delay in construction caused the cost of an environmental assessment to increase.
we conclude oti kaga has alleged sufficient injury in fact,traceable to appellees,to satisfy the requirements of standing.we question oti kaga ability to prove its damages claims given its decision to ignore the application deadline,but we find the allegations are not incapable of proof.oti kaga alleges it was improperly denied tax credits.it further alleges the receipt of indian home program funding was dependent upon an award of tax credits,and even if it had applied for funding it would have been denied.the fact it was awarded indian home program funding for elk view i in,after receiving the award of tax credits,provides support for its allegations.accordingly,we find oti kaga has alleged sufficient facts showing it was injured by the wrongful denial of tax credits to meet the injury in fact and causation requirements of standing 
statute of limitations 
alternatively,the district court held oti kaga claims relating to denial of the tax credits were barred by the applicable statute of limitations.we agree.
the district court,citing wilson garcia,d,concluded south dakota statutes of limitations governing personal injury actions,codified laws,and civil rights actions,codified laws,governed all of oti kaga claims arising from denial of the tax credits.oti kaga did not dispute the applicability of these statutes.instead,it argued the claims were not barred because sdhda actions constituted an ongoing tort,thereby tolling the limitations period.the district court disagreed,finding the alleged discriminatory conduct ended in october when the tax credits were awarded.the district court concluded oti kaga period for bringing claims based on the denial of tax credits expired in october,and oti kaga did not file suit until february,approximately four months after the statute of limitations expired.
on appeal,oti kaga abandons its earlier position and argues a different statute of limitations applies.it now contends the district court erred in applying the limitations periods set out in and.oti kaga now argues the appropriate statute of limitations is the limitations period found in a a.oti kaga further argues the limitations period was tolled,in accordance with a b,during the pendency of its fair housing complaint.the record shows oti kaga filed a fair housing complaint following denial of its application for tax credits and the complaint remained pending from october through september.if this period is taken into account,oti kaga complaint was timely.
appellees argue oti kaga is precluded from presenting this new argument on appeal.daisy ncr,cir holding absent exceptional circumstances this court will not ordinarily consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal.oti kaga contends its argument is not new because its complaint alleges the facts necessary to establish the applicability of a b tolling provision,and characterizes its argument as new authority rather than a new claim.we disagree.oti kaga is not simply advancing additional authority on appeal to support an argument it articulated in the district court.rather,it has abandoned its earlier position in favor of a new argument one the district court had no opportunity to consider.in renfro swift eckrich,cir,we refused to consider,absent exceptional circumstances,an argument that a statute of limitations applied when the party had argued in the district court a statute of limitations applied.here we find no exceptional circumstances warranting a different result.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment dismissing all of oti kaga claims premised on the denial of tax credits 
denial of home program funding 
next,oti kaga alleges several causes of action arising out of sdhda denial of state home program funds in.we consider each of these claims in turn 
fair housing act claims 
oti kaga alleges disparate treatment and disparate impact resulting from sdhda refusal to grant state home program funding in,in violation of the fha,and.the district court,relying on village of arlington heights metro.housing dev,d,dismissed oti kaga claims finding oti kaga,as a corporation,has no racial identity and can not establish its membership in a protected class.see oti kaga,d at citing mcdonnell douglas green,d.the district court noted several appellate court decisions characterizing the language in arlington heights as dictum,but nevertheless concluded b ecause the supreme court has yet to speak again on the issue and because there is no guidance on the topic from the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit,this court will adhere to it.oti kaga,d at.
