this appeal stems from a civil forfeiture action brought by the united states on august,against eight parcels of real property,in united states currency,six vehicles and five financial accounts.after timothy bishop bishop filed a timely claim and answer as to all in rem defendants listed in the initial complaint,the district court stayed the action pending the outcome of bishop parallel criminal case.on july,bishop was convicted of possession with intent to distribute marijuana in violation of a,and on september of that year the district court lifted the stay.
when the united states then moved for an interlocutory sale of the in rem defendants located in new hampshire based on their deteriorating condition,the district court granted that motion.in an amended complaint the united states added an additional parcel of real estate plus an allegation that three of the previously named parcels were forfeitable under a and a 
on november,the united states filed its summary judgment motion,accompanied by an evidentiary record comprising affidavits and numerous exhibits supporting its allegations that all of the in rem defendants were purchased with drug proceeds and that four parcels had been used to facilitate drug trafficking.bishop admitted in his partial objection to motion for summary judgment objection that he can not mount a sufficient defense as to each asset to prove that it was acquired with untainted money.bishop also asserted for the first time that the united states summary judgment motion must be denied because the government forfeiture complaint was filed outside the five year limitations period of.
on october,the district court ruled that bishop had waived more accurately,forfeited any statute of limitations defense when he failed to raise that affirmative defense in a responsive pleading,though the court also held that the forfeiture proceeding was timely filed in any event.because bishop had also failed to dispute the merits of the forfeiture as to the assets at issue,the district court entered a final order of forfeiture.bishop takes this appeal from that order,also alleging in part that he was denied effective assistance of counsel and that the united states perpetrated a fraud on the court.because none of bishop arguments possess any merit,we affirm the district court decision.
background 
bishop involvement in drug trafficking dates back to,when he and a partner began to purchase approximately ten pounds of marijuana weekly for distribution.bishop stored that marijuana at the home he shared with his parents.when he went to college in the late,bishop began to purchase larger amounts of marijuana for sale to other dealers.from through several tenants who rented property owned by bishop stored and sold marijuana from the property and paid rent to bishop from drug proceeds.during that time bishop and a partner also purchased marijuana that they sold from another of bishop properties.in the period from december to may bishop purchased at least pounds of marijuana from roger pageot at approximately per pound,then distributed the marijuana.
beginning in bishop business was so robust that he was able to purchase numerous parcels of real property,each funded at least partially with proceeds from his drug sales financial records also indicated that bishop eventually purchased a porsche,a honda motorcycle and a audi quattro.while the cost of those purchases aggregated more than,bishop reported taxable income of only during that same time period.throughout the and early bishop also deposited over in various financial accounts.
bishop exploits began to attract law enforcement attention.on november,police officers executed a search warrant at one of bishop properties after surveilling the premises.they seized an ohaus electric gram scale,ziploc bags,a box of marijuana,a triple beam scale and rolling paper.
bishop ultimately became the subject of a drug enforcement agency dea investigation in june.through a confidential informant ci the dea learned that the ci had been supplying bishop with large quantities of marijuana since.in addition the dea learned that bishop had been charged with possessing distribution amounts of marijuana in and,as well as having been convicted twice in on charges of possessing a gun.bishop contends that the dea had knowledge of his drug trafficking history before,arguing that lowell police office barry goldner goldner must have submitted bishop arrest information to the dea federal database.but because bishop submitted that contention without any evidentiary support despite his burden to produce rebuttal evidence,it can not be credited at this stage of the proceedings.
it is undisputed that in the course of its investigation the dea monitored and recorded meetings between bishop and the ci.that investigation culminated in bishop arrest after the dea videotaped bishop buying four blocks of marijuana from the ci.on that same day investigators executed a search warrant at bishop address,where they recovered strong evidence of drug trafficking,including drugs,drug ledgers and cash.those drug ledgers were submitted to special agent eugene saupp saupp,a supervisory forensic examiner with the fbi,who concluded after investigation that the records seized at bishop house contained balances for accounts related to his drug business between and.according to saupp,the records reflected a minimum total of in drug sales during those years.saupp also opined that some of the records related to sales in bishop more recent marijuana distribution business.
after his arrest bishop pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute of approximately pounds of marijuana in violation of section a,receiving a month prison sentence.those events gave rise to the civil forfeiture proceedings that the district court later enforced on summary judgment and that bishop now appeals.
standard of review 
we review summary judgment rulings de novo vives fajardo,cir.we will not disturb a district court summary judgment ruling so long as there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.rule c.as horizon lines of puerto rico,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted has explained,a n issue is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party,and a fact is material if it has the potential to affect the outcome of the suit.we have relatedly observed in smith,cir that a genuine issue of material fact does not spring into being simply because a litigant claims that one exists,id.internal citation omitted further instructs that n either wishful thinking nor conclusory responses unsupported by evidence will serve to defeat a properly focused rule motion.thus the nonmoving party must produce hard evidence of a material factual dispute id.to survive a summary judgment motion.
government burden of proof 
since the civil asset forfeiture reform act of act,amending the government burden to prove that certain property is subject to forfeiture was increased from mere probable cause the old standard to the preponderance of the evidence united states,cir.act c states 
t he burden of proof is on the government to establish,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the property is subject to forfeiture.
act c emphasis added goes on to provide 
i f the government theory of forfeiture is that the property was used to commit or facilitate the commission of a criminal offense,the government shall establish that there was a substantial connection between the property and the offense.
bishop argues that the government failed to satisfy its burden of proving that there was a sufficient nexus between the drug proceeds and bishop ownership of the property.we disagree.
at the outset we note that bishop conceded that all in rem defendants were purchased,at least in part,with drug proceeds.here is bishop concession,set out in his objection 
therefore,for purposes of this proceeding only,bishop will not contest the allegations that all assets were purchased at least in sufficient part with money or,in the case of liquid assets,include money to make them su
