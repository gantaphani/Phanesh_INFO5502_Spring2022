the city of huntington beach appeals the district court determination that the telecommunications act of,stat.codified as amended at titles,and the tca,preempted its decision to require omnipoint communications,doing business as t mobile,to obtain voter approval before constructing mobile telephone antennae on park property.tmobile the district court denial of permanent injunctive relief.we conclude that the city decision was not preempted and consequently reverse the district court.
we first consider the preemptive scope of the tca.because congressional intent is the ultimate touchstone of preemption analysis,when congress adopts a statute that provides a reliable indication of congressional intent regarding preemption,the scope of federal preemption is determined by the statute.engine mfrs.ass coast air quality mgmt,cir internal quotation marks omitted.although congressional intent primarily is discerned from the language of the preemption statute and the statutory framework surrounding it,also relevant are the structure and purpose of the statute as a whole,as revealed not only in the text,but through the reviewing court reasoned understanding of the way in which congress intended the statute and its surrounding regulatory scheme to affect the law and parties whose actions are affected by the statute.medtronic,lohr,internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also cipollone liggett,explaining that congress intent to preempt may be explicitly stated in the statute language or implicitly contained in its structure and purpose internal quotation marks omitted.therefore,we begin by assessing the text of the relevant provisions of the tca and their historical and statutory context.
in,congress passed the tca to encourage the development of telecommunications technologies,including wireless telephone services.city of rancho palos verdes abrams.among other means to this end,congress enacted c,entitled p reservation of local zoning authority,which was intended to minimize federal interference with state and local land use decisions,kay city of rancho palos verdes,cir,while still reducing the impediments imposed by local governments upon the installation of facilities for wireless communications,such as antenna towers,abrams,at.
as suggested by the title of c,an understanding of the mechanics of local governments zoning and land use decision making is necessary to discern the section preemptive scope.see kay,at.in general,local governmental authorities,such as cities and counties,establish local zoning boards,planning commissions,or analogous entities to promulgate and enforce zoning and other land use restrictions within their jurisdiction.patrick rohan,zoning and land use controls julian conrad juergensmeyer thomas roberts,land use planning and development regulation law ed see also williamson cnty.reg l planning comm hamilton bank.local land use decisions fall into two general categories.see dolan city of tigard,contrasting t he sort of land use regulations that involved essentially legislative determinations classifying entire areas of the city,with a city adjudicative decision to condition petitioner application for a building permit on an individual parcel.first,local land use authorities may recommend or enact plans and zoning maps that affect the classification and use of property generally.juergensmeyer roberts,supra,at.this is primarily a legislative function.see rohan,supra,at a cal.gov t code classifying the adoption of a general plan as a legislative act.second,local land use authorities may exercise an adjudicative function that involves applying land use rules to individual property owners,including the consideration of requests for waivers and variances.juergensmeyer roberts,supra,at.
in addressing land use regulations and decisions related to the installation of wireless communication facilities,the tca closely tracks the typical division of land use decision making.see kay,at noting that the text used in c closely mirrors state laws relating to zoning and permitting agency decisions.congress began by enunciating a general principle of preservation of local authority 
except as provided in this paragraph c nothing in this chapter shall limit or affect the authority of a state or local government or instrumentality thereof over decisions regarding the placement,construction,and modification of personal wireless service facilities.
this preservation principle is subject to the limitations set forth in the subsections of c b.two of the four subsections,c b i and iv,relate to the promulgation of generally applicable legislative regulations.thus,c b i provides that the regulation of the placement,construction,and modification of personal wireless service facilities by any state or local government or instrumentality thereof shall not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services and shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services.id.c b i i ii.section c b iv provides that n o state or local government or instrumentality thereof may regulate the placement,construction,and modification of personal wireless service facilities on the basis of the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions where the facilities otherwise comply with federal requirements.id.c b iv.
the other two subsections,c b ii and iii,refer to the procedures used by local land use authorities in making adjudicative decisions.see cellular.town of oyster bay,cir noting that the tca clearly establishes procedural requirements that local boards must comply with in evaluating cell site applications.these subsections provide 
ii a state or local government or instrumentality thereof shall act on any request for authorization to place,construct,or modify personal wireless service facilities within a reasonable period of time after the request is duly filed with such government or instrumentality,taking into account the nature and scope of such request.
iii any decision by a state or local government or instrumentality thereof to deny a request to place,construct,or modify personal wireless service facilities shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.
id.c b ii iii.under these subsections,local zoning authorities must adopt administrative procedures requiring timely,written decisions when adjudicating an application for approval of a development project involving personal wireless service facilities.id.c b ii see kay,at.
we conclude that c a functions to preserve local land use authorities legislative and adjudicative authority subject to certain substantive and procedural limitations.this conclusion clarifies the scope of c a preemptive effect.section c does not have a typical preemption clause that expressly preempts state law,followed by a savings provision excepting certain types of state enactments from preemption.a,b a stating that the provisions of erisa shall supersede any and all state laws as specified,except as provided in the savings clause.rather,c takes the opposite approach it begins with a savings clause,and then makes the savings clause subject to exceptions.thus c expressly preserves local land use decisions,such as decisions regarding placement,construction,and modification of wireless facilities,and then makes this preservation principle subject to a proviso e xcept as provided in the rest of c.id.c a emphasis added.although this approach reverses the order of a typical preemption clause,it accomplishes the same goal by logical inference,congress intended the proviso section to preempt local land use authority that does not comply with the requirements in c b,while preserving local zoning authority that complies with such requirements.see metropcs city of,cir holding that the tca preempts only those local zoning decisions that conflict with the tca antidiscrimination and provisions and not decisions that are harmless to the fcc regulatory scheme.accordingly,we conclude that c has the following preemptive scope it preempts local land use authorities regulations if they violate the requirements of c b i and iv and it preempts local land use authorities adjudicative decisions if the procedures for making such decisions do not meet the minimum requirements of c b ii and iii.
we next consider the facts of this case,including the pertinent legal framework for the city decisions.
this case implicates two different aspects of municipal authority the city authority to enter into licenses of cityowned property,and the city responsibility for making and implementing planning and zoning decisions.first,as a charter city under california law,the city has plenary authority to control municipal property.the california constitution reserves to charter cities the authority to make and enforce all ordinances and regulations in respect to municipal affairs,subject only to restrictions and limitations provided in their several charters.cal.const,a see also simons city of,d.in,an initiative known as measure c amended the city charter to impose certain limits on the city ability to authorize use of property.this provision states 
no structure costing more than may be built on or in any park or beach or portion thereof unless authorized by the affirmative votes of at least a majority of the total membership of the city council and by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the electors voting on such proposition at a general or special election at which such proposition is submitted 
according to the voter information pamphlet,which is a proper extrinsic aid to interpreting an initiative,people lester,the purpose of measure c was to allow the citizens of huntington beach to have a direct vote in any future commercial development or sale of the city parks and beaches,so as to put control of public park lands into the hands of the voters and out of the reach of developers and special interest groups.by giving the voters authority over construction on public lands,measure c operates as a limitation on the city otherwise plenary authority over these lands.
second,the city has obligations under state and local law for making and implementing land use decisions.although charter cities are also exempt from many of the state local planning and zoning regulations provisions,see cal.gov t code,their legislative bodies adopt general plans which contain the mandatory elements set by state law.id.see also id,b.the city has established such a general plan,see huntington beach,code,and has also promulgated regulations to implement its own zoning and subdivision code,id.the city delegated the preparation and recommendation of legislative land use determinations,such as amendments to the general plan and zoning map,to a planning commission,id,d see also id,subject to the city council final authority to approve or deny legislative determinations,id.a.the city delegated its adjudicative land use authority to administrative bodies,primarily the planning commission and a zoning administrator.see id.d e.these administrative bodies adjudicate land use applications subject to the city council authority to act as a board of appeals.id.a.
the city process is subject to typical administrative procedural requirements.as relevant here,the planning commission,zoning administrator,or city council must render its decision on an application or appeal in the form of a written statement,minute order or resolution,which shall be accompanied by reasons sufficient to inform as to the basis for the decision.id.a.further,t he reviewing body shall formulate its written findings within five calendar days after the decision and must provide notice of its decision to the applicant and any other party that requests such notice.id.b,c.
at the time of t mobile application in,the city council had in place an ordinance establishing a procedure for the adjudication of applications to construct and modify wireless communication facilities within city limits.see id.c under the regulations,a person wishing to install and operate a wireless communication facility,such as an antenna,must submit a permit application to the planning and building department.id.e after the department confirms that the application is complete,the applicant must obtain a wireless permit from the director of the department or a conditional use permit from the zoning administrator.id.e.the applicant can appeal a denial of the permit to the planning commission.id.e d,c the city council is the final arbiter of any appeal of the planning commission adjudication of a permit application.id.a.
in july,t mobile submitted two applications to the city planning and building department for wireless permits to construct wireless antennae in harbour view park and bolsa view park.the applications identified the city as the property owner of the parcel where the antennae would be located.under the director authority,see huntington beach,code e,the planning and building department approved t mobile requests for the two wireless permits shortly thereafter,in august and september.
after obtaining these permits,t mobile commenced lease negotiations with the city,and ultimately entered into site license agreements to lease space in each park for the antennae.the agreements were executed by the city mayor in december and approved unanimously by the city council in january.under the site license agreements,the city,as owner of the property,authorized tmobile to install and maintain its wireless facility on the city premises,for which t mobile would pay a licensing fee.
after obtaining the site license agreements,t mobile applied to the city building and safety department for building permits to begin construction of the facilities.in its applications,t mobile reported that the total construction valuation of the bolsa view and harbour view antennae were and,respectively.after the department issued these building permits in april,tmobile began to construct the harbour view site antenna.
after construction commenced at harbour view,local residents who opposed the construction commenced aggressive protests that blocked activities at the site.tmobile agreed to stop construction temporarily pending the city efforts to resolve this unexpected public opposition.in subsequent communications between t mobile and city representatives,the city learned that the total construction value of the projects that t mobile had reported on the applications for building permits did not reflect the total construction costs,which would substantially exceed for each antenna.
in april,the city held a special meeting of the city council,at which residents spoke against the construction of an antenna at the harbour view location.at a subsequent closed session,the city council determined that,although tmobile had valid land use and building permits and valid site license agreements,t mobile still was required to obtain voter approval under measure c before it could proceed with construction.accordingly,on july,the city attorney sent t mobile a letter stating that the city continues to recognize the validity of the site licenses and the wireless permits,but because the construction costs for each wireless facility exceeded,the city was obliged to enforce measure therefore,the city attorney directed the building and safety department to suspend the building permits until t mobile obtained voter approval.
instead of seeking voter approval,t mobile filed a complaint in federal district court in may and moved for preliminary injunctive relief to prevent the city from requiring compliance with measure t mobile argued that the tca barred the city from applying measure c to tmobile proposed projects.the city filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that it had acted as a participant in the market,rather than as a regulator,and therefore the market participant doctrine shielded its decisions regarding the use of its own property from federal preemption.
in october,the district court denied the pretrial motions submitted by t mobile and the city.first,it denied t mobile motion for preliminary injunctive relief because t mobile had not sufficiently demonstrated a likelihood of irreparable harm.the court also rejected the city argument that it could avoid the tca preemptive effect because it had acted as
