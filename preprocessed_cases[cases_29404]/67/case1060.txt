the district court,adopting the magistrate judge report and recommendation,found that the security interest claimed by mitchell had been extinguished by merger of the title and mortgage when the property was reconveyed to mitchell automotive by deed in lieu of foreclosure.consequently,usl levy on the property and its garnishment of rents were to be sustained and enforced.defendants argue that the district court erred by ruling that the deed merged into the mortgage failing to determine whether the levy was proper and failing to afford defendants a jury trial or evidentiary hearing pursuant to.comp.laws ann.after review of the record and the arguments presented on appeal,we affirm 
formed in as a subsidiary of mitchell,mitchell automotive manufactured and sold leather products for use in automobile interiors.mitchell automotive purchased a substantial amount of finished leather from usl and,by early,had built up a debt to usl of more than million.at the same time,mitchell had booked more than million in loans to its subsidiary.given its financial troubles,which it attributed to nafta,mitchell automotive found a buyer that they hoped could secure additional automobile manufacturer contracts.
on april,lamont group,and lamont group acquisition corporation,purchased mitchell automotive assets,including the clare facility,for a total of million.the lamont group paid with million in cash and two promissory notes for the balance.to secure the notes,the lamont group granted mitchell automotive a security interest in the purchased assets and a mortgage on the clare facility.also,the debt owed to usl was assumed by the lamont group.on april,within days of the sale,usl filed this diversity action to recover on the debt 
on may,mitchell automotive granted mitchell a continuing security interest in all its personal and intangible property,including all instruments,to secure any and all existing and future indebtedness.the security agreement was signed by helen malik as secretary and treasurer for both mitchell and mitchell automotive.it is undisputed that mitchell obtained a security interest in the lamont group mortgage and promissory notes through this agreement 
the lamont group defaulted and,on november,surrendered possession of all personal property that constituted collateral subject to its indebtedness to the first secured creditor.the lamont group also delivered to mitchell automotive a quitclaim deed in lieu of foreclosure for the clare property,which stated in pertinent part 
it is lamont intent to convey and transfer absolute title to the above described premises to mitchell automotive,free of any equity of redemption.it is expressly understood and agreed that the execution and delivery of this deed shall not in any manner be deemed to be a merger with or the extinguishment of the mortgage or constitute a reduction of the indebtedness secured thereby.the mortgage and the entire indebtedness secured by the mortgage is and remains in full force and effect provided,however,that the recourse obligation of lamont group under that certain asset purchase agreement dated april,shall be reduced by the sum of six million dollars.
mitchell automotive held both title to and the mortgage on the property.
on january,a consent judgment in favor of usl was entered against mitchell automotive,the lamont group,and lamont group acquisition corporation,jointly and severally,in the sum of,plus interest.usl conducted a creditor examination,during which helen malik testified as the representative of mitchell automotive.
on may,usl levied on the personal property of mitchell automotive at its offices in owosso,michigan.the levy officer arrived with three trucks and several assistants to take possession of the personal property.in order to avoid the cost of transportation and storage,mitchell automotive,through counsel,agreed that the officer would have complete control over the sale of all of mitchell automotive personal property that mitchell automotive would not sell,move,or dispose of any of its personal property and that its remaining personal property was not sufficient to satisfy the judgment.with that understanding,the levy officer did not take possession of the property.

in july,usl served a periodic garnishment on the tenant that was paying to use the clare facility.mitchell,claiming an interest in the clare property,filed a motion to set aside the periodic garnishment.usl received a total of in garnished periodic lease payments before the lease was terminated.then,on august,usl filed its motion for determination of interests in the property of mitchell automotive,arguing that mitchell security interest was extinguished by merger,was not perfected,was fraudulent,and that the corporate form should be disregarded.the mitchell defendants filed a joint response on september.
these motions were referred to the magistrate judge who,after briefing and oral argument,issued his report and recommendation on march.the magistrate judge concluded that the mortgage and security interest in it should be deemed to have been extinguished in november and that mitchell had failed to perfect its security interest until after usl garnishment and levy of personal property.on march,the mitchell defendants jointly filed objections to the and a separate demand for jury trial.usl responded to the objections.
the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation,agreeing that merger extinguished mitchell security interest and finding that the remaining objections would not alter the outcome.accordingly,the court denied the motion to set aside garnishment,granted usl motion for determination of interest in its favor,and sustained the garnishment of rents and levy on the clare property.this appeal followed.

mitchell automotive argues for the first time on appeal that there could be no merger because it did not hold both the title and the mortgage.defendants reliance on maxwell hammond,to support this proposition is misplaced.in maxwell,a mortgage on real property was granted to austin davis to secure several notes.davis indorsed the notes and assigned the mortgage to a bank to secure his own debt.when the property was later deeded to davis,the fee did not merge with the mortgage because davis had previously transferred th
