plaintiffs,edgar allen gibson and leslie gibson,appeal the dismissal of their suit seeking recovery under a standard flood insurance policy.plaintiffs argue that their claims were not barred by the statute of limitations and that their state law claims should have been remanded to state court.we affirm.
plaintiffs purchased a standard flood insurance policy sfip issued by defendant,american bankers insurance company,under authority of the national flood insurance act nfia.plaintiffs claimed their home and its contents were damaged by a flood on april.on june,defendant denied coverage under the sfip.on june,plaintiffs filed this action in kentucky state court alleging breach of contract,violation of kentucky law,and breach of the fiduciary obligations of good faith and fair dealing.on june,pursuant to,defendant removed the case on the basis of federal question jurisdiction.defendant argued that plaintiffs claims could only be pursued under the nfia.
after removal,a magistrate judge granted defendant motion to dismiss under.b the judge found that plaintiffs claims were based on defendant denial of coverage under an sfip issued under the nfia,claim disputes under sfips are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal district courts,plaintiffs failed to file their claims in federal district court within nfia one year statute of limitations,and the statute of limitations was not tolled by plaintiffs filing in state court because that court did not have jurisdiction under nfia.the magistrate judge found that plaintiffs challenge to the disposition of their sfip claim must be adjudicated exclusively in federal court under the nfia and refused to remand the state law claims.plaintiffs appealed.
a dismissal pursuant to a rule b motion is reviewed de novo.see williamson county cmty.ass slater,cir.dismissal of a complaint because it is barred by the statute of limitations is proper when the statement of the claim affirmatively shows that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts that would entitle him to relief.duncan leeds,cir emphasis in original internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
plaintiffs argue that their claims are not barred by the statute of limitations because the filing in state court tolled the statute under nfia.the filing in a state court of competent jurisdiction tolls the statute of limitations during the pendency of the state action.burnett cent,d.we agree with the district court that plaintiffs claims disputing the handling and denial of coverage under the sfip were within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal district court and,therefore,the filing in state court did not toll the statute of limitations.
nfia was enacted to provide a unified national program to reduce and avoid losses due to flood by making reasonably priced flood insurance available for residential and commercial properties.the federal emergency management administration fema administers the national flood insurance program.a.congress authorized fema to prescribe regulations establishing the general method or methods by which proved and approved claims for losses may be adjusted and paid for any damage to or loss of property which is covered by flood insurance.fema established a comprehensive regulatory scheme setting forth the rights and responsibilities of insureds and insurers under the national flood insurance program.see pts.under regulatory authority granted by congress in a,fema created the write your own wyo program,which authorizes private insurance companies,such as defendant,to issue sfips.
jurisdiction and the statute of limitations for claims made under nfia are defined in 
u pon the disallowance by the director of any such claim,or upon the refusal of the claimant to accept the amount allowed upon any such claim,the claimant,within one year after the date of mailing of notice of disallowance or partial disallowance by the director,may institute an action against the director on such claim in the united states district court for the district in which the insured property or the major part thereof shall have been situated,and original exclusive jurisdiction is hereby conferred upon such court to hear and determine such action without regard to the amount in controversy.
see also.we have concluded that this language mandates that federal district courts have exclusive jurisdiction over suits under nfia.see state bank of coloma flood ins.program,cir.
the insurance policy in state bank was issued directly by fema,as opposed to a policy,like the one in this case,that was issued by a private insurance company under the wyo program.in van holt liberty mutual fire insurance company,cir,the third circuit addressed this difference and concluded 
for several reasons,a suit against a wyo company is the functional equivalent of a suit against fema.first,a wyo company is a fiscal agent of the united states.a.second,fema regulations require a wyo company to defend claims but assure that fema will reimburse the wyo company for defense costs.i.third,an insured flood insurance claims are ultimately paid by fema.after a wyo company depletes its net premium income,fema reimburses the company for the company claims payments.pt,app.a,art.iv a.when a wyo company proceeds from insurance premiums exceeds its current expenditures,it must pay the excess proceeds to the fia.pt,app.a,art.vii b.although a wyo company collects premiums and disburses claims,only fema bears the risk under the flood insurance program.thus,a lawsuit against a wyo company is,in reality,a suit against fema.
the third circuit noted that to construe narrowly to confer exclusive jurisdiction only in cases against fema would cause anomalous results 
because fema bears the risk and financial responsibility regardless of whether the lawsuit formally names fema or a wyo company as the defendant,it would make little sense for congress to have intended to create original exclusive jurisdiction for suits against fema but not for suits in which fema fiscal agent is the nominal defendant.
we adopt the third circuit reasoning and hold that provides exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over suits against a wyo insurance company arising out of a disputed flood insurance claim.see also hairston travelers cas.sur,cir holding that federal courts have jurisdiction over suits brought under policies issued by wyo companies.but see downey state farm fire cas,cir declining to follow the third circuit reasoning in van holt.
we have also held,however,that if the state court does not clearly lack jurisdiction,equitable tolling may still apply.farrell auto.club of,cir.equitable tolling should be applied sparingly and only when exceptional circumstances prevented timely filing through no fault of the plaintiff.ayers united states,cir.
when plaintiffs filed their suit in state court,the sixth circuit had not addressed whether such claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal district courts.at that time,however,every court that had addressed this issue concluded that conferred federal district court jurisdiction over suits against wyo companies for sfip payment disputes.see van holt,at miller am.banker ins.group,d,parsons footwear,omaha prop.cas,d,webb aetna ins,no.civ,wl.july.there were,therefore,no competing jurisdictional theories to justify the application of equitable tolling.see fox eaton,cir.
in addition,plaintiffs sfip specifically stated 
conditions for filing a lawsuit you may not sue us to recover money under this policy unless you have complied with all the requirements of the policy.if you do sue,you must start the suit within months from the date we mailed you notice that we have denied your claim,or part of your claim,and you must file the suit in the united states district court of the district in which the insured property was located at the time of loss.
pt,app.a,r while forum selection clauses in contracts do not deprive courts of jurisdiction,they are presumptively valid.see stewart org.ricoh,d bremen zapata,d.in light of the lack of any judicial authority supporting the filing of plaintiffs suit in state court and given that plaintiffs were explicitly put on notice of the need to sue defendant in federal court through the specific contractual language of the sfip,there are no exceptional circumstances that justify the tolling of the statute of limitations.see hairston travelers cas.sur,cir filing in state court did not toll statute of limitations on plaintiff sfip claims because state court did not have jurisdiction.
that leaves plaintiffs final argument that their claims under the kentucky unfair claims settlement statute,should be remanded to state court.if plaintiffs claims under the kentucky statute are preempted by nfia,there are no claims to remand to state court.under the supremacy clause of the united states constitution,state laws that interfere with,or are contrary to the laws of congress,made in pursuance of the constitution are invalid.pub.intervenor mortier,d quoting gibbons ogden,wheat.whether federal law preempts state law turns principally on congressional intent.cent.pipeline state.comm of,d.
this court will give preemptive effect to federal law where a federal statute expressly preempts state law,a federal law impliedly preempts state law,or federal law and state law actually conflict.gustafson city of lake angelus,cir.state and federal law actually conflict when compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility.lime avocado growers,paul,d,or when a state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress,hines davidowitz.implied preemption occurs if a scheme of federal regulation is so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for the states to supplement it,if the act of congress touch es a field in which the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject,or if the goals sought to be obtained and the obligations imposed reveal a purpose to preclude state authority.mortier,at.quoting rice santa fe elevator.
while this circuit has not addressed this issue,most courts have consistently found that nfia preempts state law claims that are based on the handling and disposition of sfip claims.see novikov allstate ins,no.civ,wl.july,state law claims of breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress under an sfip were preempted by nfia because applicability of state law would undermine a nationally unified program of flood insurance jamal travelers lloyds of texas ins,d claims of breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing and violations of texas law are preempted by nfia neill state farm fire cas,d,causes related to the insurance company claims handling under state law was preempted.some cases have distinguished between state law claims based on the handling of an sfip claim and those that are related to the procurement of the policy.see messa omaha prop.cas.ins,d,state law claims were nothing more than disagreement with disposition of sfip claim and are barred by field preemption under nfia.some courts have found that claims relating to the procurement of the policy are not preempted by nfia.see spence omaha indem.ins,cir powers ins.agency,no.civ,wl.but see bleecker standard fire ins,no preemption because federal funds would not be used to pay damages for torts committed by wyo companies.
in this case,plaintiffs claim defendant violated the kentucky statute by failing to act promptly on communications,refusing to pay the claim,failing to affirm coverage,and not attempting a good faith settlement.all of these claims are in essence over the disposition of the sfip claim.they are all based on defendant handling and denial of coverage under the sfip.congress and fema have regulated the claims adjustment process and judicial review of coverage claims under flood insurance policies.uniformity of decision requires the application of federal law and precludes the enforcement of state laws on the same subject.if plaintiffs prevail,their coverage claims will be paid with federal funds.the defense costs incurred by defendant are also covered by federal funds.see i.it is unnecessary for us to decide whether policy procurement type state law claims are preempted by nfia.the claims asserted by plaintiffs clearly are preempted by nfia and are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts.these claims,therefore,are likewise barred by the statute of limitations and there are no claims to remand to state court.
i concur in the majority conclusion that the federal courts have exclusive original jurisdiction over lawsuits challenging the disallowance of claims against private insurers participating in the write your own wyo program under the national flood insurance act nfia,pursuant to.i disagree,however,with the majority conclusion that federal law preempts the gibsons tort claims.i also disagree with the majority conclusion that equitable tolling is not appropriate under the present circumstances.for these reasons,i respectfully dissent.
preemption 
the gibsons argue on appeal that,even if the magistrate judge correctly determined that their federal contract claim for breach of the insurance policy was,the magistrate judge erred in dismissing their tort claims against american instead of remanding them to kentucky state court.opposing the remand of these state claims to state court,the wyo insurer,american bankers insurance american,argues that remanding these claims would be inconsistent with the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts under,and that these tort claims are preempted by federal law.i consider each of these arguments in turn.
exclusive federal jurisdiction over tort claims 
with respect to american first argument,it is clear that congress may confine jurisdiction over federal claims to the federal courts and thus override,in effect,the concurrent jurisdiction of the state courts.see,tafflin levitt,d gulf offshore mobil oil,d.but this rule applies only to federal may not confine jurisdiction over state claims to the federal the issue is really whether the gibsons advanced federal or state claims in their complaint.
the majority agrees with american that should be interpreted broadly to encompass the gibsons tort claims.the statutory provision at issue states that upon the disallowance of any claim the claimant,within one year may institute an action on such claim in the united states district court,and original exclusive jurisdiction is hereby conferred upon such court to hear and determine such action.the majority holds that the gibsons tort action was really based on the disallowance of their insurance claim and thus that the federal district courts had exclusive jurisdiction over that action.
in effect,the majority transforms the gibsons tort claims into a contractual claim and then holds that that claim is preempted by federal law the van holt court endorsed this interpretation of the nfia,holding that it effectively confines jurisdiction over claims sounding in tort but which are intimately related to the disallowance of their insurance claim to the federal courts.see van holt liberty mut.fire ins,cir.in reaching this conclusion,however,van holt specifically declined to hold that the claims were preempted by federal law.see id.at w e need not decide whether the nfia preempts the claims.instead,that court based its holding on the fact that federal funds are at stake in this suit.id.at.the van holt court concluded that there was exclusive federal jurisdiction under over claims sounding in tort,even though the van holt insureds had not alleged,explicitly,that the wyo insurer had violated the terms of the insurance policy.see id.instead,the van holt insureds had alleged that the wyo insurer had violated the new jersey consumer fraud act and acted in bad faith.presumably,the van holt insureds could not have prevailed on these tort claims without establishing that the wyo insurer violated the terms of the policy.
van holt may be read to stand for the proposition that claims against wyo insurers are,effectively,federal claims where the federal government would be required,by statute,to cover the liability of the wyo insurers on those claims.although i agree with this proposition in principle,i disagree with the van holt court application of it to insureds tort claims.not every lawsuit against a wyo insurer is really a suit against fema,with costs to be paid ultimately out of the treasury.although fema covers the expenses of wyo insurers in paying out claims and in litigating challenged disallowances in federal court,the nfia states a clear exception to this rule t he director of the federal emergency management agency may not hold harmless or indemnify an agent or broker for his or her error or omission.c.thus,under the nfia the federal government is not obligated to indemnify wyo insurers for tort liability arising from their handling of flood insurance claims.to put the matter simply,federal funds are not at stake in cases such as this,and thus the tort claims pleaded by the gibsons should properly be considered tort claims rather than contract claims,even under the reasoning of van holt.
the issue,then,is whether the gibsons tort claims qua tort claims are preempted by federal law.the majority concludes that they are,but,as demonstrated in the next section,this conclusion can not be squared with the statutory and regulatory language in effect at the time this lawsuit was initiated.
preemption of tort claims 
under the supremacy clause,const.art.vi,cl,federal law can preempt state law in three different ways.first,in cases of express preemption,congress explicitly defines the extent to which its enactments state law.english general,d.second,in cases of field preemption,state law is where it regulates conduct in a field that congress intended the federal government to occupy exclusively.id.at.congressional intent to occupy a field of regulation in this way will be inferred where federal regulation is pervasive or where the federal interest dominates,precluding state regulation.see id.third,in cases of conflict preemption,state law is to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law.id.
despite the majority conclusion to the contrary,the nfia does not preempt tort claims such as the gibsons in any of these ways first,congress has not explicitly preempted tort claims,as the nfia does not include an express preemption provision.see spence omaha indem.ins,cir the nfia contains no express preemption provision.scherz car.ins,d,t he nfia does not contain an express preemption provision.id.in an amicus brief the united states and fema acknowledge that the nfia does not contain an express preemption provision.some courts that have held,incorrectly,that expressly preempts tort claims based on a broad reading of the term claim as used in that provision.see,mason witt,d,holding that state law tort claims are preempted under an express preemption theory stapleton state farm fire cas,d,same.the majority opinion is perhaps best read as adopting this view.as discussed supra,however,the nfia expressly provides,in c,that wyo insurers are liable for their own errors and omissions,and it seems unlikely that congress intended to preempt tort claims where federal funds are not at stake 
second,congress did not intend federal law to occupy the field of flood insurance regulation to the exclusion of state tort law.this conclusion is based primarily on the structure and language of the nfia itself.in enacting the nfia,congress provided that fema would bear the costs incurred by the wyo insurers in litigating claims arising out of claims under the wyo policies themselves.thus,as the van holt court recognized,a lawsuit against a wyo company is,in reality,a suit against fema.van holt,at.but,as discussed supra,not every lawsuit against a wyo company is really a suit against fema,because c specifically prohibits fema from indemnifying an insurer for his or her error or omission.because the nfia makes no explicit provision for insureds to sue wyo insurers for such errors and omissions,the logical conclusion is that congress intended insureds to employ state tort law to sue wyo insurers in such circumstances.see bleecker standard fire ins,d,as nfia does not provide a cause of action for an insurance agent error or omission,it is logical to conclude that congress intended for plaintiffs to avail state law remedies to address an insurer tortious misconduct.davis travelers prop.cas,d,given that the nfia has no provision for holding insurers liable for error or omissions,a logical conclusion is that congress contemplated that state tort law could apply to the conduct of wyo insurers.
in addition,regulations promulgated by fema under the nfia reinforce this conclusion.for example,in describing the arrangement between fema and the wyo insurers,the regulations state,in relevant part 
limitation on litigation costs.following receipt of notice of a claim,the office of general counsel ogc,fema,shall review the information submitted.if it is determined that the claim is grounded in actions by the insurer that are outside the scope of this arrangement,the nfia,and cfr chapter,subchapter b,involve issues of negligence the ogc shall make a recommendation to the administrator as to whether the claim is grounded in actions by the insurer that are significantly outside the scope of this arrangement.in the event the administrator determines that the claim is grounded in actions by the insurer that are significantly outside the scope of this arrangement,the insurer will be notified,in writing,within thirty days of the administrator decision,if the decision is that any award or judgment for damages arising out of such actions will not be recognized as a reimbursable loss cost,expense or expense reimbursement.
pt,app a,art.as discussed supra,the payment of claims arising under the wyo that are governed by federal law and over which federal courts have exclusive reimbursed by fema.but these regulations envision that wyo insurers will incur litigation costs that are not reimbursable under the nfia.see also pt,app.a,art.ix t he responsible party shall bear all liability attached to that delay,error or omission to the extent permissible by law.although the regulations,like c,do not explicitly state that these liabilities will arise under state law,the clear implication is that these costs related to negligence,or,in the terms of c,error or omission,will arise from tort claims.see also bleecker,d at davis,d at stanton state farm fire cas,d,clearly,state tort claims were contemplated and were not expressly prohibited.
similarly,national flood insurance program nfip regulations require that wyo insurers be licensed by the state to engage in the business of property insurance,a,and allow for state auditing and regulation of wyo insurers,see pt,app.b b the wyo companies are subject to audit,examination,and regulatory controls of the various states.see also moore allstate ins,alaska noting that the federal government did not preempt all state involvement in flood insurance.
finally,the gibsons claims are not preempted because of a conflict between kentucky law and the federal statute or its objectives.conflict preemption occurs where it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements,or where state law would frustrate the objectives of congress in enacting the federal legislation.english,at.with respect to the first prong,there is nothing in the record to indicate that american could not comply with both kentucky and federal requirements in their dealings with the gibsons and other insureds,at least on the facts of this case.after all,american should be able to comply with the requirements of the nfip without breaching duties of good faith and fair dealing imposed by kentucky statutory and common law.this conclusion is further bolstered by fema regulations,which dictate that i n carrying out its functions a wyo company shall use its own customary standards,staff and independent contractor resources,as it would in the ordinary and necessary conduct of its own business affairs.e.this provision appears to require that wyo insurers comply with state insurance law,just as they would in their ordinary,business.
with respect to the second prong,the bet
