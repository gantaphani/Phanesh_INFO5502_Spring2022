after a jury convicted william bryson,of swindling the estate of an elderly woman,the district court entered a forfeiture order against his assets.william son,leland,challenged the order,contending that some of the forfeited assets belonged to him.finding that leland had no legal or equitable interest in the forfeited property at the time his father committed the illegal acts that resulted in the forfeiture,the district court rejected leland challenge.leland appeals.in addition to urging affirmance,the government alternatively asserts that we should dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because leland noted his appeal before the district court judgment became final.for the reasons that follow,we hold that we have jurisdiction and affirm the judgment of the district court.
on january,a jury convicted william bryson on two indictments.all counts involved a complicated scheme to defraud the estate of ethel swink.the jury forfeited of william assets.
on june,the district court entered a preliminary order of forfeiture and an order for substitute assets pursuant to p.the substitute assets included lots,and at richardson pointe in seneca,south carolina,and a plot on sitton mill road in seneca,south carolina.each of the five lots had been at one time titled in leland name.the court served leland attorney with a notice of forfeiture,which leland acknowledges receiving.
one month later,pursuant to n,leland filed a petition of interest in this forfeited property.the swink estate,david lusk,and rachel bryson william bryson wife also filed petitions of interest in other parcels of forfeited property.at the outset of the forfeiture hearing held on january,the government informed the court that the swink estate had only petitioned to protect the forfeiture order,and that the government had settled with lusk and reached an arrangement with rachel bryson,resolving her claim by agreement.the court then heard testimony as to the only remaining claim to the property,that of leland bryson.
on march,the district court issued an order rejecting leland claims and declin ing to amend the final order of forfeiture.the court explained that leland failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he has an interest in lots,and of richardson pointe,or the acre tract on sitton mill road all in seneca,south carolina.although the claims of the swink estate,lusk,and rachel bryson seem to have been resolved by the time of or at the forfeiture hearing,the court issued no formal order disposing of those claims nor did the court certify pursuant to.c that it found no just reason for delay with respect to leland claim.nevertheless,on april,leland filed a notice of appeal.
on september,the government moved to dismiss leland appeal as violative of.c,which provides 
if multiple petitions are filed in the same case,an order dismissing or granting one petition is not appealable until rulings are made on all the petitions,unless the court determines that there is no just reason for delay.
on march,the district court entered orders disposing of the claims of the swink estate,lusk,and rachel bryson in the manner outlined at the january,forfeiture hearing.one month later,the government filed a notice with this court that the district court march,orders rendered moot its motion to dismiss this appeal.nevertheless,we asked the parties to submit supplemental briefs on the jurisdictional issue.in its brief and at oral argument,the government changed its position and maintained that we lack jurisdiction to consider the appeal.
unquestionably,leland notice of appeal was premature.at the time he noted his appeal,the district court had entered a written order rejecting his claims to the forfeited property,but the court had not entered a final order of forfeiture accounting for the other claims to the property,even though those claims essentially had been resolved by then.nor had the district court made any determination pursuant to.c that there was no just reason for delay ing leland appeal prior to the entry of a final order of forfeiture.
in equipment finance group traverse computer brokers,cir,we considered whether we had jurisdiction over a similar,prematurely filed appeal.there the plaintiff noted its appeal after the district court had granted summary judgment to one defendant,but before it had issued a ruling as to the remaining defendant.nor,at the time the appeal was noted,had the court certified,pursuant to.b,that the initial decision appealed from was a final judgment and there was no just reason for delay.we concluded that n onetheless the subsequent dismissal of the claims of the remaining defendant prior to our consideration of the appeal effectively satisfies the finality requirements of rule b.equipment finance,at.we noted that the practical approach to finality adopted under these procedural circumstances caused no prejudice to the defendant and accorded with the similar rationale in harrison edison.apparel stores,cir granting effect to rule b certification filed after appeal noted.id.
as the government recognizes,the certification specified in.c,the rule at issue here,is akin to that specified in.b,the rule at issue in equipment finance.supplemental brief of appellee at.in fact,rule c is derived from.b.advisory committee note wright,king klein,federal practice and procedure criminal,at.undoubtedly for this reason,the government implicitly acknowledges that if equipment finance is good law,its rationale compels the conclusion that we have jurisdiction over the case at hand.the government suggests,however,that equipment finance is inconsistent with the supreme court prior decision in firstier mortgage investors mortgage ins,d.
in firstier,the court considered whether an appellate court had jurisdiction over an appeal filed after the district court had orally announced that it intended to grant summary judgment but before the district court had entered judgment or the parties had,at the court request,submitted findings of fact and conclusions of law.the tenth circuit had held that it lacked jurisdiction over the case because the district court had not issued a final judgment at the time the appeal was noted.firstier,at.the supreme court reversed.id.
the court pointed out that fed.a specifically provided that a notice of appeal filed after the announcement of a decision or order but before the entry of the judgment or order shall be treated as filed after such entry and on the day thereof.id.at.the court rejected the view that an initial decision or order under rule a must be final.instead,the court held that the rule permitted an appeal taken from a nonfinal decision,in certain cases,to serve as an effective notice from a subsequently entered final judgment.id.at.the firstier court cautioned that,of course,rule a does not allow a premature notice of appeal from a clearly interlocutory as a discovery ruling or a sanction order under rule to serve as a notice of appeal from the final judgment.id.at.rather,the court held that rule a permits a notice of appeal from a nonfinal decision to operate as a notice of appeal from the final judgment only when a district court announces a decision that would be appealable if immediately followed by entry of judgment.id.emphasis in original.
despite the government suggestion to the contrary,we do not believe equipment finance conflicts with firstier.in equipment finance,as here,the district court initial nonfinal decision would have be en appealable if immediately followed by entry of judgment,as required by firstier.in equipment finance the entry of judgment following the initial nonfinal decision would have to have been done pursuant to.b in the case at hand,it would have had to have been done pursuant to.c.obviously,the firstier court had no occasion to consider an entry of judgment pursuant to these rules but nothing in firstier indicates that its holding does not apply to such judgments and rightly so a judgment properly certified by a district court pursuant to.b or.c is just as final as one made final pursuant to other rules.see,cold metal process united eng g foundry.sears,roebuck mackey.
