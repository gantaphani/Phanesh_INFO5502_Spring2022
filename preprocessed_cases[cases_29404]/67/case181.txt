plaintiffs brought suit against doral financial corporation and doral mortgage corporation collectively,doral for violation of the federal truth in lending act tila.plaintiffs seek rescission of their home loans,and damages,based on doral alleged failure to provide them sufficient notice of their rescission rights.the district court granted doral motion to dismiss plaintiffs claims.we affirm.
background 
because this case reaches us on appeal from the granting of a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,we accept as true plaintiffs factual allegations.see rogan menino,cir.
there are two sets of plaintiffs in this case.the first set,johnny and maria the santoses,obtained an original home mortgage from doral mortgage in.by march,the santoses had defaulted on payments under the original loan.to maintain their home,they elected to refinance on march,again with doral mortgage.the new loan totaled,of which was used to pay off the principal and finance charges due under the original loan,thus canceling that loan.the parties dispute what was done with the in additional proceeds from the refinancing.doral argues that the entire amount was remitted to doral as financing charges,while the santoses claim that one month after the transaction was finalized,they received in proceeds from doral within a year,doral mortgage assigned the santoses new loan to doral financial which was the legal holder of the note at the time this action was brought.
the second set of plaintiffs is composed of lymary and ranfi the rojases.the rojases obtained an original home mortgage with doral mortgage on august,the rojases refinanced their original loan,again with doral mortgage.the refinancing loan totaled,of which went to pay the principal balance and finance charges outstanding on the rojases original loan,which was cancelled.of the remaining funds,went to doral mortgage for refinancing fees,and reverted to the rojases as a new money advance.
before closing on the refinancing loans,doral provided the santoses and rojases with a notice of right to cancel.the form was modeled on federal reserve board model form.see app.both sets of plaintiffs received identical disclosure forms,and they acknowledged receipt by signing the documents.below,we excerpt the relevant sections of the disclosure form that plaintiffs received 
you are entering into a transaction that will result in a mortgage,lien or security interest on your home.you have a legal right under federal law to cancel this transaction,without cost,within three business days 
if you cancel the transaction,the mortgage,lien or security interest is also cancelled.
if you decide to cancel this transaction,you may do so by notifying us in writing you may use any written statement that is signed and dated by you and states your intention to cancel,or you may use this notice by dating and signing below.
the tila grants consumers a rescission period for any consumer credit transaction where a security interest will be acquired by the lender in the consumer principal dwelling.a.this rescission period begins to run when the transaction is consummated or upon delivery of notice of the consumer right to rescind,whichever occurs later.id.however,the rescission period is extended to three years if the lender fails to meet the disclosure requirements of the tila.f.the federal reserve board frb has issued an implementing regulation known as regulation z,which governs,among other things,the disclosures that lenders must make to consumers.et.regulation z includes an appendix of model forms for various consumer transactions,including model forms and,which are at issue here.see app.
in,plaintiffs informed doral of their intention to rescind their refinance loans,arguing that doral alleged failure to disclose properly their rescission rights had extended the rescission period to three years.thereafter,doral issued written rejections of plaintiffs attempts to rescind.in response,plaintiffs brought suit against doral,originally framed as a class action in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico,seeking rescission of their loans,and statutory and actual damages.the district court granted doral motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,holding that doral met its disclosure obligations by clearly and conspicuously informing the plaintiffs of their rescission rights.plaintiffs now appeal the dismissal of their claims.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo the grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,accepting all facts as true and giving the party who has pleaded the contested claim the benefit of all reasonable inferences.palmer champion mortgage,cir.
plaintiffs make two arguments to support their assertion that the rescission period for their refinance transactions should be extended from three days to three years.first,they allege that doral failed to comply with the tila disclosure requirements because it gave plaintiffs a form patterned on model form,which is designed for general transactions,rather than one patterned on model form,which is designed for refinancing transactions.see fed.reg.second,plaintiffs argue that the form doral used was misleading because it did not adequately explain the effects of rescinding a refinancing loan,as opposed to an original loan.we take these arguments in turn.
plaintiffs first approach is a.they insist,despite clear statutory and regulatory language to the contrary,that if the creditor does not provide the appropriate form,the borrower shall have rescission rights.this is simply incorrect.the statute permits the lender to inform consumers of their rescission rights by using the appropriate form of written notice published and adopted by the federal reserve board,or a comparable written notice of the rights of the obligor.h emphasis added.the plain meaning of the word or makes clear that the lender may comply with its disclosure obligations by using a model form or,alternatively,a comparable written notice.regulation z is equally clear that either type of notice will satisfy the lender obligation to satisfy the disclosure requirement the creditor shall provide the appropriate model form in appendix h of this part or a substantially similar notice.b emphasis added.in addition,the tila plainly states that use of the model forms is not obligatory.see b nothing in this subchapter may be construed to require a creditor or lessor to use any such model form or clause prescribed by the board under this section.
in sum,because the plain language of the statute and regulations does not require exclusive use of the model forms,plaintiffs are incorrect to insist that doral alleged failure to provide the appropriate frb form is a per se violation of and regulation 
plaintiffs second argument requires more analysis.they assert that doral use of a form patterned on model form rather than significantly misled them as to their rescission rights,because the effects of rescinding a refinance loan are different from the effects of rescinding an original loan.in particular,plaintiffs highlight that the form they received failed to disclose that if a refinancing loan is rescinded,the original loan is not cancelled,meaning that the lender retains a security interest in the property under the original loan,and the consumer reverts to paying off the original loan.plaintiffs argue that a consumer would be less willing to rescind a refinance loan if he believed that as a result he would also have to repay the original mortgage.
our analysis of this argument must start with the disclosure standard set forth in the tila,which requires that lenders clearly and conspicuously disclose borrowers rescission rights.a.regulation z elaborates on this disclosure standard by listing the five elements of clear and conspicuous disclosure 
the notice shall be on a separate document that identifies the transaction and shall clearly and conspicuously disclose the following 
i the retention or acquisition of a security interest in the consumer principal dwelling.
ii the consumer right to rescind the transaction.
iii how to exercise the right to rescind,with a form for that purpose,desi
