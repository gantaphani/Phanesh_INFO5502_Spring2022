in,plaintiff sycamore industrial park associates bought an industrial property with fixtures,including a steam heating system,from defendant ericsson.before it sold the property,ericsson installed a new natural gas heating system,but it left the old heating system in place.several years after purchasing the property,sycamore discovered that the boilers,pipes,and various pipe joints that make up the old system were insulated with material.sycamore sued to force ericsson to remove and dispose of the abandoned asbestos insulation and reimburse sycamore for alleged response costs it has incurred or will incur in removing the asbestos insulation.this action arises under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla,and under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra.the district court granted ericsson motion for summary judgment,and sycamore appealed.for the reasons explained below,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
background 
ericsson owned the property at issue,located in sycamore,illinois,for several decades.the property contains nine buildings where ericsson manufactured electrical wiring and cable.during most of ericsson ownership of this property,the buildings were heated by the boiler system.the boilers are large mechanical units and are anchored to the floor of the two buildings that house them.they are connected to the other buildings through a pipe network.most of the pipe network runs near the ceilings of the several buildings and is connected to the structures at intervals by metal fasteners.all of the insulated piping is located inside the various structures of the facility except for two areas where the piping extends between buildings.the insulated piping that extends between buildings is encased in a mechanical piping chase or in a metal casing.to maximize thermal efficiency,most elements of the steam boiler system are covered with insulation.this insulation is physically attached to the steam boiler system and associated piping.
in january,ericsson ceased all of its manufacturing operations at this facility and sought to sell it to a third party.soon thereafter,an ericsson employee,michael kreiger,decided that he would like to purchase the property and operate it as an industrial park.kreiger was ericsson vice president for managing services and purchases and was in charge of managing the sycamore property for ericsson.
meanwhile,in the winters of and,the heating system was experiencing difficulty and needed costly repair and maintenance.in december,while negotiating to sell the property to kreiger,ericsson leased part of the property to uarco.before uarco moved into the site,ericsson installed natural gas unit heaters in the parts of the facility that uarco would occupy.
in late,ericsson reached an agreement to sell the property to kreiger.kreiger then partnered with another ericsson employee,robert boey,to form sycamore industrial park associates as an illinois general partnership.as soon as the sale was completed,kreiger would transfer ownership in the facility to the sycamore partnership.
in the spring of,ericsson installed additional natural gas unit heaters so that the entire facility could be heated with the new units.upon installing the new heaters,ericsson discontinued use of the old heaters,but it left the old heating system in place.
ericsson sale of the property to kreiger closed on may.kreiger immediately assigned the property to sycamore.ericsson did not remove the old heating system at the time of sale the boilers and piping remained completely in place after the sale.at the time of the sale,neither kreiger nor boey requested that ericsson remove the old heating system.
the abandoned steam heating system has not been used for the purpose of heating the buildings since the closing.the parties disagree as to whether the system is merely turned off,meaning that it could be utilized again,or whether it is inoperable.
in,sycamore discovered asbestos in the insulation that covered the steam boiler system and associated piping.the parties dispute the circumstances under which the asbestos was discovered.ericsson describes the discovery as the result of a repair and maintenance operation in an attempt to show that sycamore was contemplating use of the system.sycamore responds that it discovered asbestos during a routine inspection by a prospective tenant and that it was not considering utilizing the old heating system.
sycamore sued ericsson,seeking to compel it to remove the insulation.sycamore claims that by discontinuing use of the heating system containing asbestos insulation but not removing it from the site,ericsson violated cercla and rcra.sycamore also sued under state law nuisance and negligence theories not at issue on appeal.
on january,the district court granted ericsson motion for summary judgment.the district court found that the defendant abandoned the asbestos insulation in place at the property prior to sale.yet it held as a matter of law that the abandonment did not constitute disposal of a solid or hazardous waste into or on any land or water so that such solid waste or hazardous waste might enter the environment,as cercla requires.in addition,the district court held as a matter of law that the abandonment of the heating system and the subsequent sale of the sycamore property was not handling,storage,treatment,transportation or disposal of any solid or hazardous waste,as required by rcra.sycamore appeals the district court decision on the cercla and rcra claims.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
this court reviews a district court grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo.jackson county of racine,cir.in doing so,all facts and reasonable inferences are construed in the light most favorable to the nonmovant party,sycamore.lawson csx,cir.a district court grant of summary judgment is to be affirmed if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
cercla claim 
cercla liability attaches when a plaintiff establishes that the site in question is a facility as defined by cercla the defendant is a responsible party there has been a release or there is a threatened release of hazardous substances and the plaintiff has incurred costs in response to the release or threatened release.a envtl.transp,ensco,cir stevens creek assocs.barclays bank,cir.the second and third elements are at issue here.
cercla states that a prior owner of a facility is a responsible party if it controlled the site at the time of disposal of a hazardous substance.a.we have held in the past that asbestos is a hazardous substance within the meaning of cercla.leasing union elect,cir.therefore,for ericsson to be a responsible party,sycamore only needs to show that a disposal took place before ericsson relinquished control of the site.cercla adopts the definition of disposal from the solid waste disposal act,which defines disposal as 
d ischarge,deposit,injection,dumping,spilling,leaking,or placing of any solid waste or hazardous waste into or on any land or water so that such solid waste or hazardous waste or any constituent thereof may enter the environment or be emitted into the air or discharged into any waters,including ground waters.
accordingly,to make a case for ericsson liability as a responsible party,sycamore must establish that at the time it controlled the site it discharged,deposited,injected,dumped,spilled,or leaked a solid or hazardous waste or placed it into or on any land or water.
one issue that arises is whether the boiler system is solid or hazardous waste.while cercla purports to cover both solid and hazardous waste,in order to be hazardous waste the material must be solid waste because the statute defines hazardous waste as a solid waste,or combination of solid wastes,which because of its quantity,concentration,or physical,chemical,or infectious characteristics may be hazardous.solid waste is then defined as any garbage,refuse,sludge from a waste treatment plant,water supply treatment plant,or air
