this appeal presents the question of how to untangle the real property interests of a criminal from those of the criminal spouse for purposes of forfeiture pursuant to the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,l.adrienne totaro appeals from the district court denial of her claim of legal right,title or interest to the country estate she shared with her husband ronald totaro for almost thirty years.we conclude adrienne proved by a preponderance of the evidence she does hold legal right,title or interest superior to ronald in a portion of the improved property.we vacate the forfeiture order in part and remand for further proceedings.
this appeal arises from an ancillary proceeding to the conviction of ronald totaro for counts of mail fraud,wire fraud,money laundering,unlawful money transactions and rico racketeering.see united states totaro.cir affirming the conviction.ronald was sentenced to thirty years in prison and fined million for operating an advance fee scheme in which he conned investors out of millions of dollars between and.id.at.along with the verdict,the jury returned a special verdict form indicating it found,beyond a reasonable doubt,the totaros country estate was acquired or maintained with the proceeds of ronald illegal activities.
following the verdict and pursuant to the rico forfeiture statute,l,the district court entered a preliminary order of forfeiture and the government caused a notice of forfeiture to be published.adrienne totaro,wife of ronald,and her father edmund kotkeiwicz both filed notices of claim of legal right,title or interest in the property pursuant to l and.the district judge referred this ancillary proceeding to a magistrate judge who held a hearing pursuant to l and produced a report recommending the district court deny the claims of adrienne and kotkeiwicz.the district court adopted it without further elaboration.adrienne filed this appeal.kotkeiwicz does not appeal from the district court decision.ronald,of course,is not a party to this proceeding.his rights to the property have been deemed forfeited.
the history of the property is as follows.ronald and adrienne married in and ronald bought land at east quaker road,east aurora,ny,in.in april,ronald signed a quit claim deed conveying the land to himself and adrienne.in april and november,the totaros took out mortgages for and,respectively,and used the proceeds to build a house on the land.they moved into their new home in september.
ronald filed for bankruptcy in.in,adrienne acquired full legal title to the property by paying to become the assignee of a creditor holding a mechanic lien on ronald undivided in the property.from that point on adrienne has been the sole title owner of the parcel at east quaker road.in june,adrienne obtained another mortgage for,which was consolidated with what remained of the two mortgages taken out in,for a new mortgage of.in,adrienne bought a small plot of land next door at east quaker road to square off the parcel,making the total size of the estate acres.the purchase price and adrienne source of funding are unclear in the record below,but she says she bought it with part of a loan from her father.this loan was the basis for kotkeiwicz claim to the property.
the first act forming part of ronald rico crime took place in.from that date forward ronald funneled some of the proceeds from his rico crimes into adrienne checking account,from which she paid the mortgage payments.between and the totaros added a tennis court,pool,guest house sometimes referred to as a pool house,landscaping and new kitchen at a total cost of.ronald arranged and dealt with the contractors but all payments for these improvements came from adrienne checkbook.between december and january,of the funds passing through adrienne checkbook a total of were proceeds from ronald rico crimes.ronald often represented himself as owner of the property and he used it as collateral for several loans.a title search revealed several tax liens,judgments and encumbrances against ronald for the estate between and.three tax liens against adrienne were also listed.
the magistrate judge found adrienne income during the relevant period to have been as follows.between and adrienne earned between and a year as a substitute teacher.in,she did not work outside the home,but that is the year her father loaned her.in,adrienne earned working for a toy company.in and,adrienne says,she returned to being a substitute teacher and worked as a consultant for her husband for some period of time she can not remember what she earned those years.from to,she earned less than per year as a substitute teacher.these figures are adrienne own estimates,and not certain amounts,because adrienne and ronald did not file taxes after the.adrienne reported wages averaged per year from to.
in reviewing the denial of a claim pursuant to l in a rico forfeiture proceeding,we review the district court findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard and its interpretation and application of the federal forfeiture laws de novo.united states,cir united states simmons,cir applying de novo review to interpretation of a and clear error to the district court finding of facts.
defendants who violate the rico act must forfeit any property constituting,or derived from,any proceeds which the person obtained,directly or indirectly,from racketeering activity a.rico forfeiture is an in personam sanction against the individual,not an in rem action so forfeiture reaches only the criminal defendant interest in the property.see united states alexander,cir quoting united states sarbello,cir united states angiulo,cir united states ginsburg,cir.
the government interest in the property vests at the time of the unlawful activity.c all right,title,and interest in property vests in the united states upon the commission of the act giving rise to forfeiture under this section.ginsburg,at in short,while the government interest in the profits or proceeds of racketeering activity does not attach until conviction,its interest vests at the time of the act that constitutes the rico violation emphasis in original.with the verdict of forfeiture in the criminal proceeding,the government succeeds the defendant entire interest in the property.united states anderson,cir.third parties who wish to assert a right,title or interest in the forfeited property can not intervene in the criminal case or file their own separate action against the united states.i.instead,third parties must assert their claims in the forfeited property in the civil proceeding ancillary to the criminal trial.l.
section l provides the mechanism by which third parties,also referred to as petitioners,may assert claims to property subject to rico forfeiture.l united states gilbert,cir.it permits petitioners to challenge an order of forfeiture by showing they had a vested or superior legal right,title or interest in the property at the time the criminal acts took place,or they were bona fide purchasers for value.l a,b.adrienne asserts only the first of vested or superior right,title or interest.the governing rule reads 
if,after the hearing,the court determines that the petitioner has established by a preponderance of the evidence that 
a the petitioner has a legal right,title,or interest in the property,and such right,title,or interest renders the order of forfeiture invalid in whole or in part because the right,title,or interest was vested in the petitioner rather than the defendant or was superior to any right,title,or interest of the defendant at the time of the commission of the acts which gave rise to the forfeiture of the property under this section or 
the court shall amend the order of forfeiture in accordance with its determination.
l.the court alone is responsible for deciding this question.l.
no prior panel of the eighth circuit has had occasion to apply l.in addition to decisions of other courts that have considered l,two other sources guide our analysis.first,l is identical to the drug crimes forfeiture statute,n,so case law implementing n is persuasive in our task of applying l.gilbert,at cases applying one of these analogous statutes have used section n and section l cases interchangeably.united states lavin,cir noting n was enacted with language identical to l and concluding l is a useful guide in the application of n.second,we look to state law to evaluate a claim to a legal right,title or interest in the subject property,so long as doing so does not frustrate a federal interest.see united states,cir applying tennessee law to gauge a petitioner interest in a farm subject to a preliminary order of forfeiture pursuant to a united states,cir applying wisconsin property law in a a forfeiture proceeding.the totaros country estate is situated in new york state,therefore,we will refer to the law of new york.
much of ronald rico proceeds were funneled into adrienne checking account,from which the mortgage,real estate taxes,and costs of improvements were paid.adrienne earnings were too small to have been the sole or even the primary source of money to pay these costs.the magistrate judge concluded from these facts that adrienne was but a straw owner and therefore did not hold a legal right,title or interest vested in her rather than in ronald.in so deciding,the magistrate judge interpreted l a as requiring more than the bare legal title held by adrienne.in addressing the second clause of l a the magistrate judge found that any right,title or interest in the property held by adrienne was not superior to ronald.
before the district court adrienne asserted a claim to the entire country parcels of land,the house and all the improvements.on appeal,adrienne now concedes that the major improvements made to the country estate in the the remodeled kitchen,the pool,tennis court and guest subject to forfeiture.she has made this concession because she does not dispute the magistrate judge conclusion the improvements were paid for with rico proceeds,albeit with checks from adrienne checking account.therefore,the question before this court is whether the district court erred in denying her notice of claim only with respect to the land and unimproved house.
we begin with adrienne assertion of the innocent owner defense.she asserts the entire property minus the improvements she concedes are forfeited should not be forfeited on the ground she is an innocent owner.she is completely innocent of rico crimes,however,there is no statutory basis upon which to base an innocent owner defense.unlike the civil forfeiture statute,there is no explicit or implied innocent owner defense in.such a clause would be superfluous.by its terms,rico forfeiture is an in personam action,so it reaches only the property of the criminal defendant.because the statute provides for forfeiture of only the rico defendant property,there are no circumstances in which the property of an innocent owner is lawfully forfeited pursuant to.in effect,assertion of this defense begs the question decided below,namely,what was adrienne legal interest in the country estate 
turning to her statutory claims,the district court was required by l to amend the forfeiture order if adrienne proved by a preponderance of the evidence she either had a legal right,title or interest vested in her rather than in ronald from to the period of the rico acts or had a legal right,title or interest superior to ronald during that time.adrienne argues she prevails under either clause of l a.
we begin with analysis of the first clause.it is undisputed adrienne has held title under the laws of new york to the first parcel of land since and to the second since.title was vested in her rather than in ronald before his rico violations began in.if bare title suffices under l to save the property from forfeiture,adrienne prevails.the government urges this court to hold adrienne is a straw or nominal owner and therefore not a beneficiary of this clause.other courts have recognized straw or nominal owners may not defeat forfeiture.see,united states ida,d,finding petitioner was straw owner without legal right,title or interest to defeat forfeiture.
this case does not,however,present the hallmarks of straw or nominal ownership lack of possession of the property and no exercise of dominion or control over it.see united states v.one chevrolet corvette,vin,with all appurtenances and attachments thereon,cir holding claimant with legal title to a car was a nominal owner and was therefore not entitled to prevent forfeiture united states v.one douglas aircraft,serial,cir holding title owner of an aircraft may not have standing to challenge the forfeiture if the criminal defendant exercised dominion or control over it by,amongst other things,using it as collateral for a loan united states v.one porsche coupe,vehicle identification number,finding forfeited car owner of record was nominal owner who could not challenge forfeiture because he gave the car to his son,the criminal defendant,who exercised sole possession and exercised dominion and control over it.adrienne lived on the property and exercised dominion and control over not exclusive dominion and control,but sufficient dominion and control nonetheless.she lived there and raised the totaros children on the property.she was personally invested in the ownership of the property.she bought ronald half of the first parcel from his creditor for sum within adrienne sole purchase power with her salary as a substitute teacher.the government casts aspersions on this transaction but points to no new york law upon which we could rule it invalid.she bought the second parcel from a neighbor some six years before ronald rico activity started so there is no reason to believe this purchase was accomplished with tainted funds.in addition to her personal financial investment in the property,she encumbered the property with three tax liens.under these facts we are reluctant to declare adrienne a mere straw or nominal owner.
we find adrienne bare title insufficient to prevent forfeiture under the first clause of l a for a different reason.when ronald began his rico violations in,the estate was encumbered with a considerable mortgage.it was the proceeds from ronald rico violations,filtered through adrienne checking account,which paid the mortgage,real estate taxes and upkeep on the property.the magistrate judge found,on a sound factual basis,that adrienne income alone was far from sufficient to pay all or a substantial portion of the mortgage,real estate taxes and upkeep.but for the rico proceeds,therefore,adrienne would not hold title to the country estate.it would do a severe disservice to the intent and purpose of the rico forfeiture statute if a criminal were able to protect and enjoy rico proceeds by investing them in property titled to a spouse.see united states martinez,cir a defendant interest in the proceeds of rico activities extends to property traceable to the proceeds of racketeering activity.we will therefore not allow adrienne to benefit from the blanket protection of title ownership.we hold adrienne bare title is insufficient to prevent forfeiture of the estate under the first clause of l a.
we now turn to the second clause,under which adrienne may prevail if she can show a legal right,title or interest in the property superior to ronald right,title or interest.l a.the government urges this court to conclude adrienne held no right,title or interest in the property superior to ronald on the ground the jury in ronald criminal case found,beyond a reasonable doubt,the estate was acquired or maintained with the proceeds from ronald crimes.the jury decision determines the fate of only ronald interest in the property.its verdict makes ronald entire interest in the property forfeited to the government,but it does not decide the question of what,if anything,adrienne or any other third parties own.that question was not put to the jury.instead,we look to state law to sort out the respective ownership interests,and save from forfeiture the portion of the estate adrienne can prove is hers,at.
the magistrate judge found the entire estate was forfeitable,a finding supportable only if adrienne held no legal right,title or interest in the property superior to ronald.we conclude that finding was in error,however,because adrienne has proven by a prep
