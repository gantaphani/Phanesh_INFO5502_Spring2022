this case requires us to assess the constitutionality of restrictions imposed by the city of newport,rhode island city,on the performance of music at asterix and obelix a o,a newport.the district court rejected a first amendment challenge to the restrictions mounted by a o and laurel casey,a cabaret singer who performs at a o,and entered summary judgment for the city on the ground that the restrictions were narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest.concluding that the district court decision lacks support in the record,we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.
a o is located at thames street in newport.the property is zoned limited business and abuts a residential neighborhood.in june of a o was granted an entertainment license permitting musical performances,pursuant to newport,ordinances ch.public entertainment.the word none was typed next to the word amplification on the approved application.on june,casey performed at a o with her voice amplified,accompanied by an amplified bass and an unamplified piano.that evening a o was cited for violating the city noise ordinance.newport,ordinances ch.noise abatement setting maximum decibel level of for districts zoned limited business.casey explained the events which gave rise to the violation of the noise ordinance at a city council hearing on june 
now,to tell you the truth,it was my fault last friday that we went over the noise ordinance.a person in the audience requested that i sing from an operetta and i began to sing a portion of rinaldo.there are several high notes that go above high note c in r i naldo and it was those high notes apparently that shot us off the scale.
the complaint against a o was subsequently dismissed.as far as the record reveals,a o was not cited for violating the terms of its entertainment license.
on june,the city council held a hearing on a o application for a renewed license that would permit amplification.residents of the neighborhood voiced displeasure with the noise emanating from a o during musical performances.the council voted to renew a o entertainment license,but with the restriction still in place,and with an added prohibition against singing whether amplified or not.
on june,casey filed a complaint against the city in federal district court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and damages under on the ground that the and restrictions violated her right to free expression under the first amendment.on june,the council removed the restriction,which it had imposed in the mistaken belief that a o previous license had included the same restriction the restriction,however,remained in force.the council also required that a o keep its doors and windows closed during musical performances a first amended complaint was filed on july,adding a o as a plaintiff.
on may,the council again renewed a o entertainment license,this time with amplification of singing allowed,but amplification of musical instruments forbidden.a second amended complaint filed on july,added a count challenging the ban on amplification of instruments effective as of june.after the parties filed for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment for the city on october,holding that the challenged restrictions were valid time,place,and manner regulations that did not infringe upon the plaintiffs first amendment rights.plaintiffs filed this timely appeal in which they ask us to vacate the judgment of the district court and order the entry of a judgment declaring that the city license restrictions are unconstitutional,enjoining their enforcement,and leaving the question of damages for the district court on remand.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment for the city de novo,examining the record in the light most favorable to casey and a o and drawing all reasonable inferences in their favor.we affirm the district court decision only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the city is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see knights of columbus,council town of lexington,cir.here we focus on the legal question of whether the challenged restrictions violate the first amendment.see id.
music,as a form of expression and communication,is protected under the first amendment.ward rock against racism,d.expression need not include words to qualify for first amendment protection.the supreme court has said that a narrow,succinctly articulable message is not a condition of constitutional protection,which if confined to expressions conveying a particularized message,would never reach the unquestionably shielded painting of jackson pollock,music of arnold schoenberg,or jabberwocky verse of lewis carroll.hurley gay,lesbian and bisexual group of boston,d citation omitted.thus it is not just casey verbal expression,but also the musical sound she and her band produce,that is protected under the first amendment.
nevertheless,the government may impose reasonable restrictions on the time,place,or manner of protected speech,if those restrictions are content neutral narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest and leave open ample alternative channels of communication.ward,at.we have described our review under this standard as intermediate scrutiny.amusements,town of dedham,cir.intermediate scrutiny is more demanding than the rational basis standard that is often used to gauge the constitutionality of economic regulations,but less rigorous than strict scrutiny,where we inquire whether a regulation is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.id.quoting arkansas writers project ragland,d.if a regulation of speech is not narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest,it can not be deemed constitutional.see turner broad,fcc,d vacating district court decision that regulation of speech was constitutional because facts in the record failed to establish that requirement was met.the burden of proof is on the city to demonstrate that its restrictions on speech are narrowly tailored.see board of trustees fox,d s ince the state bears the burden of justifying its restrictions,it must affirmatively establish the reasonable fit we require.citation omitted.
the district court held that the challenged restrictions were permissible under the ward test.although chronologically the first restriction imposed on performers at a o was the ban on singing,we think it makes more sense to begin our legal analysis with the and restrictions.we deal with the restriction last 
no amplification 
content neutrality 
the supreme court has said that t he principal inquiry in determining content neutrality is whether the government has adopted a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys.the government purpose is the controlling consideration.ward,at.citation omitted.thus a regulation that has a disparate effect on different styles of music may nevertheless be considered content neutral if the intent behind the regulation is unrelated to content.the district court found that t he city clear objective in imposing the restriction was to reduce noise,a purpose unrelated to the content of the message appellants sought to convey.there being no suggestion in the record that the restriction was motivated by the content of casey performances,the restriction qualifies as content neutral.
narrow tailoring 
on the question of narrow tailoring,the district court found that the restriction in force between june of and june of banning amplification of both singing and instruments serves defendants articulated interest in noise reduction,and that without the restriction,the city would be unable to control effectively the volume of music,amplified or unamplified,emanating from a o.the court then declared that the restriction does not burden more speech than necessary,and that plaintiffs could still convey their respective messages,but without the aid of an amplifier.in sum,the district court found that the city could not have achieved the desired reduction in noise without imposing the restriction,and that the restriction did not burden substantially more speech than was necessary to achieve the city objective.
in analyzing the district court conclusions regarding narrow tailoring,we are guided by the supreme court opinion in ward and our opinion in globe newspaper beacon hill architectural commission,cir.accordingly,we begin with a review of those opinions.
in ward,the plaintiffs had challenged new york city requirement that performers on a city concert stage in central park use amplification equipment and a sound technician supplied by the city.at.the court of appeals had invalidated the requirement,holding that the city guideline was not narrowly tailored to further the city interest in limiting the sound emanating from the city stage because it has not been shown that the requirement of the use of the city sound system and technician was the least intrusive means of regulating the volume.id.at.quoting rock against racism ward,cir emphasis in original.the supreme court emphatically rejected this least intrusive means test our cases quite clearly hold that restrictions on the time,place,or manner of protected speech are not invalid simply because there is some imaginable alternative that might be less burdensome on speech.at.quoting united states albertini,d.
the court then went on to reaffirm the applicable standard,stating first that the requirement of narrow tailoring is satisfied so long as the regulation promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.ward,at.internal quotation marks omitted.as the dissent notes,we have cited this statement in some of our own first amendment cases.see knights of columbus town of lexington,cir amusements,at.however,as we recognized in globe newspaper,at,see infra,this statement can not be separated from the supreme court own qualification of the meaning of this statement,set forth in ward 
to be sure,this standard does not mean that a time,place,or manner regulation may burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government legitimate interests.government may not regulate expression in such a manner that a substantial portion of the burden on speech does not serve to advance its goals.so long as the means chosen are not substantially broader than necessary to achieve the government interest,however,the regulation will not be invalid simply because a court concludes that the government interest could be adequately served by some alternative.
ward,at.emphasis added citations omitted 
to demonstrate the importance of this qualification the court went on in ward to explain why the city sound amplification guideline was not substantially broader than necessary to achieve the government interest.it noted that i f the city regulatory scheme had a substantial deleterious effect on the ability of bandshell performers to achieve the quality of sound they desired,plaintiff concerns would have considerable force.id.at.it emphasized that the district court had found that the city sound technician give s the sponsor autonomy with respect to the sound mix and does all that he can to accommodate the sponsor desires in those regards.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,the court found no evidence that the city technician was unable to implement properly the performers instructions regarding sound quality or mixing.in light of those findings,the court concluded that the city guideline requiring that performers use the city amplification equipment and sound technician has no material impact on any performer ability to exercise complete artistic control over sound quality.id.thus,the court held that the guideline satisfied the requirement of narrow tailoring because it was not substantially broader than necessary to achieve the city legitimate ends.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
globe newspaper 
in globe newspaper,we acknowledged that ward not substantially broader than necessary requirement is part of the test for narrow tailoring.a beacon hill architectural commission regulation banned street furniture,including newspaper boxes,in boston historic beacon hill neighborhood.the district court had held that the regulation violated the first amendment because the commission had shown no reason why its interest in preserving the architectural and historic character of the neighborhood can not be met by,for example,subjecting newsracks and other street furniture to the same review process as merchandise racks.globe newspaper,at internal quotation marks omitted.
we reversed on the ground that the regulation promoted a substantial government interest in aesthetics that would have been achieved less effectively absent the regulation,and that it did so without burdening substantially more speech than necessary.id.at.we explained that 
w hile the district court correctly considered the fact that alternatives exist,it gave too much weight to that fact alone.in so doing,it essentially discount ed from the equation ward inquiry into whether the regulation promotes the commission interests such that they would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.
id.at internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.importantly,however,we declared that alternatives must be considered in connection with the inquiry into whether,absent the challenged regulation,the government interests are achieved less effectively,and cautioned that courts are not merely to defer to the government subjective judgment.id.at emphasis added.
we observed in globe newspaper that while the commission could have adopted a less drastic solution,it had carefully calculated the costs and benefits associated with potential solutions to the problem of street furniture.id.we concluded that t he path the commission chose to the newsracks altogether was the most effective solution aimed at reducing visual clutter and preserving the neighborhood historic character.id.in other words,while not engaging in a means analysis,we emphasized that the commission had weighed the alternatives before it,and we pointed out that an obvious alternative to the ban on street that newsracks be designed to blend in to the have been less effective in achieving the commission objective than an outright ban.id.at.for our purposes,the essential point is that we emphasized in globe newspaper that the test requires the district court to consider whether the regulation challenged on first amendment grounds sweeps more broadly than necessary to promote the government interest.that consideration,in turn,can not be done without some evaluation of the alternative measures put in issue by the parties.
c.the district court rationale 
as explained supra,the district court found the ban on amplification narrowly tailored because the restriction serves the city interest in noise reduction this objective could not be achieved without the restriction the restriction does not burden more speech than necessary and casey could still convey her message,but without the aid of an amplifier.although we conclude that the record supports the district court first the restriction advanced the city interest in noise does not support the other three.thus,the district court overlooked ward requirement that the means chosen can not be substantially broader than necessary to achieve the government interest.at.
i.the restriction serves the city interest in noise reduction 
we agree with the district court that the ban on amplification serves the city interest in noise reduction,as it limits the volume of noise performers can generate to the capacity of their unamplified voices and instruments.the restriction was implemented to protect residential neighbors of a o,and the supreme court has recognized that the government has a substantial interest in protecting its citizens from unwelcome noise,an interest that is perhaps at its greatest when government seeks to protect the,tranquility,and privacy of the home.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.nevertheless,as we have explained,the mere fact that the ban on amplification serves the city interest in noise reduction is not enough to satisfy the requirement.
ii.the city objective could not be achieved without the restriction 
the district court stated that without the restriction,the city would be unable to control effectively the volume of music emanating from a o.this statement implies that alternatives to the ban on amplification do not exist.but the record does not support the district court assertion.casey and a o suggest that the city objective could be achieved by enforcement of the city noise ordinance.see newport,ordinances ch.noise abatement setting maximum decibel level of for districts zoned limited business.this may or may not be so.however,as a matter of logic,reliance on the noise ordinance would be less restrictive than a total ban on amplification because it would permit the use of amplifiers at levels that did not exceed the decibel limit set in the noise ordinance.yet the city did not explain why it could not have relied on this alternative to the restriction.see globe newspaper,at.
iii.the restriction does not burden more speech than necessary 
there is no support in the record for the district court conclusion that the restriction does not burden more speech than necessary to achieve the city interest in preventing excessive noise.see ward,at.upholding regulation that was not substantially broader than necessary.neither in the district court opinion nor in the record is there any explanation of why the alternative advanced by the of the city noise not have achieved the city interests as effectively as the amplification ban,while substantially diminishing the burden on speech.this approach is in sharp contrast to ward,where the court cited specific alternatives the city had rejected and its reasons for doing so.
in ward,the court explained that new york had rejected the idea of a fixed decibel limit for all performers using the bandshell because the impact on listeners of a single decibel level is not constant,but varies in response to changes in air temperature,foliage,audience size,and like factors.id.at.the city had also rejected the idea of using its own technician to operate equipment supplied by the performer,because the city technician might have had difficulty satisfying the needs of performers while operating unfamiliar,and perhaps inadequate,sound equipment.see also globe newspaper,at designing the newsracks to better blend in would promote the commission interest by reducing their unsightliness.it would not achieve,however,as effective a reduction in the visual clutter.by contrast,the district court opinion gives no indication as to why the city of newport could not have relied on the noise ordinance to achieve its objective.
we do not see how the substantially broader than necessary determination could be made in this case absent some consideration of the alternative of enforcing the noise ordinance.far from being a hypothetical possibility conjured up by appellants,the noise ordinance is on the books,is unmistakably designed to address the problem of excessive noise,and has been enforced against a o in the past.there is no indication in the record that such enforcement is not effective in achieving the city objective 
we emphasize,however,that the city need not prove that the restriction is the least restrictive means of achieving its objective of controlling excessive noise.any such requirement is clearly proscribed by the precedents.ward,at.however,if enforcing the noise ordinance would effectively achieve the city objective,and the burden on speech imposed by the restriction is substantially broader than the burden that would be imposed by enforcing the noise ordinance,the restriction may not meet the narrow tailoring test.
inescapably,the application of the narrow tailoring test entails a delicate balancing judgment by the court.see blount sec,regulations of speech must,by virtue of the narrow tailoring requirement,strike an appropriate balance between achieving the government goals and protecting constitutional rights henderson lujan,despite the seemingly mathematical character of the metaphor,the supreme court in fact applies the requirement as a balancing test.first amendment plaintiffs often argue that a regulation sweeps too broadly and that less burdensome alternatives are available to accomplish the government objective.the government responds that the proposed alternatives would be less effective in achieving its objective.the trial court is then required to balance the competing interests under the standard,mindful that the government is not required to choose the least intrusive means of advancing its interests.here,however,the court did not engage in any balancing analysis,deferring instead to the unsupported assertion of the city that the restriction in a o license was the only effective means of addressing the noise problem.
the city calls to our attention metropolitan transportation authority,cir,which held that a ban on the use of amplifiers on new york city subway platforms was narrowly tailored to the city interests in elimination of excessive noise and public safety the concern was that amplified music interfered with police communications,the public address system and the work of track crews.id.at.the district court had enjoined enforcement of the ban,finding that the goal of noise reduction could be achieved by enforcing the decibel limit applicable to musical performances on subway platforms.id.the second circuit held that the district court had improperly relied on the perceived availability of a alternative to the amplifier use of decibel meters.id.at.it explained that the proposed alternative would be impractical the noise regulation requires that decibel measurements be taken at a distance of five feet from the music source.the difficulties in making such measurements on a crowded subway platform with riders rushing on and off trains are apparent id.at.
although a crowded subway platform in new york city seems far removed from a residential neighborhood in newport,rhode island,there might be practical problems or administrative burdens that complicate the enforcement of a noise ordinance in this quieter setting.such considerations are certainly relevant in evaluating whether a proposed alternative would effectively achieve the city objective.see id.however,this record is silent on any practical problems or administrative burdens that would render enforcement of the noise ordinance an ineffective alternative to the restriction 
nevertheless,the dissent states that the record establishes that the noise ordinance clearly failed to address the community concerns and,as such,can not be considered an effective alternative.respectfully,that is not so.the scattered references to the noise ordinance at the city council meeting on june,where the license restrictions were adopted do not amount to evidence that enforcement of the noise ordinance was considered and rejected as ineffective.here is the sum and substance of these references 
councilor sardella,questioning the requirement that an applicant list the specific types of instruments that performers would be permitted to play,said entertainment is entertainment and as long as someone does violate the noise ordinance i do believe we should be restricting them to whether they have a flute player,a guitar player,or a vocalist.
casey explained that it was my fault last friday that we went over the noise ordinance 
doug stevenson a neighbor said i do even think it an issue of violation of any noise ordinance,it just the fact that we did have this noise before and now we do and we have to deal with it and we do like it.
tarigo unidentified said last week so we could adhere to that city ordinance of the decibels of the language that precedes these words is illegible.
as we have explained,at the district court the burden was on the city to show that the restriction did not burden substantially more speech than necessary to achieve the city objective.see fox,at.the city did not meet this burden simply by submitting evidence that the noise ordinance was mentioned at the meeting at which the restriction was adopted.indeed,the city itself has not in its motion for summary judgment or on the council considered the alternative of enforcing the noise ordinance and concluded that it would be ineffective.nor has the city supplemented the record of the council meeting with evidence supporting its view that the restriction is narrowly tailored,as it was free to do at the district court.
the dissent is correct that residential neighbors were unhappy about the noise emanating from a however,it is mere speculation to say that enforcing the noise ordinance was an ineffective alternative to the restriction when there is no indication in the record that the city had made any attempt to enforce it beyond the one incident documented in the record.
iv.casey could still convey her message without amplification 
as its final basis for concluding that the ban on amplification was narrowly tailored,the district court stated that appellants could still convey their respective messages,but without the aid of an amplifier.appellants respond,with the support of uncontradicted affidavits,that amplifiers are not used simply to take a message and make it louder while holding constant its content.to be sure,amplification may be necessary to convey a message,and appellants advance the argument that amplification is required for casey voice to be heard over the chatter of a o patrons.however,as appellants point out,amplifiers are also used to create new messages that can not be conveyed without amplification equipment.amplification enables performers to boost the relative volume of quiet instruments,such as the bass and the lower registers of the human voice,and to adjust the tonal qualities of voices and instruments without necessarily increasing the overall volume of the performance much modern music simply can not be performed without the use of amplifiers.thus the ban on amplification has a direct and immediate effect on the expression at issue.the record therefore does not support the district court conclusion that appellants could still convey their messages without amplification.without amplification,some of the messages are not conveyed at all.
the supreme court observed in ward that i f the city regulatory scheme had a substantial deleterious effect on the ability of bandshell performers to achieve the quality of sound they desired,plaintiff concerns would have considerable force.at.the court emphasized that there was no evidence in the record that the quality of performances had been impaired by the city regulatory scheme.on the contrary,it declared that the city guideline has no material impact on any performer ability to exercise complete artistic control over sound quality.id.at.here,in contrast,there is evidence of a deleterious effect on the quality of sound casey has been able to produce.indeed,the regulation precluded outright the performance of certain songs that require her to sing quietly in a low register with amplification.
in sum,we conclude that the district court erred in its application of the ward test for narrow tailoring to the facts of this case.the record does not support the district court conclusion that the city means were not substantially broader than necessary to achieve the government interest.
alternative channels 
although the failure of the record to support the district court conclusion that the restriction is narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest requires that we vacate the judgment below,we nevertheless note that the ban on amplification at a o does leave open ample alternative channels of communication,and thus satisfies the third prong of the ward test.at.internal quotation marks omitted.appellants assert unpersuasively that t here is no alternative for laurel casey to find a means to convey her artistic message to an audience of over people on a saturday night in a restaurant in newport without having the benefit of an amplifier.however,the restrictions imposed on performers at a o do not prevent casey from performing at other establishments in newport unencumbered by the same restrictions.
no amplification of instruments 
the district court held that appellants lacked standing to challenge the restriction on amplification of instruments but not singing that has been in force since.in the district court view,which the city reflects in its brief,casey and a o are endeavoring to challenge the restriction on behalf of other musicians.we disagree with this characterization of appellants claims,and hold that both casey and a o have standing to assert violations of their own first amendment rights.
the basic requirements for article iii standing are that the petitioner is someone who has suffered or is threatened by injury in fact to a cognizable interest,that the injury is causally connected to the defendant action,and that it can be abated by a remedy the court is competent to give.save our heritage,faa,cir.as a singer who performs with a band,casey expression encompasses more than just her voice.it is the music she produces in conjunction with her band that constitutes her expression.if the quality of casey performance has been affected by the ban on the amplification of her accompanists,she has suffered an injury in fact to a cognizable interest her interest in performing her music as she wishes to perform it the injury is causally connected to the restriction the city placed on a o entertainment license and the district court has the power to remedy the injury by enjoining enforcement of the restriction on amplification of instruments.casey therefore has standing to challenge the restriction on the amplification of instruments.see id.
a o also has standing to challenge the restriction on the amplification of instruments.if,as appellants allege,the restriction has impaired the quality of casey performances,a o has suffered an injury in fact to a cognizable interest a reduction in the quality of the entertainment it offers its customers the injury is causally connected to the restriction on its entertainment license and the district court has the power to remedy the situation by declaring the restriction unconstitutional.see id.
despite concluding that appellants lacked standing to challenge the ban on amplification of instruments,the district court went on to declare that even if appellants did have standing,its analysis of the total ban on amplification applied equally to the ban on amplification of instruments.we have held that the district court erred in finding that the total ban on amplification was narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest.we conclude likewise with respect to the ban on amplification of instruments.in restating its conclusion about the total ban on amplification,without additional analysis,the district court repeated its error of neglecting to consider the viability of the alternative of enforcing the city noise ordinance.we therefore remand to the district court for consideration of appellants challenge to the restriction under the framework described in this opinion 
no singing 
the district court found that the restriction in force for two weeks in june of was a valid regulation of speech.casey and a o argue that the restriction was facially invalid,as it had the effect of utterly suppressing casey right to perform.they also assert that there is no rational basis for discriminating between one form of instrument,the human voice,and other instruments such as pianos and guitars.
frankly,we can make little sense of appellants facial invalidity argument,at least as they express it.they seem to argue that a ban on singing could never be permissible under any circumstances.stated so sweepingly,that is an untenable proposition.appellants also make an equally unavailing argument that the requirement is not content neutral,hoping to invoke strict scrutiny see arkansas writers project,at.requiring state to show that regulation of speech is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and narrowly drawn to achieve that end citation omitted.however,appellants do seem to argue,barely,that the restriction suffers from the same infirmities that afflict the restrictions on amplification.based on our analysis supra,we conclude that the record does not support the district court holding that the restriction is narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest.thus the restriction too must be addressed by the district court on remand.
to meet the narrow tailoring requirement set out in ward,the city was required to establish that the challenged restrictions do not burden substantially more speech than necessary to achieve its interest in noise reduction.the city has failed to carry its burden on this point.the record is devoid of any explanation of why the alternative of enforcing the city noise alternative that is on the books,is designed to address the problem of excessive noise,and has been enforced against a o in the not have achieved the city objective as effectively as the amplification ban,while placing a substantially lesser burden on speech.absent some evidence of this in the record,the district court had no basis for deciding whether the challenged restrictions are,or are not,substantially broader than necessary to achieve the city objective.
we conclude,therefore,that the district court erred in its application of the test for narrow tailoring established in ward and applied in globe newspaper,and hence the judgment entered for the city must be vacated.however,there is no basis in law for ordering the entry of judgment for appellants.the proper analysis remains to be done and,depending on the outcome of that analysis,damages issues must be resolved.we therefore remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
judgement vacated.remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
i agree with and concur in judge lipez reasoning and the record requires further development and additional analysis remains to be done.however,i am less confident than judge lipez that the city of newport amplification ban is content neutral.the record discloses that the city sole intent in imposing the license restrictions at issue here was to limit the volume of sound emanating from asterix obelix,in an effort to accommodate its residential neighbors.but,by banning all amplified music,the city effectively,albeit unwittingly,banned a whole host of musical instruments and,necessarily,the unique musical messages that can only be produced by those instruments.and,ironically,the ban will not necessarily insure an acceptable level of noise could,for example,sing to the accompaniment of snare drums,but not amplified flutes.
in the world of modern music,amplified is not synonymous with made louder.electronic musical instruments can only produce sound through a process of electronic amplification,but those instruments are not inherently louder than acoustic or unamplified instruments.a modern synthesizer,for example,can make sound only by means of electronic amplification,yet that amplified instrument easily and faithfully mimics the sounds produced by a wide range of acoustic instruments such as pianos,harps,flutes,acoustic guitars,violins,drums.moreover,the synthesizer can reproduce those musical sounds as softly and quietly as desired.yet,the synthesizer falls within the city ban.an electronically amplified aeolian harp can produce the same soft floating witchery of sound as nature own,but the volume is more easily controlled on the amplified version.
so,while the city did not impose the amplification ban because of any overt disagreement with the messages conveyed by amplified musical instruments,thus,arguably,making the ban content neutral,i believe the ban is sufficiently to give rise to what the supreme court referred to in ward rock against racism,d,as an argument of much force,that the city has impermissibly interfered with the artistic judgment of performers at a o.in ward,the court noted that a ny governmental attempt to serve purely esthetic goals by imposing subjective standards of acceptable sound mix on performers would raise serious first amendment concerns id.at.here,the city regulation of expressive activity within a o may well not be content neutral because it appears to impose subjective standards of instrument selection on performers and may not be justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech,id.at.quoting clark community for creative,d,notwithstanding the absence of official disagreement with the artistic messages conveyed by amplified instruments.see police of chicago mosley,d holding that picketing ban imposed to prevent disruption of school was not content neutral when the ban allowed picketing on some topics but not others carey brown,d same.
the governmental regulation in ward was not intended to,and did not in fact,interfere with artistic expression.but here,the regulation singles out certain musical instruments and thus has a direct and immediate effect on the expression at issue,by suppressing it,and does so without any apparent justification,given the substantial disparity between the ban expansive reach and the interests the ban purports to serve.
with that the license restriction may not be content join in judge lipez opinion.
with due respect,i disagree with my colleagues regarding whether the licenses in question are narrowly tailored.while the majority correctly recounts the holdings of both ward rock against racism,d,and globe newspaper,beacon hill architectural commission,cir,it overstates the burden for finding that a time,place,and manner restriction is narrowly tailored.in fact,despite pronouncements to the contrary,the majority essentially elevates the narrowly tailored requirement to something approaching a least restrictive means test by requiring that proposed alternatives always be considered.the majority also ignores crucial evidence in the record which supports the district court finding that the licensing requirement was narrowly tailored.my own review of the evidence and the relevant law leads me to the conclusion that the city has met its burden of showing that the licenses are narrowly tailored.
the majority understands globe newspaper as imposing a requirement on courts to consider less burdensome alternatives in deciding whether a challenged regulation is narrowly tailored.in fact,the court did say,as the majority points out,that alternatives must be considered.at.however,this statement can only be understood in context.in globe newspaper,the district court had found that a general ban on street furniture,including newspaper racks,in beacon hill was not narrowly tailored because less burdensome alternatives existed.at.in overturning that decision,the court pointed out that those alternative regimes had been considered and rejected as ineffective.id.at simply,the lower court rested its decision on the availability of alternative regulations and ignored ample evidence showing that those alternatives were ineffective.it was against this background that the court commented that alternatives must be evaluated to see whether they are as effective as the challenged scheme.
here,the situation is very different.appellants do not challenge the city enactment of a general licensing scheme regulating entertainment establishments rather,appellants complain about the city specific refusal to grant a o a more comprehensive entertainment license.as part of that challenge,appellants point to the city noise ordinance,positing that its enforcement would be a alternative to a license which covers only certain forms of entertainment.there is no evidence,or even a suggestion,that the city actually considered utilizing the noise ordinance instead of the licensing scheme when it came to a this is entirely predictable.the controversy over a o application arose at a city council meeting when the city considered the renewal of annual entertainment licenses for the coming year.it was not in the context of deciding what regulatory regime would best balance noise pollution reduction against allowing full artistic expression.to exempt a o from the normal licensing scheme,in favor of utilizing the noise ordinance,would have been a strange result,to say the least.
furthermore,existing law does not generally support the proposition that alternatives must be considered when deciding whether a regulation is narrowly tailored.in knights of columbus,council town of lexington,cir hereinafter knights of columbus,a
