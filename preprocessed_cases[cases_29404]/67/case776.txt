normal parm,harold eugene watts,roy michael gammill,william rogers,and robert allen balch plaintiffs,recreational fishermen,appeal the district court denial of their summary judgment motion and the grant of the for summary judgment by east carroll parish sheriff mark shumate sheriff shumate.plaintiffs brought their claims against sheriff shumate under,alleging that they were falsely arrested for trespass when they refused to cease fishing on waters covering ordinarily dry,private property the property owned by walker cottonwood farms,to walker lands,collectively walker.plaintiffs argue that sheriff shumate lacked probable cause to arrest them for fishing on the property because the public has a federal and state right to fish on the property when it is submerged under the mississippi river.because we disagree,we affirm the district court judgment.
factual and procedural background 
the underlying dispute in this case began over a decade ago,and the facts have been considered in various forms by multiple courts,including this one.plaintiffs are lifelong boaters,hunters,and fisherman who fish on the mississippi river in east carroll parish and other river parishes in northeast louisiana.the water levels of the mississippi river fluctuate seasonally.in east carroll parish,the normal low water mark is feet above mean sea level.yet during the spring season the river floods well beyond its normal a result of increased rainfall and snow melt in the the river regularly rises to as high as one hundred and twelve feet above mean sea level.it is normal for the river to remain at this level for at least two months.
the property is located in east carroll parish.on its eastern side,the property is bound by the mississippi river,and on its western side,it is bound by the mississippi river levees.buildings,crop lands and forests,with trees as tall as one hundred and forty feet,are located on the property.in addition,waterways known as gassoway lake,little gassoway lake,and other bodies of water are contained within its boundaries.gassoway lake,which plaintiffs consider the most ideal venue for fishing on the property,is located on the property western side,nearly miles from the ordinary low water mark of the mississippi river and its channel.gassoway lake is connected by a drainage ditch to bunch cutoff,which,in turn,flows into the mississippi river.when the river floods in the spring,gassoway lake,along with the rest of the property,is submerged under its waters.
plaintiffs have fished the waters of gassoway lake when it was flooded by the mississippi river,even though they knew that walker objected to their presence.in,walker began filing complaints with sheriff shumate against boaters fishing on gassoway lake.sheriff shumate responded by arresting plaintiffs,and others found on the property,for trespass while admitting that they did not have walker permission,plaintiffs claimed that they were entitled to fish on the property when it was flooded because gassoway lake was either owned by the state of louisiana on behalf of the public or subject to state and federal servitudes.
the attorney general for the state of louisiana agreed with plaintiffs position and issued louisiana attorney general opinion,concluding that channels of the mississippi river traversed the property and were river bed owned by the state.his opinion stated that lake gassoway is a naturally navigable body of water under both state and federal law and actually supports navigation for such purposes as hunting,fishing,and trapping he also determined that the property was subject to a public servitude.notwithstanding this opinion,sheriff shumate continued to arrest fishermen found on the property.however,the east carroll parish district attorney,james buddy caldwell,informed sheriff shumate that he did not intend to prosecute any of the plaintiffs for trespass until the ownership and public servitude issues were resolved.to this day,plaintiffs have not been prosecuted.
on june,walker filed suit in louisiana state court against the east carroll police jury,seeking a declaration that it owned the property and an injunction prohibiting members of the public from entering without permission.walker lands,louisiana,slip op.at,may.the state trial court issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the police jury,and all other persons or government agencies,from entering gassoway lake without permission for any purpose,including boating,fishing,or hunting.id.at.the police jury filed a demand against the state of louisiana.the state was added as an indispensable party,and the police jury was eventually dismissed.id.on march,the court granted walker motion for summary judgment and issued a permanent injunction.id.the state appealed to the second circuit court of appeal of louisiana,which reversed,holding that the issues could not be resolved on summary judgment.walker lands,east carroll parish police jury,slip op.at,wl,march.
on december,with the state trial court yet to issue a final decision,plaintiffs filed this case in federal district court.plaintiffs alleged that sheriff shumate lacked probable cause to arrest them in light of the opinion of the state attorney general and the decision of the second circuit court of appeal.they claimed that 
until there is rendered a final judgment in the litigation pending in the sixth district court between walker and the state of louisiana,there is not sufficient legal evidence to prove,beyond a reasonable doubt,that the use of the naturally and regularly navigable waters of the mississippi river,including those navigable waters that include gassoway lake,little gassoway,the old channel and bunch,results in a criminal trespass of the land of walker,so long as the plaintiffs utilize naturally occurring,navigable waters of the mississippi river.
plaintiffs sought damages for false arrest under and an injunction prohibiting further arrests for fishing on the property until a final judgment is rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction,specifying the ownership and navigational rights of the state of louisiana and walker relative to the property during normal water heights 
on june,plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment,and on july,sheriff shumate filed a for summary judgment or,in the alternative,a motion to stay the case pending resolution of the state court proceedings.both motions were referred to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation.because there was a reasonable probability that the state courts might find the waters at issue to be navigable and thus public,the magistrate judge held that a federal decision in this case could be obviated by the state proceeding.the district court adopted the report and recommendation,stayed the federal case,and plaintiffs appealed.in an unpublished decision,we agreed that the questions of louisiana law,then pending in a louisiana court,might render it unnecessary for federal courts to decide the constitutional issues presented in this case,and affirmed the district court stay.parm shumate.cir.

the state appealed the trial court decision to the second circuit court of appeal,which affirmed in part and reversed in part.walker lands,so d at.the appellate court accepted the trial court findings of fact and held that the property was privately owned.the court rejected the state argument that the property was the bed of the mississippi therefore owned by the a river bed consists only of the land lying below the river ordinary low water mark.id.at.it did not matter that the mississippi river sometimes flooded the property.id.at.
privately owned land does not become part of a navigable body of water when a nearby navigable body of water overflows its normal bed and temporarily covers the property.gassoway lake is landlocked and does not now lie in the bed of the mississippi river,which is some three and miles to the east likewise,it is not a channel of the river,since it is cut off from it.

nevertheless,the second circuit court of appeal lifted the state trial court injunction because walker lacked standing to seek relief against a hypothetical.id.at.the court stated that while o wners of private property may forbid entry to anyone for purposes of hunting or fishing and the like,walker could only ask for relief against a specific individual after that person had invaded the property.id.the court declined to resolve whether there was a public servitude on the property during the mississippi river peak stage.it observed that under louisiana law,the bank of the mississippi river consists of all the land lying between its ordinary low and high water marks,which includes all of the property,and noted that a public servitude preserves a river bank for the public navigational use.id.at.and while it stated that f ishing and hunting on flooded lands do not meet the definition of using the bank of a river at its high water mark for a navigational purpose,id.at citations omitted,it pretermit ted discussion of the issue because the state had not properly raised it,id.at.
on june,the second circuit court of appeal decision became final when the louisiana supreme court denied the state application for a writ of certiorari.in light of the conclusion of the state court proceedings,on august,the district court lifted the stay in this case.the court ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs in support of their for summary judgment and referred the matter to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation.sheriff shumate filed briefs arguing that the case was moot because plaintiffs merely sought relief until the second circuit rules there is no federal or state right to fish on private property above the mississippi river ordinary low mark and even if there was such a right,he was entitled to qualified immunity because it was not a clearly established constitutional right.plaintiffs,on the other hand,argued that they were entitled to summary judgment because there is both a state and federal right to fish on the property when it is submerged under the mississippi river.they asserted that the case was not moot because their complaint sought damages for false arrest and an injunction,not just until the state proceeding was complete,but until the public navigational rights were determined.finally,they contended that sheriff shumate was not entitled to qualified immunity because he was not being sued in his personal capacity.
on april,the magistrate judge issued his report and recommendation.he rejected sheriff shumate alternative arguments,stating that the case was not moot because the state appellate court expressly pretermitted ruling on the issue of navigational rights and sheriff shumate was not entitled to qualified immunity because the case was not brought against him in his personal capacity.turning to the fundamental question in the case,the magistrate judge held that no federal statute authorized plaintiffs to fish on the property,nor did the federal navigational servitude,which is derived from the commerce clause of the united states constitution,grant persons the right to fish on navigable waters.however,the magistrate judge determined that federal common law did create a right to fish on navigable waters,and that this public right burdens the property when it is submerged under the waters of the mississippi river.similarly,the magistrate judge held that louisiana law grants to the public the right to for purposes of running waters found in the state,regardless of the river stage.
on august,the district court adopted the report and recommendation in part.it agreed that neither federal statutes nor the federal navigational servitude provides plaintiffs with the right to fish on the property.the district court disagreed,however,with the magistrate judge determination that federal common law and state law granted such a right.the district court stated that while this court has recognized a public right to reasonably use navigable waters,we have not found a right to fish on private lands.moreover,although the district court found that the property is a bank of the mississippi river under louisiana law and subject to a state servitude,the servitude is limited to activities that are incidental to the navigable character of the mississippi river and its enjoyment as an avenue of commerce f ishing and hunting are not included in these rights.accordingly,the district court found that sheriff shumate had probable cause to arrest plaintiffs for trespass and entered summary judgment on sheriff shumate behalf.
this timely appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and drawing all reasonable inferences in that party favor.see crawford formosa plastics,cir.summary judgment is proper when the evidence reflects no genuine issues of material fact and the is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.citing.c.a genuine issue of material fact exists if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the party.id.quoting anderson liberty lobby,d.
in order to prevail in a claim for false arrest,a plaintiff must show that he was arrested without probable cause in violation of the fourth amendment.brown lyford,cir citations omitted.in a suit brought against a municipal official in his official capacity,the plaintiff must show that the municipality has a policy or custom that caused his injury.kentucky graham,d monell city of soc,d.if a municipal officer who has authority to establish final municipal policy makes a decision or orders a course of action,the municipality may be held liable for the officer decision or order.pembaur city of cincinnati,d see also turner upton county,texas,cir holding that the municipality may be held liable for the illegal or unconstitutional actions of its final as they engage in the setting of goals and the determination of how those goals will be achieved.
in this case,sheriff shumate does not argue that he lacked final authority.nor does he continue to argue that he is entitled to qualified immunity,accepting plaintiffs assertion that they do not seek to hold him liable in his individual capacity.the key issue,therefore,is whether plaintiffs have either a federal or state right to fish on the property in the spring during the mississippi river normal flood stage.if they do not,sheriff shumate had probable cause to arrest them for trespass and was entitled to prevail on summary judgment.
federal rights 
plaintiffs argue that they have a federal right to fish on the property when it is covered by the mississippi river waters because the mississippi river is a navigable waterway of the united states.they co
