this action stems from the efforts of a commercial landfill operator to win approval for its proposed landfill expansion after a change in tennessee law required the expansion of landfills to comply with new zoning requirements.wiley hutcherson hutcherson,the property owner,hutcherson metals,hutcherson metals,and western tennessee enterprises,wte,argue that hutcherson scrap company,hutcherson scrap,which is not a party to this lawsuit,was the subject of differential treatment and arbitrary action by lauderdale county,tennessee lauderdale county commission the county commission lauderdale county regional planning commission the planning commission rozell criner,former lauderdale county executive don ammons,robert flagg,and dennis mccaslin,county commission and planning commission members between july and november and doug collins,planning commission member during all relevant periods of this dispute.plaintiffs now appeal the district court grant of defendants federal rule of civil procedure c motion for judgment on the pleadings,which dismissed plaintiffs action in its entirety.
this appeal presents four issues whether the instant action seeks to raise claims and issues that could have been litigated in a prior state proceeding and thus properly should be dismissed pursuant to the doctrine whether plaintiffs complaint sets forth sufficient facts to support a claim that defendants denial of plaintiffs rezoning request was so arbitrary and capricious as to violate substantive due process whether plaintiffs complaint sets forth sufficient facts to support a claim that,although plaintiffs landfill and the landfill were similarly situated,their differential treatment with respect to rezoning was not rationally related to a legitimate state purpose and,therefore,was a violation of the equal protection clause of the constitution and whether the district court properly found that defendants were not entitled to absolute immunity for actions taken in their legislative capacities.
we conclude that plaintiffs are barred under the doctrine of res judicata from raising the foregoing claims because they could have been litigated in the prior state proceeding.accordingly,we affirm the district court dismissal of the instant complaint.
background 
factual background 
on december,the county commission adopted the lauderdale county zoning resolution,which provided that a sanitary landfill was a use permitted on appeal in far and industrial i districts.to obtain a use permitted on appeal designation,a landowner seeking to operate a landfill was required to submit an application to the lauderdale county board of zoning appeals board for approval.at the time this zoning resolution was enacted,there existed only one landfill in lauderdale county,a landfill.
the state of tennessee licensed hutcherson scrap in november for operation of a sanitary landfill on a small portion of hutcherson scrap love farm property in lauderdale county the county.the property,jointly owned by hutcherson,wte,and hutcherson scrap,was and remains.in january,the board authorized hutcherson scrap to operate a sanitary landfill on a parcel of love farm for use by plaintiffs as a disposal site for certain of plaintiffs private recycling program.thereafter,hutcherson scrap conveyed by deed this parcel to landfill,a corporation owned by hutcherson,on which it began operation of a sanitary landfill.
between june and february,the county purchased one hundred acres for the expansion of the county landfill.plaintiffs allege that the county never submitted its expansion plan for approval to the board as a use permitted on appeal despite the fact that the zoning resolution made no distinction between private and public landfills.
in,hutcherson scrap,in coordination with wte,set in motion efforts to obtain state approval for its construction of a class i sanitary landfill on acres of love farm enveloping hutcherson scrap landfill.thereafter,in october,the planning commission became aware of hutcherson scrap interest in expanding its landfill.plaintiffs maintain that the planning commission began discussions at this time to remove landfills from areas such as love farm in an effort to stymie hutcherson scrap landfill expansion.the planning commission,according to plaintiffs,continued these discussions over the course of the next several months and sought to enact an amendment to the zoning resolution with no other purpose than to thwart hutcherson scrap expansion plans.
in may,the planning commission began consideration of an amendment to the zoning resolution to provide for the creation of two types of industrial districts light industrial and heavy industrial.it also discussed possible sites for the newly proposed district.state planner tim roach recommended that the planning commission redesignate the county landfill and hutcherson scrap landfill as compliant.the planning commission rejected roach suggestion,however,and recommended to the county commission that it rezone only the county landfill as.plaintiffs submit that the planning commission differential treatment in this regard was motivated by its desire to prevent the approval of hutcherson scrap proposed landfill expansion.in june,the planning commission voted to recommend the creation of and industrial districts.although the planning commission vote had no binding the county commission can amend a zoning recommendation was required by state law as a precondition for future county commission action.
later that year,in august,the county commission,pursuant to the planning commission recommendation,amended the zoning resolution amendment and effected the following changes the single industrial designation was expanded to include and activity landfills could no longer be sited in far zones,but were thenceforth to be restricted to areas the county landfill was rezoned to insure the orderly development of land use in lauderdale county,although hutcherson scrap landfill was not and although hutcherson scrap could continue operation of its acre sanitary landfill,it would be required to seek approval for any future landfill or landfill expansion either by seeking to have its property rezoned as or by seeking a permit from the board.
prior to the adoption of the amendment,a notice of public hearing was published announcing a hearing scheduled for august.the notice provided in relevant part 
the hearing is to receive public input into proposed amendments to the lauderdale county zoning resolution and zoning map summarized as follows 
consideration of a resolution entitled a resolution to amend the lauderdale county zoning resolution,provisions governing industrial districts and the lauderdale county zoning map.the resolution creates two industrial districts for lauderdale county light industrial and restricted industrial.further,specific definitions of,and restrictions on,landfills,commercial feed lots and salvage yards are created and requirements for site plans established.specific uses and requirements listed in the resolution may be viewed in the office of the lauderdale county executive.
the amendment of the lauderdale county zoning map to designate it all existing i industrial zoning districts as light industrial and the designation of the existing lauderdale county landfill as restricted industrial.
plaintiffs contend that the notice provided no explanation or discussion concerning removing landfills as a use permitted on appeal from the far zoning district.
on december,in what plaintiffs maintain was part of the county commission continuing effort to frustrate hutcherson scrap expansion plans,the county commission approved a resolution,known as the jackson law,that prohibited the new construction of private commercial landfills in the unincorporated areas of any county without prior approval of the county legislative body.the passage of this resolution resulted in the termination of further action by the state of tennessee,division of solid waste management dswm,on hutcherson scrap application for an expansion of its landfill.when the dswm completed its review of hutcherson scrap application,a representative of hutcherson scrap appeared before the county commission,seeking approval of its proposed landfill expansion.the county commission refused hutcherson scrap request,noting that it first was required to submit a request with the planning commission before the county commission would consider any expansion plan.
on march,william griggs appeared before the planning commission on hutcherson scrap behalf concerning its proposed landfill application.the planning commission informed him that hutcherson scrap would have to file an application to rezone the proposed landfill expansion area to before the planning commission would make any recommendation to the county commission.plaintiffs note that at the time the planning commission provided this information,sanitary landfills,such as the one operated by hutcherson scrap,were designated as a use permitted on appeal in areas.plaintiffs nevertheless submitted an application to rezone acres of love farm from far to,as instructed by the planning commission.the planning commission recommended that the county commission deny hutcherson scrap requested rezoning on april,and referred all matters relating to plaintiffs application to the dswm.
in may,the county commission,at a public hearing on hutcherson scrap rezoning request,invited public comment from lauderdale county citizens.later that year,in october,the county commission held another public hearing concerning a second proposed amendment to the zoning resolution amendment.according to plaintiffs,the public notice announcing this hearing contained no indication that landfill designation would be on the agenda.the county commission passed the amendment,which eliminated sanitary landfills as a use permitted on appeal in areas.plaintiffs contend that defendants never notified them prior to the amendment adoption that hutcherson scrap had been misinformed by the planning commission and that it was not required to have its property rezoned to as a precondition to approval of its application.
although the dswm approved hutcherson scrap proposed landfill expansion on november,plaintiffs expansion efforts could not move forward until the county commission rezoned hutcherson scrap property.at the urging of rozell criner,the lauderdale county executive,hutcherson scrap resubmitted to the planning commission a request to rezone acres of love farm from far to.on january,the planning commission again voted to recommend the denial of hutcherson scrap rezoning request.the county commission scheduled a public hearing and vote on hutcherson scrap request for march.that hearing was postponed,however,when several county commission members were indicted for and later convicted of soliciting bribes from hutcherson in exchange for favorable votes on hutcherson scrap rezoning request.
at the rescheduled hearing,held on october,hutcherson scrap was permitted to present evidence in support of the rezoning petition.several persons present at the hearing opposed the approval of hutcherson scrap application on various grounds.one such concern was that rezoning the area proposed by hutcherson scrap from far to effectively would place a commercial district in a residential and agricultural region unequipped with necessary arterial highways,roads,and utilities and,more generally,that the new industrial district would disrupt the orderly development of lauderdale county.the county commission voted to deny hutcherson scrap rezoning request,a decision that plaintiffs maintain lacked either discussion of the pertinent issues or review of hutcherson scrap evidence.
on april,the planning commission held a special meeting at which it passed a resolution recommending that landfills be eliminated as a use permitted on appeal in areas.the county commission voted on may,to pass this resolution.plaintiffs submit that the county commission did so without any discussion and without adequate public notice.
procedural history 
state proceedings 
on december,hutcherson and wte filed a lawsuit in the lauderdale county chancery court against criner and the county commission collectively the state court defendants,seeking injunctive and declaratory relief and money damages for violation of their substantive due process rights.neither hutcherson scrap nor hutcherson metals was a party to this action.the plaintiffs later amended their complaint to eliminate their request for money damages.after the state court defendants motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction was denied,the action proceeded to trial on march.thereafter,on june,the state trial court issued a final decree in which it found that the state court defendants had violated hutcherson and wte federal and tennessee substantive due process and equal protection rights.it nevertheless declined to grant them injunctive relief to permit construction of the proposed landfill.the tennessee court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the state trial court,and the tennessee supreme court denied hutcherson and wte application for leave to appeal.
on march,hutcherson and wte filed an application with the board seeking approval for construction of its landfill as a use permitted on appeal.after a public hearing on the matter,at which hutcherson and wte presented their proposal and members of the public were permitted to comment,the board voted unanimously to deny the application.on august,hutcherson and wte filed a new lawsuit in the lauderdale county chancery court seeking review of the board decision and requesting that chancellor martha brasfield vacate the board decision and order the board to approve the application.on august,the lauderdale county chancery court issued an order upholding the board decision.hutcherson and wte appealed that order to the tennessee court of appeals on september,and that appeal remains pending.
federal proceedings 
on september,hutcherson and wte,along with hutcherson metals,initiated the instant lawsuit in the united states district court for the western district of tennessee pursuant to,alleging substantive due process,procedural due process,and equal protection violations.only the substantive due process and equal protection claims are before this court on appeal.the facts underlying plaintiffs federal complaint are the same as those that form the basis of hutcherson and wte state complaint.after filing their answer on october,defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c,arguing that plaintiffs failed to establish a violation of a constitutional right and,therefore,can not sustain a claim under.plaintiffs responded to this motion on june.after further briefing by the parties,the district court granted defendants motion on march,and entered a final judgment dismissing plaintiffs action on april.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
the doctrine provides that inferior federal courts lack jurisdiction to review the final judgments of state courts.court of appeals feldman,d rooker fidelity trust.res judicata provides that federal courts must give state court judgments the same effect the rendering state court would give them.see marrese am.acad.of orthopaedic surgeons,d.the two doctrines are not coextensive,and should be considered first since its application strips federal courts of jurisdiction and the ability to hear a res judicata,or other affirmative,defense.garry geils,cir quoting gash assocs.vill.of rosemont,cir.the seventh circuit has adopted several useful guidelines for distinguishing between these two doctrines 
in order to determine the applicability of the doctrine,the fundamental and appropriate question to ask is whether the injury alleged by the federal plaintiff resulted from the state court judgment itself or is distinct from that judgment.if the injury alleged resulted from the state court judgment itself,directs that the lower federal courts lack jurisdiction.if the injury alleged is distinct from that judgment,the party maintains an injury apart from the loss in state court and not inextricably intertwined with the state judgment,res judicata may apply,but does not
