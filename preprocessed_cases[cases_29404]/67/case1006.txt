sarah melson brought this action against prime insurance syndicate,prime,alleging that prime decision not to pay her insurance policy face value for a loss caused by fire damage to melson commercial property violated both michigan state law and the terms of the insurance policy.melson appealed the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of prime,contending that the district court judgment was erroneous because prime coinsurance which it relied to deny melson full invalid,as against michigan public policy and the coinsurance provision is ambiguous,and thus fraudulently misrepresents the true nature of the policy.on appeal,we held that the coinsurance provision provided melson with accurate notice as to the conditions of the policy coverage.we were unable to determine with certainty,however,whether the coinsurance provision violated michigan public policy,and thus sought guidance from the michigan supreme court in the form of two certified questions that court declined to answer our questions.in re certified questions from the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit.this opinion follows.
background 
on september,melson purchased two adjoining properties for commercial use in detroit,michigan,located at and seven mile road,respectively.the total purchase price for both properties was,which included the land and all other elements of the real estate.
on october,melson insured both properties with prime.the total insurance coverage for both buildings was for the property at issue.according to the insurance policy policy,prime was required to pay the full amount of actual loss in the event of a fire,subject to certain limitations and conditions.one of these conditions was the imposition of a coinsurance penalty if it were determined that melson had underinsured the property.attached to the policy under a provision titled additional conditions,the coinsurance provision states we will not pay the full amount of any loss if the replacement cost value of covered property at the time of the loss times the coinsurance percentage shown for it in the declarations is greater than the limit for the property.the policy commercial property coverage declarations page declarations page listed a coinsurance amount of.this required melson to insure the property at of its replacement cost value to avoid triggering the coinsurance penalty.
on january,a fire damaged the building located at seven mile road each party agrees that the actual cash value of the loss exceeded the total coverage of prime calculated the actual cash value of the loss at.without a coinsurance provision,prime would have been required to pay the policy full face value.here,however,prime contends that because the policy imposed a coinsurance requirement,it is not responsible for indemnifying melson for the policy full face value.prime argues that it is only required to cover a percentage of that loss,because melson failed to meet the coinsurance requirement.specifically,prime contends that because melson insured less than of the building total replacement cost with them,it is only responsible for the proportion of the loss equal to the proportion that was adequately insured.
prime determined that the full replacement cost of the building was.applying the coinsurance provision,prime determined that the replacement cost value multiplied by the coinsurance percentage required melson to have insured the property for,rather than.prime then determined that it would only pay a sum equal to the proportion of insurance that melson had versus what she was required to have.that is,prime agreed to pay the equivalent proportion of of whatever loss was incurred.
prime used the following formula to calculate its payment 
multiply the replacement cost value of the covered property by the coinsurance percentage 
divide the limit of insurance of the property by the figure determined in step 
multiply the total amount of loss,before the application of any deductible,by the figure determined in step 
subtract the deductible from the figure determined in step 
pursuant to these calculations,prime sent melson two checks totaling on april.melson filed an action in federal district court,alleging that prime refusal to pay the full was a violation of both the terms of the contract and michigan state law.the district court granted prime motion for summary judgment.melson appealed,alleging that prime misrepresented the nature of the policy,that the policy was ambiguous,and that the coinsurance provision was contrary to michigan public policy.although we affirmed the district court order on melson first two claims,we were unable to determine whether coinsurance clauses violated michigan public policy.we certified two questions to the michigan supreme court,which declined to provide guidance after determining that it did not have jurisdiction.our opinion addresses only whether coinsurance clauses violate michigan public policy.

b.the public policy claim 
melson argues that prime coinsurance provision is contrary to michigan public policy for two reasons the michigan legislature revoked the statutory authorization permitting inclusion of coinsurance provisions in property policies and the michigan legislature requires that property policies pay,at a minimum,actual cash value benefits upon a loss.when and how state law applies to a particular case is a matter on which the state supreme court has the last word.houston dutton,cir.if state law is unsettled,as in this case,we anticipate how the state supreme court would rule on the issue of state law.c h entertainment,jefferson county fiscal court,cir.in order to determine how the state supreme court would rule,we look to the decisions of the state intermediate courts unless we are convinced that the state supreme court would decide the issue differently.united of omaha life ins.rex roto,cir.
michigan public policy 
with few exceptions,courts have held that a n insurer is free to define or limit the scope of coverage as long as the policy language fairly leads to only one reasonable interpretation and is not in contravention of public policy.farm bureau mut.ins.nikkel,quoting heniser frankenmuth mut.ins.regarding the determination of whether an insurance contract contravenes public policy,the michigan supreme court has stated 
public policy is to be ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interests.as the term public policy is vague,there must be found definite indications in the law of the sovereign to justify the invalidation of a contract as contrary to that policy.
