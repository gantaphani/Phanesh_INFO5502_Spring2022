chris kohler appeals from a grant of summary judgment to defendant bed bath beyond of california bb b on kohler claims under title iii of the americans with disabilities act ada.kohler contends that the district court erred in concluding that the ada does not require wall space within the maneuvering clearance next to the frame of a restroom door that must be pulled open,and that the district court erred in ruling that,because the door lacked a latch within the meaning of standards governing ada compliance,no maneuvering space was required next to the frame of a restroom door that must be pushed open.we have jurisdiction under.we conclude that kohler claims related to the necessary maneuvering clearance must be rejected.we affirm.
kohler is paraplegic and requires the use of a wheelchair to move in public.on two days in may,kohler used the restroom in the bb b store in riverside,california.during those visits he encountered purported architectural barriers that he claimed impeded his ability to fully use the store.the alleged barriers relevant to this appeal relate to floor and wall space adjacent to the restroom door.kohler brought suit against bb b in the district court for the central district of california.kohler claimed violations of the ada,and related state law provisions.the parties filed for summary judgment.
the record shows that there was less than ten inches of wall space on the pull of bb b restroom door,but there was more than four feet of clear floor space beyond this wall space.kohler alleged that the lack of wall space made it difficult for him to pull open the restroom door by pushing off the wall with one hand while pulling the door handle with the other.there was also less than three inches of wall or floor space on the push side of the door,making it difficult for kohler to open the door.
with respect to the claims of insufficient clearance next to the restroom door,the district court concluded that the ada accessibility guidelines guidelines,which set out the ada compliance requirements for physical structures,require only eighteen inches of floor space rather than floor and wall space on the pull side of a door.the district court also determined that clearance of at least twelve inches of floor space on the push side is required only if the door has a latch,which the district court interpreted to mean a privacy latch.otherwise,no strike side clearance,whether floor or wall space,is required on the push side.
on this basis,the district court denied kohler motion and granted bb b motion on kohler ada claims.the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over kohler state law claims and dismissed them without prejudice.
kohler timely appealed the district court judgment,which is now before us.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.doran eleven,cir.summary judgment should be granted if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.
we may affirm the district court on any basis supported by the record.forest guardians forest,cir.
title iii of the ada prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages,or accommodations of any place of public accommodation with a nexus in interstate commerce.oliver ralphs grocery,cir quoting b,a.the ada requires that new facilities be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,unless this would be structurally impracticable.id.at quoting a.a facility is generally readily accessible within the meaning of the ada if it complies with the guidelines.id.at.
it would be hard to overstate the significance of the ada for a person with a disability who could enjoy a public facility with reasonable modification to make it accessible,but who is otherwise precluded from use and shut out by an architectural barrier.recognizing that it is good business,as well as the requirement of the law,to accommodate the disabled and thereby to enlarge the market for one goods or services,most companies have gladly given their support fully to legal compliance with the ada.but invariably questions about whether particular accommodations satisfy the ada legal requirements will arise.
we have explained that the guidelines,which were promulgated by the attorney general,set out the technical requirements that places of public accommodation must meet to comply with the ada.see chapman pier imports,cir en banc.the parties refer to both the and the guidelines in their briefs.the guidelines went into effect on march.see d ii b.but the new requirements have a safe harbor provision under which a building that complied with the guidelines and has not been altered on or after march,will not be required to make any changes to comply with the guidelines.d i.
kohler argued below that the guidelines controlled the district court decision based on when bb b construction permits were issued.he argues here that because bb b was not in compliance with the guidelines,the safe harbor provision does not apply and the guidelines control.we conclude that kohler position is unpersuasive under either the or the guidelines.
neither the nor the guidelines require a minimum amount of wall length on the pull side of a door.
kohler argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to bb b because the guidelines require at least eighteen inches of clear wall length on the strike side of a door that is pulled open.but kohler argument fails because we hold that the guidelines maneuvering clearance requirements relate only to floor space and to the air above it,not to wall space.both the text and structure of the guidelines support our conclusion.
the first flaw in kohler contention relates to text.kohler argument relies on an implausible reading of the relevant provision of the guidelines.the requirement reads minimum maneuvering clearances at doors that are not automatic or shall be as shown in figure.the floor or ground area within the required clearances shall be level and clear.pt,app.d.figure a,reproduced below,shows the required clearance for a front approach to the pull side of a door,and uses both solid and dotted lines,as well as a thick solid line 
the guidelines graphic conventions indicate that a dotted line signifies the boundary of clear floor area,while a solid line is a typical dimension line showing customary units in inches above the line see pt,app.d tbl.the thick solid line is not explained by the graphic conventions.id.
the text accompanying figure says that f ront approaches to pull side of swinging doors shall have maneuvering space that extends from the hinge side of the door to inches mm minimum,inches mm preferred,beyond the latch side of the door and inches mm minimum perpendicular to the doorway.pt,app.d.if we interpret maneuvering space to mean the same thing when it refers to space extending past the latch side of the door that it does when referring to space perpendicular to the doorway,then adopting kohler view would require that the sixty inches of maneuvering space perpendicular to the doors have walls all around it,such that an door would need to be built into a deep alcove.common sense does not permit us to adopt such an understanding,and kohler in oral argument agreed that the ada and guidelines were not intended to require such alcoves.more important is the fact that the word wall is absent from figure a and the accompanying note.but the floor area is explicitly referenced in,to which figure is attached.also,the space is called maneuvering space,which we understand to mean the space needed for a wheelchair to navigate up to and through a doorway.we interpret the guidelines to require eighteen inches of clear floor space and clear air space above that floor so that a person in a wheelchair can maneuver freely.
looking to the guidelines only reinforces our conclusion.kohler argues that because the guidelines graphic conventions at figure include the description of a solid black line convention as representing a wall,a floor,ceiling or other element cut in section or plan,it means wa
