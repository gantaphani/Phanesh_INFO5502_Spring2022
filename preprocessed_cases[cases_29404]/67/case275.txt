plaintiffs appellants heidi and juan rodriguez,parents of minor child,brought suit for disability discrimination under the fair housing act,et fha,against defendants appellees village green realty,a real estate agency,and blanca aponte,its agent.the plaintiffs allege,inter alia,that the defendants made housing unavailable on the basis of disability in violation of f provided different terms,conditions,and privileges of rental housing on the basis of disability in violation of f expressed a preference on the basis of disability in violation of c and misrepresented the availability of rental housing on the basis of disability in violation of d.the united states district court for the northern district of new york mcavoy,granted summary judgment for the defendants on these claims.this appeal followed.
we hold that the district court erred because there was sufficient evidence presented that qualifies as disabled under the fha.we also hold that the fha prohibition against statements that indicate any preference,limitation,or discrimination based on handicap,c,may be violated even if the subject of those statements does not qualify as disabled under the fha.finally,we hold that the ordinary listener standard is not applicable to claims under d for misrepresenting the availability of housing.accordingly,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand.
background 
factual background 
plaintiffs heidi and juan rodriguez are the parents of minor child who has autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy.this suit under the fair housing act arose from text messages about sent to heidi rodriguez by defendant blanca aponte,a real estate agent.
the rodriguez family had rented a single family home on a basis for two years on property located in saugerties,new york.the property was owned by donnie morelli and included two single family homes and acres.some time in,the property was listed for sale with defendant real estate agency village green realty.defendant aponte served as the listing agent.
on january,aponte left a letter at the rodriguez home informing them of morelli intention to sell the property to mansour farhandian.the letter stated that farhandian would be willing to continue to rent to the rodriguez family,but under certain modified terms,including an increased rent,and asked the rodriguezes to inform aponte whether they agreed to the new terms.if not,the letter stated,they would have to vacate the premises by march.the rodriguezes did not immediately inform aponte as to whether they accepted the new terms.
on january,morelli entered into a purchase agreement with farhandian the agreement anticipated a closing in early march.in order to facilitate the anticipated sale,aponte continued to try to contact the rodriguezes to determine whether they intended to accept the new lease terms.she texted rodriguez on january and february inquiring about a response to the letter,but rodriguez did not respond.
on february,suffered two grand mal seizures rodriguez called morelli from the hospital to inform him about the seizures and tell him that it was not the time for her and rodriguez to be negotiating with aponte.the next day,aponte texted rodriguez hi please respond to my notices if you have an attorney please have them get in touch me,to which rodriguez replied please call donnie morelli for an update.id.aponte wrote back will do.id 
this began the exchange of text messages from february to that are the principal subject of this action.on february,aponte wrote to rodriguez that she had j ust spoke n w ith donnie morelli and that,w hile they were both sympathetic to rodriguez situation,morelli was selling the property and aponte would be proceeding with legal action to remove you from the premises.id.after several exchanges regarding scheduling a time for aponte to inspect the rodriguezes home,rodriguez stated,
we are not leaving.where do you want us to go with a sick child why do you keep on harassing and insisting that we move when you were told of my daughter being sick we were asking for free rent or anything of the sort.just to be understood and left alone to deal with her medical issues without being bothered by you asking us to leave our home.
aponte replied that she had not asked you to leave but that she had received no response from the rodriguezes about the new owner rental terms.id.in reply,rodriguez complained about the poorly maintained icy road near the home and questioned how vehicles could get up the road o r better yet an ambulance for my daughter if needed.id.aponte responded,
this has nothing to do with what we were just speaking about.fact is that if i can get up and down emergency vehicles should be able to as well.this has been an unusually cold and snow filled winter.so maybe you should consider relocating to a better and more easily accessible location.
a few days later,on february,rodriguez sent a text message to aponte stating that she needed to reschedule the inspection because had suffered the second seizure and needed to return to the hospital for testing.this led to the following exchange 
aponte february,just spoke w my lawyer for management company we will accept your rescheduling appointment for friday if you provide verification of medical appointment for your daughter.the prospective new owner is very concerned about continuing your lease with you childs medical situation and will probably not want to rent to you i think we need to let you know that we will not be renting to you please plan on rel please make plans to relocate.we will give you until end of march.respond to me not to mr morelli blanca 
rodriguez february,what are you talking about aponte february,exactly what i said.you have cancelled our appointment because of issues with your daughter illness.we want verification of your appointment that being said the new owner has decided not to continue to rent to you because your daughter should be in a more convenient location to medical treatment 
rodriguez february,you spoke to the new owner that fast and he made a decision not to rent to us because my daughter has seizures or is this you decision 
i am confused.
aponte february,the new owner is concerned by your statement that emergency vehicles can not reach you should your daughter be at risk.also concerned about you not making place readily available for inspection and thinks i should have a key that is the right of a landlord and his representative.for me,i only have your statement that your daughter us sick do u have verification 
on february,aponte reiterated that the new owner was concerned about renting to the rodriguezes because of rodriguez statement that the home was not readily accessible to emergency vehicles,which aponte stated was a major concern as to liability.she further stated,i think that your tenancy is over.will verify after speaking to both donnie morelli and buyer.
in addition to learning of medical problems from the text messages from rodriguez,aponte obtained information around the same time about from the rodriguezes neighbor,tammy drost.drost,who lived in the second house on the property that was being sold,was a special education aide at elementary school,and personal assistant at the school.drost had frequent contact with aponte and told aponte that was autistic,may be epileptic and was placed in a special class at school.rodriguez testified at her deposition that she believed that morelli,who was also aware of diagnoses,seizures,and special educational services,had also told aponte this information.
although the sale between morelli and farhandian was not completed,plaintiffs began looking for new housing in late january or early february of,when it became very apparent that they were not wanted,and they moved to another home in september of that year.in the interim,the rodriguezes complied with aponte request for higher rent beginning in march.
ii.proceedings in district court 
in september,plaintiffs filed this action,alleging that the defendants had violated the fair housing act,et fha.in their amended complaint,the plaintiffs claimed that the real estate agency and aponte had made housing unavailable on the basis of disability in violation of f provided different terms,conditions,and privileges of rental housing on the basis of disability in violation of f expressed a preference on the basis of disability in violation of c and misrepresented the availability of rental housing on the basis of disability in violation of d 
the plaintiffs and defendants for summary judgment on october,the district court granted defendants motion with respect to the claims at issue here,holding that the plaintiffs had not come forward with sufficient admissible evidence to allow a reasonable factfinder to conclude that was disabled as defined by the fha rodriguez vill.green realty,cv,wl,at,rodriguez i.the plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of the district court dismissal of their claims under c and d,arguing that for those claims it is irrelevant whether is disabled,because these fha provisions apply to any person aggrieved by a statement indicating a preference or discrimination based on handicap or a misrepresentation of availability because of handicap.although the district court agreed upon reconsideration that subsections c and d apply more broadly than subsection f as to standing to bring a claim,the court still dismissed these claims,finding that there was insufficient evidence that aponte statements about indicated a preference,limitation or discrimination based on handicap,or that a dwelling was not available because of handicap.rodriguez vill.green realty,cv,wl,at,rodriguez ii.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in dismissing their claims on the basis of lack of disability.plaintiffs assert that meets the fha definition of disabled because her epilepsy and autism substantially limit her ability to learn.see h.they also argue,in the alternative,isabled under the act,aponte regarded her as having an impairment that substantially limited her in a major life activity.see h.finally,the plaintiffs argue that the district court erroneously concluded that an ordinary listener could not have interpreted aponte statements as reflecting discrimination.

ii.statutory framework 
this appeal requires us to address the amendments to the fha,which extended the fair housing act protections against housing discrimination to disabled individuals.see fair housing amendments act of,stat.codified at et.we are guided by our decisions interpreting similar language that appeared in the americans with disabilities act ada,et,prior to the ada amendment in 
definition of handicapped 
the fha makes it unlawful t o discriminate in the sale or rental,or to otherwise make unavailable or deny,a dwelling to any buyer or renter because of a handicap or t o discriminate against any person in the terms,conditions,or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling,or in the provision of services or facilities in connection with such dwelling,because of a handicap.f.the act also forbids the representation to any person because of handicap that any dwelling is not available for inspection,sale,or rental when such dwelling is in fact so available.id.d.both provisions prohibit action taken because of handicap,and,as such,require that plaintiffs show the existence of a disability within the meaning of the fha in order to state a claim under these subsections 
to demonstrate a disability under the fha,a plaintiff must show a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities a record of having such an impairment or that he or she is regarded as having such an impairment.h see recap,at.prongs and,which we will refer to as the actually disabled test and the regarded as test,respectively,are the two definitions relevant here.
subsection c 
subsection c of the fha prohibits mak ing,print ing,or publish ing,or caus ing to be made,printed,or published any notice,statement,or advertisement,with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference,limitation,or discrimination based on handicap,or an intention to make any such preference,limitation,or discrimination.c.this court has interpreted this provision in the context of racial discrimination to mean that a plaintiff could bring an action if the defendant statements suggest ed to an ordinary reader that a particular race was preferred or dispreferred for the housing in question,regardless of the defendant intent.ragin harry macklowe real estate,cir ragin ii third and fourth alterations in original emphasis added quoting ragin times,cir ragin i.
iii.whether is disabled 
the plaintiffs argue that is disabled under the fha because her impairments substantially limit the major life activity of learning or,in the alternative,because aponte treated impairments as if they substantially limited a major life activity we hold that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to defendants on the ground that did not have a disability within the meaning of the fha because there is sufficient evide from which a reasonable jury could conclude that was either substantially limited in the major life activity of learning or that aponte regarded as substantially limited in the major life activities of learning or obtaining housing.
actually disabled under section h 
a n individual is considered disabled under h if he or she suffers from a physical or mental impairment,that affects a major life activity,and the effect is substantial.recap,at.major life activities include functions such as caring for one self,performing manual tasks,walking,seeing,hearing,speaking,breathing,learning,and working.id.at quoting,inter alia,b.
the applicable regulations define a p hysical or mental impairment to include epilepsy and autism.a.epilepsy is a brain disorder that causes recurring seizures.library of,epilepsy,medlineplus,last updated.people with epilepsy can experience different types of seizures,including grand mal and petit mal seizures.library of,absence seizure,medlineplus,http last updated may.grand mal seizures typically result in rigid muscles,followed by violent muscle contractions and loss of consciousness.library of,generalized tonic clonic seizure,medlineplus,http last updated may.petit mal seizures,also known as absence seizures,generally involve staring episodes lasting fewer than seconds.library of,absence seizure,supra.people experiencing this type of seizure undergo a change in consciousness or alertness.id.
autism spectrum disorder is a neurological and developmental disorder that affects how a person acts and interacts with others,communicates,and learns.library of,autism spectrum disorder,medlineplus,last updated may.the essential features of the disorder are persistent impairment in social interaction and restricted,repetitive patterns of behavior,interests,or activities.am.psychiatric ass n,diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ed.dsm.manifestations of the disorder vary greatly.id.deficits in social communication can range from abnormalities in eye contact to failure to initiate or respond to social interactions.id.at.one example of characteristic repetitive behavior is h ighly restricted,fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity.id.a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder requires that these symptoms limit or impair everyday functioning.id.at.in young children with autism spectrum disorder,lack of social and communication abilities may hamper learning,especially learning through social interaction or in settings with peers extreme difficulties in planning,organization,and coping with change negatively impact academic achievement,even for students with intelligence.id.at.
the first question is whether the plaintiffs have provided sufficient evidence to create a genuine dispute that suffers from an impairment.the plaintiffs evidence includes a sworn declaration from pediatrician,irene flatau,which states 
medical history shows that she has been diagnosed with epilepsy since.this causes her to experience grand mal seizures,the most intense type of seizure,during which she loses consciousness and suffers violent muscle contractions,as well as petit mal seizures,also known as absence seizures,during which a person briefly and suddenly lapses into unconsciousness.
in addition,has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.
rodriguez also testified that has been diagnosed with autism,suffers from petit and grand mal seizures,and receives medical treatment and special services in school for these conditions.this evidence is sufficient to create a genuine dispute as to whether has a physical or mental impairment under the fha.see a.
we must then determine whether the district court erred in holding that there was insufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that impairments substantially limited her ability to learn.in toyota motor manufacturing,kentucky,williams,d,superseded by statute adaaa,stat.at,the supreme court decided that substantially limit s in the ada definition of disability required that an impairment prevent or severely restrict an individual major life activity.toyota motor,at accord capobianco city of,cir t he mere fact that an impairment requires an individual to perform a task differently from the average person does not mean that she is disabled within the meaning of the ada.the impairment impact must be permanent or long term,toyota motor,at,and it must be evaluated with reference to measures that mitigate the individual impairment,sutton united air lines,d,superseded by statute,adaaa,stat.at 
defendants argue that this circuit requires the submission of medical evidence to establish a disability under the fha and that plaintiffs claims fail for their failure to present admissible medical evidence concerning how epilepsy and autism affected her learning.however,medical evidence as to the extent of an individual impairment is not always required to survive summary judgment.neither the ada or the fha text,nor the respective implementing regulations require medical evidence to establish a genuine dispute of material fact regarding the impairment of a major life activity at the summary judgment stage.instead,toyota motor requires a n individualized assessment to determine the existence of a disability.toyota motor,at.medical testimony may be helpful to show that an impairment is substantially limiting,but it is not always necessary.see autozone,cir head glacier,cir.
our decision in heilweil mount sinai hospital,cir,is not to the contrary,as defendants contend.the statement in heilweil that n o medical proof substantiate d the plaintiff disability claim under the rehabilitation act was limited to the context of that case.id.at.in heilweil,the issue that required such proof was the extent to which the conceded impairment of asthma limited the plaintiff in the major life activity of working.id.at.the plaintiff claimed that her asthma prevented her from working in the hospital where she had been employed.id.at.both the plaintiff own statements and those of her doctor showed,however,that her asthma was only exacerbated in a particular unventilated area in the hospital,and not at different locations with different air quality.id.it was in this context that we dismissed the plaintiff contrary contention that she was unable to work in the general environment of the hospital as mere speculation given the absence of corroborating medical evidence.id.thus,because the plaintiff only showed that she was unable to work in one particular area of the hospital due to her asthma,she did not raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether she was substantially limited in the major life activity of working.id.at.
as the outcome of heilweil reflects,conclusory declarations are insufficient to raise a question of material fact.see davis new york,cir.however,evidence that conveys,in detail,the substantially limiting nature of an impairment may be sufficient to survive summary judgment.
here,the plaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether ability to learn was substantially limited by her impairments.the district court concluded that the plaintiffs testimony does not explain how condition may have substantially limited a major life activity,rodriguez i,wl,at,and that there was no objective assessment or indication of the degree of any e ffect of impairments on her school work or learning ability such that it can reasonably be said that any limitation is substantial,id.at.this summary of the evidence fails to resolve all ambiguities or draw all permissible factual inferences in favor of the plaintiffs.see stone,at.
in reaching its conclusion,the district court did not note relevant deposition testimony from rodriguez.for example,rodriguez testified that was provided with an individualized education plan iep at school since summer and was classified as ohi.according to rodriguez,had been diagnosed with autism at the beginning of.as a result of her classification as ohi and the provisions of her iep,received at her school counsel ing,individual,group counsel ing,occupational therapy,speech and physical therapy different testing accommodation s,note takers,various things being read to her,extra time to complete tasks,extra time to take tests,and homework modifications.defendants argue that the receipt of special education services is not,by itself,determinative as to whether a child qualifies as disabled.we agree.a child receiving services under the idea need not be substantially limit ed in the major life activity of learning,so one may therefore qualify as disabled under the idea for purposes of that statute without demonstrating a substantially limit ing impairment.ellenberg military,cir alterations in original.here,however,it is not just that qualified for an iep that is dispositive in determining whether she qualifies as disabled.rather,the nature of the specific services she requires shows the extent to which her impairments affect her ability to learn,and the additional evidence of how she has struggled notwithstanding her iep and the support she receives at school create a triable question of fact precluding summary judgment.id.at noting that the plaintiff could have used her particular individualized education program to show specific evidence of substantial impairment,but did not.
rodriguez also testified that petit mal seizures cause her to blink off for short periods of time.for example,when experiencing these seizures,will stop,having forgotten what she was saying,or she will miss part of a program when watching television and not recall what happened.according to rodriguez,began experiencing petit mal seizures in august or september,when was entering fifth grade.rodriguez testified that received special academic services throughout fifth grade,and that her grades in sixth grade while initially good kept going considerably lower.by the time reached seventh still struggling with school.this testimony therefore also demonstrates the magnitude of impairment in the area of learning.see hanneke de boer et,the global burden and stigma of epilepsy,epilepsy behav,stating that o ne major area of cognitive malfunctioning in people with epilepsy is memory impairment and that frequent seizures can impair learning of new information because of the amount of time the person is unaware of the environment.
in addition,on february,during the time of the text message exchange with aponte had her first of two grand mal seizures.she was taken to the hospital and then suffered the second grand mal seizure on the way home.she was again taken to the hospital.shortly following these seizures,was removed from her school because her medications were causing her to have outbursts and the school was not able to provide her with a aide,making it more of a safety risk to have her there.she was then home schooled by a tutor provided by the school system,who had to double her time because they could not even get through the stuff with her.she did not return to school until the last week of june and did not finish her fifth grade course work until august.although the defendants are correct in observing that grand mal seizures have apparently not recurred since february,it is the impact of her impairment,not its most severe physical manifestations,that must be permanent or long term.see toyota motor,at.rodriguez testified that was continuing to struggle to keep up in school as late as september.there is therefore at least a question of fact as to the impact of the grand mal seizures alone and in combination with her other conditions on ability to learn.joan austin et,does academic achievement in children with epilepsy change over time,developmental med.child neurology,finding no trend of improved academic achievement among children whose seizure conditions changed from high to low severity,and hypothesizing that o ne possible explanation for this finding is that these children missed out on learning information during the period when their seizure conditions were severe and they were not able to catch up.
in addition to this evidence,the plaintiffs also submitted medical evidence to demonstrate the extent of limitations,including a may evaluation,a june occupational therapy initial evaluation,and progress notes and reports from pediatric neurologists in and.the plaintiffs offered these documents in opposition to defendants motion for summary judgment.the documents were cited in plaintiffs opposition brief,quoted in plaintiffs response to defendants local rule statement,and presented as attachments to the declaration of plaintiffs attorney,who attested that they are true and accurate copies,and were produced under a protective order for medical records.
the defendants first raised an objection to the admissibility of these records in their reply brief in support of their motion for summary judgment,which was filed on october.on october,the district court noted on the docket that the parties for summary judgment would be decided without oral argument.on october,just six days after defendants first objected to the admissibility of the medical records the district court issued its opinion in rodriguez i,in which it found that the records were inadmissible because they were unauthenticated and there was no indication that they were complete and accurate copies of medical records.see rodriguez i,wl,at.it therefore does not appear that the plaintiffs had an opportunity to respond to the defendants objections or to supplement the record with additional documentation to authenticate and certify the records prior to the district court ruling.see.c advisory committee note to amendment a party may object that material cited to support or dispute a fact can not be presented in a form that would be admissible in evidence.the objection functions much as an objection at trial,adjusted for the pretrial setting.the burden is on the proponent to show that the material is admissible as presented or to explain the admissible form that is anticipated.sand airtemp,cir stating that.does not require that parties authenticate documents where the party did not challenge the authenticity of the documents.
having reviewed these medical records,we note that their appearance,contents,and substance are what one would expect of such records and support plaintiffs claim that they are what they appear to be.b stating that the authentication requirement can be satisfied by t he appearance,contents,substance,or other distinctive characteristics of the item,taken together with all the circumstances united states pluta,cir t he burden of authentication does not require the proponent of the evidence to prove beyond any doubt that the evidence is what it purports to be.rather,the standard for authentication,and hence for admissibility,is one of reasonable likelihood.alteration in original internal quotation marks and citation omitted united states bagaric,cir the requirement of authentication is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter is what its proponent claims.this finding may be based entirely on circumstantial evidence,including a ppearance,contents,substance and other distinctive characteristics of the writing.alterations in original internal quotation marks and citations omitted,abrogated on other grounds by org.for women,scheidler,d.the record also indicates that these records were produced by the medical providers themselves.see smyth,app x a,tab at facsimile transmittal page from eriver neurology,app x a,tab at hipaa authorization signed by rodriguez authorizing release of records to plaintiffs counsel,app x a,tab at cover letter to plaintiffs counsel describing photocopying fee from school district where evaluating occupational therapist was employed.these documents therefore seem like the type that likely could have been authenticated and certified,had plaintiffs had the opportunity to respond.
moreover,although the district court stated that these records were inadmissible,the court still considered them,reviewed them in some detail,and concluded that they were insufficient to establish a medical condition that substantially limits one or more major life activities.rodriguez i,wl,at.accordingly,although we conclude that the evidence discussed above is sufficient to raise a genuine dispute as to the extent of limitations,we will consider these medical records as well.sony elm state,cir describing the second circuit strong preference for resolution of disputes on their merits and preference for resolving doubts in favor of a trial on the merits cargill,sears petroleum transp,d,because of the preference to have issues and claims decided on their merits,rather than on the basis of a procedural shortcoming,the exclusion of otherwise relevant evidence on technical grounds is generally not favored.
we find that the medical records submitted by the plaintiffs further support plaintiffs claims of how severely impairments affect her ability to learn in may,at the recommendation of school,the rodriguezes took to see pediatrician monica meyer for a evaluation.meyer recorded the rodriguezes concern that anxieties have led to a plateauing in her school work and her no longer performing well in school.she diagnosed as having pervasive developmental disorder and noted that this condition,along with anxiety,impact s her life in general,her performance at school and her peer interactions.meyer found that a t school,belongs in an integrated class with a special education teacher who has experience working with children on the autistic spectrum.meyer also recommended counseling,social skills training,occupational therapy,and accommodations that lessen the impact of anxiety on her academic performance.id.
an occupational therapy initial evaluation conducted by school system in following autism diagnosis found that she had difficulty registering visual and movement input and misses directions.the evaluation also noted that requires more external supports than her peers to participate in learning,is currently not registering input that will help her attend to the task at hand,has t olerance within the learning environment that is less than that of her peers,and has a vailability for learning within the learning environment that is less than that of her peers.
in november,shortly before the events of february,pediatric neurologist glenn castaneda diagnosed and treated epilepsy.his notes confirm that the rodriguezes observed that petit mal seizures were beginning to affect her school work as her grades were deteriorating.
finally,castaneda records from march state that rodriguez reported that conditions were causing a lot of distress for and that she ha d been off of school for at least a couple of weeks.at the time of rodriguez deposition in september,was in her first week of seventh grade,and she was still experiencing petit mal seizures and was having struggles with school already.
whether just considering the evidence,or also considering this medical evidence,the evidence as to the severity of learning limitations is sufficient to survive summary judgment.a jury could reasonably infer from the extensive educational support receives that she is significantly limited in her ability to independently register and process information,pay attention to educators,take notes,read,and complete her homework.see gummo vill.of depew,cir if,as to the issue on which summary judgment is sought,there is any evidence in the record from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the opposing party,summary judgment is improper.these skills are fundamental to learning,as are the ability to remember information and to follow written or demonstrated directions abilities that may also be substantially limited by petit mal seizures and autism,according to plaintiffs evidence.where these skills are limited,it follows that ability to learn may be substantially limited.see emory astrazeneca pharm.lp,cir reversing a grant of summary judgment because evidence that plaintiff limitations interfere with his ability to read and process information,as well as basic math skills or the filling out of paperwork,was sufficient to create a genuine issue as to whether he was substantially limited in the major life activity of learning branham snow,cir holding that a reasonable juror could find the plaintiff substantially limited in the activity of eating based on his diabetes,his limitations after receiving treatment,and the side effects of that treatment.significantly,this conclusion is supported by the fact that,despite the extra help receives at school,her grades began deteriorating in fifth grade and she has continued to struggle in sixth and seventh grade.see sutton,at.drawing all permissible inferences in favor of the plaintiffs,they have presented sufficient evidence at this stage of the litigation to create a genuine dispute as to whether ability to learn is substantially limited.
regarded as disabled under section h 
plaintiffs also challenge the district court conclusion that there is insufficient evidence upon which a fair minded trier of fact could reasonably conclude that aponte regarded as having a handicap.rodriguez i,wl,at.according to the regulations issued by the department of housing and urban development,one is regarded as having an impairment if,inter alia,she h as a physical or mental impairment that does not substantially limit one or more major life activities but that is treated by another person as constituting such a limitation.d.prior to the enactment of the adaaa,the regulations implementing the ada contained a substantially identical provision,which we held required a plaintiff to show that defendants perceived the plaintiff impairment as substantially limiting the exercise of a major life activity.reeves johnson controls world,cir 
proving that a plaintiff is regarded as disabled is a question embedded almost entirely in the defendant subjective state of mind.ross campbell soup,cir.
this court has consistently held where subjective issues regarding a litigant state of mind are squarely implicated,summary judgment would appear to be inappropriate and a trial indispensable furthermore,a sojourn into an adherent will inevitably trigger myriad factual inferences,as to which reasonable persons might differ in their resolution.traditionally,this function has been entrusted to the jury.
patrick lefevre,cir citations omitted.
the first step of our analysis is to determine the major life activity at issue.reeves,at.the plaintiffs primarily contend that aponte text messages show that she perceived epilepsy as substantially limiting her in the major life activity of obtaining housing.they also argue that she regarded as substantially limited in her ability to learn.
this court has not determined whether obtaining housing is a major life activity,but the fourth circuit has held that it is.united states mgmt,cir.we agree.major life activities means functions such as caring for one self,performing manual tasks,walking,seeing,hearing,speaking,breathing,learning and working.b.but this list is not exclusive.reeves,at see also bartlett state bd.of law exam rs,cir.major life activities are those activities that are of central importance to daily life,toyota motor,at,including reading,bartlett,at,and interacting with others,jacques dimarzio,cir.on the other end of the spectrum are those activities that are insufficiently fundamental,such as performing housework and shopping.colwell suffolk cnty.police dep t,cir.the ability to obtain shelter is among the most basic of human needs and thus is a major life activity for purposes of the fha.we note that a person is not substantially limited in the major life activity of obtaining housing simply because she is unable to,or regarded as unable to,live in a particular dwelling.rather,a person is substantially limited if,due to her impairment,she can not live or is regarded as unable to live in a broad class of housing that would otherwise be accessible to her.sutton,at.
we now turn to whether the plaintiffs evidence is sufficient for a reasonable juror to conclude that aponte perceived impairments as substantially limiting her in the activities of learning or obtaining housing.the district court concluded that the only limitations expressed by these messages were with respect to the ability of an ambulance to reach the property,not whether was limited with respect to a major life activity.rodriguez i,wl,at.we disagree.
first,there is sufficient evidence to create a genuine dispute as to whether aponte perceived as substantially limited in her ability to learn.aponte knew from drost the rodriguezes neighbor and aide at school that was autistic and received special education services at school.aponte learned from rodriguez,and likely from morelli as well,that is epileptic.although aponte statement in her text messages that t he prospective new owner is very concerned about continuing your lease with you childs medical situation and will probably not want to rent to you,does not illuminate what medical condition is at issue or why she thought the condition would be of concern,answering those questions and determining aponte mental state should be left to the jury.see lefevre,at.
second,there is also evidence that aponte perceived as substantially limited in her ability to obtain housing.aponte wrote in her text messages to rodriguez 
the new owner has decided not to continue to rent to you because your daughter should be in a more convenient location to medical treatment.
the new owner is concerned by your statement that emergency vehicles can not reach you should your daughter be at risk.id.
when all these concerns came up about your daughter being seriously ill and emergency vehicles not being able to get to her that is of major concern as to liability which you raised id.at.
arguably,aponte expresses through these messages a belief that,because of her epilepsy,could only live close to facilities providing medical treatment.if true,this could certainly be a perceived substantial limitation on ability to obtain housing.by including in the definition of handicap not only those who are actually physically impaired,but also those who are regarded as impaired,congress acknowledged that society accumulated myths and fears about disability and disease are as handicapping as are the physical limitations that flow from actual impairment.sch.bd.of nassau,arline,d referring to section of the rehabilitation act of,stat.codified as amended at et.the amendments to the fha,which extended coverage of the act to disabled individuals,were specifically aimed at rejecting g eneralized perceptions about disabilities and unfounded speculations about threats to safety as gro
