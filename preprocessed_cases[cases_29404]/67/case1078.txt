louis and karen metro would like very much to acquire some land that they believe the city of lawrenceburg,indiana,and the lawrenceburg conservancy district promised to convey to them.the option contract their company held,however,was premised on the construction of a flood control project that the city and the district had planned.when that project was abandoned,the district told the metros that their option could no longer be exercised.this lawsuit,brought under the diversity jurisdiction,asserts that the city and the district breached their contract with the metros business.the district court found for the plaintiffs and ordered reformation of the option contract to extend the date by which the option could be exercised,but it rejected the metros request for money damages on the ground that their proof of injury was too speculative.we agree with the district court that the contract was breached.the remedy that the court ordered,however,needs some additional attention,and so we remand for that limited purpose.
louis and karen metro are both citizens of ohio.they are the sole members of a limited liability company,metro family,llc,that owns properties and rents them to businesses in ohio and indiana.southern ohio pizza,an ohio corporation that the metros own,operates domino pizza franchises in properties that it leases from metro family.one of its pizza shops was located on the west bank of tanners creek,which is a tributary of the ohio river.tanners creek bisects lawrenceburg,which itself is situated at the point where ohio,indiana,and kentucky meet.
several times during the century,floods have surged down the ohio river from the east and have overwhelmed the river tributary system and the adjacent towns.in,a particularly bad flood hit lawrenceburg,prompting the city to entertain the idea of building a new levee.it turned to the district to carry out any such plans.in,the city and the district inaugurated the westside flood protection project,which had the goal of building a flood wall along the west bank of tanners creek,just where metro family property on which a pizza shop was operating was located.in order to fund the project,the city and the district entered into a contract entitled the extension of revenue sharing agreement,dated december,under which each party promised to use the revenue from a riverboat casino for that purpose.
this arrangement enabled the district to move forward with the acquisition of land along tanners creek.one parcel it needed was the spot where metro family had its domino franchise.it notified the metros that it intended to acquire the property using its eminent domain powers.about ten months later,a professional appraiser concluded that the fair market value of the property was.
in the meantime,as required by,the district sent an offer to metro family to purchase the property for.the metros were not satisfied with this offer,and so negotiations ensued.on july,their lawyer counteroffered for terms calling for metro family to receive and an option contract.the district accepted the counteroffer,and the parties signed the modified agreement on october.paragraph read as follows,in relevant part 
at the time of closing,which shall occur on or before november,district shall execute an irrevocable option in favor of metro family wherein metro shall have the right to purchase acres of the real estate described in exhibit a and the adjoining acres for a purchase price of the option shall be exercisable for a period of eighteen months commencing with the date written notice of substantial completion of the district facilities is given by the district to metro by registered mail 
exhibit a contained the legal description of the parcel of land,sometimes called the taylor tract,to which the option applied.unfortunately,the agreement did not address what would happen if the levee project was not completed.the deal was closed on november.
at the time the option was executed,the district intended to use the property solely for the construction of the levee.but,as the poet robert burns famously observed,
the schemes o mice an men,gang aft agley,
an us nought but grief an pain,for promis joy 
to a mouse,on turning her up in her nest with the plough.only two months after signing the agreement,the common council of lawrenceburg passed a resolution withdrawing its funding from the levee project.this unraveled everything without city funding,the district decided that it could not go forward on its own.it estimated that the cost of completion was somewhere between and million it had only million available for the project at the time and the district did not want to raise taxes.
left with the property for which it had paid,the district eventually conveyed it to the city.the city then decided to put it to an alternative use,and a highway bridge now exists on the area that was to be used for the levee project.the parcel described by the option contract is now virtually unusable,because it lies underneath a new extension of indiana route.
proceeding by agreement before a magistrate judge,see c,the parties participated in a bench trial.the district court found that as of the time the agreement was executed,it was not ambiguous,because everyone concerned expected that the levee project would be completed within a reasonable time,and that there would be enough land behind the levee for metro family to exercise its option and rebuild its pizza store.when the city decided to withdraw funding for the project,the court concluded,the essential purpose of the agreement failed.under indiana law,such an occurrence creates a latent ambiguity in the document.the court thus turned to extrinsic evidence,principally from the negotiating history of the option agreement which it reviewed in detail in its opinion,and drew from that the conclusion that metro family should be entitled to exercise its option even if the levee project was never completed.
the court also found that the district did not definitively decide to abandon the project until as late as december.the evidence indicated that no member of the district ever communicated to metro family that the option could not be exercised until at least august of.to the contrary,on several earlier occasions,district representatives expressed the hope to metro family that the project would be resumed or completed and thus that the option would eventually be usable.as the court saw it,metro family relied on these representations when it allowed its building to be demolished,which happened some time after february.
at the bench trial,metro family offered evidence in an effort to prove that the city and district actions had caused it to suffer a lost future stream of income.the court,however,found their expert account to be too speculative to give it any weight.it also found that louis metro testimony about the fair market value of the property on the date of the taking and about the damage caused to him by the destruction of the building was too vague to support any conclusions.
the court summarized its findings as follows 
metro family has proven the existence of an option contract that the contract contained a latent ambiguity that the intention of the parties was to allow metro family to exercise the option if the levee project was not completed that the district breached the option contract by refusing to allow metro family to exercise the option within eighteen months of the district final decision not to proceed with the project,which in this case is its decision to convey the property to the city.
it found that metro family was not entitled to money damages for the breach,however,because of a failure of proof.that said,the court found that the market value of the property was plus the right to exercise the option.emphasis in original.even though there was no evidence of the monetary value of the option,the court thought that reformation of the contract was appropriate,because the parties had made a mutual mistake of fact.it thus ruled,both on that ground and under the theory of promissory estoppel,that metro family was entitled to exercise the option within months of the date of its order.
