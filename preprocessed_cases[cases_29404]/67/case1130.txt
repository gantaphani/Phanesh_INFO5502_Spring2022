ambrosia land investments,llc ambrosia and intervening illinois mine subsidence insurance fund the fund collectively the plaintiffs appeal the district court conclusion that their claims are barred by the illinois construction statute of repose,ilcs b.for the following reasons,we reverse.
background 
in,ambrosia constructed a warehouse on its property in clair county,illinois,which happened to be located above ellen mine the mine,an underground coal mine originally built in the early that spans over acres.peabody,who had acquired the rights to the mine in from perry coal company,operated the mine until,when it closed the mine.the mine was designed using a method of mining called the room and pillar,in which shafts are driven down into the earth,creating passageways for the movement of coal and personnel.coal is removed,leaving empty areas or rooms.pillars are then formed from the remaining coal and rock,providing structure and support for the rooms and for the surface above the mine during the time the mine is in operation and permanently thereafter.while pillars are usually reinforced with secondary support by installing bolts or timber,because of the passage of time,the exact type of secondary support used in the mine is unknown.as time passes,the surface above a mine sinks or shifts as a result of mine subsidence,which is the deterioration of the pillars,design defects,or geological occurrences.
in order to insure that property owners have the financial resources to repair damage to property caused by mine subsidence,the illinois legislature established the fund to provide reinsurance for mine subsidence losses to illinois property.ilcs.the fund is required to enter into reinsurance agreements with all illinois property insurers,whereby premiums are collected by the insurer and paid to the fund under the agreement.once the insurer receives a claim of potential mine subsidence from the property owner,it forwards the claim to the fund.the fund hires geologists to investigate the claim and eventually determine whether the damage was caused by mine subsidence or other earth movement.if the fund determines that the damage was caused by mine subsidence,it notifies the insurer,who in turn fulfills its contractual duties by paying the insured for the losses claimed,and then requests reinsurance reimbursement from the fund.the fund reimburses the property insurer for the amount it paid to its insured,and the fund is then subrogated to the rights of both the insured and the property insurer.see ilcs b.
in late november,forty years after peabody closed the mine,ambrosia noticed that its warehouse had structural damage.suspecting that the damage was the result of mine subsidence,ambrosia filed a claim with its insurance company,federated mutual,on its insurance policy for mine subsidence loss coverage.federated,in turn,forwarded the claim to the fund.the fund received federated claim and hired geologist stephen danner to investigate.on march,danner concluded that mine subsidence from the mine caused damage to the warehouse on the ambrosia property.federated paid ambrosia the maximum amount of its mine subsidence loss coverage policy then requested reimbursement of that amount from the fund.the fund paid federated the full amount of the claim.
on april,ambrosia filed suit against peabody in illinois state court,claiming that it sustained actual damages that substantially exceeded the amount that it received from federated.the complaint alleged that peabody,as owner and operator of the mine,was negligent in failing to provide adequate support for the surface above the mine,and peabody violated its duty to prevent mine subsidence under the illinois surface coal mining land conservation and reclamation act scmlcra,ilcs.peabody removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.in october,the fund moved to intervene as an additional plaintiff under ilcs,claiming peabody was strictly liable for failing to provide sufficient support for the surface of the ambrosia property,and asserting its subrogation rights to recover the it paid pursuant to its reinsurance agreement with federated in.
peabody moved for summary judgment,asserting in part that plaintiffs sought to hold peabody liable for their acts or omissions that occurred over years ago,and that a coal mine constituted an improvement to real property,thus plaintiffs claims were barred under the illinois construction statute of repose,ilcs b.
plaintiffs also filed a summary judgment motion,claiming that it was undisputed that the warehouse was undermined by peabody during the period it operated the mine to,and because a surface owner had an absolute right to subjacent support,peabody was strictly liable for failing to provide subjacent support under illinois law.plaintiffs also argued that b did not bar their claims because the removal of coal was not construction of an improvement to real property.
on march,the district court granted peabody motion for summary judgment,finding that b barred plaintiffs claims because a coal mine constituted construction of an improvement to real property.accordingly,the district court denied plaintiffs motion for summary judgment as moot.this timely appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
we begin by determining whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of peabody.we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,drawing all inferences in favor of the nonmoving parties.breneisen motorola,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party peabody is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.our task is to determine whether,as a matter of law based on undisputed facts,the illinois statute of repose bars the plaintiffs claims.hausman monarch mach.tool,cir.
the illinois construction statute of repose,entitled management and supervision,provides that 
no action based upon tort,contract or otherwise may be brought against any person for an act or omission of such person in the design,planning,supervision,observation or management of construction,or construction of an improvement to real property after years have elapsed from the time of such act or omission 
ilcs b.application of b involves a analysis whether a coal mine is an improvement to real property,and whether peabody engaged in activities that fall within the ambit of b.garrison gould,cir.
improvement to real property 
whether a coal mine constitutes an improvement under the illinois statute of repose is a question of law,although resolution of the question is grounded in fact.garner kinnear,cir louis rockwell graphic.because we sit in diversity,we apply illinois substantive law.ass benefit,caremark rx,cir.we use a common sense approach,focusing on the ordinary meaning of the statutory language when interpreting the phrase improvement to real property.hilliard lummus,cir.
although illinois courts have not yet addressed the issue of whether a coal mine constitutes an improvement to real property under b,illinois case law provides us with strong guidance.in louis rockwell graphic systems,the illinois supreme court defined improvement as a valuable addition made to property usually real estate or an amelioration in its condition,amounting to more than mere repairs or replacement,costing labor or capital,and intended to enhance its value,beauty,or utility or to adapt it for new or further purposes,at citing black law dictionary ed see also hausman,at discussing improvement to real property as defined in louis.although the louis court held that there was an insufficient factual record to determine whether a printing press was an improvement to real property,it set forth relevant criteria for determining what constitutes an improvement to real property,such as whether the addition was meant to be permanent or temporary,whether it became an integral component of the overall system,whether the value of the property was increased,and whether the use of the property was enhanced,at see also state farm mut.auto.ins.grace,cir morietta reese constr,d.the application of b should focus on the entire construction project and not merely on a single component of the system.garrison,at.
this court and illinois courts have addressed whether various products constitute improvements under in actions involving personal injury.see id.electrical switch installed as part of electrical switching station is an improvement garner,at overhead garage door system was an improvement hausman,at anneal line for metal coils is an improvement herriott allied signal,cir used to transfer coal are improvements hilliard,at screw conveyor is an improvement morietta,at removal and repavement of an existing road is not an improvement billman,d,construction work at a traffic intersection is an improvement.
illinois courts have also addressed what constitutes construction of an improvement to real property under in actions involving damage to real property.see bank of ravenswood city of chicago,d,a subway system is not an improvement zimmer vill.of willowbrook,d,a pond and culvert is an improvement cont l ins.walsh constr.of illinois,d,underground sewer system is an improvement.
in a case involving the same mine we discuss here,a federal district court held that a coal mine is an improvement to real property under illinois law.illinois mine subsidence ins.fund peabody coal,d.there,the fund brought suit as a subrogee of multiple insurance companies federated was not one of those companies,and sought damages from peabody for reinsurance reimbursements it paid for mine subsidence damage claims caused by the mine.in granting peabody motion for summary judgment,the district court found that a room and pillar coal mine was an improvement to real property,and held that the fund claims were barred by b.id.at.
on this appeal,we address plaintiffs arguments that previous case law dictates that any underground activity that benefits the surface property is not an improvement under,and under bank of ravenswood city of chicago,d,a coal mine is not an improvement because it does not have any relation to the use or enjoyment of the real property located above it.
plaintiffs argue that any activity,above or below ground,which involves an addition that benefits the surface property,is an improvement under,and in contrast,any underground activity that does not benefit the surface property is not an improvement and the statute of repose does not apply.we find this argument to be without merit.nothing in the statute of repose indicates that the illinois legislature intended to distinguish between activities and activities in relation to improvements to real property.moreover,plaintiffs interject a new definition of improvement to real or not the underground construction benefits the surface property,one that has no support under illinois law.
plaintiffs reliance on ravenswood is unavailing.in ravenswood,an illinois appellate court analyzed whether the construction of a subway system was an improvement to real property under.using the relevant criteria in louis as a guide,the court focused on whether the construction of the subway system is an integral component of the overall system,and found that a subway system is not an integral part of the function of the residential townhomes and does not enhance the overall value.the court further held that the subway system,unlike a sewer system or construction work on a traffic intersection,does not have any actual relation to the use or enjoyment of the real property located above it,at.plaintiffs therefore argue that while the underground coal mine may have enhanced the ground underneath the mine,it did not benefit the surface property of the mine because the mine has no actual relation to the use or enjoyment of the real property located above it.
peabody argues that plaintiffs reliance on ravenswood is misguided,maintaining that this renegade decision is the only illinois case that suggests that underground construction must relate to the use and enjoyment of the surface property,and that the district court,as well as the court in illinois mine subsidence insurance fund,d at,found that ravenswood offers no authoritative support for the addition of this requirement of relation to the use and enjoyment of the surface property.we tend to ravenswood analysis of an improvement to real property has not been interpreted by any other illinois appellate court,therefore we are inclined to follow the vast majority of other illinois courts interpretations of what constitutes improvement to real property under.
peabody also points to a illinois decision that supports a liberal interpretation of the statute of repose.in continental insurance walsh construction of illinois,defendants excavated the earth to construct a sewer system,which ultimately caused damage to the plaintiffs building above the surface of the construction.in holding that the creation and the construction of a sophisticated sewer distribution system constitutes an improvement to real property under,the court found that the construction was an addition,rather then a repair and replacement,which substantially enhanced the value of the property.d,at.
after a review of illinois law within the context of improvements to real property under,we find that a coal mine is an improvement to real property under b.the mine,particularly the pillars,was intended to be permanent support for the surface above the mine.there is no doubt that a coal mine is a valuable addition to the real property,hiking up the real estate value of the property and awarding the owners of the property with mineral rights.at the time of the construction and operation of the mine,it made the property more valuable than it would have been without a mine underneath it.that the mine is more than a repair or replacement is beyond is an addition to the property which did not previously exist.further,the mine cost labor and capital to construct,and was constructed to adapt the property for a further mining.we therefore find that a coal mine constitutes an improvement to real property for statute of repose purposes.
activities protected by the statute 
our next inquiry is whether peabody falls within the protected class of activities under b.the first clause of the statute places the protected activities in a certain context no action based upon tort may be brought against any person for an act or omission of such a person in the design,planning,supervision,observation,or management of construction.b emphasis added see garrison,at.the concluding phrase,of construction,modifies each of the enumerated activities and not merely the final one.garrison,at.the statute of repose was originally enacted to protect the architect,the engineer,the contractor,anyone who is involved in the planning,supervision,operation or management of construction,or the construction of the improvement to real property,house proceedings,may,at.it was to provide relief for professionals who are trying to exercise their sound judgment in the design and construction of improvements to real property.id.at.
the illinois supreme court invalidated the original version of the statute as special legislation,because it excluded from its protection owners or occupiers of the property on which the building was being built or the improvement was being made.state farm,at citing skinner anderson.the statute was amended by the illinois legislature to eliminate the exclusion,and the revised statute was upheld in people ex.rel.skinner hellmuth,obata kassabaum,where the court found that protects anyone who engages in the enumerated activities,regardless of their status.see also hausman,at under,mere labels are not dispositive.
because the statute was enacted for the express purpose of insulating all participants in the construction process from the onerous task of defending against stale claims,wright bd.of,d,the plain language of b reflects that purpose and bars only those claims regarding construction of an improvement to real property.mba enterprises,northern illinois gas,d.thus,illinois courts have held that for a defendant to benefit from,the legal claims against it must arise out of activity.prate installations,thomas,d,morietta,at.where a defendant is not sued for its act or omission in
