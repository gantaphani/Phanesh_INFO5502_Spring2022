jacqueline gray and windhover,appellants,collectively challenge ordinances enacted by the city of valley park,missouri,city that address illegal alien employment in the context of real estate occupation and leasing.appellants initially filed suit in state court against the city to invalidate the ordinances.the city removed the case to federal court and the parties later filed cross motions for summary judgment.the district court granted judgment in favor of the city,denied appellants motion and dismissed appellants second amended complaint with prejudice.because appellants have standing and we agree with the district court regarding the absence of preclusion,we affirm.
background 
gray is the sole owner of windhover,a corporation that owns rental units in the city.intermittently,windhover hires individuals to work at miscellaneous tasks and perform maintenance on this property.in september,gray and others sued the city in state court seeking to enjoin the enforcement of an ordinance ordinance,later repealed and amended by ordinance,which concerned the same general subject matter as the two ordinances challenged in this action.see reynolds city of valley park,wl the reynolds case.the city removed the reynolds case,but the district court remanded,in part because it held there was no case or controversy under the federal declaratory judgment act.id.at.in february,the city effectively repealed both of the ordinances at issue in the reynolds case and replaced them with ordinance involving the harboring of illegal aliens in rental units and ordinance involving the employment of unauthorized aliens.the reynolds case nonetheless proceeded in state court and on march,after the city repealed the two ordinances upon which the pending action was based,and the plaintiffs declined the opportunity to amend the action to include ordinances and state court permanently enjoined the enforcement of the two,ordinances.the city appealed that order and the missouri court of appeals dismissed the case as moot because the enforcement provisions of the ordinances had been repealed and substituted with new executory and at issue in the instant appeal.reynolds city of valley park.
on march,appellants initiated the instant action in state court,challenging ordinances and.ordinance,however,is the only ordinance now at issue because the city repealed ordinance in july,and the parties stipulated to a voluntary dismissal of appellants related claims.the city removed the case to federal district court.the district court retained the action,holding that the new ordinance imposed immediate obligations on appellants.
generally,ordinance prohibits all business entities in valley park from knowingly employing unauthorized aliens the ordinance sets out a procedure for lodging complaints against potential violators and requires,among other things,that those business entities that apply for a business license sign an affidavit stating that they do not knowingly employ any person who is an unlawful worker.
both parties filed motions for summary judgment with the district court.as a result of these motions,the district court addressed issues of preclusion based upon the effect,if any,of the state court march,injunction concerning ordinances and preemption,or not,by federal immigration law appellants standing to assert an equal protection claim the status of appellants due process claim and whether ordinance violates missouri law.the district court ruled in the city favor,determining that there was no issue preclusion arising from the state court earlier decision regarding ordinances and because ordinance was not identical federal law did not preempt ordinance appellants lacked standing to pursue an equal protection claim ordinance does not violate the due process clause and ordinance does not violate missouri law by exceeding the authority granted a fourth class city.
only two issues are before us today whether the district court lacked jurisdiction over this matter and whether this matter is precluded by the prior missouri state court order.
ii.discussion 
in an unlikely turn of events,appellants now claim that ordinance is not enforceable against them at all and was never enforceable and as a result,the district court had no subject matter the court failure to remand a jurisdictional defect.i f a plaintiff lacks standing,the district court has no subject matter jurisdiction.young america affiliated computer services acs,cir quoting faibisch of,cir alteration in original.appellants current claim,contrary to nearly every pleading filed by appellants since the inception of this case in state court,is that there is no actual or imminent and thus no justiciable case or controversy sufficient to satisfy federal standing requirements.to be sure,this course of argument is unorthodox.it is with restraint that we do not point out the numerous instances,in court pleadings and affidavits made under oath,where appellants claimed imminent harm,injury to property interests and other burdens of enforcement and compliance arising from ordinance.to be fair,at one point appellants did amend their argument in support of summary judgment and sought a declaration that the ordinance did not apply to windhover or gray.that argument,however,was not made in the context of a challenge to standing although a ruling in appellants favor on that issue would have put the issue of standing in play,but was crafted to judicially solidify the interpretation of ordinance as it applied to appellants.but,that argument was merely a needle in the haystack of appellants allegations of imminent harm to themselves and third parties that dominated the proceedings below 
judicial estoppel 
the city argues that because appellants current stance regarding their lack of standing is wholly at odds with the position they took before the district court,appellants should be judicially estopped from proceeding on this theory.the doctrine of judicial estoppel provides that when a party assumes a certain position in a legal proceeding,and succeeds in maintaining that position,he may not thereafter,simply because his interests have changed,assume a contrary position,especially if it be to the prejudice of the party who has acquiesced in the position formerly taken by him.new hampshire maine,d quotation omitted holding that under the doctrine of judicial estoppel,new hampshire was equitably barred from asserting,contrary to its position in prior litigation over the states lobster fishing rights,that the inland piscataqua river boundary ran along the maine shore in re coastal plains,cir taylor food world,cir lowery stovall,cir in re cassidy,cir.this rule generally prevents a party from prevailing in one phase of a case on an argument and then relying on a contradictory argument to prevail in another phase.pegram herdrich,d.the purpose of the doctrine is to protect the integrity of the judicial process by prohibiting parties from deliberately changing positions according to the exigencies of the moment.new hampshire,at.monterey dev.lawyer title ins,cir.
while the circumstances under which judicial estoppel may appropriately be invoked are not reducible to any general formulation,the supreme court has identified several factors that typically inform the decision whether to apply the doctrine in a particular case whether a party later position is clearly inconsistent with its earlier position whether the party has succeeded in persuading a court to accept that party earlier position,so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create the perception that either the first or the second court was misled and whether the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped.new hampshire,at.there is no mechanical test,however,and ultimately,because the rule is intended to prevent improper use of judicial machinery,the discretionary determination to apply the doctrine of judicial estoppel is made on a basis.id.at.stating that judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine invoked by a court at its discretion.
the city contention that we should apply judicial estoppel in this case is not without force.indeed,it would seem at first blush that this is just the sort of case to which judicial estoppel must apply.however,we are sufficiently concerned about applying judicial estoppel under the particular circumstances of this case that we decline to do so in the end,we must have article iii jurisdiction to entertain any claim even though the change in tactics in this case does seem to result in the sort of extreme perversion of the judicial process that normally justifies the use of judicial estoppel.most critically,we have failed to find any precedent,and the city cites to no authority,supporting the application of this doctrine in the face of an alleged jurisdictional default even if the parties wasted judicial resources up to this point and misled the courts on this issue in the process,we may not forge ahead on blind principle without jurisdiction to do so.
jurisdiction 
we recognize that a ny party or the court may,at any time,raise the issue of subject matter jurisdiction.gmac commercial finance llc dillard dep t stores,cir.and,even if neither party had raised the issue below,we are required to address it.renne geary,d discussing justiciability and ripeness for the first time before the supreme court,city of dallas,d.
federal courts are not courts of general jurisdiction they have only the power that is authorized by article iii of the constitution and the statutes enacted by congress pursuant thereto.bender williamsport area sch,d.the limitations imposed by article iii are usually referred to as the case or controversy requirement.schanou lancaster county sch.dist,cir quoting arkansas fcc,cir en banc see also valley forge christian college americans united for separation of church state,d article iii of the constitution limits the judicial power of the united states to the resolution of cases and controversies.this court defines case or controversy to require a definite and concrete controversy involving adverse legal interests at every stage in the litigation.mcfarlin newport special sch,cir.federal courts must always satisfy themselves that this requirement has been met before reaching the merits of a case.courts employ a number of doctrines to determine justiciability such as standing,ripeness,and mootness.schanou,at.
article iii standing represents perhaps the most important of all jurisdictional requirements,at.this doctrine requires federal courts to satisfy themselves that the plaintiff has alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to warrant her invocation of jurisdiction.summers earth island,d internal quotations and emphasis omitted.in the normal course,the plaintiff has the responsibility clearly to allege facts demonstrating that she is a proper party to invoke judicial resolution of the dispute and the exercise of the court remedial powers.warth seldin,d.this assures the existence of that measure of concrete adverseness necessary to sharpen the presentation of issues necessary for the proper resolution of the constitutional questions.city of los angeles lyons,d.
this particular case is interesting because it is not the normal course of events for the parties originally initiating the action to challenge their own standing on appeal by claiming the very law they challenge is not enforceable against them in the normal course of events,a simple dismissal would logically cure the current ailment.here,however,it is appellants desire to pursue their claims in missouri state court,where they started,and thus appellants seek to shed themselves of this federal forum and all of its ramifications it is customary that the court must accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and draw all inferences in the plaintiff favor when making a determination on standing.young america,at.given the unique posture of this case,the nature of appellants allegations on appeal are different from those alleged in their complaint.were we to look only to appellants complaint a pleading that was never amended to reflect the current discussion there would be no controversy regarding appellants standing because it would surely exist.as the case stands today,we review appellants complaint,along with ordinance,all pleadings in this matter,and the parties arguments on appeal in making our jurisdictional decision.warth,at.
to satisfy article iii standing requirement,there must be injury in fact or the threat of injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical the injury must be fairly traceable to defendant challenged action and it must be likely as opposed to merely speculative that a favorable judicial decision will prevent or redress the injury.summers.at friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d.the standing requirement assures that there is a real need to exercise the power of judicial review in order to protect the interests of the complaining party.summers.at quoting schlesinger reservists comm.to stop the war,d.to determine whether a challenge such as this is justiciable requires us to take these factors into consideration on a basis.regional rail reorganization act cases,d.
appellants now claim that ordinance is not enforceable against them because appellants only hire independent contractors,appellants have no business permit to lose in the event of,and any potential injuries,assuming ordinance applied to appellants,are not imminent and are speculative.
focusing properly and sequentially on the three requisites for standing,we find injury in fact traceable to ordinance that could be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.all parties acknowledge that appellants have not yet been subjected to enforcement under ordinance.facial challenges may be brought,however,in certain circumstances.plaintiffs have standing to challenge the facial validity of a regulation notwithstanding the nature of a lawsuit,where the impact of the regulation is direct and immediate and they allege an actual,fear that the law will be enforced against them.lake carriers ass macmullan,d abbott labs.gardner,d,abrogated on other grounds by califano sanders,d krantz city of fort smith,cir.only recently have appellants changed their tune to claim they no longer fear enforcement of ordinance.even so,the city argues that ordinance is enforceable against appellants and will be enforced against appellants and,given the unique posture of this case,we take that claim into consideration when deciding appellants stake in this litigation.see int l ass of firefighters city of ferguson,cir concluding that the threatened conduct against the claimant husband should she violate the challenged charter provision was sufficient to present a case or controversy krantz,at assuming for the purposes of standing that the city would enforce violations of the law in question because the city vigorously defended the ordinance and never suggested that it would refrain from enforcement.
now,turning to appellants specific claims as to why is not enforceable,we easily dispose of the first.appellants do hire individuals or contractors from time to time to perform maintenance on the rental units and are likely to do so in the future as such,we need neither speculate nor merely attempt to anticipate whether appellants will fall within the purview of ordinance in that respect.littleton,d.
second,appellants are clearly contemplated by the ordinance at issue as a business entity.that appellants do not maintain a business license is immaterial.the definition casts a wide net.business entity means any person or group of persons performing or engaging in any activity,enterprise,profession,or occupation for gain,benefit,advantage,or livelihood,whether for profit or not for profit.ordinance.the term business entity shall include,but not be limited to,individuals,partnerships,corporations,contractors,and subcontractors.id.at.section further states that t he term business entity shall include any business entity that possesses a business license,any business entity that is exempt by law from obtaining such a business license,and any b
