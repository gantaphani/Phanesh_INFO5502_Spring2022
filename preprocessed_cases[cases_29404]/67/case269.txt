colleen and john austin appeal from judge telesca dismissal of their complaint pursuant to fed.civ.b.the complaint asserted claims under the fair housing act fha,title viii of the civil rights act of,as amended,et,against the town of farmington.the complaint alleged that appellants obtained limited variances from a land use regulation prohibiting accessory structures on the lot of their newly purchased home the variances allowed appellants to install a fence,pool,and deck designed to accommodate the needs of appellants disabled son the town board resolutions allowing the variances required removal of the structures when,inter alia,the disabled child residency in the house terminated.we shall refer to these limitations as the restoration provisions.the reasonableness under the act of the requirement that the restrictions be restored after the child residency ended is at the heart of the present dispute.appellants also claim that the restoration provisions constituted illegal retaliation for their asserting fha claims.see.
the district court determined that it did not need to reach the issue of whether the restoration provisions were reasonable under the fha because appellants complaint did not allege facts sufficient to show either an intent to discriminate or to constitute disparate impact discrimination.because we conclude that the reasonableness of the town accommodations is in issue,but a valid claim for retaliation has not been alleged,we affirm in part and vacate in part.
background 
in reviewing a district court fed.civ.b dismissal of a complaint,we of course accept all factual allegations as true,and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.see chambers time warner,cir.
the complaint alleges that,in,colleen and john austin decided to move from north carolina to new york,with their two sons.their older son,cole,has multiple serious disabilities as a result of being born prematurely,including cerebral palsy and global developmental delays.he is and visually impaired.
appellants sought to move to an area with good public schools and chose the town of farmington.appellants became interested in a home in the town auburn meadows development.appellants wanted to install a fence in order to keep their son safely within their yard and to build an pool because of the benefits aquatic therapy affords to children with cerebral palsy.
before purchasing the home,appellants learned that there was a town ordinance restricting patio lots,like that of the house in question,in the subdivision.the restriction in question was passed as part of the rezoning and authorization necessary to the auburn meadows development.the authorization contained numerous provisions relating to open space,trails.the provision at issue here prohibited accessory structures,such as pools and fences,within the patio home portion of the site but allowed such structures on other larger lots within the rear yard portion of the site provided that such rear yards are screened from adjacent public.appellants lot was subject to the full prohibition.
upon learning of the restriction on the property,colleen austin called the farmington town building department to seek a variance.the code enforcement officer told her that appellants would have to request such a variance from the town board.appellants bought the home confident that they would be able to secure the necessary permission.
in june,after negotiations with appellants,the town board passed a resolution entitled granting a temporary accommodation to install a fence and an swimming pool to the owners of lillybrook court in the auburn meadows subdivision however,the resolution also stated that the fence and swimming pool must be wholly removed from the property within days of the disabled child ceasing to live on the property,of appellants ceasing to own the property whether by conveyance,death or any other reason,or of anyone being added as an additional owner of the property.the resolution further stated that the fence and pool were to be removed at the expense of the austin sic or of the new owners of the property.the resolution stated that appellants had the right to bring a legal challenge to the restoration provisions.
during the summer of,appellants installed the fence and pool.after the town granted appellants request for a second variance,they added a deck to the pool.the second resolution contained the same restoration provision.the total cost for installing the fence,pool,and deck,as well as accompanying landscaping work,was over.appellants have been quoted a price of to remove the fence,pool,and deck and repair the damage to the yard.
on june,appellants filed the present action challenging the restoration provisions and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against their enforcement.appellants alleged two claims based on the fha i discrimination by the town denial of a reasonable modification pursuant to section f a,and ii retaliation by the town for asserting their rights under federal law in violation of section.
on june,the district court dismissed appellants complaint pursuant to the town fed.civ.b motion.the court concluded that there were simply no facts alleged that evince a discriminatory intent in requiring that plaintiffs restore their property to its original condition once the need for the modifications is no longer present.austin town of farmington,supp.further,the court held that p laintiffs fail ed to support,beyond their conclusory assertions,that requiring them to bear the cost of removal of the fence and pool is in some way based upon their son disability when the initial grant of a variance to build the pool along with a fence was granted knowing that plaintiffs son was disabled.finally,the court stated that plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged a violation of the fha under the analysis here,there has been no showing that the restoration requirement does not apply to individuals.
discussion 
as noted,we review de novo a district court dismissal of a complaint pursuant to rule b.see chambers,at.to survive dismissal,a complaint must plead enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.bell atl.twombly.
in,congress amended the fair housing act of to extend its coverage to housing discrimination based on an individual disability.
section f provides 
for purposes of this subsection,discrimination includes 
a a refusal to permit,at the expense of the handicapped person,reasonable modifications of existing premises occupied or to be occupied by such person if such modifications may be necessary to afford such person full enjoyment of the premises except that,in the case of a rental,the landlord may where it is reasonable to do so condition permission for a modification on the renter agreeing to restore the interior of the premises to the condition that existed before the modification,reasonable wear and tear excepted.
b a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules,policies,practices,or services,when such accommodations may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling or 
f.neither subsection a nor subsection b requires that the denial of modifications or accommodations be the result of a discriminatory animus toward the disabled.both require only that the requested modification or accommodation be reasonable and that the denial s result,in the case of section f a,in diminishing the disabled person full enjoyment of the premises or,in the case of section f b,in so diminishing that person use and enjoyment of the premises as to constitute a denial of equal opportunity.
the town does not challenge the applicability of the fha to the ordinance prohibiting accessory structures on patio lots in the auburn meadows development.indeed,the house report accompanying the amendments to the fha specifically stated that the act was intended to prohibit the application of special requirements through regulations,restrictive covenants,and conditional or special use permits that have the effect of limiting the ability of such individuals disabled persons to live in the residence of their choice in the community,at,reprinted in,see,city
