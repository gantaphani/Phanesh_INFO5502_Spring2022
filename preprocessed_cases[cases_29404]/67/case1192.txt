for almost forty years,a monument inscribed with the ten commandments the monument has occupied a spot in cameron park,a public park in the city of la crosse,wisconsin la crosse or the city.recently,certain residents of la crosse,joined by an advocacy group,sued the city claiming the monument violated the establishment clause of the first amendment.in response,la crosse sold a portion of the park and the monument to the order of eagles,the service organization that had originally donated the monument to the city.the district court held that this sale violated the establishment clause.we reverse.
in the fall of,the local chapter or aerie of the fraternal order of eagles the eagles requested the permission of the city to install in cameron park cameron park or the park a granite monument bearing an inscription of the ten commandments and adorned with certain religious and other symbols associated with this country an eagle grasping the american flag in its talons and the eye most often associated with the one dollar bill the la crosse park board considered the proposal at its september,meeting and,on october,gave the eagles permission to erect the monument in the park.
the installation ceremony was scheduled to coincide with the eagles annual convention to take place in la crosse in june.the particular location of the monument within the park was left to the determination of the city director of parks and recreation.
cameron park occupies one and acres in downtown la crosse.the park is classified by the city as a neighborhood park.according to the city park and recreation plan,the purpose of a neighborhood park is to provide an attractive neighborhood setting and a place to be used primarily for recreation for people of all ages.la crosse owns more than acres of land designated as parkland.of that parkland,acres are designated as neighborhood parks.
the park,rectangular in shape,is bordered on three sides by sidewalks and public streets,and on one side by private property.a map of the park shows that it is intersected by walkways and dotted with trees.the park is surrounded by commercial property,including a bank and a restaurant.there are no governmental buildings within sight of the park,and it is not necessary to walk through or past the park to enter into any governmental buildings.
the parks and recreation director chose a location for the monument very near the northeastern corner of the park.the monument is placed seventeen feet south from a sidewalk bordering the park and sixty feet west from another sidewalk bordering the park although there is a walkway through the park and near the monument,it runs behind the face of the monument,and a visitor walking along the walkway would not see the inscription.the monument does not occupy a particularly privileged location in the aesthetic scheme of the park.the attention of visitors to the park is not drawn to the monument by it being displayed in a particularly prominent location or setting such as,for instance,on a hill overlooking the surrounding landscape or at the center of the park with walkways leading the visitor to the monument.the location of the monument near the corner of the park was not,however,accidental.the monument is,and has been since its construction,directly across from the eagle la crosse headquarters and the monument inscription faces the headquarters 
in april,after the approval of the monument but before its installation,la crosse suffered severe flooding from the mississippi river.several hundred students from the area,and as far away as milwaukee,volunteered to help with efforts,particularly the filling of more than sandbags.the students efforts were recounted in a special flood edition of the local newspaper.
two months later,on june,the monument was dedicated.participants in the dedication ceremony included alvin watson,a past president of the la crosse aerie,a minister of the local lutheran church,a state judge,and the president of the park board.in his remarks dedicating the monument,watson paid tribute to the youth who helped fight the flood in april.the local paper reported the next day that the monument was dedicated especially to those young people who helped during this spring flood.
for the next twenty years the monument generated little if any controversy.during that time and through today,the eagles assumed full responsibility for the preservation and maintenance of the monument.members of the eagles have planted and watered a small flower bed surrounding the monument.further,the monument has been illuminated at night by a light attached to the roof of the eagles building.the city has expended no funds in maintaining the monument.
in,phyllis grams,a resident of la crosse,joined by the coordinating appellee in this case,the freedom from religion foundation,the foundation,wrote a letter to the la crosse common council,asking that the monument be removed from the park.the council denied the request,and grams and the foundation filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the western district of wisconsin,contending that the location of the monument in the park violated the establishment clause of the first amendment to the constitution.this case was eventually dismissed in for lack of standing.freedom from religion foundation,zielke,aff cir.
more than a decade later,in june,the foundation again asked the city to remove the monument from the park.the city council again refused.in september,the secretary for the la crosse aerie wrote to the city attorney and offered to take back the monument and display it in a location visible to the public.the city declined the offer.in march,a local episcopal church also offered to move the monument to another location.the city again declined the offer.finally,the foundation also offered to move the monument to another location.again,the city declined the offer.in april,the city council addressed the monument controversy and passed a resolution.the resolution noted that there was a threat of a renewed lawsuit by the foundation,the monument was given to the city to honor the effort of area youth,the council believed the monument did not violate the constitution,the monument deserved to remain in its current location,and the council would take the necessary steps to keep the monument in its current location.
by june,the city reached what it saw as a solution and decided to sell the monument to the eagles along with a by parcel of land under and surrounding the monument.on june,the la crosse parks commission recommended the sale of this parcel.
on july,the foundation,joined by two fictitiously named plaintiffs,filed a suit against the city challenging the display of the monument in the park.the district court later denied the individual plaintiffs motion to proceed anonymously.on august,twenty additional individuals were named as plaintiffs.each of the individual plaintiffs asserted essentially the same facts.they are all residents of la crosse and claim that they avoid the park because of the presence of the monument,or that they are emotionally disturbed or distressed when they travel to one of the commercial businesses surrounding the park because of the presence of monument.
ten days after the foundation filed its suit,on july,the city council adopted,by a vote,a resolution authorizing the sale of the parcel directing the city assessor to determine the fair market value of the parcel and authorizing the mayor and city clerk to execute any necessary deeds to effectuate the sale of the parcel.the resolution also noted that the monument had been dedicated to the flood fighters.the resolution cited as authority for the sale of the parcel wisconsin statute.this statute grants a city council the power,in conjunction with a city board of park commissioners,to sell park land when that land is no longer needed for park purposes in the resolution,the la crosse city council stated that the parcel at issue was no longer needed for park purposes.
the sale to the eagles took place on august.as indicated above,the plot of land sold to the eagles was roughly a by area of the park square feet where the monument was located.this plot is bordered on three sides by the park and on one side by a sidewalk.the city assessor had previously determined that the fair market value of the parcel at issue was or per square foot.the eagles paid this amount.the quitclaim deed recording the transfer provided that appropriate fencing,landscaping and signage shall be provided by and maintained in order to commemorate the youth of the la crosse area for their assistance and great help for the spring,flood that the city of la crosse experienced.
in october,the eagles erected a steel fence around the parcel.temporary signs were later added which read this is the property of the la crosse eagles aerie.in march,these temporary signs were replaced with permanent signs on all four sides of the fence stating,
this is the property of 
la crosse eaglesaerie to the volunteers whohelped save the city of la crosseduring the flood.
below this wording is a picture of volunteers filling sandbags during the flood.
one month later,the city of la crosse erected a second fence,this one and,like the first fence,four feet high,almost immediately outside the fence erected by the eagles.on the north and south sides of this fence are metal signs.on these signs in high black letters is the statement private park.beneath this statement,in black letters,are the words this property is not owned or maintained by the city of la crosse,nor does the city endorse the religious expression thereon.
the foundation and the individual plaintiffs collectively,the appellees were not appeased,however.the appellees amended their complaint after the sale of the plot,and again after the fences were constructed.the appellees continued to assert that the presence of the monument in the park,despite the sale,violated the establishment clause.
the district court agreed and in july,granted summary judgment in favor of the appellees.mercier city of la crosse,d.the district court held that the city display of the monument before the sale to the eagles violated the establishment clause,id.at,and that the sale of the monument to the eagles did not terminate the violation,id.at.the district court also held that the appropriate remedy for the violation was the return of the plot of land to the city and the removal of the monument from the park.id.at.
shortly after formal judgment was entered in favor of the appellees,however,the eagles,who had not been a party to the suit,moved to intervene and,at the same time,moved the district court to alter,amend,or grant relief from,its judgment under federal rules of civil procedure e and b.the district court agreed with the eagles that it should have been a party to the suit,granted the motion to intervene,vacated its judgment,and permitted the eagles to conduct limited discovery.
at the close of its discovery,the eagles moved for summary judgment.on february,the district court denied the eagles motion and,sua sponte,granted summary judgment in favor of the appellees.mercier city of la crosse,d.in granting summary judgment to the appellees,the district court again held that the display of the monument at the park prior to the sale constituted a violation of the establishment clause.id.at.the district court also held that the sale of the plot was,itself,regardless of what happened to the monument after the plot was sold,an independent violation of the establishment clause.id.at.as in its earlier decision,the district court concluded that the only remedy available was the invalidation of the sale of the plot and the removal of the monument from the park.id.at.this appeal followed.
on appeal,the city and the eagles challenge the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the appellees our review is de novo.mcpherson city of waukegan,cir.a party is entitled to summary judgment in its favor when there is no genuine issue of material fact and that he or she is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c celotex catrett,d.the parties agree that there are no material facts in dispute.the only question,therefore,is whether the appellees are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
the first amendment to the united states constitution provides,in pertinent part,that congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion const.amend.i,cl.this provision,the establishment clause,is made applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment.everson bd.of educ.of the township of ewing.
in recent years,this court has considered in various contexts whether the government use or display of religious imagery violates the establishment clause.see.civil liberties union,cir books city of elkhart,cir gonzales north township,cir harris city of zion,lake,cir american jewish congress city of chicago,cir.that is not precisely what we are asked to resolve here.we are not concerned with whether the installation and presence of the monument on public land a municipally owned park from to violated the establishment clause.although the district court reached such a conclusion in its order and opinion granting summary judgment in favor of the appellees,neither the eagles nor the city challenge that holding in this court.
we need not,therefore,decide whether the display of the ten commandments in a neighborhood park violated the establishment clause we will assume,however,the district court was correct in order to reach the issue that is before this court whether the sale by the city to the eagles of the plot of land underneath and surrounding the monument was an independent violation of the establishment clause.
in support of their position that the sale of the monument and land to the eagles was constitutionally permissible,the eagles and the city rely extensively on this court decision in freedom from religion,city of marshfield,cir.the appellees argue in response that marshfield is not controlling.we turn to marshfield itself to resolve this disagreement.
marshfield 
in,the local chapter of the knights of columbus,a roman catholic laymen organization,donated to the city of marshfield,wisconsin,a statue of jesus christ.id.at.the city accepted the gift and placed the statue on land owned by the city.id.the statue was and is fifteen feet in height and depicts christ,arms open in prayer,standing atop a large sphere,which in turn rests atop a base bearing the inscription in block letters christ guide us on our way.id.the statue overlooks the main thoroughfare into marshfield from the south,and is clearly visible to travelers from the road.id.a few years after the statue was installed,a member of the knights of columbus agreed to help marshfield construct signs,picnic tables,and outdoor grills at the site,and the city agreed to designate the property as a city park.id.the city also provided the site with electricity.id.
nearly forty years after the statue was installed,the foundation requested that the city remove the statue.id.when the city refused,the foundation,joined by a local resident,sued the city claiming the presence of the statue in a park violated the establishment clause.id.shortly after the suit was filed,a group of marshfield residents referred to in marshfield as the fund purchased from the city the land underneath and surrounding the statue.id.at.the city separated out the electrical service required for lighting the statue from the cost of lighting the rest of the park,and the cost of lighting the statue is paid by the fund.the city also placed a disclaimer near the statue stating that the location of the statue did not constitute an endorsement of religion.
on appeal in marshfield,the plaintiffs argued that the sale was a sham and,as such,the sale itself constitute d an endorsement of religion by the city.id.at.the plaintiffs also argued that the sale did not end the government endorsement of religion,because the continued presence of the statue in proximity to a public park may still reasonably be perceived as the city endorsement of religion.id.at.
considering whether the sale of the statue was proper,this court noted that a bsent unusual circumstances,a sale of real property is an effective way for a public body to end its inappropriate endorsement of religion.id.at.we cautioned,however,that given the risk of manipulation in a formalistic standard,a court must look to the substance of the transaction as well as its form to determine whether government action endorsing religion has actually ceased.id.this court held that the sale of the statue by the city of marshfield was proper because the city performed the necessary formalities to transfer ownership of the parcel,sold the parcel for a fair price,and the fund assumed the traditional duties of ownership.id.at.
this court also held,however,that despite the formal sale of the property,the proximity of the statue to city property and the lack of visual definition between city and fund property creates a perception of improper endorsement of religion by the city and constitutes a violation of the establishment clause.id.at.this court noted that the parcel of land sold by marshfield was not physically differentiated from the surrounding public park,and no visual boundaries currently exist that would inform the reasonable but unknowledgeable observer that the fund property should be distinguished from the public park.id.at.this court also noted that the statue positioning and orientation combine with the other physical features to convey the impression that the statue is on city park property.id.at.
on remand,this court instructed the district court,together with the parties,to develop some way to differentiate between property owned by the fund and property owned by the city.id.at.the remedy reached by the district court on remand is,not coincidentally,similar to the steps taken by la crosse after its sale of the parcel at issue in this case the district court ordered the installation,on marshfield property,of a fence.freedom from religion,city of marshfield,wl,at.may.attached to the fence,the district court ordered the installation of two signs,each reading,
private park 
this property is not owned or maintained by the city of marshfield,nor does the city endorse the religious expressions thereon.
id.the district court ordered that t he text private park will be in ten inch block letters while the subsequent text will be in four inch block letters.id.recall that the fencing and signs installed by la crosse is identical even to the point of having the lettering to that ordered by the district court in marshfield.
b.the present case 
as noted above,the parties and the district court dispute the significance of marshfield.the eagles and the city argue that marshfield compels judgment in their favor.quoting this court statement in marshfield that a bsent unusual circumstances,a sale of real property is an effective way for a public body to end its inappropriate endorsement of religion,id.at,the eagles and the city argue that there are no unusual circumstances to call into question the sale.
conversely,the appellees argue that marshfield is not controlling because that case considered only whether the city remained excessively entangled with the private owner because a restrictive covenant required that the private owner maintain the property as a park.marshfield did not address,according to the appellees and the district court,whether the sale itself,particularly in light of competing offers to relocate the monument to private property,demonstrated a preference for,and therefore an endorsement of,religion by the city.they claim this selective sale constituted an independent violation of the establishment clause.
the appellees,however,misread marshfield.marshfield considered not just whether the restrictive covenant was constitutional,but also whether the sale itself was a sham and constituted an endorsement of religion by the city,as well as whether the city continued to violate the establishment clause after selling the property to a private party.marshfield,at.marshfield concluded that the sale was proper and not an unconstitutional endorsement of religion.id.at.
as noted above,the appellees attempt to discount marshfield by claiming the case concerned only whether the sale inextricably entangled the city with the private owners and thus the statue because a restrictive covenant required the private owner to maintain the property as a park.it is true that in marshfield the court concluded that the restrictive covenant did not improperly entangle the city,but this court went further,holding that the sale itself did not constitute an unconstitutional endorsement of religion.id.at.this court also held that our independent review of the facts here leads us to conclude that this sale validly extinguished any governmental endorsement of religion.id.at.we also stated that a bsent unusual circumstances,a sale of real property is an effective way for a public body to end its inappropriate endorsement of religion.id.at.thus,although marshfield focused on the original placement of the statue and whether the sale rectified the establishment clause violation,that case also made clear that the sale of the parcel was permissible under the establishment clause.
in the present case,la crosse executed just such a sale.on the assumption that the monument placement in a public park constituted a constitutional violation,in line with marshfield,the sale would appear to have ended la crosse endorsement of religion.but the district court held,and the appellees now argue,that even if that sale ended the existing violation,the reasons for the sale caused the city to commit a second violation.the city council knew that it was faced with a lawsuit seeking the removal of the monument on the theory that the location of the monument violated the establishment clause.although it had three separate offers from the eagles,a church,and the foundation to move the monument to a different location,the council instead chose to sell the monument site to the eagles.although the city no longer owned the parcel,the appellees claim that because the council members knew that the sale would keep the monument in its challenged location,the sale itself favored the religious purpose of the monument,and thus that act was unconstitutional.
to begin with,the appellees have no legal precedent for this assertion.the desire to keep the monument in place can not automatically be labeled a constitutional violation.removal is always an option,but as marshfield holds,it is not a necessary solution to a first amendment challenge.the court in marshfield approved the sale when removal was obviously an option,so the appellees complaint that the city of la crosse exercised the wrong option is contrary to the holding in marshfield.
in short,marshfield authorized an alternative to sale that did not involve unusual circumstances.this does not mean,as the appellees suggest,that if the la crosse sale is valid,every sale of public space where a religious display is located would be permissible.the supreme court,and this court,have emphasized the nature of a court review of an alleged establishment clause violation.see,santa fe independent school dist.doe,d quoting lynch donnelly,d,concurring every government practice must be judged in its unique circumstances books,at.the same holds true for efforts to end a violation.simply because we find in this case that the sale by the city of la crosse did not violate the establishment clause does not mean,as marshfield made clear,that every such sale would be permissible.here,we are focused upon the sale of the property in response to litigation undertaken to remove a monument that has stood undisturbed on governmental property for forty years.we are not endorsing a initiative designed to sell off patches of government land to various religious denominations as a means of circumventing the establishment clause.we therefore reject the idea that the sale was a violation of the establishment clause simply because the city had other options.
the sale,however,must still satisfy the requirements of marshfield,namely,there must be no unusual circumstances surrounding the sale of the parcel of land so as to indicate an endorsement of religion.marshfield highlighted some of the typical sort of improprieties that might cause us to disregard a transaction.id.at.such improprieties would include a sale th
