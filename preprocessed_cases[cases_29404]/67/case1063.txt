for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court dismissal of the claims against the employees of the twra sued in their individual capacities under the doctrine of qualified immunity,but reverse the district court holdings that the claims against the defendants sued in their official capacities were barred under eleventh amendment sovereign immunity,and that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the had constitutionally protected property interests in reelfoot lake or its submerged lands.accordingly,we remand to the district court for further proceedings.
background 
jamie and bonnie hamilton hamiltons own real property in obion county,tennessee that extends to the ordinary low water mark of reelfoot lake.on their real property,the hamiltons own and operate hamilton resort,which features a motel and areas for tent camping and trailer parking.the resort is primarily frequented by hunters and fishermen.by virtue of a doherty land grant the hamiltons also claim to own a portion of the reelfoot lake bed that adjoins their real property.nearly years before the present litigation,jamie hamilton placed a light pole in the lake bed of reelfoot lake approximately yards from the shore of his real property.claiming doherty riparian rights at the pole location,the hamiltons contend that the pole is outside the wildlife management area administered by the twra.the pole stood in four feet of water and was frequently used by the hamiltons as a site to fish,hunt,and moor boats.jamie hamilton moored a boat to the light pole on november,and,after leaving the boat,returned later that day to discover that it had been removed from the lake.
november,was the first day of the duck hunting season at reelfoot lake.on that day,twra enforcement officers were instructed to search the lake for illegal and unregistered blinds,including riparian blind sites.after the official end of the day hunt,and about thirty minutes before sundown,twra officers observed a duck blind in the water at least yards from the shore of the hamiltons property.upon closer inspection,they discovered that the blind was attached to a boat and was camouflaged.the boat,which was made of aluminum,measured fourteen to sixteen feet in length,had no motor,was moored to the hamiltons light pole,and was surrounded by duck decoys.additionally,officers observed that there were shot gun shells on the floor of the blind and that,while the blind had a bright sign stating that it was a riparian duck blind,no twra registration number was displayed on the blind.the officers did not look for a registration number on the boat.
the officers determined that the blind was located within waters administered by twra and that the location of the blind was not a registered permanent or draw blind site,and therefore,that the blind was illegal.the hamiltons did not have a permanent registered or draw blind site on reelfoot lake on november.a few hours after the blind was discovered,twra officers received orders from the twra regional office to remove the items found at the pole from the lake.without notice,consent,or a warrant,they removed the boat,floating blind,and decoys from the lake and transported them to a reelfoot wildlife management area facility.
after the boat was removed from the water,officers discovered that it had registration numbers on it,and that it was registered to the hamiltons.upon discovering that his boat,blind,and decoys were missing,jamie hamilton demanded their immediate return or a citation.the twra would not return the boat to hamilton,however,until after it conducted further investigation.hamilton was never cited for any violation and,after ten days,the items seized were returned to him.
on november,the hamiltons filed the present action pursuant to in the western district of tennessee.on january,all parties agreed to stay federal proceedings pending resolution of a related action in tennessee state court.the hamiltons state action alleged the same basic facts and causes of action as their federal suit,but also named the twra and twrc as defendants.a tennessee circuit court granted the motion to dismiss,but a tennessee appeals court held that the action against the individual officers should not be dismissed.see hamilton cook,wl.on april,the hamiltons motion to voluntarily dismiss their remaining claims against the individual officers was granted by a state court.thus,the stay of their federal action was lifted on july,and the hamiltons filed an amended complaint.
the hamiltons contend that the november,removal of their boat,blind,and decoys constituted an illegal search and seizure and a denial of due process under the fourth,fifth,and fourteenth amendments.they seek monetary,declaratory,and injunctive relief.specifically,they seek a declaratory judgment against twra employees defendants sued in their individual capacities in the amount of compensatory and punitive damages b declaratory judgment that enforcement of the twra permit program violated their constitutional and civil rights,and that the be enjoined from enforcing the permit program against them c declaratory judgment that the use of their doherty portion of the lake by created a nuisance and,thus,that the be enjoined from permitting such use and d declaratory judgment that plaintiffs have riparian fishing,hunting,travel,and the ability to construct a pier or dock on the lake that defendants be enjoined from interfering with any attempt by plaintiffs to extend their dock.
on april,the moved the district court for summary judgment.on january,the district court granted the motion for summary judgment on the following grounds the claims against defendants sued in their official capacities were barred under the eleventh amendment alternatively,the hamiltons could not establish a constitutionally protected property interest in reelfoot lake or the land thereunder and the defendants sued in their individual capacities were entitled to qualified immunity.the hamiltons appeal the district court grant of the motion for summary judgment.

standard of review.
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see hartleip mcneilab,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show there is not a genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.fed civ.c.the party may not rely on his pleadings alone,but must demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue for trial by pointing to specific facts that create such an issue.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.in making this determination,a judge may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence.see anderson liberty lobby,d.
eleventh amendment sovereign immunity.
the district court granted summary judgment to the stating that the hamiltons claims were barred by eleventh amendment sovereign immunity because they were in the nature of a quiet title action implicating special sovereignty interests.specifically,the district court held that the supreme court decision in idaho coeur tribe of idaho,d mandated dismissal of the hamiltons claims because,according to the district court,the hamiltons sought relief that would,in effect,invalidate the authority of state agencies to regulate and administer reelfoot lake.the court held that the importance of state regulatory control over,and public ownership of,reelfoot lake militated against the hamiltons claims because the relief they requested intruded too far onto the sovereignty of the state of tennessee.
in coeur,the supreme court held that the coeur indian tribe tribe suit against the state of idaho,various state agencies,and numerous state officials in their official capacities,was barred by the eleventh amendment because it amounted to the functional equivalent of a quiet title action which implicates special sovereignty interests.id.at.the tribe,a federally recognized sovereign nation,claimed ownership of the submerged lands and bed of lake coeur,along with the navigable rivers and streams forming part of its water system,and sought a declaratory judgment to establish its entitlement to the exclusive use and occupancy and the right to quiet enjoyment of the submerged lands as well as a declaration of the invalidity of all idaho statutes,ordinances,regulations,customs,or usages which purport to regulate,authorize,use,or affect in any way the submerged lands.id.at.the tribe also sought a preliminary and permanent injunction prohibiting defendants from regulating,permitting,or taking any action in violation of the tribe rights of exclusive use and occupancy,quiet enjoyment,and other ownership interest in the submerged lands along with an award for costs and attorney fees and such other relief as the court deemed appropriate.id.
the court was troubled because the declaratory and injunctive relief sought by the tribe was and invasive,and characterized the tribe claims as the functional equivalent of quiet title in that substantially all benefits of ownership and control would shift from the state to the tribe should the tribe prevail.id.at.the court held that under these particular and special circumstances the ex parte young exception to eleventh amendment sovereign immunity,which generally permits suits in federal court against state officials sued in their official capacities seeking prospective equitable relief for continuing violations of federal law,did not apply.id.at.this case is distinguishable from coeur because the hamiltons claims do not rise to the level of a functional equivalent of a quiet title action implicating special sovereignty interests.
the hamiltons contend that the removal of their boat,blind,and decoys constituted an illegal search and seizure and a denial of due process under the fourth,fifth,and fourteenth amendments,and seek,in essence,prospective equitable relief in the form of a declaratory judgment as to the existence of their alleged constitutionally protected riparian rights,and an injunction preventing the state from continuing to violate their constitutionally protected riparian rights.the hamiltons also seek in compensatory damages and in punitive damages against twra employees sued in their individual capacities.the district court dismissal of these claims should be affirmed under the doctrine of qualified immunity as discussed infra at ii d.in the hamiltons remaining claims they seek a judicial declaration of,and an injunction protecting,their alleged exclusive riparian rights over doherty land grants submerged under reelfoot lake,the existence of such rights having already been affirmatively established by the supreme court of tennessee.see state ex rel.cates west tennessee land.the question to be decided in this case is whether the hamiltons themselves are entitled to enjoy and enforce these rights.
as alluded to supra at note,in,the supreme court of tennessee delineated the respective rights of the public and private individuals in the ownership and use of the waters of reelfoot lake and the land thereunder.see state ex rel.cates,at.the court held that reelfoot lake was a navigable stream in the technical sense,meaning that the rights of the public attach to it,to its use,and to its fisheries,so that it is incapable of private ownership,and the state owns it in public trust for all the people,and can not alienate it away.id.at.with that said,however,the court continued its discussion as follows 
does the fact that the doherty grants were submerged by the lake after they were granted,and are now the bed of a navigable stream,deprive the owners of the submerged land of their title to the lands and their right to claim the fisheries in the waters lying over them upon this particular question,we have not been cited to any authority directly in point,and we have found none.it would seem,on principle,that the title to the land would be unaffected by the formation of the lake,and its owners would be entitled to its use and its enjoyment as long as they can reasonably identify it and fix its boundaries.it is proven in this case that the doherty grants can still be identified,and their boundaries are reasonably well established.the waters of the lake are clear,and many of the monuments of boundary can still be identified.grants,and are not totally submerged,and portions of them are still upland and form parts of the shore of the lake.grant is entirely submerged but its boundaries are located,and it is platted on the map.as these lands were grantable by north carolina,and were subject to private ownership before the formation of the lake,we are of opinion that the mere fact that they have since become submerged by a body of navigable water does not deprive the owners of their title to the land as long as they can be reasonably identified.upon all of the authorities,this title and ownership will carry with it the exclusive right of fishery in the waters over these grants.
id.in light of this discussion,the court concluded that the state of tennessee was entitled to a decree establishing its title in trust for all the people to all that portion of the lake,its fisheries and fowling privileges,lying outside of,and not over and above,the grants issued by the state of north carolina to doherty.id.at emphasis added.
it is evident that the hamiltons are claiming entitlement to riparian rights already determined by the highest court of the state of tennessee to be valid property rights incident to the ownership of land submerged by reelfoot lake.property interests are not created by the fourteenth amendment,rather they are created and defined by independent sources,such as state law.see brotherton cleveland,cir.state supreme court decisions are controlling authority for such determinations.see id.at.the supreme court of tennessee has specifically stated that the rights of the public attach to reelfoot lake and to its use,but only to those portions of the lake not over and above doherty grants.unlike the tribe in coeur,the hamiltons are not seeking to divest sovereign ownership of reelfoot lake from the state,or seeking entitlement to the exclusive use and occupancy of the lake.nor are the hamiltons seeking to invalidate the regulatory authority of the tennessee agencies in this case.
if the tribe in coeur had prevailed,lake coeur would have been annexed to the sovereign control of the tribe,effectively placing the lake beyond the jurisdiction of the state of idaho.justice,in her concurring opinion in coeur,characterized the tribe suit as follows 
first,as the tribe concedes,the suit is the functional equivalent of an action to quiet its title to the bed of lake coeur.it asks a federal court to declare that the lands are for the exclusive use,occupancy,and enjoyment of the tribe and to invalidate all statutes and ordinances purporting to regulate the lands.the tribe could not maintain a quiet title action in federal court without the state consent,and for good reason a federal court can not summon a state before it in a private action seeking to divest the state of a property interest second,the tribe does not merely seek to possess land that would otherwise remain subject to state regulation,or to bring the state regulatory scheme into compliance with federal law.rather,the tribe seeks to eliminate altogether the state regulatory power over the submerged lands at establish not only that the state has no right to possess the property,but also that the property is not within idaho sovereign jurisdiction at all.
idaho coeur tribe of idaho,d,concurring.if the hamiltons prevail at trial,reelfoot lake will remain within the sovereign control of the state of tennessee,and will continue to be subject to tennessee regulatory authority.at most,if the hamiltons prevail,the state of tennessee will be required to tailor its regulatory scheme to respect the hamiltons constitutionally protected riparian the state may be required to do for all owners of submerged doherty land in accordance with the jurisprudence of the supreme court of tennessee.the relief sought by the hamiltons in this case does not begin to approach the and invasive relief sought by the tribe under the particular and special circumstances of coeur,and this court does not read the ruling of coeur to extend to the facts of this case.
eleventh amendment sovereign immunity does not bar the hamiltons claims for equitable prospective relief.the hamiltons seek prospective relief to enjoin tennessee officials from committing continuing violations of federal law,namely violation of their rights under the fifth and fourteenth amendments,and therefore,the ex parte young exception applies in this case.the principal opinion in coeur,written by justice kennedy,espouses a,rather than a approach,to the application of the ex parte young doctrine.see coeur,at.at.nevertheless,this portion of the principal opinion failed to muster a majority of the court.in fact,a majority of the court,including the four dissenting justices and the three justices joining in the concurring opinion,rejected justice kennedy balancing approach,and held that it would continue to apply the ex parte young rule as it has been traditionally understood.see id.at.at,concurring joined by scalia and thomas,jj.see also id.at.at souter,dissenting joined by stevens,ginsburg,and breyer,jj.in short,a young suit is available where a plaintiff alleges an ongoing violation of federal law,and where the relief is prospective rather than retrospective.id.at.at,concurring emphasis in original.this case falls within the ex parte young exception,and the district court erred when it held that this suit was barred by eleventh amendment sovereign immunity.
procedural due process and protected property interests.
the hamiltons contend that the district court erred in its alternative holding that the are entitled to summary judgment on the ground that the hamiltons were unable to establish a constitutionally protected property interest in the waters of reelfoot lake or the land thereunder.in essence,the district court held that,by virtue of the state of tennessee ownership of reelfoot lake in public trust and the tennessee legislature enactments empowering state agencies to regulate the lake,even if the hamiltons are doherty land owners,they have no constitutionally protected property interests in their submerged land.
in considering procedural due process claims,this court first determines whether the interest at stake is within the fourteenth amendment protection of liberty and property.see ferencz hairston,cir.only after reaching a conclusion that the interest claimed is within that protection does this court consider the form and nature of the process that is due.see id.citing board of regents roth,d.thus,in a section due process claim for deprivation of a property interest,a plaintiff first must show a protected property interest,and only after satisfying this first requirement can a plaintiff prevail by showing that such interest was abridged without appropriate process.id.quoting lrl properties portage metro hous,cir.
property interests protected by the due process clause must be more than abstract desires for or attractions to a benefit.see board of regents roth,d.the due process clause protects only those interests to which one has a legitimate claim of entitlement.id.at.at.this has been defined to include any significant property interests including statutory entitlements.brotherton,cir citations omitted.as previously stated,property interests are not created by the fourteenth amendment,rather they are created and defined by independent sources,such as state law.see id.at quoting roth,at.at.state supreme court decisions are controlling authority for such determinations.see id.
as noted in the discussion supra in section ii b,the hamiltons are claiming entitlement to riparian rights already determined by the supreme court of tennessee to be protected property rights incident to the ownership of land submerged by reelfoot lake.see state ex rel.cates west tennessee land.the district court held,however,that the hamiltons were unable to reasonably identify the areas of land submerged by the lake to which they claim ownership because their deed to their real property on the lake merely establishes that their property extends to the ordinary low water mark of reelfoot lake.as the supreme court of tennessee held,as the doherty lands were grantable by north carolina,and were subject to private ownership before the formation of the lake,the mere fact that they have since become submerged by reelfoot lake does not deprive the owners of their title to the land as long as they can be reasonably identified.id.
the hamiltons contend,and the do not dispute,that their property is subsumed within doherty grant number.in,as is the case today,grant number was not totally submerged,and portions of it formed parts of the shore of the lake.see id.as noted by the district court,the hamiltons warranty deed states that the hamiltons property on reelfoot lake extends to the lake ordinary low water mark.because the state of tennessee condemned grant number in,any land that is submerged when the lake is below its low water mark is owned in public trust by the state.however,any land that is submerged when the lake is above its low water mark is part and parcel of doherty grant number.thus,the key determinant of whether the hamiltons have protected riparian rights is the location of the low water mark on reelfoot lake.
there is no evidence in the record affirmatively establishing the low water mark of reelfoot lake in.the parties presented competent summary judgment evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact as to this issue.in his affidavit in opposition to the motion for summary judgment,jamie hamilton stated that he saw the plans for the first spillway at reelfoot lake in,and it showed the low water mark at feet.this assertion,if true,is not merely conclusory and is based on a personal observation by the affiant.the dispute the assertion,but do not present any evidence to the contrary.rather,the cite ann.b which established the low water mark of reelfoot lake as of a s first established by the reelfoot lake commission of t he natural ordinary low water mark is two hundred and mean sea level which is also the top of the twenty floodgates at the reelfoot lake spillway dam.
evidently,it is the case that the current water level of reelfoot lake is approximately same level the lake was at in.the hamiltons allege that,starting in,the state of tennessee constructed a series of spillways or dams progressively raising the lake water level from feet to its present level.according to a united states geological survey,a elevation covers acres in surface area while a elevation covers acres.the hamiltons claim to own portions of doherty grant submerged after,and a genuine issue for trial exists as to the extent of their ownership of the reelfoot lake lake bed.if the hamiltons can establish ownership of doherty lands submerged after,the hamiltons have protected riparian rights in the waters above those lands.
