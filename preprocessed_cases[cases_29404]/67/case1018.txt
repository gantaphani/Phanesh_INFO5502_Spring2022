plaintiffs brandywine,and gary sewell appeal from the district court dismissal of their constitutional challenge to the city of richmond zoning scheme.they maintain that the district court erred when it upheld richmond revocation of the business license to their adult bookstore.for the reasons given below,the order of the district court is affirmed.
on june,plaintiff gary sewell,owner and president of brandywine,applied for a business license in the city of richmond,kentucky.sewell stated on his application that his business would engage in the rental,sales exhibition of video,books,magazines,e tc.he signed a statement promising that no movies,books,magazines,novelty item or any other item of an adult nature will not sic be sold,distributed or given away or traded at this location.city officials issued him a license.despite his disclaimer,sewell proceeded to open a retail store selling sexually explicit books and other materials.
on july,city officials notified plaintiffs by letter that their store was operating improperly under richmond zoning rules.the letter stated that the store was located in a business zoning district,and that businesses engaged in selling adult materials were only permitted to locate in industrial zones.the city revoked plaintiffs business license and ordered that the store be closed.
since the time that their business was closed,plaintiffs have expressed no interest in relocating.nor have they attempted to appeal their license revocation through the process provided by richmond zoning rules.
zoning in richmond is governed by a development ordinance.the ordinance divides richmond into five zoning districts agricultural,residential,business,industrial,and.within each zoning district,the ordinance establishes three categories of permitted land use,conditional,and accessory.uses are defined as uses that are deemed to be most appropriate,and are permitted outright in a district without further review by the planning commission or the board of adjustment.conditional uses are defined as uses that may or may not be appropriate,dependent upon the situation.these uses may call for restrictions on location,size,extent,and character of performance in addition to those already imposed by the ordinance,and require review and permitting by sic the conditional use requiring review by the board of adjustments.the ordinance gives the board of adjustments the power to approve,modify or deny any application for a conditional use permit.
the development ordinance lists bookstores as uses in zones,and provides that i f a specific use is not listed,the closest related use will serve as the appropriate use category as determined by the planning commission.
at the time that plaintiffs applied for their license,the development ordinance included an april amendment that categorized adult bookstores as conditional uses in zones.it was this amendment that city officials relied upon when they revoked plaintiffs license.
upon the revocation of their business license,plaintiffs brought this action for declaratory,injunctive and monetary relief.they alleged that richmond zoning scheme unconstitutionally restricted their ability to exercise their first amendment rights.they claimed that the april amendment forced adult businesses to locate in zones,where,as conditional uses,the determination of whether they obtained licenses was subject to the unbridled discretion of the board of adjustments.they also alleged that the language of the april amendment was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad,and that richmond enforcement of the zoning scheme resulted in the unconstitutional taking of their property.
less than one month later,in august,richmond modified the development ordinance,reclassifying adult bookstores as uses in zones.with this change,adult bookstores would no longer have to seek approval from the board of adjustments before locating in zones.
despite the august amendment,plaintiffs continued to pursue their lawsuit.on march,the district court held that the development ordinance did not unconstitutionally restrict adult expression,and that the language of the april amendment was neither vague nor overbroad.it further held that plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the conditional use procedure applied to adult bookstores in zones,and alternatively,that the august amendment that classified adult bookstores as uses in zones rendered plaintiffs complaint about the conditional use procedure moot.accordingly,the district court dismissed plaintiffs action.this appeal followed.
failure to assert a ripe takings claim 
plaintiffs argue that at the time that their license was revoked,richmond zoning scheme was unconstitutional because the april amendment only permitted adult businesses to locate in zones subject to the unbridled discretion of city officials.they contend that richmond should have subjected them to the development ordinance as it existed prior to the april amendment,when no mention was made in the development ordinance of adult bookstores,and bookstores were categorized as uses in zones.
though plaintiffs have asserted a takings claim,that claim is premature.we ascertain whether a takings claim is ripe or not de novo.bannum,city of louisville,cir.a takings claim is not ripe until the government entity charged with implementing the regulations has reached a final decision regarding the application of the regulations to the property at issue.williamson county regional planning comm hamilton bank of johnson city,d.because plaintiffs never appealed the revocation of their license,the city never reached a final,definitive position regarding the application of the development ordinance to plaintiffs business.
plaintiffs appeal from the district court determination that they lacked standing to challenge provisions of the zoning scheme that applied outside of zones because they had not demonstrated an intent to relocate.plaintiffs argue that standing requirements are relaxed in challenges premised on first amendment violations,and accordingly,that they should have been permitted to assert third party standing to challenge the conditional use procedure applied to adult bookstores in zones.they do not appeal the denial of their claim that that part of the development ordinance was vague or overbroad.
this court reviews de novo the district court conclusions of law with regard to standing.united states miami university,cir.where the district court has dismissed for lack of standing,we accept as true all material allegations in the complaint,and construe the complaint in favor of the complaining party.warth seldin,d.
under traditional requirements for standing,plaintiffs must establish injury in fact,meaning an invasion of a legally protected interest a causal relationship between the injury and the challenged conduct and a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.g v lounge,michigan liquor control comm n,cir.the district court correctly held that under these requirements,plaintiffs have standing to challenge the zoning scheme ban on adult bookstores in zones,since they were injured in fact when they were forced to close their business,a causal relationship existed between the enforcement of the zoning scheme and the harm,and the injury was redressable by an award of monetary damages for lost business.
however,a plaintiff may have standing to challenge some provisions of a law,but not others.clark city of lakewood,cir.in the instant case,plaintiffs never alleged any intention to locate outside a zone.therefore,under the traditional requirements,they lack standing to challenge the provisions of the zoning scheme that do not relate to zones,including the application of the conditional use procedure to adult bookstores in zones.
plaintiffs argue that they should be permitted to assert third party standing to challenge the conditional use procedure because they are mounting a first amendment facial challenge to richmond zoning scheme.where plaintiffs challenge a statute or ordinance for vagueness or overbreadth,the supreme court has concluded that they have standing to assert the rights of third parties whose protected
