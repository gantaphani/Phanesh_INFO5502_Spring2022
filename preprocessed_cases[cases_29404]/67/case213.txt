this case began as an interpleader action to determine the proper distribution of surplus proceeds from a foreclosure sale conducted by states resources corporation src.to that end,src named several defendants with interests in the foreclosed property,including the architectural team,tat,a junior lienholder.tat filed counterclaims against src,alleging that src mishandled the foreclosure sale and breached its fiduciary duty to tat.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of src,denied a motion by tat to add a counterclaim,and denied a motion by src to strike portions of an affidavit filed by tat.both parties appealed.we affirm.
this case has a complex factual and procedural history that is discussed in detail in the district court opinion.see states res.capizzi,dist.lexis.we relate only those facts relevant to the questions presented on appeal.
states resources corporation interest in the capizzi property 
in october,michael capizzi capizzi signed a note,secured by a mortgage on his property at lincoln road,lincoln,ma,memorializing a loan from winchendon savings bank wsb for use in developing his property.after wsb became insolvent,other institutions obtained and assigned the mortgage until src became the mortgagee in.
src first initiated foreclosure proceedings against capizzi in state court in january,alleging that he was in default on the note.due to a series of partial payments and defaults by capizzi and his wife,catherine capizzi,src cancelled and recommenced foreclosure proceedings against capizzi several times.the capizzis filed several lawsuits against src and bankruptcy petitions to prevent the foreclosure,none of which was successful.during the course of a state court action filed by the capizzis against src,src removed the case to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction.on june,the district court granted a motion by src for default judgment against the capizzis for their failure to plead or otherwise defend against src counterclaims,and entered judgment in favor of src for.
b.the architectural team,interest in the capizzi property 
in,tat filed a lawsuit against the capizzis in suffolk superior court,regarding a dispute over unpaid fees.in,tat obtained and duly recorded a attachment on the capizzi property.the lawsuit went to trial and the court entered a judgment in favor of tat for,with interest accruing from the filing date.see the architectural team,capizzi,slip op.at,aff.on september,tat obtained and recorded a execution on its judgment from the court.
c.the foreclosure auctions and disbursement of proceeds 
after obtaining its default judgment against the capizzis,src made plans to sell the property.src hired garrett,and its president,garrett healy,to conduct the foreclosure auction proceedings.
at the first foreclosure auction,the highest bid of came from linda micu.micu signed a memorandum of terms and conditions for the purchase at the mortgagee foreclosure sale as linda micu or assigns and provided garrett with a deposit.however,micu,who turned out to be a straw person for catherine capizzi,did not purchase the property and forfeited her deposit.micu left garrett a phone message stating that we have had a little bump in the road here financially and we are now having a problem getting financing but i would at least like to give you the courtesy to let you know at this point we can not proceed with this and hopefully you can get this thing going and someone else can take advantage of what i think is a pretty good deal.
after micu offer fell through,src scheduled a second foreclosure auction for september.src published a notice of mortgagee sale of real estate,which contained a legal description of the property,in the concord journal on september,and.at the direction of src,garrett also publicized the auction through telemarketing,mailings,the internet,and display advertisements in the boston globe on september and.the display advertisements contained incorrect information,allegedly obtained from town records,understating the acreage of the property and the number of bedrooms,bathrooms,and fireplaces it contained.
in early august,garrett received a letter from leonard florence,who offered to buy the property for and provided a deposit of.garrett informed counsel for src of the offer and deposit.src attorney later informed garrett that,based on his interpretation of state law,src could not accept florence offer because it was made outside of the public auction process.garrett rejected florence offer and asked him whether he would like to participate in the upcoming auction.florence declined,telling garrett that he did not have the time to pursue the property.garrett returned the deposit to florence.neither src nor garrett informed any of the other interest holders of the offer by florence.
on september,garrett conducted the second foreclosure auction.kevin duffy made the highest bid of.duffy and garrett executed a memorandum of terms and conditions for the purchase at mortgagee foreclosure sale,which included a provision stating that tat had a real estate lien on the property.
at the time of the final foreclosure auction of the capizzis property,src was owed,which it collected from the proceeds.in november,counsel for src and tat negotiated the disbursement of the surplus auction proceeds.on november,src sent tat a check for in partial satisfaction of tat junior lien.after sending the check,src sent tat an indemnification agreement pursuant to which tat would indemnify and hold harmless src from any and all actions,proceedings,claims,demands,costs,damages and expenses in connection with or arising out of the payment.tat never executed the indemnification agreement.
procedural history 
src initiated an interpleader action in federal district court on january,seeking a judicial determination regarding the proper apportionment of proceeds from the september,foreclosure sale of the capizzis property.although src initial judgment against the capizzis was satisfied by the proceeds of the sale,src alleged that it had accrued additional fees and costs due to the lawsuits filed by the capizzis and the payment owed to the auctioneer for his services.src named several parties with interests in the proceeds as defendants,including tat.on march,tat filed an answer affirmative defenses against catherine capizzi and counterclaims against src,seeking an accounting and alleging unjust enrichment and various other defects in foreclosure.on april,tat filed an amended answer,affirmative defenses,and counterclaims.on july,tat filed a motion to amend its answer to add a counterclaim against src and garrett under.laws ch.for unfair and deceptive business practices,based on information regarding the florence offer that tat alleges it first learned about through discovery.on october,src filed a motion for partial summary judgment,which tat opposed.
on january,the district court granted src motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed tat counterclaims,denied tat motion to amend its answer to add a counterclaim,and denied src motion to strike portions of an affidavit filed by tat.shortly thereafter,src filed a motion for a final judgment,describing a proposed disbursement of the surplus funds.on february,the district court issued the final judgment,adopting src disbursement proposal and ordering src to disburse to garrett,for its auctioneer services and to src for costs and attorneys fees incurred in the interpleader action and related bankruptcy litigation.tat and src appealed.
subject matter jurisdiction 
as a preliminary matter,we dispatch src argument that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over some of tat claims under the doctrine.under the doctrine,federal district courts lack jurisdiction over federal complaints that essentially invite federal courts of first instance to review and reverse unfavorable judgments.federación de maestros de junta de relaciones del trabajo de,cir quoting exxon mobil saudi basic indus,d.src asserts that the district court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over tat claims that src acted in bad faith and without reasonable diligence in conducting the foreclosure sale because a state court dismissed similar claims made by the capizzis in a suit the capizzis filed against src.although tat was not a party to that suit,src argues that tat claims regarding the foreclosure sale are inextricably intertwined with the issues adjudicated in the state court proceedings and that granting relief to tat would be effectively holding that the state court was wrong in its decision.
src argument is incorrect.the supreme court has clarified the scope of the doctrine 
the doctrine is confined to cases of the kind from which the doctrine acquired its name cases brought by losers complaining of injuries caused by judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.does not otherwise override or supplant preclusion doctrine or augment the circumscribed doctrines that allow federal courts to stay or dismiss proceedings in deference to actions.
exxon mobil.at.src argument thus fails for two reasons.first,as noted,tat was not a party to the initial action.therefore,tat is not a loser complaining of injuries caused by judgments.see also valenti mitchell,cir we have found no authority which would extend the doctrine to persons not parties to the proceedings before the state supreme court.
second,as we have recently stated,i f federal litigation is initiated before state proceedings have ended,if the federal plaintiff expects to lose in state court and hopes to win in federal litigation is parallel,and the doctrine does not deprive the court of jurisdiction.federación de maestros de,at emphasis in original.in this case,src is relating tat claims against it here to proceedings filed by the capizzis in march in the middlesex superior court.since the state court action referenced by src was not yet filed when src filed its federal district court action in january,and was still pending when tat answered with its counterclaims in march,the doctrine does not deprive the district court of subject matter jurisdiction over those claims.
motion for summary judgment 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.hodgkins new england telephone,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.an issue is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could resolve the point in favor of the nonmoving party.nasco,public storage,cir emphasis in original citation and internal quotation marks omitted.a fact is material if it has the potential to affect the outcome of the suit under the applicable law.centennial wireless,cir.we may affirm a summary judgment decision on any basis apparent in the record.uncle henry,plaut consulting,cir citing fabiano hopkins,cir.
tat argues that the district court erred in granting src summary judgment motion and finding no genuine issue as to any material fact regarding src compliance with its fiduciary duties to tat as a mortgagee conducting a foreclosure sale under massachusetts law.to support its breach of fiduciary duties claim,tat focuses on the district court determinations regarding the adequacy of notice and advertising of the property for sale,the adequacy of the price obtained,and src handling of the micu bid and florence offer.we address each issue in turn.
adequacy of notice and advertising 
tat argues that src violated its fiduciary duties under massachusetts law by publishing inaccurate display advertisements in the boston globe.these advertisements understated the acreage listing acres instead of six and the number of bedrooms,bathrooms,and fireplaces.
statutory requirements for foreclosure proceedings are governed by.laws ch,defining the statutory power of sale and ch,governing notice of foreclosure proceedings.as tat concedes,src satisfied statutory notice requirements by publishing timely notice in the concord journal,and the statute does not require additional advertising or notice.see.laws ch.
beyond compliance with statutory terms,however,a mortgagee also owes a fiduciary duty to lienholders of the property.in executing the power of sale,the mortgagee,in addition to a literal compliance with the terms of the power,is bound to exercise good faith and to put forth reasonable diligence to protect the interests of the mortgagor,atlas mortgage tebaldi,or those claiming in his right,including those holding junior encumbrances or liens.sandler silk.there may be circumstances where a mortgagee advertisement of inaccurate information about a property is evidence of a lack of good faith or reasonable diligence,even if those inaccuracies occurred in notices beyond the minimal publication notice required by statute.deslauries shea,a mortgagee ordinarily is not required to give notice of a foreclosure sale other than by publication.but there may be circumstances in which failure to give further notice is evidence that good faith was not used to obtain the best reasonable possible price.citations omitted.
however,there is no evidence of bad faith or lack of diligence here.src asserts that it obtained the inaccurate information given to garrett for the display advertisements from town of lincoln records.tat does not contest this assertion and does not allege that src had an improper motive for the inaccuracies.src was not the buyer of the property.no allegations have been made that src was alerted to the inaccuracies and refused to remedy them.as the district court concluded,i f anything,the reasonable inference to be drawn from src arranging for advertisements in the boston globe was that it was attempting to stir up interest among potential buyers of the property and thereby generate competitive bidding at the auction.states res,dist.lexis,at.therefore,src did not violate any fiduciary duty it owed to tat.
without evidence of,or evidence that src might have a motive for undermining the foreclosure sale,or any other showing of misconduct,there is no genuine issue of material fact on this claim.see fdic elder care,cir normally,a party suggesting fraud or bad faith is expected to point to the misconduct lies,rigged account books,by a fiduciary that reflects the bad faith or constitutes the fraud.true,on some occasions the inference of fraud or bad faith might be compelled by the combination of motive and outcome but here motive is utterly lacking emphasis in original.
adequacy of price obtained 
tat emphasizes that the price paid in the second auction was lower than the bid offered independently by micu,who could not complete the sale,and by florence,who made his offer outside of the bidding process.tat argues that this reduction in price is evidence of src lack of reasonable diligence and good faith.
under massachusetts law,a bsent evidence of bad faith or improper conduct mere inadequacy of price will not invalidate a sale unless it is so gross as to indicate bad faith or lack of reasonable diligence.resolution trust carr,cir emphasis in original internal quotations and citations omitted see also seppela aho contr,petersen,finding that a showing that foreclosure sale price was less than fair market value was not enough to support any basis of liability.
generally,to determine whether a sales price is grossly inadequate,the price is compared with a fair market value appraisal of the property.see elder care,at.the comparison figure stated by tat is based on the micu bid and florence offer and not on an appraisal of the fair market value of the property.tat has not offered any such appraisal information.even assuming a comparison of a previous uncompleted bid and final sale price is appropriate,other courts have found differences to be not so gross as to indicate bad faith or a lack of reasonable diligence.see elder care,at disparity between estimated liquidation price of and later sales price of not so gross as to withstand summary judgment motion resolution trust,at disparity between appraisal price of and sales price of not enough to withstand a summary judgment motion fairhaven savings bank callahan,purchase price of on property securing a debt not so inadequate as to constitute a breach of fiduciary duty as a matter of law sher south shore bank,disparity between alleged fair market value of and sales price of not so gross as to withstand a motion to dismiss cambridge sav.bank cronin,disparity between alleged fair market value of and sales price of warranted direct verdict against the challenger of the sale.
src handling of the micu bid and florence offer 
tat argues that src violated its fiduciary duty by failing to facilitate the transfer of micu interest to florence and failing to disclose the florence offer to tat.tat alleges that micu expressed the desire to assign her contract rights to another buyer through her phone message to garrett and her signature on the sales contract as linda micu or assigns.tat argues that,given src knowledge of micu alleged desire to assign,src should have assisted micu in assigning her rights under the sales contract to florence,or,at the very least,told tat of florence offer.
we do not find any support in the record for tat contention that micu expressed to src her desire to assign her rights.the fact that micu signed the contract linda micu or assigns does not constitute a request that src help her assign her rights to another party.micu telephone message,rather than being a request for assignment assistance as tat contends,is merely notification of and an apology for her failure to complete the sale.micu took no action at any time to assign her rights to a third party.
generally,massachusetts law requires sale of foreclosure property by public auction.laws ch.i n mortgage foreclosure sales,if the highest bidder fails to pay,the trustee of the property may declare that the next highest bidder may purchase the property,may resell the property promptly,or may readvertise the sale for another day.dundas chemical bank.courts have explained that efforts to resell the property promptly must take place at the public auction,not through a private sale which is not advertised to the public.see id.at collecting cases.after being notified of the florence offer,src attorney researched the issue and concluded,based on his interpretation of state law,that src could not accept florence offer because it was outside the foreclosure auction process.less than two months after the first auction took place,src held the second foreclosure auction and sold the property to the highest bidder at the auction.based on these facts,src did not violate its duty of good faith and reasonable diligence by failing to arrange a sale to florence.
nor did src violate its fiduciary duties by failing to discuss the florence offer with tat.a mortgagee fiduciary duty to junior lienholders generally requires that the mortgagee inform parties whom it knows to be interested in buying the property of an upcoming sale.see sandler,at finding that failure to give notice of sale to a party with a attachment who had expressed her intention to buy was evidence of bad faith danielczuk ferioli,finding disputed reasons for mortgagee failure to meet with prospective bidder prior to foreclosure sale were material to question of compliance with fiduciary duties see also in re lapointe,upholding bankruptcy court finding of lack of reasonable diligence by foreclosing bank for failing to provide notice of sale to a party it knew to be interested in buying.it is undisputed that src informed florence of the upcoming auction.
tat argues that a mortgagee has,in addition to its duty to inform interested buyers of an upcoming auction,a duty to inform junior lienholders of the existence of interested buyers.however,tat fails to provide any case law to support this assertion or any meaningful explanation of why such a duty would protect tat interest in the property in this case.tat argues that,if it had been informed of the florence offer,it may have been able to consummate the sale of the property to him.however,tat does not explain how it could have facilitated a sale to florence,nor has it presented any evidence supporting the inference that it could have done so.
presumably,circumstances may exist where a court could infer bad faith from a mortgagee failure to mention an offer of sale to lienholders.if,for example,a mortgagee was secretive or evasive in discussing the details of an upcoming auction with prospective buyers and purchased the property itself,its failure to disclose to junior lienholders that more substantial offers had been proposed by other buyers would certainly be suspect.bon graves,noting that a mortgagee evasiveness with interested buyers,along with other circumstances,showed that he was acting in the interest of buying the property at his own price rather than the highest price competitive bidding could bring.however,in this case,src fully informed florence of the opportunity to bid on the property through the public auction.furthermore,src was not the buyer and tat does not allege that src was colluding with the buyer to lower the sales price.thus,no breach of its fiduciary duties can be inferred from src failure to discuss the florence offer with tat.
motion to amend answer and add counterclaim 
a denial of a motion to amend under.a is generally reviewed for abuse of discretion.see hatch for children,youth families,cir.rule a states that leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.accordingly,unless there appears to be an adequate reason for the denial,undue delay,bad faith,dilatory motive on the part of the movant,futility of the amendment,we will not affirm the denial.hatch,at.
in this case,tat filed its motion to amend its answer to add a counterclaim against src under.laws ch.for unfair and deceptive business practices.in its decision and order granting summary judgment for src on tat counterclaims,the district court also denied the motion to amend as futile,finding that tat arguments relate d either to the insufficient claims or to the factual allegations underlying them involved in its other counterclaims,which the district court had already rejected.we therefore analyze whether tat proposed amendment is properly characterized as futile.see hatch,at.
as a preliminary matter,src argues that relief under.laws ch.is not available in this case because tat puts forth no allegations that a commercial transaction took place between src and tat.under massachusetts law,whether ch.applies to an interaction between two parties requires a dual inquiry first,the court assesses whether the interaction is commercial in nature,and second,it evaluates whether the parties were both engaged in trade or commerce,and therefore acting in a business context.linkage trustees of boston.
an interaction is not commercial in nature if it is a purely private interaction,where the undertaking is not in the ordinary course of a trade or business.linkage,at citation omitted.such interactions include disputes stemming from an employment relationship,disputes between individual members of a partnership arising from partnership business,and transactions and disputes between parties to a joint venture and between fellow shareholders.see id.citing szalla locke.
the dispute between src and tat does not appear to be purely private.while src and tat do have a fiduciary relationship,src handling of the foreclosure auction was not an transaction but the management of the sale of a property through public auction.see szalla,at noting that sales generally offered to the public are included in the statutory definition of commerce.
however,we need not decide this issue.assuming arguendo that the interaction between src and tat regarding the foreclosure sale is not generally barred from the application of ch,we find that the district court decision to deny the motion to amend should still be affirmed.
