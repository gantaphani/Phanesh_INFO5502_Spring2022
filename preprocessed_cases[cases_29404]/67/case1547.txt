factual and procedural background 
camille pissarro completed the impressionist painting rue saint honor√©,effet de pluie the painting in.julius cassirer purchased the painting in.the cassirers were a jewish family that played a prominent role in germany economic and cultural life.when julius died,his son fritz and fritz wife,lilly,inherited the painting.
in,lilly decided to flee germany because of the discriminatory nuremberg laws enacted in that stripped jews of their civil rights and citizenship.lilly and fritz had to obtain permission to leave germany and had to subject any works of art that they wished to take with them to an official appraiser.the appraiser was appointed by the nazis.he told lilly that she could not take the painting out of germany.the appraiser demanded that lilly hand the painting over to him for a payment of reichsmarks around at exchange rates.lilly surrendered the painting.
in,the painting was sold to an anonymous purchaser.after the war,lilly attempted to locate the painting without success.she obtained compensation for the loss of the painting in the german courts.when lilly died in,she named her grandson claude cassirer as her sole heir.
in,baron hans heinrich thyssen bornemisza,one of the world most prolific private art collectors,bought the painting.in,the thyssen bornemisza collection foundation the foundation,an agency of the kingdom of spain,purchased the thyssen bornemisza collection,including the painting.spain provided a palace to house the thyssen bornemisza museum.
in,claude first discovered that the painting was on display in the thyssen bornemisza museum.by that time,he was living in california.claude filed this lawsuit in may against the foundation and the kingdom of spain.
defendants filed an initial motion to dismiss on the ground that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the dispute.the district court ruled that it had subject matter jurisdiction under the foreign sovereign immunity act exception to sovereign immunity for lawsuits involving rights in property taken in violation of international law.that decision was upheld by a three judge panel and an en banc panel of the ninth circuit.see cassirer kingdom of spain,cir cassirer kingdom of spain,cir en banc.
after the en banc ruling,claude died.on remand,claude heirs his son david,daughter ava,and the united jewish federation of san diego county were substituted as plaintiffs collectively,the cassirers.the cassirers voluntarily dismissed spain,and the foundation agreed not to challenge personal jurisdiction.
the foundation moved to dismiss the cassirers complaint on the ground that c,as amended,is unconstitutional.the district court granted the motion to dismiss without leave to amend on the grounds that c is unconstitutional under foreign affairs field preemption and as a consequence,the cassirers claims are untimely under the more general statute of limitations for recovery of property.the cassirers timely appealed.
statutory background 
at the time the cassirers initiated their lawsuit,the california code of civil procedure provided a general statute of limitations for a n action for taking,detaining,or injuring any goods or chattels,including actions for the specific recovery of personal property.c.in filing their lawsuit,however,the cassirers relied on the california code of civil procedure enacted in.that statute provided that the owner of artwork defined as an article of artistic significance taken as a result of nazi persecution during the period of to may recover the article from any museum or gallery so long as the action is commenced by december.we struck down as unconstitutional on the basis of field preemption in von saher norton simon museum of art at pasadena,cir,as amended by cir.
shortly after the ruling in von saher,the california legislature amended,the general statute of limitations provisions.the original provisions of c were renumbered as c and c.the legislature added a new provision,c,which is at the heart of this appeal,that provides for a statute of limitations for an action for the specific recovery of a work of fine art brought against a museum,gallery,auctioneer,or dealer.c.the amended statute specifies that the period is triggered on the actual discovery by plaintiff of t he identity and the whereabouts of the work of fine art and i nformation or facts that are sufficient to indicate that the claimant has a claim for a possessory interest in the work of fine art that was unlawfully taken or stolen.id.c a i ii.the statute applies to all pending and future actions commenced on or before december,so long as the action concerns a work of fine art that was taken within years prior to the date of enactment of this statute.id.c b.that includes any pending actions that have not yet reached final judgment or whose time to appeal has not expired.id.
discussion 
foreign affairs preemption standards 
the constitution gives the federal government the exclusive authority to administer foreign affairs.movsesian victoria versicherung ag,cir en banc,cert.denied.accordingly,state laws that intrude on this exclusively federal power are preempted under the foreign affairs doctrine.id.
under foreign affairs preemption there are two grounds for preemption conflict preemption and field preemption.id.conflict preemption occurs when a state acts under its traditional power,but the state law conflicts with a federal action such as a treaty,federal statute,or executive branch policy.id.at.the district court held that c was not preempted on the basis of conflict preemption,and the foundation does not challenge that ruling on appeal.
field preemption occurs when a state,in the absence of any express federal policy intrudes on the field of foreign affairs without addressing a traditional state responsibility.id.at.the cassirers argue that the district court erred when it held that c,as amended,is unconstitutional on the basis of field preemption.we agree.
whether c is unconstitutional on the basis of field preemption 
field preemption exists when a state law has no serious claim to be addressing a traditional state responsibility and intrudes on the federal government foreign affairs power.id.at.
we need not consider whether c addresses an area of traditional state responsibility,because we conclude that c does not intrude on the federal government foreign affairs power.
to intrude on the federal government foreign affairs power,a statute must have more than some incidental or indirect effect on foreign affairs.movsesian,at quoting zschernig miller.for example,in zschernig miller,the supreme court struck down as unconstitutional an oregon probate statute on the basis of field preemption.at.there,the oregon statute provided that nonresident aliens could not receive personal property unless they could show 
the existence of a reciprocal right of a united states citizen to take property on the same terms as a citizen or inhabitant of the foreign country the right of united states citizens to receive payment here of funds from estates in the foreign country and the right of the foreign heirs to receive the proceeds of oregon estates without confiscation.
id.at quoting.
as applied,oregon judges in construing the oregon probate statute sought to ascertain whether rights protected by foreign law are the same rights that citizens of oregon enjoy.id.at.in so doing,oregon courts had repeatedly determined that if the alleged foreign right may be vindicated only through state agencies,then there is no right of the type the oregon statute requires.id.consequently,the oregon statute ha d a direct impact upon foreign relations.id.at.
in our other field preemption cases,we found intrusion into foreign affairs on the face of the statutes.section,the statute for artwork,explicitly created a special rule that applie d only to a newly defined class of plaintiffs who had suffered wartime injuries.von saher,at quoting deutsch turner,cir.section express ed a distinct political point of view on a specific matter of foreign policy by labeling the actions of the ottoman empire genocide and providing relief only for armenian genocide victim s.movsesian,at quoting b.likewise,intruded on the federal government foreign affairs power because california sought to redress wrongs committed in the course of the second world war by providing a right of recovery only to second world war slave labor victims and second world war forced labor victims.deutsch,at.
the district court concluded that c intruded on foreign affairs on two grounds c created a remedy for wartime injuries and c is functionally equivalent to unconstitutional.we conclude that the district court erred on both counts.
first,the district court accurately noted that under von saher,movsesian,and deutsch,states may not create their own remedies to the problem of looted art or other wartime injuries,and they may not require their courts to make politically sensitive determinations on matters of foreign policy.section c,however,does not create a remedy for wartime injuries by creating a new cause of action for the recovery of artwork.contra von saher,at.section c extends the statute of limitations for preexisting claims concerning a class of artwork that is unrelated to foreign affairs on its face.it does not require that those claims arise out of wartime injuries,or from any other specific source that might implicate the federal government foreign affairs power.because c is silent on matters of foreign affairs,it does not convey a distinct juristic personality from that of the united states when it comes to matters of foreign affairs.id.at.nor is there any evidence in the record at this stage in the proceedings that california courts,as in zschernig,are applying c to establish the state own foreign policy.at.
second,the district court incorrectly determined that c was functionally equivalent to unconstitutional.the district court emphasized that the statute limits its application to claims to art taken after by fraud or duress,which clearly indicates that the extended limitations period encompasses claims.but whether a statute of limitations may permit holocaust is not the test for preemption.in von saher,we remanded plaintiff claims so that the district court could determine whether plaintiff claims to recover artwork were timely under the general provisions of,before the statute was amended.at.
and in fact,is not functionally equivalent to unconstitutional.while covered only claims to recover artwork,c extends to any work of fine art.indeed,since its enactment,artwork cases have invoked c.see prelacy of the armenian apostolic church paul getty museum,no.l,suing over a manuscript allegedly stolen in rafaelli getty images,cv cas pjw,suing over photographs created in the.
we find that the district court erred in concluding that intrudes on foreign affairs.we thus conclude that the district court erred in striking down as unconstitutional on the basis of field preemption.
whether c violates the foundation due process rights 
the foundation argues that c violates its due process rights by retroactively stripping it of its vested property interest acquired in the painting when the longstanding statute of limitations period expired.we affirm the district court ruling that the foundation can not establish such a claim on the basis of the current record.
in campbell holt,the supreme court established that 
it may very well be held that in an action to recover real or personal property,where the question is as to the removal of the bar of the statute of limitations by a legislative act passed after the bar has become perfect,that such act deprives the party of his property without due process of law.the reason is that,by the law in existence before the repealing act,the property had become the defendant.both the legal title and the real ownership had become vested in him,and to give the act the effect of transferring this title to plaintiff would be to deprive him of his property without due process of law.
campbell holt.
but as the district court emphasized,campbell applies only when the property at issue had vested and had become the defendant.the supreme court explained in chase securities donaldson that,where lapse of time has not invested a party with title to real or personal property,a state legislature,consistently with the fourteenth amendment,may repeal or extend a statute of limitations,emphasis added.accordingly,we have explained that w here a lapse of time has not invested a party with title to real or personal property,a state legislature may extend a lapsed statute of limitations without violating the fourteenth amendment,regardless of whether the effect is seen as creating or reviving a barred claim.starks rykoff,cir.
the district court found that whether a lapse of time invested the foundation with title to the painting required the development of the following factual disputes,not pleaded in the complaint the history of the painting transfer whether the painting was stolen in the foundation chain of title whether the foundation possession of the painting was uninterrupted for adverse possession purposes and whether the foundation possession of the painting was open for adverse possession purposes.none of these factual disputes are resolved in the foundation favor by the facts pleaded in the complaint.
we disagree with the cassirers,however,that the foundation due process claim may be resolved conclusively in the cassirers favor at this juncture.the cassirers claim that the constitutional analysis utilized in campbell and chase is outdated and that the modern approach is to evaluate whether c passes rational basis review.but the cassirers do not proffer any authority that involves whether the statute at issue harmed a defendant interest in a vested property right.instead,they rely on inapposite cases.see,campanelli allstate life ins,cir stating retrospective economic legislation must only pass rational basis review quoting motors romein,emphasis added lyon agusta,cir t he supreme court has not blanched when settled economic expectations were upset,as long as the legislature was pursuing a rational policy.emphasis added.the cassirers have not shown that c need only pass rational basis review if,in fact,the foundation had a vested interest in the painting.we conclude that the district court correctly held that the foundation due process challenge can not be resolved on the foundation motion to dismiss.
whether c violates the foundation first amendment rights 
the foundation argues that c violates its first amendment rights because c targets museums and art galleries for unfavorable treatment.we disagree.
the district court correctly reasoned that c does not burden expression in any manner cognizable under the supreme court first amendment jurisprudence.the foundation relies solely on cases in which the statutes at issue imposed a tax on certain entities engaged in free speech activities.see minneapolis star tribune.com r of revenue,holding that a state special tax on the press which limit ed its effect to only a few newspapers was subject to strict scrutiny and was unconstitutional festival,city of pleasant hill,d,holding that the city admissions tax,as applied to plaintiff theater owners,impose d an impermissible burden on protected speech.section c does not impose a tax on the foundation.further,the statute merely permit
