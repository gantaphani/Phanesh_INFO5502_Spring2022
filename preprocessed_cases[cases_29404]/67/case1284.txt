armando gonzalez,michael adams,and victor satas were in the business of condominium conversions in cicero,illinois.in,they suddenly encountered obstacles thrown in their path by the town of cicero.they believed that cicero,through its president betty,was applying the laws to them in an unconstitutional manner.together with a number of other people,they sued the town,claiming that it had violated their fourteenth amendment equal protection rights,and a jury awarded them a verdict of.cicero responded first with motions for a judgment as a matter of law and a new trial,and then with the appeal in.we affirm that judgment of the district court.appeal,which we consolidated with the first in our order of june,concerns the district court award of attorneys fees and costs in favor of the plaintiffs in the principal case.finding no abuse of discretion,we also affirm that order.
once a jury has rendered a verdict,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to that verdict.the account of the relevant facts that follows should therefore be understood in that light.in,gonzalez and the other appellees to whom we shall refer collectively as the gonzalez parties,unless the context otherwise requires began purchasing old apartment buildings in cicero.they rehabilitated the units in those buildings and then sold the units individually as condominiums.their only significant competitor in the condominium conversion business was joe pav,a figure in cicero real estate community and,not coincidentally,the former boss and continuing ally of betty.
before any person in cicero sells a piece of property,she must obtain a real estate transfer stamp from the town.the first step toward obtaining the stamp is for the seller to apply for and receive a certificate of compliance for the property from cicero building department.when a property seller submits a request for a certificate of compliance,the building department dispatches an inspector to the property to ensure that it is in full compliance with all relevant codes and zoning rules.in the normal course,once an inspector determines that a piece of property is in compliance,issuance of a certificate is a mere formality.the building commissioner merely verifies that the inspector found no problems and then directs that the certificate be issued.
until early,cicero imposed the same permitting requirements on everyone,including the gonzalez parties and pav,and no one was having any trouble passing inspections and getting certificates of compliance for his rehabilitated units.prior to february of,the gonzalez parties applied for and received building permits to do restoration work on the units in their buildings and,when the units were ready to be sold,cicero issued certificates of compliance and real estate transfer stamps.by september of,the gonzalez parties had sold fifty units in four buildings.cicero also initially issued certificates of compliance for the units in two of the six buildings that are the subject of this grace and the warren park.the gonzalez parties received certificates for all the units in these two buildings but did not sell four available units before the certificates expired.then the trouble began.
the first sign that all was not well came with gonzalez original application for certificates of compliance for the units in the albright,anna,and daniel buildings in early february of.initially,the building department simply failed to respond to their applications.when gonzalez inquired about scheduling inspections,the clerk of the building department informed him that his applications had been transferred to the town legal department.there he was advised that he needed to apply to the town board for legal use designations for the buildings.this was a curious determination given that gonzalez had only recently purchased the buildings and the sellers had received certificates of compliance and real estate transfer stamps without difficulty.not wanting to cause trouble,gonzalez applied for use designations and ultimately received them.
after obtaining the use designations,gonzalez again approached the building department about scheduling inspections for the affected units.inspectors were dispatched to the buildings and filed reports concluding that the units were in compliance with all relevant codes.according to established practice,this should have ended the matter.in fact,both the former building commissioner and the director of code enforcement testified at trial that following the inspections they would normally have issued the certificates as a matter of course.but the certificates did not materialize.gonzalez made inquiries at the building department and was again referred to the legal department.this time the assistant town counsel told gonzalez that wanted to know where their condominium approval was.
this request was perplexing.cicero at that time did not have a condominium ordinance,much less any established procedure for acquiring condominium approval.not surprisingly,therefore,the gonzalez parties had not been required to seek any such approval for any of the units they had sold over the previous year.nonetheless,again trying to be accommodating,gonzalez sent a letter seeking condominium approval.put the issue on the agenda of the next town board meeting.
at that meeting,made another unprecedented request.she wanted to know if appellees had parking spaces for each of the condominium units that they intended to sell.the gonzalez parties had received separate certificates of compliance for similar units over the past two years without ever having to show the existence of parking spaces per unit.and parking had never before been cited as a problem with the current batch of the units at the grace and the warren park,which already had received certificates of compliance once.claimed that the parking requirement was part of a zoning provision that had been on the books long before gonzalez began doing condominium conversions.that ordinance required parking spaces per unit constructed or substantially altered after.
the buildings owned by the gonzalez parties had been constructed before,and the phrase substantially altered had never before been interpreted to include the kinds of renovations they had made.among other things,they had not added units,changed the configuration of the units,or made any other structural changes to the buildings.in essence,they had made cosmetic improvements and were proposing to change the ownership structure of the buildings.the renovations on the six buildings for which gonzalez was now allegedly required to provide parking were no different from the renovations he had completed on the other buildings that had received certificates of compliance without difficulty.at trial,no cicero official,including,could define substantially altered.
following the town board meeting,directed the economic development committee to determine how much parking was available at gonzalez buildings.gonzalez never contended that he could satisfy the spaces requirement,so it was no surprise when the economic development committee reported to the town board that the number of spaces fell short of the alleged requirement.thereupon instructed gonzalez that he could not sell the units unless he obtained a variance from the zoning board,which was headed by her friend and political supporter anthony accardo.gonzalez dutifully applied for the variances but was turned down.this had the effect of shutting down his condominium conversion business.
to someone unaware of cicero history,all of these new requirements and shifting standards might have appeared rational enough but for two anomalies.the first was that at the same time that the gonzalez parties were being subjected to the new regime,joe pav and others continued to do business under the old rules.between february and april of,pav applied for certificates of compliance for units in his morton park building.this was an old rental building that pav had rehabilitated and like the gonzalez group was now selling as individual condominiums.the project was completed with much fanfare,including a ceremony personally attended by.pav applications for certificates of compliance for these units sailed right through the building department,without any detours to the town hall or the legal department.inspectors were promptly dispatched and reports were issued finding the units to be in compliance.finally,pav received certificates approved by best friend,mary lynn chlada,the head of the building department.pav was not required to obtain condominium approval for the conversions.also tellingly,he received the certificates even though his morton park building had undergone essentially the same renovations as the gonzalez buildings and lacked the allegedly required parking spaces per unit.similarly,hector garcia,a real estate broker in cicero,had no trouble obtaining a certificate of compliance on april,for a rental building that he sold after a renovation similar to gonzalez.garcia building had three parking fewer than what had claimed to gonzalez was de rigeur.
the second anomaly related to the timing and reason for the new requirements the gonzalez parties were forced to satisfy.it turned out that the difference in treatment between them and others like pav and garcia was not accidental.instead,it arose out of a breakdown in gonzalez professional relationship with.in,cook county approached gonzalez about finding rental space for a new women,infants,and children wic office in cicero.gonzalez eventually negotiated a lease with the county for space in one of his buildings.the town of cicero,however,needed to approve the lease and gonzalez was told had decided to block the deal.gonzalez scheduled a meeting with at which she acknowledged that this was true.gonzalez attempted to persuade her to approve the lease,and by the end of the meeting,was.she told gonzalez to expect a call from edward vrdolyak,a former chicago alderman with no official position in the town of cicero.
shortly thereafter,vrdolyak summoned gonzalez to his chicago office.as the two talked,vrdolyak assured gonzalez that was his friend,that she would help him,but that gonzalez should take care of her.not long after this meeting,permitted the lease to go through.she later testified that she had done gonzalez a favor as opposed,we suppose,to making a decision in the best interest of the town.gonzalez,however,apparently did not get the message vrdolyak was trying to send.instead of a more valuable show of gratitude,gonzalez sent a bouquet of flowers.this proved to be insufficient.not long after,the question of his certificates of compliance for the condominium units at issue in this case came to a head.
believing that his inability to obtain certificates of compliance was the result at least in part of dissatisfaction with his chosen method of thanking her for her assistance on the wic lease,the gonzalez parties filed a complaint alleging that their rights had been violated in a number of ways,including through cicero violation of their equal protection rights under the fourteenth amendment.upon the recommendation of a magistrate judge,the district court denied the plaintiffs request for a preliminary injunction in an order issued april.the parties then filed for summary judgment.the district court denied gonzalez motion and granted cicero motion on all claims except the one based on the equal protection clause.cicero filed a motion for reconsideration,which the district court denied august.as we have already noted,a jury trial ensued,the jury found for the plaintiffs on the equal protection claim,and it awarded them damages in the amount of.cicero filed motions for a judgment as a matter of law or,in the alternative,for a new trial under.and.the district court denied these motions on september,and this appeal followed.
cicero has chosen on appeal to tackle the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury daunting task,given the deferential standard that applies to such reviews.it also complains that the district court mistakenly admitted certain testimony with regard to damages and that it was entitled to what it calls an itemized jury verdict apparently,in context,this means cicero believes the district court abused its discretion when it did not submit special interrogatories under.with respect to damages.we will take each argument in turn.
sufficiency of the evidence 
equal protection violation 
although cicero filed motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial with the district court,it has framed its challenge on appeal to the equal protection verdict only in terms of whether,based on the evidence presented at trial,a reasonable jury could conclude that cicero committed an equal protection violation.this formulation of the standard of review applies only to the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law.kossman northeast.reg l commuter,cir.cicero has thus waived any argument that it was entitled to a new trial because the jury verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence,a claim we would review for abuse of discretion.see trzcinski american cas,cir.we are particularly comfortable finding waiver in this case because cicero failed to include the district court judgment s denying its motions in its rule a appendix.not only is this sanctionable misconduct,collins educ.therapy,cir,but it forces us to infer from the arguments in cicero opening brief which of the district court judgments cicero has chosen to appeal.as we read its brief,cicero is claiming only that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

after setting out the facts in the record in the light most favorable to its own position,cicero spends much of its opening brief asserting that this was a garden variety zoning dispute that had no business being in federal court.while it is true that this characterization appears in a number of cases involving challenges to decisions,see hartland sportsman club,town of delafield,cir coniston village of hoffman estates,cir,these are not magic words that municipal defendants can simply recite in order to insulate their decisions from scrutiny under federal law.whether cicero is entitled to judgment as a matter of law depends on the facts in the record construed favorably to the gonzalez parties,not on convenient quotes applied to a version of the facts rejected by the jury.at one point cicero was also arguing that the district court erred when it refused to grant summary judgment on the equal protection claim.this effort was misguided.once a trial on the merits has occurred,we rely on the record developed at trial and will not review an earlier denial of summary judgment.marshall porter county plan comm n,cir.the town wisely abandoned this argument in its reply brief.

cicero only challenge to the jury verdict is that the gonzalez parties failed to present enough evidence that the decision not to furnish certificates of compliance to them after february of was motivated by totally illegitimate animus.cicero argued this point aggressively during closing arguments and the court gave a totally illegitimate animus instruction,but the jury disagreed,finding that precisely that animus motivated the town stance toward these developers.on the record before us,we can not say that no reasonable jury could have reached this conclusion.indeed,as the following account demonstrates,we are satisfied that a challenge based on the weight of the evidence would also have failed,had this argument been preserved.
the evidence read in the light most favorable to the jury verdict established that in and early,there were two dominant players in the cicero condominium conversion business,the gonzalez parties and pav.until early,cicero imposed the same requirements on everyone.no one was asked to obtain condominium approvals prior to the issuance of certificates of compliance,and no one had to demonstrate that he had parking spaces available for each rehabilitated unit he intended to sell.that changed in february of in the manner we have already described.while pav continued to receive certificates of compliance under the old rules,gonzalez was subjected to a series of unprecedented requirements,many of which were substantively requiring condominium approval in the absence of any ordinance or policy creating such a all of which the jury reasonably could have inferred were traceable to and to her personal hostility toward hostility reflecting precisely the sheer vindictiveness called for in albiero.
the jury heard testimony that personally controlled regulation in cicero and reached her decisions on at best questionable personal grounds.by late,she had installed her closest friend,mary lynn chlada,as director of code enforcement,even though chlada had no experience with land use and zoning issues.then transferred to chlada all the powers formerly vested in the building commissioner,including the power to issue certificates of compliance.she appointed the former building commissioner,anthony accardo,to a paid position heading the zoning board as a favor.accardo,also a loyal supporter of,testified that he would never challenge her authority.herself corroborated her willingness and ability to personalize decisions when she acknowledged that she had first blocked gonzalez wic lease and then decided to help him by letting it go,as later events proved,not with a free pass.
the jury also heard evidence suggesting that considered it perfectly acceptable to expect those who benefitted from her position as town president to give financial support to her political campaigns.there was testimony at trial that city officials approached local businesses needing cooperation from the town of cicero and encouraged them to purchase large numbers of tickets in support of local republican party.acknowledged that to raise money for her efforts,she relied on the loyalty of her friends,including accardo,whom she repaid by naming him to be the paid zoning board chairperson.accardo,she admitted,had over the years been loyal and raised money for her campaigns.when challenged about this practice,responded,that just politics.a reasonable jury could have concluded from testimony that this kind of loyalty was an important qualification for obtaining positions in cicero government and for obtaining other public benefits as well.
in this context,it was reasonable to believe that could and would,under the appropriate circumstances,use her control over land use regulation in cicero to serve her personal ends through the unequal application of the laws.and the gonzalez parties presented substantial evidence that this was precisely what happened to them.the jury could reasonably have inferred from the testimony about the favor to gonzalez that was brokered by vrdolyak that expected gonzalez thanks to take the form of a financial contribution.vrdolyak had no official position in cicero government,much less a formal role in its decisions,and so his involvement was suspicious at best.what need was there for vrdolyak participation if intended to make her decision based simply on the best interests of the town of cicero the dubiousness of his role in the matter was confirmed by his statement to gonzalez that was his friend and would help him,but that gonzalez needed to take care of her.a reasonable jury could conclude from this evidence that involved vrdolyak as an intermediary to convey her expectation that gonzalez show the kind of loyalty she expects from friends for whom she does favors.
given the evidence in the record of the unprecedented,selectively applied,and substantively questionable standards that imposed on gonzalez shortly after gonzalez attempted to take care of her with a bouquet of flowers,a reasonable jury could also have concluded as this one did that the trouble the gonzalez parties had obtaining certificates of compliance for their units in early had nothing to do with a lack of condominium approval or available parking.instead,these troubles stemmed from desire to punish gonzalez for not repaying her help on the wic lease with a significant financial contribution of some kind.
hostility stemming from a person failure to contribute to a politician campaign fund,or otherwise reward her personally for permitting access to government services,falls in the category of totally illegitimate animus this motivation was not related to duties as town president and it is not a reason to deny certificates of compliance that is rationally related to a legitimate government interest.as cicero argues,there is certainly evidence in the record which,if believed by a jury,would have put this case in the category of a zoning dispute.but the jury was not persuaded by that evidence and we can not say that its decision was unreasonable.
evidence of damages 
cicero next argues that the district court erred in permitting the gonzalez parties to present their alleged damages by use of inadmissible hearsay.in general,we will not reverse a district court evidentiary ruling unless we find that the court abused its discretion.palmquist selvik,cir.the burden is still greater,however,where the appellant seeks to set aside a jury verdict in a civil case.even if the district court erred,we will only set aside a jury verdict if the appellant demonstrates that the error was not harmless,that it affected appellant substantial rights.mason southern.at carbondale,cir.a.
the testimony at issue was given by appellee michael adams,a cicero real estate broker and an equity interest holder in the buildings that are the subject of this litigation.cicero contends that adams testimony on damages should have been excluded in its entirety.without it,cicero continues,the gonzalez parties could not demonstrate that they had ready,willing and able buyers for all of their units and thus could not support their claim for damages.this is how,in cicero view,the allegedly erroneous admission of adams testimony affected its substantial rights.
we find that cicero arguments miss the mark in several ways.gonzalez and his colleagues sought consequential damages of between and million.of that,represented carrying costs for the units that had gone or were ready to go on the market but could not be sold because of the lack of certificates of compliance.the gonzalez parties presented documentary evidence of what it cost to maintain units as long as they were not sold.they relied on adams to estimate how long it would have taken to sell the units once they were placed on the market.adams had been a licensed real estate broker in cicero for seven years at the time of the trial.starting in he was heavily involved in converting condominium units in cicero.on this basis the district court found adams competent to give lay expert testimony regarding the cicero condominium market under,without objection from cicero.
when asked how he picked the dates on which carrying cost damages began to accrue for the various units,adams explained that based on his knowledge of the cicero condominium his marketing and sale of condominium would generally take three to four months from the time the
