bethel world outreach ministries brought this action asserting that montgomery county zoning regulations,which prevented bethel from constructing a church,violated the religious land use and institutionalized persons act rluipa,the united states constitution,and the maryland declaration of rights.the district court granted summary judgment to the county on all claims.for the reasons that follow,we reverse the judgment of the district court as to bethel rluipa substantial burden claim,affirm in all other respects,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
bethel,a christian church,owns a place of worship in silver spring,maryland,and rents a satellite facility in gaithersburg,maryland.both silver spring and gaithersburg are located in montgomery county.
bethel silver spring church seats approximately people at one time and the gaithersburg facility seats approximately bethel total weekly attendance at all services is about.to accommodate its congregation bethel must hold four services every sunday three in silver spring and one in gaithersburg.the number of services restricts their length,and requires that communion not be held until after the services.
time and space limitations also sometimes require bethel to cut short its important altar call practice,in which attendees may publicly dedicate their lives to christ,join the church,or request specific prayers.after the service,the director of altar call traditionally conducts conversations with those who have come forward regarding their spiritual beliefs.because the church itself lacks facilities to accommodate these conversations,the director must use a small,partitioned area in the visitor center.
even with four services each sunday,bethel faces overcrowding,and ushers must sometimes prevent worshipers from entering the sanctuary.bethel also lacks facilities for other programs,including religious education,health education,and various counseling services.and because adults use all available classrooms,bethel is unable to provide programs exclusively for youths.
for all of these reasons,in bethel purchased a acre property on brink road,also in montgomery county.bethel planned to build a new,larger church on this property.
the brink road property is located within a acre area that the county designated in as an agricultural reserve.to preserve the environmental and aesthetic benefits of open spaces in the agricultural reserve,the county zoned most of it as a rural density transfer zone subject to a transferable development rights system.under that system,developers can purchase rights from landowners in the rural density transfer zone to build in other areas of the county.the property of the landowner who sells the development rights is then subject to an easement,which restricts the density of residential development permitted on that property.prior to,the easements did not affect institutional use of property in the zone,so a church was a permitted use on bethel property.
under the county water and sewer plan,however,the county generally did not provide public service in rural density transfer zones,though it did consider exceptions to that policy.before,the county private institutional facilities policy provided a means by which institutional users,including religious institutions like bethel,could request amendments to the county water and sewer plan.in,bethel predecessor on the brink road property,farm development company,llc,requested such an amendment,which would have provided it with public water and sewer service,and allowed it to build four seat churches.
at least partially in response to this request,in the county began reviewing its private institutional facilities policy and considered changes that would have prevented farm development and other institutional users in the rural density transfer zone from gaining access to the public water and sewer system.the county did not at that time implement any such changes,but indicated that further review of the policy would be needed.
in,after purchasing the brink road property,bethel substituted itself for farm development on the request for public water and sewer service.bethel planned to build a seat church,a school,a daycare building,a social hall,and offices on the property.in november,the council denied bethel request and in the same meeting approved an amendment to the water and sewer plan prohibiting public water and sewer service to private institutional facilities in the rural density transfer zone.
in january,bethel filed a petition for administrative mandamus in state court,challenging the denial of its application for public water and sewer service as unlawful,arbitrary,capricious,unsupported by substantial evidence,and violative of the maryland declaration of rights and the religious land use and institutionalized persons act of rluipa,et.two years later,the state court granted summary judgment to the county the court of special appeals later affirmed.see bethel world outreach church montgomery.
while bethel state court action was pending,the county council considered the application of another religious institution,derwood bible church,for approval of the private well and septic system necessary to build a seat church in the rural density transfer zone in february,the council approved an amendment to the county water and sewer plan that restricted the size of new private well and septic systems in rural density transfer zones.a month later,the county denied derwood request because derwood proposed private well and septic system exceeded the maximum capacity permitted by this amendment,known as the knapp cap.
because the county had earlier in november amended its water and sewer plan to prevent private institutional facilities from obtaining access to the public water and sewer system,the knapp cap restriction on private systems effectively imposed a size limitation on new private institutional facilities in the rural density transfer zone.in response to this limitation,bethel modified its plan in order to comply with the knapp cap,and in january applied for a private well and septic system to support the construction of a smaller,seat church.
in october,while that application was pending,the county council adopted an amendment to its zoning provisions,zta,which prohibits a landowner from building a private institutional facility on any property subject to a transferable development rights easement.because bethel property is subject to such an easement,zta bars it from building even the smaller seat church.in april,the county deferred bethel well and septic application pending submission of a proposed use consistent with zta,agriculture or single family homes bethel appears to have been the only pending application effectively denied based on zta.
a month later,in may,bethel filed this action in federal court alleging that zta and the deferral of its application for a well and septic system violated its rights under rluipa,the first and fourteenth amendments,and the maryland declaration of rights.after completion of discovery,the county moved for summary judgment.the district court conducted a hearing and then granted summary judgment to the county on all claims.bethel noted a timely appeal.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.waller ex rel.estate of hunt city of danville,cir 
bethel principal appellate argument is that the county violated the substantial burden provision of rluipa.see a.that provision prohibits the imposition or implementation of any land use regulation in a manner that 
imposes a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person,including a religious assembly or institution,unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person,assembly,or institution 
a is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and 
is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.
id religious exercise includes t he use,building,or conversion of real property for the purpose of religious exercise.id.
before turning to the merits of bethel substantial burden claim,we note that the district court substantial burden analysis rested on two misunderstandings of the appropriate legal standards.we address these in turn.
first,in considering whether the county imposed a substantial burden on bethel religious exercise,the district court erred in applying,without any modification for the land use context,the standard applicable in rluipa institutionalized persons cases.
in the institutionalized persons context,we have defined a substantial burden on religious exercise as one in which a state or local government,through act or omission,put s substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.lovelace lee,cir.we borrowed this standard from the supreme court language in thomas review board of indiana employment security division,d,a case in which the court struck down as violative of the first amendment the government denial of unemployment benefits to a jehovah witness who quit his job in a war materials plant because of his religious beliefs.see at.this standard is entirely appropriate in the institutionalized persons context,since the government can employ its absolute control over prisoners like its absolute control over eligibility for unemployment benefits to pressure a person to violate his religious beliefs.
but the government lacks comparable control in the land use context.even government action preventing a religious organization from building a church will rarely,if ever,force the organization to violate its religious beliefs,because the organization can usually locate its church elsewhere.see westchester day sch.vill.of mamaroneck,cir i n the context of land use,a religious institution is not ordinarily faced with the dilemma of choosing between religious precepts and government benefits.thus,requiring a religious organization to prove that a land use regulation pressured it to violate its beliefs would be tantamount to eliminating rluipa substantial burden protection in the land use context.it seems very unlikely that congress intended this.
we note that no appellate court has applied an unmodified standard in the land use context.that is,none has required a plaintiff asserting that a land use regulation imposes a substantial burden in violation of rluipa to prove that the regulation pressures the plaintiff to violate its beliefs.rather,every one of our sister circuits to have considered the question has held that,in the land use context,a plaintiff can succeed on a substantial burden claim by establishing that a government regulation puts substantial pressure on it to modify its behavior.see westchester day,at in the land use context,courts appropriately speak of government action that directly coerces the religious institution to change its behavior emphasis in original guru nanak sikh soc y of yuba city cnty.of sutter,cir a substantial burden on religious exercise must impose a significantly great restriction or onus upon such exercise.internal quotation marks omitted midrash sephardi,town of surfside,cir a substantial burden is akin to significant pressure which directly coerces the religious adherent to conform his or her behavior accordingly.internal quotation marks omitted civil liberties for urban believers city of chicago,cir a regulation that imposes a substantial burden on religious exercise is one that necessarily bears direct,primary,and fundamental responsibility for rendering religious exercise including the use of real property for the purpose thereof within the regulated jurisdiction generally effectively impracticable.we believe that this standard best accords with rluipa.
the district court also erred in requiring bethel to show that the county targeted it in order to succeed on its substantial burden claim.see mot.hr g tr.at,no.pjm,there no way in which the court can find that bethel has been targeted this was a generic decision that preexisted even the presence of the church in the county.
of course,we recognize that when a plaintiff challenges an apparently neutral law of general applicability as violative of the first amendment,it must demonstrate that the statute targets its religious beliefs or practices.see emp t,dep t of human res.of or.smith,d t he right of free exercise does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a valid and neutral law of general applicability.internal quotation marks omitted see also church of the lukumi babalu aye,city of hialeah,d although a law targeting religious beliefs as such is never permissible,if the object of a law is to infringe upon or restrict practices because of their religious motivation,the law is not neutral.
the district court undoubtedly drew on this first amendment principle in requiring bethel to demonstrate that the county targeted it.but rluipa history indicates that congress intended that the statute do more than merely codify first amendment jurisprudence.see madison riter,cir explaining rluipa history see also smith ozmint,cir finding that rluipa protects an institutionalized person from a substantial burden on his religious exercise even when the burden is imposed by a neutral and generally applicable policy.moreover,rluipa statutory language and structure reflect this intent.
first,rluipa substantial burden provision says nothing about targeting.rather,it simply forbids government from imposing a substantial burden on religious exercise unless the government demonstrates that it has used the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest that is,unless the governmental action satisfies strict scrutiny.a.
moreover,as bethel points out,rluipa contains a separate provision forbidding discrimination.see id.b prohibiting government from imposing or implementing a land use regulation that discriminates against any assembly or institution on the basis of religion or religious denomination.in construing a statute,a court must presume that congress did not intend to enact superfluous provisions.see astoria fed.sav.loan ass solimino,d o f course we construe statutes,where possible,so as to avoid rendering superfluous any parts thereof.requiring a religious institution to show that it has been targeted on the basis of religion in order to succeed on a substantial burden claim would render the nondiscrimination provision superfluous.
therefore,it seems clear that the substantial burden provision protects against,as well as discriminatory,conduct that imposes a substantial burden on religion.accordingly,a religious organization asserting that a land use regulation has imposed a substantial burden on its religious exercise need not show that the land use regulation targeted it 
with these principles in mind,we turn to the merits of bethel substantial burden claim.
initially,we consider whether bethel has presented evidence of a triable issue of fact as to whether the county has imposed a substantial burden on its religious exercise.when a religious organization buys property reasonably expecting to build a church,governmental action impeding the building of that church may impose a substantial burden.see petra presbyterian church vill.of northbrook,cir o nce the organization has bought property reasonably expecting to obtain a permit,the denial of the permit may inflict a hardship on it.see also reaching hearts int l,prince george,d,aff by unpublished opinion,app x cir.this is so even though other suitable properties might be available,because the delay,uncertainty,and expense of selling the current property and finding a new one are themselves burdensome.see saints constantine helen greek orthodox church city of new berlin,cir.
the county contends that bethel could not reasonably expect to build a church when it purchased the brink road property because at that time the county had long been considering changes to its private institutional facilities policy to limit such institutional uses.further,the county argues,t here were no guarantees that bethel would get all the necessary approvals to build what it wanted.appellee br.at.but the county does not contest that it permitted churches in the rural density transfer zone at the time bethel bought the property,and modern zoning practices are su
