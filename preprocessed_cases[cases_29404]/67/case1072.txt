this case arises from a dispute between john bettendorf and croix county over the zoning of bettendorf property.pursuant to an ordinance enacted by the county in,a portion of bettendorf land was from to commercial.the ordinance contained a condition that the parcel would revert to upon the death of bettendorf or by bettendorf transfer of the parcel to a new owner.
in,bettendorf filed an action in the circuit court for croix county seeking a declaratory judgment that the conditional language was void and should be stricken from the ordinance.the circuit court found in favor of bettendorf on appeal,the wisconsin court of appeals held the ordinance void in its entirety.in july,the circuit court entered a revised judgment and order rescinding the commercial zoning of the disputed parcel in accordance with the court of appeals decision.the county complied with the order and rescinded the commercial permit.the case comes to us from the western district of wisconsin bettendorf is alleging constitutional rights violations in connection with the county rescinding the commercial zoning designation.after reviewing the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the county de novo,we affirm for the reasons set forth below.
background 
john bettendorf owns property located in croix county,a municipal entity and local government under wisconsin law.when bettendorf acquired the property,it was zoned.in,he began to operate a carpet sales and installation business out of his basement.by,he was also operating an excavating company and a trucking company on the property.
in december,bettendorf applied to the croix county planning,zoning,and parks committee to a portion of his property to commercial so that he could operate a trucking terminal there.the committee approved the request on condition that the commercial was only for bettendorf use and was not transferable.the committee recommendation to grant a limited permit for bettendorf to use the property for commercial activity was adopted and embodied in croix county ordinance.bettendorf used the property in a commercial manner after the ordinance was enacted but his counsel at oral argument stated that he has discontinued such use since the ordinance was invalidated.
ii.discussion 
bettendorf argues that the county removal of the commercial zoning designation following the court of appeals decision to invalidate the ordinance constitutes a taking.he also contends that the state court proceedings and resulting decision by the county to revoke the ordinance it had granted in did not provide adequate substantive and procedural due process protections.we disagree.
state law takings claim 
it is that to establish a regulatory taking for which just compensation is required under the fifth amendment and under wisconsin law,the challenged government action must deprive a landowner of all or substantially all practical uses of the property.eternalist foundation,city of platteville,all or substantially all sets a high bar for a plaintiff to recover on a takings claim.a regulatory or constructive taking will only be found where a government regulation has rendered the property practically useless for all reasonable purposes.zealy,at.the factors to be considered in determining whether a constructive taking has occurred include the nature of the government regulatory scheme,the severity of the economic impact on the challenging landowner,and the degree of interference with the landowner anticipated and distinct investment opportunities.concrete pipe and prods.inv.construction laborers pension trust,d zealy,at.bettendorf urges us to reverse the district court because it did not adequately consider the third factor.we believe it did.
the takings clause presupposes government interference with one property rights in pursuit of a public purpose.lingle chevron,d.as judge crabb noted in her opinion,bettendorf freely agreed to the conditional zoning provision.any improvements bettendorf made to his property were completed with full knowledge that the commercial designation would ultimately be lost.bettendorf knew the conditional language of the ordinance restricted his ability to recoup the value of his commercial investments when he was ready to sell and therefore petitioned the county to make the permanent.when the county refused,it was bettendorf who initiated litigation in order for the circuit court to construe the limits of the ordinance.while he hoped the litigation would result in a decision giving him greater freedom than the ordinance afforded him,the result instead limited the freedom he had previously enjoyed.that was a risk he assumed in asking the court to interpret the scope and validity of the ordinance,not a government interference with his investment opportunities 
in concluding our discussion of the takings claim,we note that while bettendorf did suffer as a result of losing the commercial designation to which he had grown accustomed,he retains full use of his property for agricultural and residential purposes.the county action does not render the property practically useless,as the takings jurisprudence requires.rather,it restores the land to its intended use at the time bettendorf acquired it.finding no government intrusion and no deprivation of all or substantially all practical use of bettendorf property,we can not find a compensable taking.
due process claims 
we now turn to bettendorf argument that substantive and procedural deficiencies violated his constitutional right to due process.
specifically,bettendorf claims he was denied the protection of the substantive legal standards that would have been applied to a change in zoning,as well as deprived of his right to a public hearing and consideration by the appropriate municipal decision makers.he contends the county deprived him of this right by failing to grant a petition for a complete of his property when the validity of the commercial designation and its conditional language came into dispute.in support of this argument,bettendorf directs the court to chapter of the croix county code of ordinances for land use and development.under section a of the code,appeals of administrative zoning decisions may be brought by persons aggrieved by those decisions or by representatives of the county,so long as the appeal is made within a reasonable time.if the county were to revoke the commercial zoning permit it previously granted bettendorf,as it did in this case,he argues the appropriate mechanism should have been the process outlined in the croix county code rather than the state court litigation that ultimately decided the matter.
bettendorf correctly states that the fourteenth amendment protects against state action that deprives a person of property without due process of law and that such protection extends to action taken by municipalities such as croix county.however,as the court of appeals of wisconsin has noted,a plaintiff who wishes to pursue a claim for an alleged violation of the right to substantive due process embarks on a difficult undertaking,especially if the claim involves zoning or other real property regulatory actions by a governmental body.eternalist,at.
at the outset,we note judge crabb observation in the district court opinion that it is not easy to make out what federal claims bettendorf is raising.in his brief before this court,bettendorf conflates substantive and procedural due process,stating that the facts and the law supporting both claims are largely indistinguishable.we disagree with this characterization.substantive due process is implicated in cases like the one before us only when a municipal body adverse decision in a zoning matter is arbitrary,oppressive,or unreasonable.id.at.in contrast,procedural due process focuses on the form of the procedures that the government must afford an individual given the particularities of the situation.doe heck,cir,citing doyle camelot care centers,cir.while the former relates to the propriety of the decision itself,the latter is concerned with the manner in which a decision is made.as this court has said repeatedly,the two are not to be confused.tun whitticker,cir dunn fairfield community high school,district,cir.
substantive due process 
bettendorf argument primarily focuses on procedural due process,but since he has also put substantive due process at issue,we will briefly address why he fails to make out a compensable claim for a substantive due process violation.
substantive due process is admittedly an amorphous concept.tun,at.it is perhaps for this reason that its scope remains very limited.id.at citing washington glucksberg,d.a government entity must have exercised its power without reasonable justification in a manner that shocks the conscience in order for a plaintiff to recover on substantive due process grounds.tun,at quoting rochin california.
the county decision to revoke the commercial designation can hardly be considered or arbitrary.after all,the action came in response to a judgment and court order invalidating the ordinance which purported to give bettendorf the right to exploit his property for a commercial purpose.in our view,noncompliance with the court order would have been more problematic than what resulted here.since the county was merely complying with a judgment from the wisconsin court of appeals,we find that the action taken was utterly reasonable and not a violation of substantive due process.
if bettendorf is arguing that the county actions took away his property rights in an arbitrary and capricious way without compensating him for the loss,the proper constitutional rubric to consider would be the takings jurisprudence,which we have already discussed and do not find applicable here.finding no taking and no violation of substantive due process,we now turn to the last question in this case,namely whether state court litigation provided adequate process,given that the county had its own alternative procedures for resolving zoning disputes.
procedural due process 
in order to prevail on a procedural due process claim,a property owner must show that he was deprived of a full and fair hearing to adjudicate his rights.where a claimant has availed himself of the remedies guaranteed by state law,due process is satisfied unless he can show that such remedies were inadequate.hudson palmer,d.the fundamental requirement is an opportunity to be heard granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.parratt taylor,d quoting armstrong manzo,d.as this court has noted,due process is flexible,requiring different procedural protections depending upon the situation at hand.doyle,at.for the reasons below,we find bettendorf was afforded adequate process in the state court system and will not reverse on procedural due process grounds.
in this case,the plaintiff himself initiated state court review of the ordinance which was ultimately held invalid.knowing that the county position on appeal was that the ordinance was invalid in its entirety,bettendorf was on notice that the ordinance could be struck down and his commercial rights rescinded.nothing in the record indicates that he was denied a full and fair opportunity to rebut the county position before the wisconsin court of appeals.bettendorf claims the state court process was inadequate,but he initiated that process himself and could have instead chosen to confine the proceedings to the appeals process set forth in the croix county code.the fact that he bypassed an appeals process which he now suggests must be followed as a matter of constitutional fairness seriously undermines his argument that the state court process was deficient.against the backdrop of events leading up to this court decision,bettendorf procedural due process argument strikes us as a last ditch effort to undo the adequate process because it did not produce the anticipated result.
as judge crabb put it,the fact that an alternative remedy existed in the croix county code is irrelevant.so long as a separate,constitutionally adequate path was employed,there can be no procedural due process violation under the flexible standards that govern.the circuit court for croix county was asked to construe the validity of an ordinance,a task well within its discretion.the county appealed and the wisconsin court of appeals responded with a reasoned and thorough analysis of the ordinance and its scope.
bettendorf now claims the appeals process outlined in the county code would have provided more or better process than the state court proceedings.this is speculative.it is also irrelevant.the due process clause requires that a claimant receive adequate process,not the most advantageous process available to him.in any event,we agree with the county that if bettendorf thought the county process was superior to litigating in state court,the option to pursue that path was available to him when the county denied his request to make the commercial permanent.having chosen the constitutionally sound path of state court litigation,bettendorf must now live with the consequences of that choice.
iii.conclusion 
finding no taking and no violation of substantive or procedural due process,we affirm.
i agree with my colleagues that plaintiff bettendorf has no viable due process claim here,and i join those portions of judge bauer opinion.i respectfully dissent,however,from my colleagues decision to affirm the dismissal of plaintiff takings claim under state law.
the majority decision gives our court approval,on bare pleadings,to a rare and extraordinary burden on property rights.the majority is saying that a local government can first designate a lawful use of property,allowing a property owner to make substantial investments in the property and to use it that way for more than years,and then state courts,at the request of the local government,can suddenly outlaw the continued use without compensation for the property owner.
to review the key facts,first,the plaintiff began using his land for a commercial use that was not then authorized by county zoning laws.the county could have taken enforcement action against him then but chose not to do so.instead,at plaintiff request,the county amended the zoning to allow commercial use of the property.in an unusual step,the county limited the commercial zoning designation to the period of plaintiff ownership of the property,but it was clear that plaintiff was legally allowed to continue the commercial use as long as he owned the property and did not assign the commercial use to anyone else.the plaintiff relied on that change in the law and invested several hundred thousand dollars to take advantage of the new zoning.when the plaintiff filed a lawsuit in state court to remove the limitation to his own ownership of the property,he claims that the county went so far as to assert that he should be fined for his operation of a commercial enterprise on the property for the preceding years.the state courts eventually concluded that the entire ordinance and special use permit were void,so that continued commercial use is now deemed illegal.the plaintiff can no longer use his property as he has lawfully used it since the zoning change in.
the takings analysis here should be straightforward.i agree with my colleagues that there is no apparent difference between federal and wisconsin state takings analysis,so i draw on both sources of law in trying to predict how the wisconsin supreme court would apply the law here.plaintiff bettendorf has what courts sometimes call vested rights and more recently call expectations in his continued use of the property in a way that has been lawful for many years,and in which he made substantial investments.the loss of those vested rights and investments through a retroactive change of the zoning ordinance should be a compensable taking.
my colleagues dispose of bettendorf takings claim with a single footnote dedicated to the vested rights issue.they criticize plaintiff for referring only vaguely to his vested rights argument.ante at.i disagree.the argument seems to me to be presented adequately.the unfairness of the change in the local law,upsetting plaintiff reasonable reliance and undermining his substantial investments,is palpable and obvious.it does not take an elaborate argument to put the issue squarely before a state or federal court.in other words,there is no need for a separate vested rights claim under federal law or state law.the concept can be understood as simply part of the regulatory takings claim that plaintiff has asserted under wisconsin law.
the label vested right is a shorthand and conclusory label in property law for important property rights resulting from prior transactions,contracts,and uses of property.the concept has a long and winding history as an integral part of american property law,from the earliest days of the union.see,vanhorne lessee dorrance,dall.it is immaterial to the state,in which of its citizens the land is vested but it is of primary importance,that,when vested,it should be secured,and the proprietor protected in the enjoyment of it.the constitution encircles,and renders it an holy thing.fletcher peck,cranch.when,then,a law is in its nature a contract,when absolute rights have vested under that contract,a repeal of the law can not devest those rights.wilkinson leland,pet.we know of no case,in which a legislative act to transfer the property of to without his consent,has ever been held a constitutional exercise of legislative power on the contrary,it has been constantly resisted as inconsistent with just principles,by every judicial tribunal in which it has been attempted to be enforced.
the concept of vested rights has not had just a single home in the law.it has evolved primarily as a doctrine of state common law or constitutional law,and it also can be embodied in state and local zoning and similar statutory schemes.see,bickerstaff clay products harris county,cir doctrine of vested rights applied by district court derived from doctrine of equitable estoppel lakeview development city of south lake tahoe,cir vested rights doctrine was concept of state law,a species of government estoppel lake bluff housing partners city of south milwaukee,detailing the concept of vested rights in wisconsin law.stat.a prohibiting new zoning ordinances from interfering with existing lawful uses.
as a concept in federal constitutional law,vested rights emerged long before the supreme court recognized regulatory takings under the takings clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments.see,in re taylor,cir noting that if appellant had vested right in property in question,it could not be taken away without due process and a hearing in court city of chicago new york,cir and of course a vested property right can not be taken away without just compensation or due process of law,citing grand trunk south bend.chicago title trust bashford,devesting of vested right in property would violate due process clause of fourteenth amendment.vested rights were long thought of as part of due process analysis,which can produce some confusion.was the theory some form of substantive due process and if not,how could more procedure justify the loss of those rights also,the vested right label has been ambiguous in at least one important respect.are vested rights untouchable under any circumstances,or can the government interfere with them as long as it pays just compensation but the concept of vested rights has migrated at least in it is still constitutional law to the modern jurisprudence of regulatory takings,where it fits much more neatly.the government can take away the vested right,but only if it pays just compensation.
under modern regulatory takings cases,whether a regulatory change interferes with the existing,lawful use of the property is a critical consideration in determining whether a compensable regulatory taking has occurred.see penn central transportation city of new york,d existing use of property was a consideration in evaluating whether there was a taking in seminal regulatory takings case.let take those elements one at a time.
first,plaintiff commercial use has been lawful,at least since the amendment to the zoning ordinance.we should take for granted in american law that a property owner should be able to rely on the facial validity of local zoning ordinances.a property owner should be able to invest his or her own money,and lenders and investors should be able to take risks as well,based on compliance with the face of the local ordinances.it should not be necessary to test the validity of those ordinances in court before those investments can be made with confidence.
the lawfulness of plaintiff commercial use distinguishes this case decisively from two cases cited by the majority that rejected vested rights claims when local governments took action to end uses of property that had been illegal.see general auto service station city of chicago,cir sign painted on side of building had been illegal for many years,and unlawfulness prevented owner from having acquired vested rights in use under state law petra presbyterian church village of northbrook,cir church did not acquire vested right by using warehouse illegally as church.in both cases,we rejected vested rights claims by distinguishing between prior uses that were legal and those that were illegal.these cases do not undermine bettendorf takings claim based on rights having vested in his prior legal use of his property.
second,plaintiff has actually been making commercial use of the property since the amendment to the zoning ordinance.in regulatory takings jurisprudence,the fact that a regulatory change prohibits what had been an actual,lawful use ought to be decisive in the vast majority of cases,and probably including plaintiff bettendorf case.
that much is clear under the test derived from penn central and concrete pipe and products of california,construction laborers pension trust,d.the three factors are the nature of the government action,the severity of the economic impact on the owner,and the degree of interference with the owner reasonable expectations.first,the nature of the government action in this case is a prohibition on what had been a lawful,established use.in one of the puzzling aspects of this case,the sparse record here does not show any particular government interest that is served by prohibiting commercial use of plaintiff property.second,the severity of the economic impact on the owner is difficult to gauge on the pleadings,but we should assume that it is substantial.several hundred thousand dollars of investments will lose or have already lost much or perhaps all of their remaining value.the bare pleadings do not provide details about expected useful lives of buildings,depreciation schedules,salvage value,and the like,which would be needed to be more precise.third,there should be no doubt that the interference with reasonable expectations is dramatic.the rather awkward phrase is most useful when applying the regulatory takings test to a government action that prohibits or modifies a planned future use of property when the property owner has already begun making substantial investments to prepare for the new use.the phrase also clearly applies to substantial investments in an established lawful use.
my colleagues explain away the third factor here by noting that the plaintiff freely agreed to the conditional zoning provision that limited the commercial zoning to his ownership of the property.that is correct,and the result should substantially reduce the amount of compensation that the plaintiff is due.his takings claim should not be decided as if he had a right to sell the property with the commercial zoning in place but he did have a right to expect the county to abide by the ordinance it enacted,allowing him to continue the commercial use as long as he owned the property.that expectation was entirely reasonable and was backed up with substantial investments.
my colleagues dismiss the third factor by disregarding the difference between having to stop the commercial use now and having to stop it some years hence,upon the plaintiff death or sale of the property.it is as if we were telling a widow with a life estate in her residence that forcing her to leave the property now will not cause her any loss because she had only a limited right to begin with.the difference between the immediate prohibition on commercial use of plaintiff property and the original limitation that he agreed to is equ
