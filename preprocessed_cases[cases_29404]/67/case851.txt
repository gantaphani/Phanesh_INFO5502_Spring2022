commercial technology,cti was found by a jury to have violated the texas uniform fraudulent transfer act tufta when it transferred real property to electric gas technology,a related entity.on appeal,cti claims that there was insufficient evidence supporting the jury findings that cti violated tufta,that the district court erred in its admission of.b evidence,and that the district court erred in denying cti motion for judgment as a matter of law on its statute of limitations claim.
background procedural history 
in,caddo capital corporation caddo loaned cti.caddo was a small business investment company licensed by the small business administration sba.caddo loaned the funds to cti under the small business investment act,a federal program designed to increase the availability of capital to small businesses by channeling federal funds to such companies.
in december,caddo sued cti in state court after cti defaulted on its payment obligations under the promissory note.on june,caddo obtained a final judgment against cti for,plus interest,attorney fees,and court costs.on june,the dallas county clerk office issued,filed,and recorded an abstract of judgment against cti in favor of caddo.almost three years later,on may,caddo assigned all of its rights in the judgment to the united states the government,on behalf of the sba.
in,approximately one year before the judgment originally obtained by caddo was to become dormant under texas property law,the government retained the services of a company to identify potential assets of cti the government contractor made contact with mort zimmerman,the president of cti,by letter in april and may.neither cti nor zimmerman responded to either of the government letters between june and may,the government continued its investigation into the existence of cti assets.a title search in dallas county revealed one piece of real property in cti office building located at neutron road in dallas,texas the neutron road property.ownership by cti was confirmed by an examination of the public records for the dallas county appraisal district and the farmers branch property records.
on may,the government obtained a writ of execution on the neutron road property however,attempts at levying the writ proved unsuccessful.the government thereafter sought to renew the caddo abstract of judgment.on june,the government recorded a new abstract of judgment the first government abstract against cti for the amounts due it under the assignment from caddo.the first government abstract was later replaced by a corrected abstract of judgment the corrected abstract,which was issued on july,and recorded with the dallas county clerk office on august,
in november,the government sought to enforce its judgment against cti through the judicial sale of the neutron road property.however,cti contested the sale,alleging that it only owned the neutron road property until may.the events that are alleged to have transpired on may,bear great weight on this case,and therefore a detailed summary account of these alleged actions is necessary.
cti claims that on may,while the suit brought against it by caddo was pending,cti transferred the neutron road property to one of its subsidiaries,e.the neutron road property had originally been part of the security for a commercial loan between cti and allied american bank for which cti executed a note secured by deed of trust in favor of allied american bank.by may,a number of other liens had attached to the neutron road property as well.on may,allied american bank transferred the deed of trust and lien to first texas bank,for which allied american bank was paid.
also on may,cti executed a new deed of trust on the neutron road property in favor of first texas bank for an obligation owed by e to first texas bank in the principal amount of.cti also executed a hypothecation agreement hypothecation agreement dated may,by which cti agreed to allow the neutron road property to be pledged as security for future loans from first texas bank to e.the deed of trust and hypothecation agreement were recorded in the dallas county clerk office on may,and the transfer of lien was recorded on june.
however,it was not until november,than eleven years after the deed of trust,hypothecation agreement,and transfer of lien were executed and cti recorded a warranty deed and purchase agreement both dated may,which purported to show that the neutron road property had been sold by cti to e on may.cti argued that the original warranty deed and purchase agreement had been lost by the title company,which cti claimed had gone bankrupt and thus had failed to record the instruments.
notwithstanding cti contention that it no longer owned the neutron road property,the government filed a complaint in district court in november,seeking a judicial sale of the neutron road property to satisfy its judgment against cti pursuant to the federal debt collections procedure act fdcpa,et.after the district court entered an order denying the government initial application for enforcement of judgment and sale of real property the government amended its complaint in august,adding a claim against cti under tufta.bus.et.the essence of the government tufta claim was its challenge of the purported may,transfer of the neutron road property from cti to e.
in,the tufta case was tried to a jury,which found that cti had violated the act by fraudulently transferring the neutron road property to e.specifically,the jury determined that e did not take the property in good faith nor for reasonably equivalent value.cti now timely appeals.

discussion 
whether there was sufficient evidence to support a jury finding that cti transferred the neutron road property to e in violation of tufta.
on appeal,cti argues that it did not violate tufta because the transfer of the neutron road property occurred on may,and e paid value for the property.
a.when the neutron road property was transferred for purposes of tufta.
cti offers two theories to support its contention that the transfer of the neutron road property occurred on may.first,it insists that the hypothecation agreement executed on may,was sufficient to convey title to the neutron road property from cti to e.in the alternative,cti insists that the copies of the warranty deed and the purchase agreement it recorded on november,were previously executed on may,and that the date should control.in response,the government points to numerous cti corporate documents that appear to not only contradict relevant bank documents,but also the testimony of cti own witnesses.
the hypothecation agreement 
in order to determine whether there was a conveyance of the neutron road property from cti to e on may,we must first establish the legal effect of the hypothecation agreement.in the hypothecation agreement,cti pledged the neutron road property as collateral so that first texas bank would extend credit to e.the hypothecation agreement stated in pertinent part 
f or the purpose of enabling e to obtain credit therefor,cti hereby certifies that the said property has been duly assigned,released,transferred,and delivered by cti to e,and by these presents cti hereby assign s,release s,and transfer s unto e all of cti right,title,and interest in and to said property,and hereby expressly authorize s e to pledge or hypothecate all or any part of said property for the indebtedness aforesaid,and all renewals and extensions thereof,and also for any and all other indebtedness of the same borrower to you 
emphasis added.
the texas property code provides that a n instrument that is properly recorded in the proper county is notice to all persons of the existence of the instrument.see also resolution trust kemp,cir.texas law extends this principle further,recognizing that an instrument properly recorded is notice,not only of facts therein expressly set forth,but also of all other material facts which an inquiry thereby reasonably suggested would have disclosed.housman horn,citation omitted see also westland oil dev.gulf oil,it is well settled that a purchaser is bound by every recital,reference and reservation contained in or fairly disclosed by any instrument which forms an essential link in the chain of title under which he claims.internal quotations and citations omitted lang city of nacogdoches,writ denied a person is charged with constructive notice of the actual knowledge that could have been acquired by examining public records,and that constructive notice in law creates an irrebuttable presumption of actual notice.
cti contends that the government should be charged,as a matter of law,with constructive knowledge of the contents of the hypothecation agreement and with all other facts that a inquiry would have revealed.matter of estate of matejek,christi,writ denied see also resolution trust,at.the government response has two elements.first,it argues that the hypothecation agreement simply did not function to transfer title.the government relies on the general principle that a hypothecation agreement is a pledge,an encumbrance rather than a deed translative of title or ownership.second,the government contends that whether the hypothecation agreement gave constructive notice of the transfer is an issue of fact,not law.
as a general matter,the government is correct in its assertion that to hypothecate is to pledge property as security or collateral for a debt,without delivery of title or possession.black law dictionary ed.alteration in original.however,whether a hypothecation necessarily involves delivering title or possession does not appear to address the fact that even a pledge could fall under tufta definition of transfer.tufta defines transfer broadly to include every mode,direct or indirect,absolute or conditional,voluntary or involuntary,of disposing of or parting with an asset or an interest in an asset,and includes payment of money,release,lease,and creation of a lien or other encumbrance.bus.emphasis added.even if the hypothecation agreement could not transfer title to the neutron road property,the encumbrance created by the hypothecation agreement may well have been a transfer under tufta.
however,before we address whether a hypothecation is a transfer under tufta,we must first determine the true meaning and scope of the hypothecation agreement at issue here.in construing a contract under texas law,courts must examine and consider the entire writing and give effect to all provisions such that none are rendered meaningless.int l turbine,vasp brazilian airlines,cir.there are two steps to an ambiguity analysis of a contract.flagship hotel,city of galveston,writ denied.first,a court applies the applicable rules of construction and decides if the contract is ambiguous.id.if the court finds the contract is ambiguous,the trier of fact considers the parties interpretation and other extraneous evidence.id.
cti certified in the hypothecation agreement that the neutron road property was duly assigned,released,transferred,and delivered by cti to e,adding that cti assigned,released,and transferred to e all of cti right,title,and interest in and to said property.on its face,this portion of the instrument appears to fully contemplate an absolute transfer of the neutron road property from cti to e.however,when read with the provision immediately following the above statement,this conclusion is called into doubt.the next provision of the hypothecation agreement states that cti hereby expressly authorize s e to pledge or hypothecate all or any part of said property for the indebtedness aforesaid.if cti had truly transferred the neutron road property to e outright,then cti express authorization to e to pledge or hypothecate the neutron road property as collateral for future loans would certainly be unnecessary.it seems odd to transfer all right,title,and interest in real property to someone and at the same time expressly authorize that person to do certain things with the property after the transfer has been effectuated.in addition,the hypothecation agreement provides that e may pledge the neutron road property as collateral for any and all indebtedness it seeks to create at any time before this authorization shall have been revoked in writing.cti retention of a power to revoke further indicates that the hypothecation agreement was not intended to be an outright conveyance of the neutron road property.
although cti contends that the hypothecation agreement served to transfer the neutron road property to e,a simple reading of the instrument reveals that it is susceptible to more than one interpretation.as such,an ambiguity exists as to the meaning and scope of the hypothecation agreement.therefore,to determine the legal effect of the instrument,it becomes necessary to look at the intent and conduct of the parties.
as noted previously,cti argues that it sold the neutron road property to e on may.however,it was not until november,that the corresponding warranty deed and purchase agreement reflecting this transfer were recorded in the dallas county clerk office.substantial evidence shows that,in these intervening eleven years,cti held itself out as the owner of the neutron road property.for instance,government tax records show cti as the owner of the neutron road property as late as december.specifically,during the period from to,both the dallas county appraisal district and the dallas county tax collector issued property tax statements to cti as owner of the neutron road property.in addition,on november,cti,through zimmerman,executed a deed of trust,security agreement,an assignment of rent,and a financing statement involving the neutron road property to secure the indebtedness and obligations therein to cit finance,another creditor.this deed of trust was filed of record with the dallas county clerk office on december.moreover,on april,cti,through zimmerman,executed a deed of trust to secure a promissory note payable to first texas bank.this deed of trust was filed of record with the dallas county clerk office on june.
based on the terms of the hypothecation agreement and the conduct of cti and e after executing the agreement,we interpret the hypothecation agreement as simply being a pledge from cti to e as collateral for obtaining future loans and not as an instrument conveying title to e.
warranty deed and purchase agreement 
in the alternative,cti claims that although the warranty deed and purchase agreement were recorded in november,both instruments were actually executed on may.therefore,cti argues that title to the neutron road property was passed from cti to e on the date of execution,not the date of recordation.
at trial cti was unable to satisfactorily explain to the jury why it had two different,but executed,versions of each document dated may.examination of the two copies of the warranty deed and the two copies of the purchase agreement reveal that the signatures and text alignment are different.in addition,the notary blocks bear different and inconsistent dates for expiration,and one version of the notary block is handwritten whereas the other is typed.cti also failed to explain how the title company it claimed had gone bankrupt managed to properly file and record the deed of trust,transfer of lien,and hypothecation agreement,but failed to file and record the warranty deed and purchase agreement when all five instruments were al
