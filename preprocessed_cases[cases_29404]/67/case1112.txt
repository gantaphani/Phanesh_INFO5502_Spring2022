david johnson acquired a certificate of purchase on a parcel of land in cook county,illinois the county for which taxes had not been paid.ordinarily the holder of a certificate of purchase can acquire a tax deed from the county if the owner of the property does not pay the delinquent taxes,but,in this instance,it turned out that the county had been mistaken about the delinquency.with johnson explicit consent,a state circuit court judge entered an order directing that the tax sale be rescinded,johnson money be returned and the certificate of purchase be cancelled.johnson nevertheless petitioned the state court to compel the county to issue him a tax deed,and when that request was denied,he filed this action claiming that the county clerk and other county officials had violated his civil rights under,the interstate land sales full disclosure act,and illinois state law.the district court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction under both the doctrine and the tax injunction act.because we agree that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over johnson claims under the doctrine,we affirm its judgment.
background 
in,cook county concluded that the property taxes for a particular parcel of real estate had not been paid.under illinois law,when an owner fails to pay taxes on real estate,the county collector and the county clerk bring an in rem action in state court and request permission to sell the accrued taxes,special assessments,interest and penalties.see ilcs wilder finnegan,d.in may,the county sold the delinquent taxes to z financial,llc,and issued z financial a certificate of purchase.see ilcs.z financial later sold the certificate of purchase to johnson.illinois law thus entitled johnson,as the tax purchaser,to receive a tax deed for the property if he sent and published the required notices informing the delinquent taxpayer of the right to redeem the property by repaying the delinquencies,see ilcs,and then successfully petitioned the state circuit court,within three to six months of the end of the redemption period,for an order directing the county clerk to issue the deed.see ilcs,cook county circuit.
johnson complied with the notice provisions.before he petitioned the circuit court for a tax deed,however,the county sought a judicial declaration that the tax sale was in error because the parcel was owned by a government entity and therefore was exempt from property taxes.see ilcs a.on september,johnson and the county entered into an agreed order declaring that the tax sale was in error and directing that the certificate of sale be surrendered within ten days,that the certificate be cancelled and that the county treasurer refund the purchase price plus costs and interest.the illinois circuit court entered the order.johnson does not allege that the county failed to return the money and cancel the certificate of purchase.
despite the entry of the agreed order,johnson petitioned the illinois circuit court to order the county clerk to issue him the tax deed for the property.apparently his first application did not follow the proper form,and the circuit court granted him leave to file an amended application,which he did in november.the record contains no further information regarding the outcome of johnson application,although the complaint in this case states that no deed was issued to johnson.
one year later,in october,johnson filed this action.he claims that,by refusing to issue him a tax deed,the county violated his constitutional rights to due process,equal protection and freedom from illegal searches and seizures that the county defrauded him in violation of the interstate land sales full disclosure act and that the county actions ran afoul of state statutes and illinois common law.in his complaint,johnson does not even acknowledge the existence of the agreed order.the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.in granting the motion,the district court concluded that johnson was asking,in effect,that the district court review and overturn the agreed order entered in state court,a remedy that the doctrine prohibits.the district court also concluded that the tax injunction act barred the exercise of federal jurisdiction because giving johnson the relief he requests would interfere with illinois tax collection practices.
discussion 
we review de novo a district court determination that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over a dispute.vill.of depue,exxon mobil,cir.where a party raises the issue of subject matter jurisdiction,a court need not simply rely on the facts alleged in the complaint,but also may consider extrinsic evidence to determine whether it can exercise jurisdiction.see hay.state bd.of tax comm rs,cir.
the district court reasoned that,under the doctrine,it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over johnson claims.the doctrine states that federal courts,other than the supreme court,do not have jurisdiction to review decisions of state courts in civil cases.see exxon mobil saudi basic indus,d hemmer.state bd.of animal health,cir holt lake county bd.of comm rs,cir.the doctrine deprives federal courts of subject matter jurisdiction where a party,dissatisfied with a result in state court,sues in federal court seeking to set aside the judgment and requesting a remedy for an injury caused by that judgment.see exxon mobil,at.all nations church city of chicago,cir.if the injury the plaintiff complains of resulted from,or is inextricably intertwined with,a judgment,then lower federal courts can not hear the claim.taylor fed.mortgage ass n,cir.is inapplicable,however,when the alleged injury is distinct from the judgment.for instance,it is inapplicable when the federal claim alleges a prior injury that a state court failed to remedy.centres,town of brookfield,cir see also long shorebank dev,cir.
johnson alleges that he has been injured by the court failure to issue him a tax deed.this alleged injury stems directly from the illinois circuit court entry of the agreed order it is that very order that deprived johnson of the right to receive the tax deed and relieved the defendants of any obligation to deed the property to him.in essence,johnson is complaining because the defendants are following the circuit court order.see ritter ross,cir holding that bars subject matter jurisdiction where but for the judgment the plaintiff would have no claim see also holt,at.
it is of no consequence that johnson complaint does not challenge specifically the agreed order.nor is it relevant that he has characterized his grievance as a civil rights claim.to determine whether bars a claim,we look beyond the four corners of the complaint to discern the actual injury claimed by the plaintiff.remer burlington area sch,cir looking to the substance of the plaintiff claim to determine whether applies.a litigant may not attempt to circumvent the effect of and seek a reversal of a state court judgment simply by casting the complaint in the form of a civil rights action.holt,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.johnson county refusal to issue him a tax caused by the agreed order.he can not avoid the by alleging that he suffered this injury as a result of violations of his constitutional rights.therefore,we agree with the district court that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over johnson civil rights claims.
johnson claims that the doctrine does not apply because he has not lost any decision and has not been injured by a state court judgment.appellant br.we can not accept these arguments.johnson ignores that he consented to the agreed order terms,characterizes it as an order that d efendants have drafted and describes it as void.id.in his brief,however,johnson does not dispute that the order was a final decision of the state circuit court.at oral argument his attorney submitted that the agreed order was not final.we disagree.a settlement approved by a state court is a judgment for purposes of.crestview vill.apartments dep t of hous.urban,cir quoting town of cicero,cir.in illinois,an agreed order constitutes a settlement.see buntrock terra,d,observing that an order entered by consent is equ
