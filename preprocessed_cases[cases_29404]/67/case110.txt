in this diversity case,plaintiff mark frappier sued defendant countrywide home loans,countrywide,alleging that countrywide engaged in prohibited predatory lending practices with respect to his home mortgage loan for a property at matthews road in southwick,massachusetts the home.the district court granted countrywide motion for summary judgment,and frappier appeals.
frappier and his second wife purchased the home in with an mortgage loan.over the next six years,he refinanced the loan four times,each time pulling more equity out of the property.the further refinancing at issue in this case was precipitated by frappier march divorce from his third wife,pursuant to which frappier was required either to sell the home by a set deadline or to refinance the then existing mortgage loan to remove his name from the loan.
at first,frappier tried to sell the home,applying with his new girlfriend for a mortgage loan from countrywide on another southwick property the south longyard road property,contingent upon the sale of the home.countrywide loan originator richard mamuszka,who was paid by countrywide strictly on commission,was the employee who worked with frappier and his girlfriend on their loan application in this transaction and with frappier in his subsequent transactions.sometimes the couple met with mamuszka but usually the dealings were by telephone.
in this and in the later applications,frappier provided information and mamuszka filled in the application form,this first one being completed in august.frappier says that the couple were seeking a loan,requiring verification of income and assets,and that he submitted such documents.countrywide asserts that the application was for a stated income,stated asset sisa mortgage loan,which involves little verification but is based largely on the borrowers credit score and asserted income.
frappier completed south longyard road property application stated,inaccurately,that his employment position was operations manager at a parish church,that his monthly base employment income was,that he received in monthly social security income,and that his total monthly income was therefore.in fact,frappier was earning about per month as a janitor at the church,and received per month in disability retirement income,for a total income of per month.
frappier states in an affidavit,not inconsistent with his less precise deposition testimony,that he submitted the correct income documentation to mamuszka,including tax returns showing an employment income of about per month in and,and that he never told mamuszka to list his occupation as operations manager or to inflate his income mamuszka testified in his deposition that he never inflated a borrower occupation title or income so that the borrower could qualify for a loan.the south longyard road property loan was approved but never effectuated because frappier was unable to sell his home in the time required by his divorce agreement.
because frappier was unable to sell the home,he was obligated to refinance his existing mortgage,and in september he asked mamuszka about obtaining a refinancing.on september,mamuszka took by telephone frappier application for what the parties agree was a sisa mortgage loan.frappier income and job were the same as before.the application listed frappier occupation as operations manager and his base employment income as per month unlike the prior application,it did not list any social security income.again,the parties now dispute who was to blame for the false statements.
the closing date on which frappier signed the mortgage application and the mortgage loan october.although frappier testimony is not clear on this point,his subsequent sworn affidavit asserts that he never received a copy of his loan application or any other documents before october.frappier also testified that at the closing he blindly signed but did not read the loan application or other papers that countrywide attorney told him to sign because earlier mamuszka said he take care of it.he said to sign this i take care of it,and you be all set.the documents state,of course,that the signer has read them and that the information set forth is correct 
countrywide then provided frappier with a loan in the amount of,secured by a mortgage on the home,with a fixed interest rate of percent for the first seven years and an adjustable rate of up to percent for the remainder of the loan.the loan made frappier payments total between and per month similar to the monthly payments on the home that frappier and his third wife were making before their divorce.
on november,three weeks after the first home mortgage loan closed mamuszka took by telephone a second home mortgage application for frappier,this time in the amount of as an equity loan for the home,frappier aiming to pay off credit card debt and various obligations incident to the divorce.the second mortgage was a mortgage at percent,which would require additional monthly payments of about.
this application once again listed frappier occupation as operations manager but now listed his total monthly income as the sum of the false base employment income figure used in both of frappier earlier mortgage applications and in monthly social security disability income.frappier again says he never provided the false information and did not read the papers before signing them countrywide asserts that mamuszka obtained everything from frappier himself.the second home mortgage loan closed on december.
in or around february,frappier began to have trouble making payments on both mortgage loans,and he defaulted on the loans later in the year.countrywide foreclosed on the home and in february,sent frappier a form listing the balance of principal outstanding for his mortgage as and the fair market value of the property as.
in may,frappier filed suit against countrywide in massachusetts state court,alleging a violation of.laws ch.chapter,unjust enrichment,a violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,negligence,and entitlement to equitable relief,namely,rescission of the loan note and an injunction ordering the removal of the loan from his credit history.the complaint theory was that countrywide fraudulently inflated his occupation title and income so that it could qualify him for a mortgage loan for which he would not have otherwise qualified and which countrywide knew he could not repay.if not for the mortgage loan,frappier alleged,he could have sold the property,paid off his prior mortgage,had more than left over from the equity,not suffered a loan default,and not lost the value of the payments he made to countrywide through.
countrywide removed the case to federal court and moved for summary judgment,which frappier opposed,cross moving himself.thereafter,the district court granted countrywide motion,finding that frappier had produced no evidence that countrywide knew,believed,or intended that frappier would default.the court noted that the mortgage required monthly payments similar to the prior mortgage on the house and that frappier himself attributed the default to several unforeseeable factors,such as a change in job and increased heating costs.frappier then appealed.

countrywide argues that frappier himself conceded that he had supplied mamuszka with the critical false statement that his base monthly income was.it points to its own assertion to this effect at the end of paragraph of its statement of undisputed material facts that frappier own failed to deny.but this was patently an oversight frappier own statement elsewhere asserted that at no time did he instruct or request mamuszka to inflate his income above its true monthly figure,and he had denied in his deposition and affidavit that
