csx transportation,csxt used to own and operate a stretch of track near montezuma,indiana.after the surface transportation board authorized csxt to abandon the track,the montezuma grain company montezuma grain and the redevelopment commission of parke county,indiana,county moved to reopen the abandonment proceedings.the board denied their motion,and montezuma grain and the county now petition us for review.the petition is denied.
background 
this case concerns two segments of a contiguous stretch of track running west from highway in montezuma to the junction with csxt main line in hillsdale,indiana.the eastern mile segment east segment was part of a longer line that was authorized for abandonment in icc docket no.montezuma abandonment.the western segment west segment was authorized to be abandoned in stb docket no.hillsdale abandonment.montezuma grain and the county have withdrawn that part of their petition seeking review of the board decision in stb finance docket.
a.the montezuma abandonment 
in july csxt filed an application under,which authorizes abandonment or discontinuance of a railroad line if public convenience and necessity so require,seeking to abandon a line that it owned and operated near montezuma.the application accurately identified the line to be abandoned as that running west from milepost in bloomingdale to milepost in montezuma,which corresponds to the line intersection point with county road.in addition to the milepost designations,csxt application included a schematic drawing that showed the track proposed for abandonment by means of a series of x marks.the last x extended to a point just slightly west of where the line intersects highway,located at milepost.county road was not identified on the drawing,nor was it identified in the application as corresponding to milepost.csxt noted in its application that further abandonment from milepost to milepost in hillsdale was anticipated within the next three years.
the county filed a comment within the protest period,taking no position with regard to the proposed montezuma abandonment but stating that it would be concerned if csxt later sought to abandon the track west of milepost.evident from the letters and petitions attached to the comment,however,is that the county was operating under the mistaken belief that milepost corresponded to highway and not county road.for instance one letter from members of the redevelopment commission explained that the county was involved in a major planning effort for the development of land from the western edge of to the wabash river,through which area csx rail continues to have an active line.the preservation of this active line is crucial to our planning and to our ability to attract industry.the letter later states that the members of the commission wish to go on record as being committed to protesting any further abandonment west of and,specifically,any future efforts to abandon the line from that point west to hillsdale.in a similar vein,petitions signed by county residents expressed opposition to any future abandonment because it would have a severely negative impact on county plans to develop an industrial park in the area now serviced by the rail from west to hillsdale.
csxt response,dated august,only added to the confusion surrounding the location of the west terminus of the proposed abandonment.noting that the county comment raised two separate and distinct issues the proposed abandonment of track between mileposts and,and the possible future abandonment of track to the west of milepost addressed these concerns as follows 
it is obvious that the letters and petitions attached to the comment also only intended to express opposition to the possible future abandonment filing by csxt of its line of railroad between hillsdale and montezuma.for example,the petitions signed by interested residents of parke county,indiana,indicate that they are opposed to any abandonment that will adversely affect,or have a negative impact on county plans to develop an industrial park in the area now served by rail from west to hillsdale.the area of concern being referred to in the petition is not included in csxt proposed abandonment between montezuma and bloomingdale which is the subject matter of this proceeding.that area would,however,be included in any prospective abandonment filing between montezuma and hillsdale.
the letters from the parke county industrial development committee and from mitchell vogel also refer to the development of an industrial park at montezuma and ensuring that rail service east from hillsdale to the west side of be maintained.once again these areas are not involved in this docket,but would be included in an abandonment filing between montezuma and hillsdale.
it is therefore clear that the comments of the various letters and petitions attached relate solely to retaining rail service between hillsdale and montezuma.they do not relate to the rail line at issue in this proceeding,which involves csxt rail line between montezuma and bloomingdale.
in a second comment to the board,the county reiterated that it had no objection to the proposed montezuma abandonment.but once again,the comment misidentified the west end of the abandonment as corresponding to highway and not county road the redevelopment commission continue s to actively support the county effort to develop an industrial park along the csx line that will remain between montezuma and,and appreciate s csx transportation apparent willingness to work with us and other county entities towards this goal.upon receipt of this comment,the board granted csxt application as unopposed,and in september csxt filed a letter with the board confirming consummation of abandonment.
it was not until january,when csxt began dismantling track a short distance west of highway,that the county became aware of its mistake regarding the west terminus of the abandonment.it promptly sent a letter to csxt,stating that t here now appears to be a misunderstanding as to the exact location of the west end of the trackage to be abandoned.the county complained that the x marks appearing on the drawing attached to csxt application indicated that the west end of the proposed abandonment was the west end of the bridge where passes under the involved rail line.this bridge is approximately one mile east of montezuma,in.the county also protested that csxt had made repeated assurances pointing specifically to its august,letter to the board that the west terminus did not extend beyond highway.the county requested that csxt drop any plans to dismantle trackage west of the highway and join it in petitioning the board to reopen the proceedings.
csxt responded by offering to leave the east segment intact and sell it to the county.the county did not pursue this offer,however.instead,six years later it and montezuma grain petitioned for reopening of the abandonment proceedings,arguing that the inclusion of the east segment in the abandonment was the result of mistake and inadvertence.the board denied the petition on two grounds.first,it held that it lacked jurisdiction to reopen the proceedings because csxt had already consummated the abandonment.alternatively,the board found that the petitioners failed to allege any procedural defects that would warrant relief.the board acknowledged that csxt x marks on the map,with hindsight,should probably have extended a fraction of an inch farther to the left on the schematic drawing than they actually did.nonetheless,the board concluded that the drawing was insufficient to show a lack of intent to abandon the east segment since the application itself contained an accurate description of the track by mileposts and by total mileage.the board also acknowledged that csxt august,letter was hardly a model of clarity and that the letter suggested that no track west of highway would be included in the montezuma abandonment.but any misstatements in the letter,the board concluded,were not so egregious as to overcome the explicit milepost references and other evidence to the contrary.
b.the hillsdale abandonment 
csxt continued to provide rail service through part of to the west of tr
