in,a local housing authority in charleston,missouri,the charleston housing authority the housing authority,sought to implement a revitalization plan that involved the demolition of selected public housing units.the housing units at issue were the charleston apartments,fifty rental units in a cluster of separate buildings.at the time that the housing authority adopted its plan,of the fifty units were occupied,by african american tenants.
the housing authority had purchased and updated the charleston apartments in with the help of a farmer home administration fmha section rural rental housing loan under the national housing act of,as amended by,section,stat,codified at.under the terms of the loan agreement,the housing authority was required to use the charleston apartments as public housing.also in,the housing authority had signed a contract with the department of housing and urban development hud to receive section,assistance under the housing assistance program.see.the section contract,like the section loan agreement,required the housing authority to operate the property as public housing.
in,the housing authority elected not to renew its section housing assistance program contract.also,the housing authority attempted to tender final payment on the section loan to eliminate the section contractual restrictions on use of the charleston apartments.the united states department of agriculture usda refused to accept the payment.the usda characterized the payment as a prepayment as that term is defined under the emergency low income housing preservation act,codified at c preservation act.as discussed below,the preservation act is a statute designed to protect the nation stock of public housing by requiring,inter alia,that units be offered for sale to qualifying organizations or governmental bodies for continued use as public housing when an owner proposes to prepay a loan and terminate use of the units for public housing 
the housing authority disputed the usda characterization of the tendered payment as a prepayment,arguing that the payment was a regularly scheduled payment.the housing authority also challenged the enforceability of the preservation act.the housing authority sought a court order to quiet title and to force the usda to accept the payment and release the subject units from statutory and contractual restrictions on use.ruling on a motion for summary judgment,the district court determined that the tendered payment was a prepayment,the preservation act applied,and the preservation act precluded the usda acceptance.accordingly,the district court refused to enter the housing authority requested order.the housing authority appeals these rulings.
in addition,current and former residents of the charleston apartments and a organization,housing comes first,brought a separate action against the housing authority.these plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to prevent the housing authority from implementing its revitalization plan.these plaintiffs alleged that implementation of the plan would create a disparate impact on the basis of race.the district court held a bench trial,ruled in favor of these plaintiffs on two claims,enjoined implementation of the plan,and ordered the housing authority to lease vacant and vacated charleston apartment units to eligible applicants.the housing authority appeals these rulings.
we affirm in all respects other than the scope of the injunctive relief.on this limited issue,we remand for the reasons discussed below.
background 
under the terms of the promissory note,the housing authority was to make monthly payments of,with the final payment due in.the loan documents permitted the housing authority to make prepayments on the loan.the loan documents also required the housing authority to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in effect when the parties entered the agreement as well as any subsequent laws and regulations not inconsistent with laws and regulations.
the housing authority,in fact,made substantial prepayments on the loan.the housing authority did not need all of the it initially borrowed to purchase and repair the charleston apartments.as a result,the housing authority returned almost of principal during.also,between and,the housing authority made other prepayments,including monthly payments rather than the lesser amount that was actually due.consequently,as of july,the outstanding balance was less than.
in july,the housing authority contacted the usda regarding payment of the outstanding balance of the loan.the usda responded by sending the housing authority instructions that explained prepayment procedures under the preservation act.in general terms,these procedures require an owner to provide information to enable an assessment of whether prepayment would adversely impact minorities or leave displaced tenants without adequate,safe housing.c g.if an adverse impact is expected,statutory safe harbor provisions do not apply,and the usda is required to negotiate with the owner to retain the units as public housing.id.at c a.if no agreement is reached,the owner must offer the units for sale at fair market value to certain qualifying parties for continued operation as public housing.id.at c a i.if no qualifying buyer purchases the property,the usda may then accept prepayment and release the property from use restrictions.id.at c a ii.the preservation act provides that the fair market value is a price determined by appraisers.id.at c a i.
congress passed the preservation act as a response to a perceived crisis in the loss of public housing due to the prepayment of section loans.parkridge investors,farmers home,cir.the protocol for the acceptance of prepayments and the retention of public housing did not exist when the housing authority entered the agreement with the fmha.the parties agree that,but for the preservation act,the contract grants the housing authority an unconditional right to prepay the loan.accordingly,the prepayment protocol demanded by the usda is in direct conflict with the section loan agreement prepayment provisions.
in november,the housing authority adopted a policy,and in december,decided not to rent units at the charleston apartments as they became vacant.in february,the housing authority adopted resolution in which it resolved not to seek renewal of the section contract.through resolution,the housing authority also resolved to pay off the loan and demolish the charleston apartments.
in april,the housing authority notified hud of the decision not to renew the section agreement,effective april.as of april,the amount of principal on the section loan had been reduced to about.accordingly,payment of an amount substantially less than a regularly scheduled installment payment would have paid the loan in full.
in december,the housing authority submitted a prepayment request to the usda,in compliance with the preservation act instructions that the usda had sent in july.in april,hud offered to extend the section contract for four months.also in april,the usda responded to the housing authority prepayment request by asking for additional information.the housing authority did not provide the additional information,but rather,in may,tendered a check to the usda which would have paid the loan in full.the usda returned the check the next day.about one week later,the usda sent a letter to the housing authority demanding that the housing authority continue to operate the charleston apartments in accordance with the loan documents and applicable regulations until the usda completed its impact determination as required under the preservation act prepayment approval process.at the end of may,the housing authority refused to sign a section contract extension with hud.also at the end of may,the housing authority tendered payment for a second time.the usda again returned the check.
on june,the housing authority adopted resolution which rescinded resolution regarding demolition of the charleston apartments.on june,the usda informed the housing authority that it had determined prepayment of the loan would have an impact on minorities such that the housing authority would have to advertise the charleston apartments for sale to an eligible organization or public body.the usda informed the housing authority of its right to appeal the impact determination.the housing authority did not appeal the impact determination,but rather,on june,notified the usda that it was withdrawing what it erroneously termed a request to prepay.as of the date of the district court opinion,there was no pending request for prepayment.
ii.procedural history 
in late june,the housing authority brought a complaint for declaratory judgment seeking to have the promissory note marked paid and a deed of trust released.the housing authority later added a request to obtain quiet title.we refer to this complaint and the claims therein as the housing authority complaint and the housing authority claims.
housing comes first,the two remaining charleston apartment tenants,and certain former tenants filed a separate,action against the housing authority,hud,and the usda.we refer to these plaintiffs collectively as the tenants and their complaint and the claims therein as the tenants complaint and the tenants claims.
relevant to this appeal are summary judgment rulings on the housing authority claims and trial rulings on the tenants claims.the housing authority and the tenants filed cross motions for summary judgment on the housing authority claims against the usda.the usda did not file its own motion for summary judgment,but asked in its response to the housing authority motion that the district court grant summary judgment against the housing authority.the district court questioned the tenants ability to seek summary judgment on the usda behalf.accordingly,the district court treated the request in the usda responsive filing as a motion for summary judgment and treated the tenants arguments as supplemental arguments by the usda.the district court then determined that the preservation act applied,the final payment on the loan was a prepayment under preservation act,and the usda was not able to accept the prepayment unless the housing authority first followed the protocol for preservation of public housing as set forth in preservation act.the district court granted summary judgment against the housing authority on all of the housing authority claims.
the district court disposed of counts i and ii of the tenants complaint via summary judgment in favor of the housing authority.the district court then held a bench trial on counts of the tenants complaint and entered judgment against the tenants as to counts and.the tenants do not appeal these rulings.the district court entered judgment against hud as to count xi,and hud has not appealed that ruling.
the only counts from the tenants complaint relevant to the present appeals are counts ix and x against the housing authority.count ix is a claim under the quality housing and work responsibility act of,d,in which the tenants allege that the housing authority failed to affirmatively further fair housing in relation to its refusal to rent and planned demolition of the charleston apartments.count x is a claim under the fair housing act,a,in which the tenants allege disparate impact discrimination based on race.the district court found in favor of the tenants as to the disparate impact claim,finding a disparate impact and also finding that the housing authority proffered only pretextual explanations for its actions.the district court then found,as to count ix,that there was an absence of evidence to show that the housing authority had considered the impact of its planned action upon.the district court concluded that this absence of evidence,coupled with the disparate impact violation of the fair housing act,demonstrated that the housing authority had failed to affirmatively further fair housing consequently,the district court entered judgment against the housing authority as to counts ix and 
following the bench trial,the district court ordered the housing authority not to discriminate on the basis of race.the district court declined,however,to order the housing authority to the charleston apartments.the district court found instead that because the preservation act applied,the housing authority would have to comply with preservation act protocol for the retention of public housing before the charleston apartments could be demolished or used for purposes other than public housing.accordingly,the district court ordered the usda to refuse to accept payment and to refuse to remove restrictions on use unless and until the housing authority complied with the protocol of the preservation act.
the tenants then filed a motion asking the district court to reconsider the form of relief.in ruling on the motion to reconsider,the district court determined that its initial relief was inadequate.consequently,the district court ordered the housing authority to reopen the charleston apartments and give priority to former residents who wished to return.the district court did not specify that complete occupancy was required nor that the housing authority had to achieve a certain percentage of occupancy.
on appeal,the housing authority presents a series of arguments in support of its theory that the terms of the agreement rather than the requirements of the preservation act control on the present facts and that the usda must unconditionally accept the tendered payment.the housing authority also argues that the tenants failed to demonstrate an adverse impact,and that even if the tenants had demonstrated an adverse impact,the housing authority proffered rationale for the proposed action was legitimate and.the housing authority also argues that its recision of resolution makes the present discrimination claims moot.finally,the housing authority challenges the district court remedy,namely,the forced occupancy of the charleston apartments.
iii.authority claims 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.summary judgment is particularly appropriate where the dispute revolves around arguments that are purely legal and where there are no disputes of material fact.here,the facts surrounding loan payments and performance under the section agreement are undisputed.the dispute concerns only the impact of subsequent legislation,the preservation act,upon a previously established contract.
the housing authority and the fmha entered into the section agreement in.like the supreme court in franconia united states,d,and our court in parkridge investors,farmers home,cir,we assume that the loan agreement granted the housing authority an unconditional right to prepay the loan and imposed on the usda a concomitant obligation to accept prepayment.
congress passed the preservation act in.the prepayment protocol of the preservation act is in direct conflict with the housing authority contractual right of prepayment.the housing authority argues that the contractual provisions prevail over the subsequent legislation because the government clearly waived its right to pass legislation such as the preservation act when it entered into the agreement such that the preservation act is unenforceable against the housing authority the final payment is not a prepayment under the preservation act and the usda is equitably estopped from refusing acceptance in light of its course of performance under the contract which included the ongoing acceptance of prepayments.we address these arguments in turn.
we reject the first argument based on parkridge investors.as explained by the district court below,our court in parkridge investors 
interpreted a loan agreement identical to the one at issue in this case and held that the government did not contract away its sovereign power to alter the loan agreement through subsequent legislation merely by agreeing to an absolute prepayment right.we further held that the government did not effectuate a taking or otherwise unconstitutionally alter the terms of a loan agreement by requiring the borrower to comply with the provisions of the preservation act.
in parkridge investors,our court analyzed the enforceability of the preservation act as applied to a section contract under the standard set forth in merrion jicarilla apache tribe,d.in merrion,the supreme court observed that sovereign power is an enduring presence that governs all contracts subject to the sovereign jurisdiction,and will remain intact unless surrendered in unmistakable terms.parkridge investors,at quoting merrion,at.our court concluded,the united states can not be said to have unmistakeably waived one of its most vital powers,that of enacting legislation,by virtue of this contract language.id.the district court correctly recognized that parkridge investors,involving the same law applied to a section agreement,controls on the present facts.
the housing authority second argument,that the tendered payment was not a prepayment,also fails.this technical argument is contrary to the goals of the preservation act and contrary to the preservation act implementing regulations.as already noted,congress passed the preservation act to prevent exactly the activity that the housing authority proposed in this case,namely,the removal of public housing units through the retirement of section loans and the elimination of accompanying restrictions on use.the applicable regulations at provide that a final payment accelerated from the original maturity date due to earlier prepayments or refunds from the borrower is to be treated as a prepayment.id.if the loan on a project reaches or falls below six remaining payments due to borrower voluntary advance payments the borrower will be notified that the final payment on the account can not be accepted unless a request is made.further,the regulations define prepayment as payment before the loan maturity date.
the original maturity date for the loan was.the housing authority prepayments did not alter the maturity date.through the initial refund of almost,the housing authority prepaid a substantial portion of principal.also,each additional payment included prepayments on principal.permitting a section debtor who has made substantial prepayments to label a final payment thirty years prior to the original maturity date as anything other than a prepayment would be to elevate technical form over substance.to hold otherwise would create a loophole in the preservation act prepayment restrictions large enough swallow all of congress clearly expressed intent 
the housing authority final argument,that equitable estoppel applies based on the usda past acceptance of prepayments,also fails.to succeed on a claim of equitable estoppel against the government,a plaintiff must not only prove all the elements of equitable estoppel,but also that the government committed affirmative misconduct.see rutten united states,cir in addition to proving the traditional elements of estoppel,the plaintiff must first establish that the government committed affirmative misconduct.the housing authority made no such showing in the present case.because the district court correctly rejected all of the housing authority arguments against application of the preservation act,summary judgment was appropriate and we affirm 
iv.impact discrimination and the quality housing and work responsibility act 
following a bench trial,we review the trial court findings of fact for clear error.cooper tire rubber paul fire marine ins,et,cir see also fed.civ.pro.a.the district court determinations under the disparate impact analysis are factual determinations that we review for clear error.see chambers omaha girls club,cir stating in the context of a disparate impact employment discrimination claim that determinations under the burden shifting analysis are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard of review applied to factual findings.questions of mootness are matters of subject matter jurisdiction that we review de novo.
we first address the housing authority mootness argument.the housing authority argues that because it rescinded resolution when it passed resolution,there is no longer a pending plan to demolish the charleston apartments.the housing authority also claims that it is considering a plan proposed by a group of citizens to demolish only nine of the charleston apartment fourplex units and replace those units with,units.notwithstanding these claims,the record demonstrates that the housing authority has continued its practice of leaving the charleston apartments vacant,as per resolution.further,the housing authority continues to seek reversal of the district court ruling under the preservation act.
defendants who argue mootness due to changed circumstances based on their own behavior face a heavy burden.this is because,in general,a defendant voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.serv.toc,d a case might become moot if subsequent events made it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.we think it is clear that the housing authority has not demonstrated mootness in this instance.instead,the present case fits the exception for situations that are capable of being repeated,yet escape review.id.
here,the housing authority continued attempts to obtain quiet title belie its claim that it no longer intends to convert the property to other uses.further,the timing of resolution and the withdrawal of the request for prepayment were such that they appear more akin to strategic,acts rather than elements of planning.accordingly,it is reasonable to expect that the discrimination claim plaintiffs will be subject to the same action in the future,even if under a slightly different plan.the possibility of this recurrence is not so remote or speculative that our jurisdiction is lacking.see,van bergen minnesota,cir 
turning to the merits of counts ix and x of the tenants complaint,we find no arguments specific to count ix,the quality housing and work responsibility act claim.consequently,we assume that the housing authority accepts the district court absence of evidence to demonstrate consideration of an impact upon african americans means that an adverse ruling on the disparate impact discrimination claim also resolves the quality housing and work responsibility act,affirmatively further fair housing claim accordingly,we address in detail only count x,the fair housing act claim.
to establish a prima facie,fair housing act,disparate impact claim under oti kaga,south dakota housing dev,cir,the plaintiffs must demonstrate that the action results in,or can be predicted to result in,a disparate impact upon a protected class compared to a relevant population as a whole.id.stating that plaintiffs must show a facially neutral policy has a significant adverse impact on members of a protected minority group.the tenants made this showing.the housing authority argues on appeal that the tenants disparate impact claims fail because they did not offer evidence of purposeful discrimination and did not demonstrate that similarly situated of the class were subject to disparate treatment.the tenants,however,did not allege disparate treatment,they alleged disparate impact.under united states city of black jack,cir,the tenants need prove no more than that the conduct of the defendant actually or predictably results in discrimination in other words,that it has a discriminatory effect.
the housing authority also attacks the tenants statistical proof as to disparate impact.in doing so,the housing authority discusses the goal of reducing the density of low income housing.this issue,however,is more appropriately considered under the subsequent steps of the disparate impact claim burden shifting analysis.focusing only on arguments material to the tenants prima facie case,we believe that the housing authority has failed to demonstrate clear error.the tenant proof established a disproportionate impact upon minority class members whether we examine the relevant waiting list population,the population,or the actual charleston apartment tenants.the district court did not clearly err in finding that the tenants established a prima facie case.
under the second step of the disparate impact burden shifting analysis,the housing authority must demonstrate that the proposed action has a manifest relationship to the legitimat
