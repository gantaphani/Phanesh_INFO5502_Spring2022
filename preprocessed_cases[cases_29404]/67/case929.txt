former burton,michigan,city administrator charles abbey was convicted of conspiracy to bribe a public official under and a,solicitation of a bribe by a public official under a,and extortion by a public official under the hobbs act.though covering three crimes and two statutes,abbey appeal boils down to a single assertion that the government,to sustain a conviction under or the hobbs act,must prove a direct link between a specific gift given to a public official and an explicit promise by that official to perform a specific,identifiable official act in return.though abbey is correct that the government did not prove such a link at trial and that the jury instructions did not so instruct,we nevertheless reject his argument because neither statute contains such a heightened requirement.we thus affirm abbey convictions and sentence.
albert rizzo,a local land developer,implicated abbey in statements he made to county prosecutors following the filing of perjury and fraud charges against him.rizzo stated that he had given numerous bribes to various burton public officials,including mayor charles smiley and defendant abbey he further claimed that he gave abbey a free subdivision lot in return for unspecified future official favors.these statements formed the basis of abbey federal indictment.
trial testimony indicated that abbey had been looking for a lot to build a new home on.rizzo had one,and,after some machinations the lot was deeded to rizzo secretary and possible mistress,who then deeded it to abbey abbey received it without any cash exchanging hands.rizzo testified that,in giving abbey the lot for free,he had hoped that he would be considered favorably for future burton developments.abbey argued that the lot was not free because he paid various encumbrances to clear title after receiving it and that this equaled what he believed the land was worth.abbey also denied exerting public influence in rizzo favor in any other way.
the government did not introduce any evidence establishing that,when the lot was transferred,rizzo and abbey had an express agreement for a specific official act to be done in return for rizzo gift.the government did assert,however,that abbey used his influence and position to assist rizzo with several land developments,including one in creek.the government also produced evidence that,roughly a year after the free lot transfer,abbey proposed that the city issue municipal bonds to finance pebble creek development.at that time,though rizzo had already contracted to purchase pebble creek,the title change had not yet become public.and,despite the fact that the sale was already final,it was the not publicly petitioned for a municipal bond issue.after financing was agreed upon but without a formal bidding process,rizzo was named general contractor to develop pebble creek even though he owned it.the government characterized this arrangement as the city of burton paying rizzo with municipal bond financing to develop his own property.
an initial contracting fee was agreed upon but rizzo protested.in response,officials substantially increased rizzo fee after he met with city officials,including abbey.thus,in,rizzo received an initial payment of and,six months later,another payment of.the city characterized this latter fee as overhead and profit on the pebble creek project.rizzo was allowed to handle the improvements and contracting as he wished and to submit his invoice at the end,rather than up front.
the jury found abbey guilty of conspiracy to bribe a public official under a,solicitation of a bribe by a public official under a b,and extortion under color of right under the hobbs act.he was sentenced to fifteen months in prison,and now appeals.he remains free on bond.
abbey challenges a his indictment and the jury instructions for his hobbs act conviction,b the jury instructions for his conviction of bribery under,and c his sentence.
a jury found abbey guilty of committing extortion by a public official under the hobbs act.abbey challenges the district court denial of his motion to dismiss and his rule motion for acquittal,along with the denial of his request for an additional jury instruction.all three challenges reduce to the contention that the hobbs act required the government to prove that abbey made an express promise to perform for rizzo a specific,identifiable official act in return when the land was given to him.
the hobbs act criminalizes interference with interstate commerce by extortion along with attempts or conspiracies to do so,a,and defines extortion as the obtaining of property from another,with his consent,induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force,violence,or fear,or under color of official right,id.at b.abbey challenges his conviction for extortion under color of official right.
in mccormick united states,d,the supreme court considered the requirements for an extortion conviction under color of official right in the context of campaign contributions.the court concluded that the receipt of political contributions violates the hobbs act only if the payments are made in return for an explicit promise or undertaking by the official to perform or not to perform an official act.id.at.the mccormick court observed,however,that the campaign contribution context was unique because almost all lawful contributions are given to influence future legislative or executive actions 
money is constantly being solicited on behalf of candidates,who run on platforms and who claim support on the basis of their views and what they intend to do or have done.whatever ethical considerations and appearances may indicate,to hold that legislators commit the federal crime of extortion when they act for the benefit of constituents or support legislation furthering the interests of some of their constituents,shortly before or after campaign contributions are solicited and received from those beneficiaries,is an unrealistic assessment of what congress could have meant by making it a crime to obtain property from another,with his consent,under color of official right.to hold otherwise would open to prosecution not only conduct that has long been thought to be well within the law but also conduct that in a very real sense is unavoidable so long as election campaigns are financed by private contributions or expenditures,as they have been from the beginning of the nation.it would require statutory language more explicit than the hobbs act contains to justify a contrary conclusion.
id.so campaign contributions only run afoul of the hobbs act if they are induced by the use of force,violence,or fear,or when they,having been taken under color of official right are made in return for an explicit promise or undertaking by the official to perform or not to perform an official act.id.mccormick reserved the question whether a quid pro quo requirement exists in other contexts,such as when an elected official receives gifts,meals,travel expenses,or other items of value.id.at.
in evans united states,d,the court held that an affirmative act of inducement by a public official is not an element of extortion under color of official right,id.at,and that illegal extortion is complete at the time when the public official receives a payment in return for his agreement to perform specific official acts fulfillment of the quid pro quo is not an element of the offense.id.thus,to sustain a conviction,the government need only show that a public official has obtained a payment to which he was not entitled,knowing that the payment was made in return for official acts.id 
this court took its first stab at harmonizing these decisions in united states blandford,cir.in blandford,we stated that mccormick quid pro quo requirement should not apply outside the context because if the quid pro quo requirement exists to ensure that an otherwise permissible activity is not unfairly criminalized,then an opposite presumption is likely appropriate when a public official obtains cash or property outside the campaign system because there are few legitimate explanations for such gifts.id.at.
nevertheless,it was not necessary in blandford to resolve whether the quid pro quo requirement applied universally outside the campaign context.and two years later this court stated in united states collins,cir,that the quid pro quo requirement applies to all extortion prosecutions,not just those involving campaign contributions.id.at.so,in this circuit,the hobbs act requires the government to prove the existence of a quid pro quo.
but not all quid pro quos are made of the same stuff.the showing necessary may still vary based on context,though all cases require the existence of some kind of agreement between briber and official.evans modified the standard in contribution cases by requiring that the government show only that the official obtain ed a payment to which he was not entitled,knowing that the payment was made in return for official acts.united states kelley,cir quoting evans,at.indeed,in circumstances like this the campaign context r ather than requir e an explicit promise,the elements of extortion are satisfied by something short of a formalized and thoroughly articulated contractual arrangement,merely knowing that the payment was made in return for official acts is enough.united states hamilton,cir quotations omitted emphasis added.
moreover,the official and the payor need not state the quid pro quo in express terms,for otherwise the law effect could be frustrated by knowing winks and nods.collins,at quoting evans,at.kennedy,concurring the inducement from the official is criminal if it is express or if it is implied from his words and actions,so long as he intends it to be so and the payor so interprets it.a public official thus commits extortion under color of official right whenever he knowingly receives a bribe.see wilkie robbins,d at common law,extortion was a property offense committed by a public official who took any money or thing of value that was not due to him under the pretense that he was entitled to such property by virtue of his office.quotations omitted id.at,in short,e xtortion by the public official was the rough equivalent of what we would now describe as taking a bribe.quoting evans,at.and,because the hobbs act is meant to prohibit public officials from obtaining property from others by extortion,united states brock,cir,there is no reason to impose a judicial requirement here that would make it lawful under the hobbs act to pay a public official to exert his influence in your favor,so long as it is premature for the agreement to contemplate specific acts.
so abbey is wrong in contending that,to sustain a hobbs act conviction,the benefits received must have some explicit,direct link with a promise to perform a particular,identifiable act when the illegal gift is given to the official.instead,it is sufficient if the public official understood that he or she was expected to exercise some influence on the payor behalf as opportunities arose.see united states bradley,cir united states coyne,cir.the public official need not even have any intention of actually exerting his influence on the payor behalf because fulfillment of the quid pro quo is not an element of the offense.evans,at.the inquiry is whether the official extracted money through promises to improperly employ his public influence 
this discussion disposes of abbey arguments regarding the district court denial of his motion to dismiss and his rule motion for acquittal the indictment was proper because it did not need to assert a direct link between abbey receipt of property and an explicit promise to perform of a specific,identifiable act of improper influence when the gift was given.
so we turn to abbey challenges to his hobbs act jury instructions.the district court instructed 
the phrase extortion under color of official right means the use by a public official or employee of the power and authority of the office he occupies in order to obtain money,property,or something of value from another to which that government official or employee or that government office has no official right.
it is not necessary for the government to prove that the public official or employee made any specific threat or used force or fear to cause a person to part with the property that the indictment alleges was obtained by the public official or that the employee or government office.
the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt,however,that abbey knowingly and deliberately used his official position in order to obtain money,property,or something of value,to which he had no right 
abbey requested that the following sentence be tacked on to the end of the instructions there must be a taking of property in exchange for specific promises to do or refrain from doing specific things.
the district court instruction was correct the first paragraph accurately explains the statute the second distinguishes forcible or extortion from extortion under color of right and the third paragraph accurately tracks both the statute and the supreme court guidance in evans that the public official need not induce a bribe and is guilty of extortion if he knowingly receives one.see evans,at.by contrast,abbey proposed addendum was wrong there need not be any specific promises to do or refrain from doing specific things.instead,as the discussion above illuminates,an official commits extortion under color of official right when he knowingly accepts a bribe as part of a generalized agreement to improperly exert his official influence on the payor behalf.that is exactly what the district court instructed,and what the jury found.we affirm abbey hobbs act conviction.
the jury also convicted abbey of conspiracy under to bribe a public official under a,and corrupt solicitation of a bribe by a public official under a b.similar to his argument regarding the hobbs act,he contends that the district court failed to properly instruct the jury that,to sustain a conviction under,the government must prove a specific intent element on abbey part that there be a connection between his intent and a specific official act.defendant br.at quotations omitted.
one violates a b if he or she is an agent of local government and corruptly solicits or demands for the benefit of any person,or accepts or agrees to accept,anything of value from any person,intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any business,transaction,or series of transactions of the local government involving any thing of value of or more.section a makes it unlawful to corruptly give,offer,or agree to give anything of value to any person,with intent to influence or reward an agent of the local government involving anything of value of or more.see criminalizing the conspiracy to enter into such a scheme 
by its terms,the statute does not require the government to prove that abbey contemplated a specific act when he received the bribe the text says nothing of a quid pro quo requirement to sustain a conviction,express or otherwise while a quid pro quo of money for a specific act is sufficient to violate the statute,it is not necessary.united states gee,cir.rather,it is enough if a defendant corruptly solicits anything of value with the inten t to be influenced or rewarded in connection with some transaction involving property or services worth or more.a b 
finding no support in the statute text,abbey heavily relies on united states growers of california,d.in the supreme court reviewed the conviction of a trade association for providing illegal gratuities under c a for giving tickets,meals,and other items to the secretary of agriculture.id.at.the indictment did not allege a specific connection between these gratuities and any specific matter in which the secretary had an interest.id.at.reversing the conviction,the supreme court held that required a link between a thing of value conferred upon a public official and a specific official act for or because of which it was given.id.at.explained that this was necessary because no other ruling would fit comfortably with the statutory text,which prohibits only gratuities received for or because of any official act performed or to be performed,and defines official act as any decision or action on any question,matter,cause,suit,proceeding,or controversy.id.at.quoting a,c a.the court a
