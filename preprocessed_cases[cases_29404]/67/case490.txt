opinion of the court 
this appeal calls for the interpretation of a marine open cargo insurance policy the policy entered into by ksi trading corporation ksi and royal insurance company of america royal.a fire occurred at one of ksi warehouses,and ksi filed a reimbursement claim with royal for the full extent of its loss pursuant to a warehouse storage insurance section of the policy.royal disclaimed coverage for a significant portion of the loss,asserting that the warehouse storage insurance section did not cover ksi domestically acquired merchandise.thereafter,royal sought a declaratory judgment in the district court that it was not obligated to indemnify ksi for all of its loss.the district court determined that the warehouse storage insurance section of the policy only provided coverage for ksi internationally acquired merchandise and granted summary judgment in favor of royal.we conclude that the policy is ambiguous with respect to the property that was insured while stored in ksi warehouse,and because new jersey law,which governs the interpretation of the policy,requires ambiguities to be resolved in favor of the insured,we will reverse the district court and enter judgment in favor of ksi.
ksi,a new jersey corporation,is a wholesale distributor of auto body parts that purchases inventory from both domestic and international suppliers,and stores its inventory in warehouses located throughout the united states.royal,an illinois corporation,is a marine cargo underwriter which provides insurance for the hazards encountered in maritime transportation.on may,royal provided quotations for insurance coverage to ksi broker,jeffrey joiner of the lig insurance agencies lig,and on july,royal and ksi entered into an insurance contract,with coverage commencing at this time.certain subsidiaries of ksi,including astro automotive,astro,were also covered by the policy.sometime after july,ksi received the actual marine open cargo policy no.poc.
the policy contained three sections,which are titled as follows i ocean cargo ii domestic transportation insurance and iii warehouse storage insurance.the ocean cargo section of the policy is comprised of paragraphs,but in one particularly relevant paragraph,entitled property insured insurable interest,states 
this policy covers,for account of whom it may concern,shipments of lawful goods and merchandise consisting principally of 
merchandise incidental to the assured business,consisting principally of automobile parts 
under or on deck,consigned to or shipped by others for account or control of the assured or in which the assured has the risk of loss,but excluding shipments either sold or purchased by the assured subject to the terms of sale or purchase whereby the assured is not obligated to furnish ocean marine insurance.notwithstanding the foregoing,this policy also covers all shipments of lawful goods and merchandise for the account of others from whom the assured has received written instructions to insure provided such instructions are received prior to any known or reported loss,damage,or accident and prior to sailing of the vessel.
in another particularly relevant paragraph,with the caption geographical limits,the ocean cargo section also states 
always excepting adventures which are illegal under the laws of the united states this policy covers property insured at and from ports places in the world to ports places in the world excluding shipments originating in the united states meaning the contiguous states and the district of columbia or canada for shipment to destination s in the continental united states or canada.
turning to sections ii and iii of the policy,the domestic transportation insurance section states,in pertinent part 
effective as to all shipments made on or after july,this policy is hereby extended,subject to its terms and conditions,to cover shipments of the property insured while in due course of transit only at the risk of the assured worldwide excluding the former soviet union and russian federation from the time the property leaves the store,warehouse,or factory at initial point of shipment and continuously thereafter,including while on docks,wharves,piers,bulkheads,depots,stations or platforms until delivered at store,warehouse or factory at destination.
lastly,the warehouse storage insurance section states,in relevant part 
it is understood and agreed that,subject to all terms and conditions which do not conflict with the provisions set forth herein,this policy is extended to cover property insured under section i which is the property of the assured or the property of others from whom the assured has written instructions to insure while temporarily stored in warehouses at locations listed in the attached schedule.
additionally,sections ii and iii both provide that n othing herein contained shall be held to vary,waive,alter or extend any of the terms,conditions,declarations or agreements of the policy other than as expressly stated in this coverage section.the policy renewed automatically on an annual basis.
on april,a fire occurred at ksi warehouse in franklin,massachusetts resulting in a significant loss of ksi inventory at that time,astro was a leasehold tenant of the franklin warehouse and was using it to store inventory.ksi submitted a claim to royal for its loss of inventory pursuant to the warehouse storage insurance section of the policy.ksi claimed that the inventory destroyed or ruined by the fire was in excess of the million limit scheduled for the franklin warehouse.on march,in a written notice,royal disclaimed coverage for the portion of the loss attributable to ksi domestically acquired merchandise.instead,royal agreed to reimburse ksi in the amount of was royal estimate of the net value of the internationally acquired merchandise that was lost in the salvage and a deductible.ksi maintained that it was entitled to reimbursement from royal for the full extent of its loss,up to the policy million limit.
on february,royal filed a complaint in the district court seeking a declaratory judgment against ksi and astro collectively ksi with respect to its indemnification obligations.ksi filed an answer in which it asserted counterclaims against royal for breach of contract,fraud,unjust enrichment,and bad faith.ksi also filed a third party complaint against lig,joiner,and one other named individual collectively lig.subsequently,ksi filed an amended answer and amended counterclaims,which included counterclaims for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,reformation based on fraud,and reformation based upon mutual mistake.
on june,royal filed a motion for summary judgment against ksi seeking a declaration that the warehouse storage insurance section of the policy only covered goods that originated overseas and did not cover goods that originated domestically.ksi against royal for summary judgment on its counterclaim for breach of contract on the ground that no genuine issue of material fact existed with respect to royal obligation to reimburse ksi for all of the loss it incurred as a result of the warehouse fire up to the policy limits.
on february,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of royal and denied it as to ksi,finding that the policy only provided warehouse coverage for internationally acquired merchandise.consequently,the district court found that,under the plain language of the policy,royal had no obligation to indemnify ksi for the loss of its domestically acquired merchandise that resulted from the warehouse fire.the district court also dismissed ksi claims for breach of contract.
as a result of clerical error,the case was listed as terminated on the district court docket however,because ksi counterclaims for reformation were not the subject of any party motion for summary judgment,ksi and lig filed a motion to reinstate the counterclaims.on june,the district court amended its decision and order to clarify that the reformation counterclaims remained viable.subsequently,royal moved for summary judgment on these two remaining counterclaims,and ksi filed an opposition to the motion.on august,the district court granted royal motion for summary judgment and entered its order the next day,thus rendering a final judgment.
ksi timely appealed from the district court decision and order of february,as amended by the decision and order of june,and from the district court decision and order entered august,

the central issue on appeal is whether the marine open cargo insurance policy,issued to ksi by royal,covered ksi domestically acquired merchandise while it was stored in ksi franklin warehouse.as an initial matter,maritime contracts are governed by federal admiralty law when there is an established federal rule,but absent such a rule,state law applies.wilburn boat fireman fund ins.see also pittston allianz ins,i n the absence of a controlling federal statute or an established rule of general maritime law,state law governs the scope and validity of contracts of marine insurance.because there is no applicable federal rule governing the construction of the policy at issue in the present case,state law applies,and the parties do not dispute that new jersey law is the relevant body of law for this purpose.
under new jersey law,an insurance policy is simply a contract and its provisions should,of course,be construed as in any other contract.pennbarr ins.of,cir quoting caruso john hancock mut.life ins.as is the case with other types of contracts,an insurance policy is to be governed by its own terms without recourse to other documents unless its own language so requires.herbert farkas fire ins.in the absence of any ambiguity,the terms of an insurance policy should be given their plain,ordinary meaning.zacarias allstate ins,see bd.of ed.of florham park utica mut.ins,in the absence of any ambiguity,courts should not write for the insured a better policy of insurance than the one purchased.internal quotation marks omitted kampf franklin life ins,when the terms of an insurance contract are clear,it is the function of a court to enforce it as written and not to make a better contract for either of the parties.
ambiguity exists where the phrasing of the policy is so confusing that the average policyholder can not make out the boundaries of coverage.weedo.new jersey caselaw does not require that we credit every conceivable deconstruction of contractual language,but rather instructs that the doctrine of ambiguity should be invoked only to resolve genuine ambiguities,not artificial ambiguities created by semantical ingenuity.a s fuel oil royal indem,quoting weedo,at.determining whether genuine ambiguity is present in an insurance policy requires interpreting the policy as a whole,by giving a reasonable meaning to its form and cast.arrow indus.carriers,continental ins.of.
where genuine ambiguity exists,such that the controlling language will support two meanings,one favorable to the insurer,and the other favorable to the insured,the interpretation sustaining coverage must be applied.mazzilli accident cas.ins.of winterthur,see customized distribution servs.zurich ins,i f an insurance policy terms are capable of supporting two distinct outcomes as to whether there is coverage,the subject language must be interpreted in favor of the insured.in an effort to avoid subjecting insureds to technical encumbrances or to hidden pitfalls policies should be construed liberally in their favor to the end that coverage is afforded to the full extent that any fair interpretation will allow.meier life ins,internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,when the issue of ambiguity arises from an exclusion or exception,designed to limit the protection,a strict interpretation is applied.mazzilli,at.
therefore,if the insurance policy language is insufficiently clear to justify depriving the insured of her reasonable expectation that coverage would be provided,the policy must be interpreted in favor of the insured.sparks paul ins,see zacarias,at when there is ambiguity in an insurance contract,courts interpret the contract to comport with the reasonable expectations of the insured.the rationale underlying the principle referred to as contra proferentem that ambiguities in insurance contracts should be resolved in favor of the insured is that because most insurance agreements are drafted by the insurance industry,they are essentially contracts of adhesion.pittston.ultramar am,at citing meier,at.this rationale has less force when it is applied to a sophisticated insured who has participated in the drafting process.id.at citing,united ins.
against this backdrop,ksi argues that the policy provided warehouse coverage for property insured,which,as defined in section i of the policy,means merchandise incidental to the assured business,consisting principally of automobile parts,and by its terms included all of ksi merchandise,regardless of its origin.in the alternative,ksi contends that the policy should be reformed under equitable principles.in contrast,royal argues that section i of the policy only provided coverage for the transportation of international cargo because,in addition to the language cited by ksi,section i contains a paragraph on geographical limitations which excludes from coverage any merchandise that originated and remained in the united states or canada.confronted with these conflicting interpretations,we begin our own analysis with the plain language of the policy terms to determine if a genuine ambiguity exists.see a s fuel oil,at.
paragraph of the warehouse storage insurance section states 
it is understood and agreed that,subject to all terms and conditions which do not conflict with the provisions set forth herein,this policy is extended to cover property insured under section i while temporarily stored in warehouses at locations listed in the attached schedule.
this section of the policy does not independently identify the property to which it extends insurance coverage,but it does provide a to section thus,in order to understand which property is insured while temporarily stored in ksi warehouses,we are directed to look to the ocean cargo section of the policy.
turning to this section,although the term property insured is never clearly defined,paragraph,which is captioned property insured insurable interest,certainly suggests a definition for this term when it states 
this policy covers,for account of whom it may concern,shipments of lawful goods and merchandise consisting principally of 
merchandise incidental to the assured s business,consisting principally of automobile parts 
under or on deck,consigned to or shipped by others for account or control of the assured in which the assured has the risk of loss,but excluding shipments either sold or purchased by the assured subject to the terms of sale or purchase whereby the assured is not obligated to furnish ocean marine insurance 
notwithstanding the fact that the words property insured are never used in this passage,the use of all capital letters and offsetting text,coupled with the caption property insured and insurable interest,is a strong indication that property insured is best understood to mean merchandise incidental to the assured business,consisting principally of automobile parts.
accepting this as the most plausible definition of property insured and applying it to section iii would result in finding that any and all of ksi merchandise consisting principally of automobile parts was insured while tem
