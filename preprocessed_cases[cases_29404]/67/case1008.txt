intervenor riverview trenton railroad company rtr sought an exemption from the surface transportation board board that would allow it to operate an intermodal transportation facility on property located in the cities of trenton and riverview and the county of wayne in michigan.the board,a successor to the interstate commerce commission,has exclusive jurisdiction over rail lines that are part of the interstate rail network.under federal preemption,state and local governments may not condemn railroad property that is under the regulatory jurisdiction of the board.
the local governments protested to the board that rtr proposal was a sham designed to prevent them from taking the property by eminent domain as part of their riverfront redevelopment plans.rtr proposal was evaluated by the board and underwent an environmental review pursuant to the national environmental policy act nepa requirements.et.based on the environmental assessment ea prepared under nepa,the board concluded that,as long as certain conditions were met,the project would have no significant impact on the human environment.it also concluded that rtr proposed a bona fide railroad and transportation facility.petitioners appeal from the board decision.for the following reasons,we affirm the board decision.
the parties contest the future development of a property located in the cities of trenton and riverview,michigan and along the detroit river.the property was owned by a company called dsc between and.during this time period,dsc discussed development of the site with officials from trenton and riverview and wayne county.the cities and county wanted to acquire the land and convert the property to a public use such that the public would have improved access to this area and the area would become more aesthetically pleasing.
before this occurred,however,dsc sold the property to crown enterprises.in november,crown formed a subsidiary,riverview trenton railroad company.rtr incorporated under the michigan railroad corporation statutes.on november,crown transferred the property to rtr via a quitclaim deed.
over this same time period,the local governments realized that crown would not sell the property to them.they therefore began investigating the possibility of taking the property under michigan uniform condemnation procedures act.the county attorney,mark zausmer,sent a letter to crown requesting information relevant to the proposed condemnation of the property.on december,crown responded to zausmer letter by asking for a more specific description of the property at issue.zausmer sent a legal description to crown on december.
on january,rtr filed suit in the eastern district of michigan seeking to enjoin the county from pursuing its eminent domain efforts.the district court issued a preliminary injunction on april,holding that the county efforts were preempted by the board exclusive jurisdiction over railroad activities under the interstate commerce act.
rtr quickly began work on development of the property.it filed a notice of exemption with the board describing its plans to create an intermodal transportation facility.specifically,rtr planned to use tracks on the property to provide rail service at that location,it would receive containerized freight from railroads and transfer it to trucks,and vice versa.the class exemption would allow rtr to operate as a class iii railroad defined as a railroad earning less than million a year.the board published public notice of the exemption in the federal register in january.
thereafter,the cities of riverview and trenton and wayne county filed separate petitions with the board to revoke rtr exemption.the cities and county argued that rtr was not entitled to the exemption it had sought and further that the property should be used for alternative purposes.they alleged that rtr was not planning a legitimate rail operation but rather sought to prevent the local communities from taking the property through eminent domain procedures.
rtr filed a response.it said that the communities had made no effort to condemn the property until after crown announced plans to use the property for rail operations.it further alleged that the communities only interest was to keep out the proposed rail operations.
in february,the board disallowed rtr use of the class exemption.the board based its decision on the need for a more detailed review of the proposal.
while attempting to obtain a class exemption for its rail operations,rtr also sought an individual exemption in order to put to rest any outstanding concerns that might exist about rtr invocation of the class exemption procedure.accompanying this petition was an environmental report,documenting the potential environmental effects of the project,which were anticipated to be minimal,and proposed mitigation efforts.
the board undertook an environmental analysis of rtr proposal under the procedures outlined in nepa.the board reviewed rtr proposal and its environmental report,and asked for additional data on air quality,noise,environmental justice,cumulative effects,and transportation.rtr and its environmental consultant prepared a draft environmental assessment from this data.the board reviewed the draft ea and issued it for public review on october.it concluded that rtr proposal would have no significant impact on the area.
the board sent copies of the ea to federal,state,and local government agencies.it also published a notice in the federal register advising the public that the ea was available for review and inviting comments.
the cities of riverview and trenton and wayne county submitted comments on the ea.the board responded to these comments in a issued on january.in this document,the board recommended that rtr undertake several mitigation measures to minimize the impact of the rail operations.if these mitigation measures were implemented,the board concluded that there would be no significant environmental impact on the area.
after the board issued the,it held a public meeting in the area.local officials and residents expressed opposition to the project during the meeting.these parties also expressed opposition in over letters sent to the board after the meeting.
the board responded to concerns raised at the meeting and in the letters by issuing a supplemental in august.the board proposed additional conditions upon rtr operation and concluded that if the conditions were met,there would be no significant impact on the environment.
as well as undertaking environmental reviews,the board also requested evidence about the public need for rtr project and any specific plans of the local governments to take this property through eminent domain procedures.rtr submitted evidence showing that its rail operations would benefit a variety of transportation companies.approximately fifty companies sent letters to the board indicating that rtr project would fill a need for an intermodal transportation facility.three experts testified that the detroit area needed an intermodal facility.
the local governments responded to the board request by arguing that the public interest would be disserved by granting rtr petition because it would divest local communities of the authority they need to assure that the use of the property is consistent with their broader development plans.however,they admitted that they had just taken the preliminary steps of investigating the possibility of condemning the land and that the county had not at that time and has not at this time decided to take this parcel.
in may,the board finally issued a decision regarding rtr proposed operations.it found that rtr proposal was bona fide,that the detroit area had a need for an intermodal transportation facility,and that rtr would be able to meet this need.it also found that there would be no significant impact on the environment,assuming that rtr followed the required mitigation procedures outlined in the ea,and supplemental.the board concluded that rtr should be allowed to proceed.
in order to alleviate the concerns of the local communities,the board imposed a requirement that rtr report on its progress in implementing the project at regular intervals for three years.if rtr does not begin developing rail operations,the board reserves the right to reopen the matter.
the local governments filed requests for reconsideration.the board denied these requests.however,it did address an issue raised late in the administrative proceedings,which was the designation of the detroit river as an american heritage river.the detroit river had received this designation by an executive order issued in,well before proceedings before the board had begun.the board found that the designation did not require reconsidering the matter because the rtr proposal would have no adverse environmental impact on the detroit river or its recreational resources and because the rtr proposal comported with the goal of economic revitalization advanced by the american heritage rivers initiative.
petitioners filed a timely notice of appeal in this court for review of the board decision.
the questions before us are whether the board properly granted the company request for an exemption in light of the claims of the local governments that rtr is simply trying to defeat efforts of the governments to acquire the property for recreational and uses and is not proposing a bona fide common carrier rail use,and in awarding the exemption,the board violated its duties under nepa,the coastal zone management act,and the american heritage rivers executive order.

the cities and county assert that the board erred in approving rtr application to operate as a common carrier because,they allege,rtr merely wanted to prevent eminent domain proceedings from advancing.the board found that based on careful consideration of the entire record,this is a legitimate rail transportation project,which should be allowed to go forward.it observed that rtr has developed specific plans for constructing an intermodal facility for which there is evidence of a current demand and taken reasonable steps to prepare for the commencement of rail operations.further,rtr has submitted statements from shippers supporting its project.
the board decision to grant rtr an individual exemption was not arbitrary or irrational.the record before it provided sufficient evidence for it to conclude that rtr proposes a legitimate operation.rtr developed specific plans to create its railroad operations.in june,it purchased a railway easement for rail ingress and egress to and from the crown parcel.it also hired an engineering firm to evaluate the suitability of the proposed site of the rtr shortline and intermodal facility in the detroit area and to design the track layout within the facility.the engineering firm prepared a feasibility engineering review and layout of the operations.further,rtr hired urs corporation to prepare an environmental report on the effects of its proposal for submission to the board.
along with undertaking these preliminary steps,rtr submitted a significant amount of information in support of its proposal.for example,it submitted a detailed environmental report,documenting the potential environmental effects of the project and proposed mitigation efforts.it also submitted evidence showing that its rail operations would benefit various types of transportation companies.approximately fifty companies sent letters to the board indicating that rtr project would fill a need for an intermodal transportation facility.three experts testified that the detroit area needed an intermodal facility.
thus,the board had before it substantial evidence that rtr had taken the preliminary steps necessary to establish its facility and that there was a need in the area for such a facility.given this evidence,it was rational for the board to conclude that rtr proposed a bona fide rail operation.in our opinion,these findings are not arbitrary or irrational in violation of the requirements of the apa,et.
petitioners rely on the board decision in jefferson terminal railroad company as evidence that rtr sought an exemption only to prevent condemnation proceedings from advancing.jefferson terminal railroad and operation enterprises,stb finance docket march.in jefferson terminal,jefferson,a subsidiary of crown enterprises invoked class exemption procedures to acquire and operate miles of rail line in detroit.at the time jefferson filed its notice with the board,detroit had already initiated condemnation proceedings.jefferson did not indicate to the board that there was an ongoing condemnation action.the board revoked jefferson class exemption,because it felt that a more searching process under a petition for an individual exemption or a full application was necessary.in so doing,the board stated that it was troubled by jefferson failure to disclose that the property was about to be condemned.in the board view,jefferson failure to mention this fact bolstered the city allegation that the proposal that jefferson submitted to this board was merely a device to acquire or retain property for purposes using federal preemption as a shield.
jefferson,however,does not require us to find that the board decision that rtr proposed a legitimate operation was arbitrary or capricious.unlike in jefferson,the board here was well aware that the local governments were considering condemnation proceedings on this property.in its decision granting an individual exemption,the board recognized that the county and the local communities have a different vision for this property than rtr.more specifically,in its earlier decision denying a class exemption,the board explicitly acknowledged the concerns of the local governments that rtr was seeking an exemption to prevent eminent domain proceedings from commencing.in that decision,the board stated 
wayne county and the other opponents claim that rtr proposal is merely an attempt to preclude the condemnation of some or all of the involved property for public purposes.to date,no evidence has been submitted that shows with any specificity what property may be condemned,who would condemn it,under what authority,and for what specific purpose.nor has wayne county or any other public body submitted any timetable for condemnation.
thus,it is clear that the board was cognizant of the local governments concerns when it reached its decision that rtr proposed a bona fide railroad operation.
further,unlike in jefferson,the local governments had not commenced condemnation proceedings by the time rtr requested an exemption from the board.the local governments admitted that they had just taken the preliminary steps of investigating the possibility of condemning the land and that the county had not at that time and has not at this time decided to take this parcel.
we agree with the board that the jefferson terminal case is different from the present case and does not overcome the board conclusion that rtr proposal is made in good faith 
finally,the board decision to require rtr to report on its progress in implementing its proposal ensures that rtr will not be able to use the board exemption to permanently shield the property from a condemnation action.if rtr does not begin work on its rail operations,the board reserves the right to reopen the matter.because the board will periodically monitor rtr progress,there is little concern that the board authority will be misused in order to insulate the property from the local governments should t
