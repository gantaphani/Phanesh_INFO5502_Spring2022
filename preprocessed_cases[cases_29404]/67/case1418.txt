background.
prior to,the south dakota eminent domain statutes provided that a railroad may exercise the right of eminent domain in acquiring as provided by statute.codified laws.chapter amended by adding the proviso,but only upon obtaining authority from the governor or the commission,based upon a determination by the governor or the commission that the railroad exercise of the right of eminent domain would be for a public use consistent with public necessity.chapter went on to grant the commission rulemaking power and to place the burden of proving public use consistent with public necessity on the applicant railroad.see codified laws and.then,in a provision now codified at,chapter specified criteria to be used by the governor and the commission in determining public use consistent with public necessity 
a railroad exercise of the right of eminent domain is a public use consistent with public necessity only if the use of eminent domain 
has as its purpose providing railroad transportation to shippers in south dakota,for commodities produced,manufactured,mined,grown,used,or consumed in south dakota 
is proposed by an applicant with the financial resources necessary to complete the proposed construction along with any related facilities which are necessary to protect against harm to the public safety,convenience,or other adverse socioeconomic or environmental impact,as evidenced by a financing commitment from a lender or an investor with adequate capitalization and resources to fulfill its commitment to build and complete the project 
is proposed by an applicant who has negotiated in good faith to privately acquire sufficient property without the use of eminent domain 
is proposed by an applicant who has filed a plat,as required by,and that plat sets forth the route of the road to be constructed or reconstructed,identifies each affected landowner,and specifies the location,along with construction methods and engineering specifications for all main lines,sidings,yards,bridges,crossings,safety devices,switches,signals,and maintenance facilities and 
provides that electric utilities,public utilities,telecommunication companies,and rural water systems have the right to the use of the for the placement of underground facilities,without fee,subject to reasonable regulation as to location and placement.
following extensive review,the surface transportation board approved dm e application under the applicable federal statutes in january.regarding eminent domain,the final environmental impact statement stated 
eminent domain proceedings are regulated by state law and not administered by the board.in rail construction cases the board determines whether the construction is inconsistent with the public convenience and necessity under but the applicant is responsible for the acquisition of land necessary for execution of the proposed project in the event that the proposed project is approved and dm e can not reach agreements with landowners,eminent domain proceedings may be pursued as an avenue of last resort.
dm e then commenced this action to enjoin enforcement of chapter.though recognizing that federal law leaves the use of eminent domain by railroads to state law,the district court enjoined as invalid under the dormant commerce clause because it intentionally discriminates against interstate commerce.the court also enjoined and.based on findings that dm e could not obtain financing for the powder river basin project under these oppressive restrictions,the court concluded that subsections and regulate interstate railroad operations in a manner that is by the interstate commerce commission termination act of,b,and is invalid under the dormant commerce clause.the court enjoined as violating the takings clause of the fifth amendment,made applicable to the states by the fourteenth amendment.however,based upon testimony that dm e always negotiates in good faith with landowners,the court concluded that does not conflict with federal law.the court rejected dm e severability argument and declined to enjoin enforcement of the remaining provisions of chapter.
ii.the eleventh amendment issue.
the governor argues that south dakota sovereign immunity reflected in the eleventh amendment bars this federal court decree enjoining the governor from acting in his official capacity.the district court rejected the argument,agreeing with dm e that injunctive relief may be granted against the governor under the exception to eleventh amendment immunity commonly referred to as the ex parte young doctrine.under ex parte young,the eleventh amendment bars damage relief against the states,but it does not prohibit certain suits seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against state officers.idaho coeur tribe,d.in coeur tribe,a divided supreme court held that the ex parte young doctrine did not authorize injunctive relief against state officials that would diminish,even extinguish,the state control over a vast reach of lands and waters long deemed by the state to be an integral part of its territory.at.
relying primarily on coeur tribe,the governor argues that the ex parte young doctrine does not extend to this case because regulation of eminent domain is as much a core sovereign interest of south dakota as regulating submerged lands was for idaho.but the comparison either proves too much or is unsound.on the one hand,the police power,too,is a core sovereign interest,but coeur tribe can not apply to every suit for injunctive relief against a state official exercise of the police would effectively overrule the ex parte young doctrine,despite the court express declaration to the contrary in coeur tribe,at.on the other hand,if the comparison is based on the fact that eminent domain is the power by which a state acquires ownership of lands,and lands were at issue in coeur tribe,the two cases are not comparable.this lawsuit does not involve lands that south dakota owns,nor does it challenge the state power to take land by eminent domain.rather,as the district court explained,dm e claim turns on whether the state has used the statute delegating its eminent domain power to regulate and control a federally approved railroad project.d at.thus,the injunction dm e seeks is within the traditional purview of ex parte young because it seeks to bring the state regulatory scheme into compliance with federal law.coeur tribe,at,concurring see duke energy trading,davis,cir,cert.denied,d.
the lead opinion in coeur tribe reasoned that proper application of the ex parte young doctrine require
