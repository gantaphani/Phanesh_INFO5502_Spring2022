vulcan materials company vulcan owns a land lease with the right to mine limestone.the problem is that a substantial part of the land and the mining is within the boundaries of the city of tehuacana the city in limestone county,texas.the city passed an ordinance in forbidding quarrying or mining activities within the city limits.vulcan contends that the ordinance constitutes a public taking and violates its rights under both the united states and texas constitutions.all that remains to be decided in this appeal,however,is the propriety of the district court grant of the city motion for summary judgment dismissing vulcan takings claim under the texas constitution.we ultimately hold that the case turns on whether the quarry mining constitutes a public nuisance and consequently remand for a jury determination on this issue.
the city of tehuacana has a population of approximately to people and occupies a small geographical area in limestone county,texas.
in,smith crushed stone,scs leased limestone quarry rights on three contiguous tracts of land tracts adjacent to tehuacana city limits and also leased four additional contiguous tracts of land within the city limits.it did no mining,however,on these tracts.in october,vulcan purchased the assets of scs in limestone county,including the limestone quarry rights leased by scs.this leasehold interest allows vulcan to prospect,explore,mine,operate for and produce by strip mining or open pit mining all rock,stone,limestone and similar rock like materials and grants vulcan the right to exclude all other uses of the tracts as necessary to enable the quarrying.
before its acquisition of scs assets,vulcan hired local attorney bobby reed to determine whether any ordinances would prevent vulcan from quarrying,including those tracts located within the city.reed attested that both the mayor and city secretary advised him that no ordinances existed nor were in the planning stages that would prevent vulcan from pursuing quarrying operations within the city.
the leases cover land both within and outside the tehuacana city limits.vulcan sought to mine approximately acres located inside city limits,described as tracts.this property is to of a mile wide and abutted by several public roads that access several homes,some of which are located just across the street from the property.outside tehuacana city limits,vulcan currently mines and operates a rock crushing facility on an approximate additional acres of land located immediately adjacent to tracts.
in early,vulcan began planning active quarrying on tracts.vulcan determined access points and ramp sites,determined where in that area it wanted to quarry,cleared land,stripped overburden,and otherwise prepared the tracts for physical use.there has been no recent mining on these tracts.
in october,vulcan sought and obtained permission from the texas railroad commission to construct berms on tracts.vulcan also prepared the quarry floor and removed overburden on tract to prepare for a blast shot to loosen limestone in the quarry.the city residents began to express opposition to the proposed operations and soon the city council began to consider adopting an ordinance to regulate vulcan quarrying activities.
vulcan conducted a test shot on tract on october,in an abandoned pit.another shot and similar preparatory activities were conducted on tract on november and.although approximately tons of limestone were processed through vulcan plant as a result of these two blasts,this amount was only a small percentage of what vulcan normally retrieved and processed during one day in its regular operations.some of the finished product was tested,and some was put into inventory and sold in the ordinary course of business.
before it passed the contested ordinance,the city held public hearings.numerous citizens complained about vulcan operations outside the city as well as the two blasts conducted inside the city limits.specifically,the citizens complained that vulcan activities caused shaking of houses,lifting furniture off the floor,rattling windows,shaking and jostling people in their homes,noise,dust,smoke,property damage,fear,interference with enjoyment of property and life,interference with the use of public roads and streets,and exposure to fly and throw rock.the city,and the district court,cite one flyrock incident in particular that had occurred when scs was conducting quarrying activities on the tracts outside of the city in which a boulder was propelled into a tehuacana resident yard.residents also complained that the mining activities caused springs and wells in the area to dry up.
on december,the city council passed the ordinance forbidding quarrying or blasting operations within the city limits the ordinance and on december,vulcan filed its complaint in federal district court,under both the united states and texas constitutions as mentioned above,the only claim remaining in this appeal is vulcan takings claim under the texas constitution.
in its september,memorandum opinion and order,the district court granted the city motion for summary judgment,holding that the ordinance is not an unconstitutional taking or an inverse condemnation under texas law.the district court held,as a matter of law,that the ordinance substantially advances a legitimate state interest.the court also made the following determinations with regard to vulcan regulatory takings claims 
t he activities the ordinance seeks to regulate constitute a nuisance under texas law.the ordinance therefore restricts no legitimately owned property right.even if the court were to assume that the ordinance did somehow restrict a recognized property right,a taking under texas law would not occur because vulcan has not been deprived of all economically viable use of its property.only a small portion of its property is affected by the ordinance,and the property still has an economically viable use.although vulcan argues that high explosives and heavy equipment are required to extract the limestone from the ground,the court notes that neither were required to extract the stone used to build the pyramids.obviously,while extraction of the limestone without explosives and heavy equipment may be more expensive and labor intensive,it is not impossible to operate such a quarry without violating the ordinance.accordingly,judgment will be entered to the effect that the ordinance does not prohibit quarrying,and that the ordinance is not an unconstitutional taking or an inverse condemnation under texas law.
mem.vulcan appeals.we vacate the district court grant of summary judgment to the city and remand.

under texas law,although determining whether a property regulation is unconstitutional requires consideration of a number of factual issues,the ultimate question of whether there has been a regulatory taking is a question of law.mayhew town of sunnyvale.
before we evaluate whether the ordinance constitutes a taking under the texas constitution,we must first address the city arguments that the ordinance is not a land use regulation.instead,the city contends that the ordinance is a health and safety regulation that redresses an activity under its police power and is not subject to the public takings law of texas the district court was obviously unpersuaded by the city argument because it addressed the takings issue presented in this case.
no one doubts that a municipality may enact reasonable regulations to promote the health,safety,and general welfare of its people.college station turtle rock,citing ellis city of west university place.however,if a governing body,in the exercise of its police power,enacts a regulation that goes too far in the regulation of private property,that governing body may be held to have taken the property,thus requiring it to pay compensation to the owner.jur d eminent domain.the following factors are relevant in determining if the ordinance has gone too far and effected a taking of vulcan property whether the property was rendered wholly useless whether the governmental burden created a disproportionate diminution in economic value or caused a total destruction of the value and whether the government action against an economic interest of an owner was for its own advantage.id.
in the instant case,we think that the tehuacana ordinance goes too far to be considered a mere exercise of the city police power.the only property interest at issue here is vulcan lease of the right to mine limestone from these tracts and tehuacana ordinance effectively prohibits any and all mining of limestone within city limits.
the ordinance makes clear that its purpose is to prohibit the very activity that vulcan leasehold permits.first,the ordinance is entitled an ordinance forbidding quarrying or blasting operations within the city limits.second,the ordinance makes clear that it is targeting a rock quarry operating near the city limits that has indicated its intention to begin quarrying and blasting operations within the city limits.finally,the ordinance expressly prohibits the quarrying or mining of rock utilizing blasting operations or use of explosives and the use of heavy equipment in connection with quarrying or mining operations.
in sum,it is simply undeniable that the ordinance specifically was adopted to completely prohibit vulcan from engaging in mining on tracts,and that the only right possessed by vulcan in tracts was the right to mine limestone.we therefore hold that the ordinance is a land use regulation.
we now turn to address the district court holding that the ordinance does not constitute a public taking of vulcan leasehold interest under the texas constitution.the texas constitution provides that n o person property shall be taken,damaged or destroyed for public use without adequate compensation being made.const.art.i,texas classifies takings into one of two categories physical takings or regulatory takings.mayhew,at.a physical taking occurs when the government authorizes an unwarranted physical occupation of an individual property.id.because there is no allegation that tehuacana has physically occupied vulcan property,if vulcan is to be compensated the ordinance must constitute a regulatory taking.id.
a regulatory taking can occur in two ways when the regulation does not substantially advance legitimate state interests,id.at,or when the regulation either denies the owner of all economically viable use of his categorical unreasonably interferes with a property owner rights to use and enjoy his partial taking.id.at citing,inter alia,lucas south carolina coastal council,d.
the substantial advancement requirement examines the nexus between the effect of the ordinance and the legitimate state interest it is supposed to advance.id.at.numerous governmental purposes and regulations may satisfy the substantially advance prong including enhancing the quality of life and protecting the community from the ill effects of urbanization.id.at.
even assuming,however,that the ordinance substantially advances tehuacana legitimate interests,a taking can still occur if the ordinance denies vulcan all economically viable use of its property or unreasonably interferes with its right to use and enjoy the property.id.at citing,inter alia,lucas,at.
determining whether a regulation unreasonably interferes with the landowner right to use and enjoy his property requires a court to consider the economic impact of the regulation and the extent to which the regulation interferes with distinct expectations.id.at citing,inter alia,lucas,at.the first factor,the economic impact of the regulation,merely compares the value that has been taken from the property with the value that remains in the property.id.at.the second factor,the landowner expectations,considers the existing and permitted uses of the property as the primary expectation of the landowner.id.at citing,inter alia,lucas,at.in contrast,d etermining whether all economically viable use of a property has been denied entails a relatively simple analysis of whether value remains in the property after the governmental action.id.
given the facts of this case and the limited nature of vulcan property interest,a lease for the sole purpose of mining limestone,it is clear that the denial of all economically viable use inquiry will be dispositive for the reasons set forth below.
in resolving whether value remains in vulcan lease,we must first examine which particular limestone mining rights are relevant to this of vulcan leasehold interests or only tracts the district court held that the relevant parcel in this case included not only the small acreage leased within the city limits acres,but also the adjacent acres that is also part of the lease vulcan attacks this characterization of the relevant parcel and contends that the court should consider only those tracts that the city had the authority to.
neither party has cited a texas case directly on point and we therefore must make an erie guess and follow the rule that we conclude the texas supreme court would adopt.american indem.lloyds travelers property cas,cir.
the city is correct that,under federal takings jurisprudence,when the owner of property intends to use a parcel of property as an integrated part of the whole of a larger tract,the entirety of the property is treated as one tract for purposes of a takings analysis.keystone bituminous coal debenedictis,d penn central transp.new york city,d.the supreme court explained this rule in concrete pipe,in which it stated 
a claimant parcel of property can not first be divided into what is taken and what is left for the purpose of demonstrating the taking of the former to be complete and hence compensable.to the extent that any portion of property is taken,that portion is always taken in its entirety the relevant question,however,is whether the property taken is all,or only a portion of,the parcel in question.
concrete pipe prods.construction laborers pension trust,d citing penn central,at,and keystone,at.
although these cases require the court to look at the integrated whole of the landowner property,they do not extend to support the city contentions although each case held that the relevant parcel included the entirety of the property,the regulating authority had the power to regulate all of that property.for instance,in penn central the new york landmarks preservation commission designated grand central station as a landmark and the landmark site was designated as the tax block occupied by the station.penn central,at.in conducting its analysis,the supreme court only considered other holdings of penn central in the station tax its other holdings in the city.penn central,at.similarly,in keystone,the pennsylvania subsistence act only regulated a small fraction of keystone support all of its and support pennsylvania were subject to the act.keystone,at.stating that t he question here is whether there has been any taking at all when no coal has been physically appropriated,and the regulatory program places a burden on the use of only a small fraction of the property that is subjected to the regulation emphasis added.
thus in each of these cases the supreme court rejected the plaintiff attempts to segregate the adversely affected property from the regulated whole,and to claim it is the only relevant parcel.see penn central,at.keystone,at.vulcan,unlike the property owners in penn central and keystone,however,is not arguing that the takings analysis should segregate only the adversely affected parcel from the regulated whole it contends that the relevant parcel should include only the property subject to the regulation and not its remaining property outside the city limits,which is beyond the regulator reach 
the city cites appolo fuels,united states,fed.cl,and argues that the court in that case considered,as part of the relevant parcel,property beyond the reach of the regulating body jurisdiction.appolo owned several adjacent tracts of land,some of which were in the little yellow creek watershed and others that were not.the city of middlesboro,kentucky and the national parks conservation association filed a petition with the office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement osm seeking to have the area within the watershed designated as unsuitable for mining under the surface mining control and reclamation act smcra,et.the director designated the entire petition of appolo leases within the unsuitable for surface mining but agreed to allow underground mining from outside the watershed.in response to this designation appolo filed a regulatory takings claim.
appolo,contending that a categorical taking had been effected,argued that the relevant parcel,or denominator,should include only those areas within the areas where mining was prohibited.appolo,fed.cl.at.the court,however,rejected appolo argument and held that the relevant parcel included other holdings of appolo outside the watershed area,on which mining was allowed.id.at.
contrary to the city argument,the court does not appear to have included property over which the regulating authority had no jurisdiction all of appolo property was subject to the smcra,an act of nationwide force.see hodel.surface mining reclamation ass n,d noting that the smcra was intended to establish a nationwide program to protect society and the environment from the adverse effects of strip mining.in any event,even if the city interpretation of appolo is correct,we hesitate to conclude that the texas supreme court would be persuaded by a single federal court of claims case.
because the city has not cited any authority,texas or federal,that considers property outside the regulator jurisdiction in determining a taking,we can not conclude that the texas supreme court would adopt that position.indeed,it appears that when a regulator exercises its regulatory jurisdiction to the fullest extent all value from the property within its has acted,absolute or unqualified.webster third new international dictionary.furthermore,it would seem incongruous to say that when the regulating body has seized through regulation all value possessed by the owner it has acted instead,when the regulating body takes all that the owner possesses there is perforce a categorical,not a partial,taking by that body accordingly,we hold that the relevant parcel in this case is vulcan leasehold interest on the property within the city.
in sum,the only property interest possessed by vulcan is the right to mine limestone on the land.further,the only portion of this property interest that is relevant to our takings analysis is the quarrying right within the city.finally,in accordance with our discussion above,we find that the ordinance effectively prohibits all mining of limestone on tracts.consequently,the ordinance deprives vulcan of all value of its property the relevant.we thus hold that the ordinance constitutes a categorical taking,which renders vulcan relevant leasehold interest valueless 
finally,the city argues that,under texas law,vulcan proposed activities would constitute a nuisance precluding vulcan recovery of compensation.this argument finds its origins in lucas south carolina coastal council,d.there,with respect to regulations that prohibit all economically beneficial use of property,justice scalia states 
any limitation so severe can not be newly legislated or decreed without compensation,but must inhere in the title itself,in the restrictions that background principles of the state law of property and nuisance already place upon land ownership.a law or decree with such an effect must,in other words,do no more than duplicate the result that could have been achieved in the adjacent landowners or other uniquely affected persons under the state law of private nuisance,or by the state under its complementary power to abate nuisances that affect the public generally,or otherwise.
lucas,at.thus,under federal law,even if the current value of the claimant property has been destroyed,the claimant can not recover if the background principles of the state law of property and nuisance would have prohibited that activity as a nuisance the nuisance exception.
the city contends that under the lucas nuisance exception the ordinance is not a taking because the city could abate vulcan activities as a nuisance and such a property restriction inhered in the title itself because background principles of texas property law allow the state,or adjacent landowners,to abate nuisances.thus,we must first decide whether the nuisance in federal be applied by the texas supreme court if so,we must then decide whether the district court properly held that the exception barred vulcan recovery in this case.
neither party has cited a case in which the lucas nuisance exception has been adopted by the texas supreme court nor have we found one.so,once again,we are required to predict whether the principles set forth in lucas would be adopted by the texas supreme court.american indem.lloyds,at.we conclude the texas supreme court would adopt such a rule in the proper case 
first,although mayhew does not cite the specific nuisance exception discussed in lucas,it is evident in the court own application of lucas that the mayhew court found the reasoning of lucas to be uniformly persuasive.the mayhew court cited lucas multiple times for various propositions.moreover,other texas courts have looked to lucas when evaluating takings claims under the texas constitution.see county line joint venture city of grand prairie,wl.lexis,writ denied texas natural resource conservation comm accord,wl.lexis,d,although this uncritical reliance on lucas by the texas supreme court is not conclusive of whether the texas supreme court would have looked favorably on the nuisance exception,it does impress us when making an erie guess.
moreover,although it is true that the analysis and holding of lucas now advocated by the city was not expressly adopted by mayhew,this failure certainly can not be construed as a rejection of the nuisance exception by the texas supreme court.mayhew involved a takings claim against the town of sunnyvale based on sunnyvale refusal to approve mayhew development plan and to rezone property to accommodate his proposed subdivision.mayhew,at.it was not necessary for the court to address the effect of the nuisance exception upon a categorical taking,however,because the court found that mayhew had not been denied all economically viable property retained a value of over million.mayhew,at 
second,we are persuaded that the nuisance exception is simply a sound rule.all property in texas is held subject to the valid exercise of the police power and the city is not required to compensate vulcan if its exercise of police power is reasonable.city of college station turtle rock.although it is fundamental that the government can not destroy the property of private citizens at will and without justification,the government is given,through its police powers,the ability to abate public nuisances.ljd properties,city of greenville.
third,courts should be cautious in finding a taking where the claimant activities are tantamount to public nuisances.keystone,at.this approach is consistent with the concept of reciprocity of advantage as described by justice stevens in keystone 
under our system of government,one of the state primary ways of preserving the public weal is restricting the uses individuals can make of their property.while each of us is burdened somewhat by such restrictions,we,in turn,benefit greatly from the restrictions that are placed on others.these restrictions are properly treated as part of the burden of common citizenship.long ago it was recognized that all property in this country is held under the implied obligation that the owner use of it shall not be injurious to the community,and the takings clause did not transform that principle to one that requires compensation whenever the state asserts its power to enforce it.
