this is a suit brought by russ and lee pye,seeking to require the corps of engineers to conform to statutory and regulatory requirements before issuing a permit to construct a road crossing within the waters of the united states.the pyes own adjoining land to the land on which the road crossing is constructed.their land also adjoins what is known as tract m of the sheppard tract on which an eighteenth century plantation house connected to the hayne family is situated and is near to,a matter of several hundred feet,the site of an african american cemetery owned by westvaco.the cemetery itself adjoins the pyes land and is probably partly on the pyes land.the old plantation house is eligible for the national register of historic places,as is the cemetery.
the district court dismissed the pyes complaint for lack of standing.we are of opinion such dismissal was error,and we vacate and remand for consideration of the merits of the pyes complaint.
the series of events giving rise to this litigation stems from the county proposal to improve an existing dirt access road the road leading from united states highway to the southwest corner of an approximately tract of the county land called the sheppard tract.see ex.to this opinion.the improvements affect all of the access road,which is owned by the county and open to private use only with county permission.a acre segment of the road is covered by waters of the united states.the road runs along the west side of the sheppard tract and cuts through it at its southwest corner,northwest corner,and northern end.the road leads directly from highway to a field,designated area m,at the southwest corner of the sheppard tract.area m contains the remains of an eighteenth century plantation home site.the pyes property is adjacent to area m and contains part of an historic african american cemetery.both the plantation home site and that of the cemetery have been declared eligible for entry on the national register of historic places.the sheppard tract,the pyes property,and other adjacent property are all part of a larger area known as encampment plantation.encampment plantation has historic significance because in addition to containing the eighteenth century plantation home remains,the graveyard,and other historic sites,it may have been the location where troops were stationed during the revolutionary war to guard south carolina state government which met across the edisto river during the british occupation of charleston.
in order to improve access to area m,the county proposed to fill the acres of wetland occupied by the road,to grade the road,and to install a culvert to permit drainage under the improved road.because the project involved filling wetlands,the county had to obtain a permit from the corps under section of the clean water act,
the permitting process began on october,when the county initially applied for a permit to fill the wetlands.at this time,the county intended to use the road in connection with the construction of an ash monofill on the sheppard tract.the county retired apparently meaning withdrew the application for the ash monofill on july.on january,the county applied for a nationwide permit under section of the clean water act to improve the road,indicating that it now planned to use the land at the end of the road for a dirt borrow pit and,later,for training police dogs.on april,the advisory council on historic preservation the advisory council notified the corps that the road improvement might have an effect on encampment planation,which would include the eighteenth century plantation home remains,a site that was either included in,or eligible for,the national register of historic places.additionally,the county had commissioned a cultural resource survey of the sheppard tract,obviously to determine the historical value of the area.the survey revealed that the eighteenth century plantation home site could be eligible for listing in the national register of historic places,along with other sites in the area.after receiving the results of the survey in may,the county abandoned its plans to create the dirt borrow pit.as of july,the county intended to use the road to access area m only for conducting routine maintenance of the land and for training police dogs.
the corps forwarded the county permit application on july,to the united states department of the interior,fish and wildlife service the state historic preservation office the environmental protection agency,wetlands regulatory unit the south carolina department of natural resources the united states department of commerce,national marine fisheries service and the south carolina department of health and environmental control,office of ocean and coastal resource management.both the national marine fisheries service and the fish and wildlife service responded to the corps concerning the project effects,as required under section of the endangered species act.the deputy state historic preservation officer also responded and indicated that the eighteenth century plantation home site was eligible for listing on the national register of historic places.on january,the united states department of the interior,national parks service,found the hayne plantation site and the african american cemetery site eligible for listing on the national register of historic places and informed the corps of that decision by copy of that letter.the letter indicated that the service did not find that the area was eligible for listing as a rural historic district.
the pyes filed a complaint in the united states district court,district of south carolina on february,alleging that the corps failed to complete all the required steps under federal law prior to granting the county the nationwide permit.they asserted federal question jurisdiction under and because the united states was a defendant.they sued under the administrative procedure act,the clean water act,et the national historic preservation act,et the national environmental policy act,et and the endangered species act,et.the corps answered the complaint on april.in response to the litigation,the corps suspended the permit on may,to confirm that it was properly authorized.
under this further review,the corps notified the fish and wildlife service to confine its analysis concerning endangered species to area m.the fish and wildlife service,later that month,answered that it could not discern any adverse impact on area on november,the corps reinstated the county nationwide permit,allowing it to complete the road improvement project.in reinstating the permit,the corps did not consider the impact of the improvement on the historic site in area m,or any other area,instead,confining its analysis to the footprint of the roadway area to be filled,which did not contain any historically relevant sites.
after reinstatement of the permit,the corps moved for summary judgment on february.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the corps and dismissed the complaint,finding that the pyes did not have standing to bring this action because they did not demonstrate either an injury in fact,causation of an injury by the corps,or the ability of the court to redress an injury.pye united states,army corps of eng rs,july.the county advises us that it has completed the road improvement project,however the corps freely admits that the wetland fill is easily removed.having considered the record,and after oral argument,we are of opinion that the pyes have standing to bring their suit,and we vacate and remand.
before discussing the question of standing,it is well that we recount some principal facts.
the pyes property is adjacent to the property on which the wetland fill at issue here is located.their property also is adjacent to area m on which is located the remains of the hayne plantation.it also adjoins the cemetery and probably includes a part of the cemetery.both the remains of the plantation and the cemetery are eligible for inclusion in the national register of historic places.
area m and the cemetery are located only some of a mile off of,a major coastal highway.
on august,the fish and wildlife service of the department of the interior advised the corps that the proposed permit not be authorized without service concurrence that the activity is not likely to affect federally protected species.the fish and wildlife service was of opinion that the entire sheppard tract be considered the action area of the project.it took that position because it was concerned about the secondary impacts of development within the tract that may ensue as a result of improved access.that letter stated that the public notice did not clearly describe what type of development would occur at the site and recommended that to avoid project development,we recommend that all project plans be reviewed up front to determine compliance with state and federal regulations.we recommend that a wetland master plan be prepared and submitted to the source agencies for further review.it opposed issuance of the permit until its listed agencies were addressed.the corps never addressed that position.
the plantation site and the cemetery site are both within a few hundred feet of the road which is the issue here.there was evidence aplenty in the district court,in the garrow report,that a significant part of the historical value of both the cemetery and the hayne plantation site was that neither,because of their location,had been subject to marauders 
feeling in finding a rural historic landscape incorporates all of the above attributes.a general test for feeling is whether the site or district could serve as a teaching example,without the need to ignore major changes.the feeling of the proposed district is very strong it is one of the few tracts in the county with remains from the planter house,slave settlement,upland fields,rice fields,and associated infrastructure without alteration by or modern occupation or use.
part,with respect to the hayne plantation.
the cemetery also is a good example of a distinctive,regionally important type of cemetery.the african american tradition of grave goods was strongly followed,and most of these goods have been preserved beneath recently developed topsoil.the site has not undergone the disturbance or removal of grave goods that commonly occurs as part of a misguided effort to clean up a burial ground.the cemetery can serve as a example of a community cemetery of rural african americans who followed a set of rules regarding burial customs.the cemetery was apparently not linked to a specific church,as were many later african american cemeteries,and it was not a cemetery.rural african american cemeteries of the antebellum and postbellum periods were once a common element of the southern landscape,but many have been lost from memory,removed,or impacted by development or logging.as a cemetery that embodies the distinctive characteristics of the sea coast african american type,site is recommended as eligible under criterion 
part,with respect to the cemetery.
we also note that the county commenced with proposing area m for an ash dump and both improving and paving the road to.as opposition developed,it changed the proposed use to a dirt mine and later changed the proposed use to a facility.the degree of improvement of the road was changed from a paved road merely to an improved road.the corps has described the project as to improve an existing roadway and to make it an road.
despite the fact of objections to the corps lack of addressing the impact of the road on the wetlands of the entire sheppard tract and the effect of improved and easier access to the historical sites,the corps addressed neither prior to issuing the permit,choosing instead to confine its consideration to what it calls the footprint,which is the actual fill of the wetland area,only without regard to any of the surrounding countryside,except,perhaps,area 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.marshall meadows,cir.standing is a threshold jurisdictional question which ensures that a suit is a case or controversy appropriate for the exercise of the courts judicial powers under the constitution of the united states.steel citizens for a better environment,d.the core goal of the standing inquiry is to ensure that a plaintiff bringing an action has enough of a stake in the case to litigate it properly.in cases brought under the administrative procedure act,the standing inquiry includes both a constitutional analysis and a prudential inquiry.see national credit union administration first national bank trust,d gba general servs,cir quoting motor coach,dole,cir.thus,to demonstrate standing in the context of the administrative procedure act,not only must a plaintiff show that he has suffered an injury in fact that is fairly traceable to the defendant conduct and that a court can provide relief to redress the injury,but also he must show that the injury in fact is within the zone of interests protected by the statute.motor coach,at citing data processing serv.orgs.camp,d.
to demonstrate standing at the summary judgment stage,a plaintiff must set forth evidence of an injury in fact in addition to that provided in the complaint,which will be taken as true for purposes of deciding the motion.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.this injury must be concrete,particularized,and not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan,at.internal citations omitted.a part of the pyes support for their allegations of standing were the affidavits of lee pye and michael trinkley,a professional archaeologist.these documents,together with other documents in the record,explain that the pyes own land next to,and probably including,an area containing designated historic sites and allege that the road improvements authorized by the corps permit will adversely affect that historic area.trinkley asserted that the improved road will affect the historic cohesiveness of the area and will,by providing better access,result in the presence of more looters at the historic sites.additionally,the pyes have alleged that their interests in the cohesiveness and integrity of the historical sites were further impaired by the corps failure to consider the effect on the sites of the issuance of the permit,and the failure of the corps to allow public participation and commentary by the advisory council as mandated by the act and the corps own regulations.
in this context,both our decisions and decisions of the supreme court indicate that adjacent landowners often have standing to challenge the government failure to follow statutorily prescribed procedures so long as this failure impairs a separate concrete interest of the plaintiff.see lujan defenders of wildlife,at.for instance,in lujan,the court explained that under our case law,one living adjacent to the site for proposed construction of a federally licensed dam has standing to challenge the licensing agency failure to prepare an environmental impact statement,even though he can not establish with any certainty that the statement will cause the license to be withheld or altered,and even though the dam will not be completed for many years.lujan,at.indeed,in such cases standing to sue is so that the supreme court often has dispensed with the inquiry altogether.see,robertson methow valley citizens council,d no question made of standing for a citizen council of the vicinity to challenge the contents of environmental impact statement.see also lujan,at.noting that in robertson,court did not address standing for the very good reason that the plaintiff was a citizens council for the area in which the challenged action was to occur,so that its members would obviously be concretely affected.likewise,in waterford citizens reilly,cir,we held that nearby plaintiffs have standing to challenge failures of agencies to comply with the national historic preservation act.waterford involved an organization of citizens concerned about the effect of an epa decision to allow a developer of townhouses outside of the town of waterford to hook into waterford sewer system.in permitting the,the epa failed to comply with a memorandum of agreement it had voluntarily made with various historic preservation agencies.waterford,at.the memorandum of agreement essentially reopened the section consultation process,the sam
