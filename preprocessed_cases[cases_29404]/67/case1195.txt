background 
on september,thomas and cathy davis the davises,husband and wife and citizens of the state of illinois,closed on a adjustable rate mortgage loan the loan with an initial interest rate of from the gn mortgage corporation in order to refinance personal debt.aside from the davises,the only other party present at the loan closing was patricia bogdanovich bogdanovich,the closing agent for ticor title insurance company,which was the title company authorized by gn to conclude the transaction.
at the closing,which took place at ticor offices in joliet,illinois,bogdanovich presented the davises with two stacks of paper,each purportedly consisting of documents and totaling pages.included in the stacks were duplicate copies of the proposed adjustable rate note,mortgage,adjustable rate rider to the mortgage,and accompanying documents entitled prepayment penalty note addendum,alternative mortgage transaction parity act disclosure,and notice of right to cancel.although the davises admit that they failed to read or compare the two sets of documents thoroughly at the time of the closing they allege that bogdanovich told them that the stacks were identical in content and accurately represented the agreement between themselves and gn,including a provision setting forth a prepayment penalty period.the davises signed all of the documents in one of the stacks and bogdanovich delivered the signed stack to gn while the davises retained the unsigned stack for their records 
early in,gn sold the davises mortgage,including all its rights and obligations emanating from the loan agreement,to countrywide home loans.thereafter,in the summer of,the davises requested that countrywide apprise them of the amount required to satisfy the remaining balance on their loan as of its anniversary september.countrywide responded by informing the davises that a prepayment penalty of approximately six months worth of interest on the loan would apply if the loan was paid off prior to the expiration of the prepayment penalty period,according to the signed prepayment penalty addendum in their loan file.this came as a surprise to the davises,who had no knowledge that they had agreed to a prepayment penalty rider and instead believed that they had signed,and were only subject to,a prepayment penalty clause based on alleged representations by bogdanovich as well as their own broker 
upon reviewing the unsigned copy of the mortgage contract that they retained from the closing,the davises discovered two documents which they had not previously read entitled prepayment penalty note addendum,both of which had been drafted by gn.the riders were identical except that one provided for a month penalty period,while the other provided for a sixty month penalty period.the addendum that the davises signed at the closing was of the sixty month species,a fact which they do not dispute.however,the davises claim that at the closing they signed both a and a addendum.they base this conclusion on the fact that they found a rider in the papers they retained after the closing and that bogdanovich told them that the two stacks of documents presented at the closing one signed and returned to gn and the other left with the davises were identical.therefore,the davises allege that because they signed every document in one of the stacks and found both a and a rider in their stack,they must have signed both versions at the closing.unfortunately for the davises though,they are unable to produce a signed agreement.on the other hand,the mortgage companies maintain that the parties never executed a prepayment penalty addendum and that no such rider,signed or unsigned,exists therefore,the davises were rightfully charged a penalty when they refinanced before the period in the duly signed document elapsed.
on august,the davises filed a diversity action against gn and countrywide in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois.in their original complaint,the davises sought a declaration that their loan was subject to either a prepayment penalty period or no prepayment penalty period whatsoever.they also claimed that they were entitled to relief under the illinois interest act,ilcs et,which,inter alia,makes it unlawful for a loan to provide for a prepayment penalty when that loan has an interest rate in excess of eight percent per annum the davis arm carried an initial interest rate of per annum and is secured by a mortgage on residential real estate.ilcs a.before the matter was adjudicated,however,the davises chose to refinance their loan at a lower,fixed interest rate with another mortgage company paying countrywide the contested prepayment penalty in the process,thereby mooting this portion of their claim.as a result,on april,the davises sought leave to file an amended complaint,which the court conditionally granted 
the plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on may,whereupon the trial judge addressed their failure to properly plead diversity jurisdiction and granted them ten days leave to file a second amended complaint to cure the deficiency,which they accomplished.the second amended complaint filed on may,contained four counts,alleging that each of the defendants violated the illinois interest act when they imposed a prepayment penalty without an agreement authorizing them to do so that countrywide breached the parties contract by imposing a prepayment penalty period that gn through their agent bogdanovich intentionally committed common law fraud when they misrepresented the terms of the davises mortgage loan and that gn fraudulently caused the davises to sign inconsistent prepayment penalty riders,in violation of the illinois consumer fraud act,ilcs et.
at the time that the davises filed their amended complaint,they also sought discovery from the defendants.however,due in part to settlement negotiations and two separate stays issued by the trial giving the davises leave to file a second amended complaint and the other allowing gn to file a motion for summary failed to reply to any of the davises discovery requests however,both of the mortgage company defendants had previously complied with initial discovery requirements in accordance with federal rule of civil procedure a,and each provided the davises copies of their respective loan files for the september,transaction.neither company copy of the davises loan file contained a addendum either signed or unsigned,but both contained a signed,addendum.
on july and july,gn and countrywide,respectively,filed motions for summary judgment.at this time,the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion to reconsider and vacate the district court july order staying discovery pending defendants motions for summary judgment and to obtain discovery pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure f.the trial court denied this motion on july.the district court granted the defendants summary judgment on all of the davises claims on february.we affirm.
ii.analysis 
at the outset,we note that in a case where subject matter jurisdiction in federal court is premised on diversity jurisdiction under,we apply the substantive law of the forum state,here illinois.see merrill trump indiana,cir.thus we are obligated to determine the issues presented herein as we believe the illinois courts would.see trytko hubbell,cir quoting kutsugeras avco,cir.
a.the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the mortgage companies 
summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,considering all of the available affidavits,depositions,transcripts,and exhibits in the light most favorable to the party.driebel city of milwaukee,cir.a genuine factual issue is one that properly can be resolved only by a finder of fact because it may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party.zemco navistar int l transp,cir quoting anderson liberty lobby,d.such an issue is material only if it might affect the outcome of the case under the governing law.doe roe,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also korf ball state,cir.w e are not required to draw every conceivable inference from the record,gleason mesirow,cir,and mere speculation or conjecture will not defeat a summary judgment motion,estate of phillips city of milwaukee,cir.
the davises assert that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the defendants because a genuine issue of material fact exists concerning whether or not they signed a prepayment penalty addendum to their loan at the closing.premised primarily on thomas davis personal declaration,the davises allege that their loan application originally reflected a proposed,prepayment penalty period their own loan broker,boatman,had informed them prior to closing that gn had agreed to a prepayment penalty period at the closing,the davises were presented with two stacks of documents by bogdanovich and instructed to sign one copy which would be returned to gn,while the other should be retained for their the davises records while they failed to read and compare these two stacks,bogdanovich,the closing agent,told them that the stacks were identical and represented their agreement with gn in all material aspects,including the prepayment penalty rider and upon later review,the davises found that their stack of loan documents contained both an unsigned prepayment penalty addendum as well as an unsigned addendum.
based on these alleged facts the davises argue that a reasonable trier of fact could infer that at the closing they signed a addendum in addition to the addendum discovered in the defendants files.furthermore,the plaintiffs claim that the existence of an unsigned addendum in their records is material to all of their claims renewed on appeal,it is material to their breach of contract claim because it establishes that the and intended prepayment penalty period under the contract is unclear,and it is material to the statutory and common law fraud claims because it explains the allegedly deceptive circumstances surrounding the obtainment of the prepayment penalty agreement.
breach of contract claim 
the davises claim countrywide breached the september,loan contract by enforcing a prepayment penalty rather than honoring an allegedly prepayment penalty.however,the only evidence of any agreement to a prepayment penalty period,beyond the statements the davises claim bogdanovich made at the closing,is an unsigned copy of a prepayment penalty addendum that they the davises received and retained from the closing for their records.
illinois adheres to a four corners rule of contract interpretation,which provides that a n agreement,when reduced to writing,must be presumed to speak the intention of the parties who signed it.it speaks for itself,and the intention with which it was executed must be determined from the language used.it is not to be changed by extrinsic evidence.air safety,teachers realty,quoting western.oil thompson.this approach is consonant with the general rule under illinois contract law that if the contract imports on its face to be a complete expression of the whole agreement,it is presumed that the parties introduced into it every material item,and parol evidence can not be admitted to add another item to the agreement.sunstream jet express,int l air service,cir quoting pecora szabo,d,see j b steel contractors,iber sons.in other words,u nder the parol evidence rule,extrinsic or parol evidence concerning a prior or contemporaneous agreement is not admissible to vary or contradict a fully integrated writing.id.emphasis in original internal quotations omitted.however,even when a contract is integrated on its face,if the contract is ambiguous,as a matter of law,then extrinsic and parol evidence is admissible to explain the terms of the ambiguous contract.sunstream,at quoting storybook homes,carlson,d,internal quotations omitted see pappas waldron,d,citing air safety,at.
accordingly,our task is to determine whether the loan agreement is fully integrated,clear and unambiguous,krautsack anderson,d.the threshold question for us to examine is whether the contract in question,here the mortgage loan note,is a fully integrated document,despite the lack of a specific integration clause.see j b steel contractors,at.the determination of whether a contract is integrated is a question of law for the trial judge to decide.see id.an integrated writing is one intended by the parties to be a final and complete expression of the entire agreement,krautsack,at internal quotation marks omitted,which means it contains such language as imports a complete legal obligation,eichengreen rollins,d,quoting armstrong paint varnish works continental can.importantly,only the subject writing may be considered to determine the integration question.id.at see also j b steel,at affirming the vitality of this rule,which was first established in illinois in armstrong.
the loan agreement entered into between gn and the davises is fully integrated,final in nature,and creates a completed legal obligation between the parties.when viewing the loan agreement in its entirety,we find an uncomplicated set of documents that,when read together,clearly and specifically state that the loan is subject to a prepayment penalty period of five years duration,as provided for in a separately executed addendum.the davises,in their attempt to establish,cite to the underlying promissory note,which provides that the borrower has the right to repay the loan at any time without penalty.however,other documents in the agreement,the prepayment penalty note addendum itself,plainly states that notwithstanding and provision to the contrary to language contained in said promissory note or deed of trust t he first sixty months of the loan term is called the penalty period.gn mortgage corporation memorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment,exh.d.the inherent purpose of the addendum to the contract is to alter the terms of the underlying agreement here the promissory note and the existence of such a document can not reasonably be construed as establishing.also,the documents comprising the loan agreement were all executed on the same day,contemporaneous with each other and,after reviewing each,we hold them to be internally coherent and fully integrated.in addition,the davises have failed to present us with any case law to even suggest that the lack of a specific integration clause in the loan agreement,in and of itself,would render the agreement incomplete or unintegrated.see eichengreen,at discussing j b steel.
notwithstanding the clear,comprehensive and integrated nature and language of the loan contract,the davises also argue that the agreement is facially ambiguous because of the existence of an unsigned penalty addendum document in their stack of the closing papers.this reasoning is unpersuasive for the davises can not cite their unsigned copy of a prepayment penalty rider,the very extrinsic evidence they seek to introduce,to establish that the contract is facially ambiguous thereby requiring the consideration of extrinsic evidence.the introduction of parol evidence to establish ambiguity in a facially unambiguous,signed,dated and fully integrated contract is a practice which the illinois supreme court has,to this date,neither condoned nor sanctioned,and accordingly we refuse to do so today.air safety,at commonwealth ins.titan tire,wl,cir see also see ppm finance,norandal usa,cir stating that illinois courts will look to extrinsic evidence to determine the parties intentions only if an agreement is ambiguous.
the davises argue that we should employ the provisional admission approach and consider extrinsic evidence concerning even facially unambiguous agreements.however,in air safety,the illinois supreme court reiterated the state of contract law and the rule in illinois when it stated if the language of the contract is facially unambiguous,then the contract is interpreted by the trial court as a matter of law without the use of parol evidence.air safety,at.in that same case,the supreme court made clear that illinois has never officially adopted the provisional admission approach.air safety,at.in addition,the court expressly decline d to rule on whether the provisional admission approach may be applied to interpret a contract which does not contain an integration clause until such a case is squarely before it.but am int l,graphic mgmt,cir.it is true that,although never definitively adopted either by the legislature of illinois or the highest court of that state,this court as well as a number of the illinois appellate courts have entertained the theory that under illinois law objective evidence supplied by disinterested third parties may establish an extrinsic ambiguity in an otherwise unambiguous contract under certain limited circumstances commonwealth ins,wl,at quoting ocean atl.dev.aurora christian,cir see also air safety,at listing illinois appellate court decisions.however,because the davises do not proffer objective evidence this suggested rule is inapplicable and,therefore,it is unnecessary for us to predict whether the illinois supreme court would adopt this new rule of law.see commonwealth ins,wl,at 
in all,the entire loan contract,including its prepayment penalty agreement,is clear,unambiguous and fully integrated rendering extrinsic evidence inadmissible to vary the contract terms.the davises essentially ask us to rewrite the signed and dated contract to include a shorter prepayment penalty period,but courts are not in the business of rewriting contracts to appease a disgruntled party unhappy with the bargain it struck.ppm finance,cir.thus,after review and consideration of the totality of the evidence,as is required,we hold that the signed and dated addendum is the only legally binding agreement between the parties as to a prepayment penalty,and absent fraud,countrywide can not be found to have breached their agreement with the davises by merely enforcing their rights to collect a penalty under the contract.
common law fraud 
the davises,in a separate count of their complaint,go on to allege that gn perpetrated a common law fraud during the execution of the contract,which occurs where there is a surreptitious substitution of one paper for another,or where by some other trick or device a party is made to sign an instrument which he did not intend to execute.belleville bank rose,d,citing turzynski libert,d.the davises claim that gn,along with its purported agent bogdanovich,mislead them by misrepresenting the terms of the mortgage loan at the closing.the davises allege gn did so by presenting them with different versions of the prepayment penalty addendum,one of which the version was different from what they bargained for and expected.
under applicable illinois law,an allegation of fraud must be established by clear and convincing evidence.cwikla sheir,d.however,unlike the plaintiffs breach of contract claim,illinois substantive law instructs that we are free to consider parol evidence to assist us in determining the true intent of the parties when a common law fraud has been alleged see cacciatore,d,mcmahon food burger dairy,cir.under illinois law,the elements the plaintiffs need to satisfy in order to establish common law fraud are a false statement of a material fact defendant knowledge that the statement was false defendant intent that the statement induce plaintiff to act plaintiff reliance upon the truth of the statement and plaintiff damages resulting from reliance on the statement.capiccioni brennan naperville,d.
in order to satisfy the reliance element of their claim,the davises must demonstrate not only that they relied on the gn representations regarding a prepayment rider,but that they were justified in doing so.see soules motors.when addressing the issue of justified reliance,illinois courts have long recognized that a party is not justified in relying on representations made when he has ample opportunity to ascertain the truth of the representations before he acts.when he is afforded the opportunity of knowing the truth he can not be heard to say he was deceived by misrepresentations.elipas enterprises,silverstein,d,quoting schmidt landfield,see also leon max miller son,d,miller william,d.this rule applies with equal force in instances where fraud is alleged with respect to the execution of a written contract.see belleville,at see also trust viii,d,a party can not close his eyes to the contents of a document and then claim that the other party committed fraud merely because it followed this contract.this is the due diligence rule,kolson vembu,which defeats the davises common law fraud claim.
assuming arguendo that were we to conclude that the davises satisfy the other elements of a common law fraud claim,a knowingly false statement as to a material fact which was proffered to induce reliance,which they do not,the evidence in the record would be deemed to be insufficient to establish that any reliance on their part was justified.the davises claim is premised on oral statements allegedly made by the closing agent,bogdanovich,explaining at the time of the execution of the contract that the mortgage included a prepayment penalty period.however,notwithstanding the alleged statements by bogdanovich,the davises had an opportunity and obvious obligation to read the documents before they signed them as well as up to three days after signing to review and cancel the contract under federal law if they believed the agreement to be flawed.due to the significance of the mortgage transaction a loan and the davises preoccupation with the prepayment penalty agreement in particular,they were not justified in relying on the alleged verbal statements alone.the fact is that the davises certainly had an incentive to independently read and understand the contract in order to confirm that the terms they were agreeing to,especially the addendum regarding the prepayment penalty period,were correctly set forth in the final version of the contract.their failure to read the prepayment addendum document which they signed is even less justified in light of the fact that,in addition to the ample closing meeting,the davises also were made aware that they had a full period in which to review the entire agreement and rescind it if they so decided indeed,considering the multiple obligations which the mortgage document imposed upon them,as well as the amount of money involved,the davises would have been well advised to visit a qualified attorney within that time period to review and fully explain the documents if in fact they had any doubts or concerns over its contents.nonetheless,because the davises were afforded the opportunity of knowing the truth of the representations,yet did not avail themselves of the means of knowledge open to them,they can not be heard to say they were deceived by misrepresentations.elipas enterprises,at quoting schmidt,at.thus,on the facts set forth here and in the record,we hold that the reliance element of the davises common law fraud claim can not be met as a matter of law.
illinois consumer fraud act 
the plaintiffs also claim that gn actions during and surrounding the closing on the loan violated the illinois consumer fraud act icfa.in order to be held liable for a violation of the icfa the davises must establish that the defendant undertook a deceptive act or practice the defendant intended that the plaintiff rely on the deception the deception occurred in the course of trade and commerce actual damage to the plaintiff occurred and the damage complained of was proximately caused by the deception.capiccioni,at citing connick suzuki motor,ilcs.while a complaint made pursuant to the icfa must be pled with the same specificity as that required under common law fraud,elson state farm fire cas,d,the icfa does not require a plaintiff to show actual reliance or diligence in ascertaining the accuracy of misstatements,zimmerman northfield real estate,d.thus,because the davises lack of due diligence in reviewing the document at the closing or requesting further assistance or explanation of the prepayment penalty addendum during the review period is not dispositive of the consumer fraud claim,we will examine their icfa claim separately from the common law fraud claim.see cozzi iron metal,office,cir miller,at.
the davises contend that gn deceived them by enclosing both a and a prepayment penalty agreement in the closing documents and representing to them,through their agent bogdanovich,that the unsigned and undated documents reflected the davises agreement with gn for a prepayment penalty period.they maintain that this resulted in their signing two inconsistent penalty riders,one for five years and the other for two there is no evidence that a rider was ever signed,they never produced a signed addendum and their assumption that they did sign one is completely unsupported in the record.while it is suspicious,and at the very least suggests poor business practices at gn,for the davises to be given a copy of both a and a prepayment penalty addendum at the closing,the fact remains that they actually signed only the rider.nowhere in the record do the davises nor does anyone else state definitively that a addendum was signed nor has any such signed addendum been presented to us in the record,much less introduced into evidence.the circumstances surrounding the closing on the loan that the davises point to as proof of deception,including evidence of bogdanovich alleged misrepresentations,falls far short of rising to the level of sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable trier of fact to find for the plaintiffs on this claim when considering the signed agreement.see zemco,at.
moreover,when analyzing a claim under the icfa,the allegedly deceptive act must be looked upon in light of the totality of the information made available to the plaintiff.see tudor jewel food stores,d,saunders michigan bank,d,see also bober glaxo wellcome plc,cir applying the illinois icfa.in this case,gn alerted the davises,in a number of ways,to the fact that they were agreeing to a penalty period.first,the,penalty addendum that the davises were asked to read and that they did sign contained a disclaimer in bold at the top,warning the davises do not sign this loan agreement before you read it.this loan agreement provides for the payment of a penalty if you wish to repay the loan prior to the date provided for repayment in the loan agreement.emphasis in original.second,the addendum that they signed contains three separate references to a penalty period.third,gn required that the davises execute this addendum to the mortgage separately from the remainder of the document,apparently in an attempt to denote its significance.finally,though less telling,gn provided the davises with an alternative mortgage transaction parity act disclosure form at the closing which the plaintiffs signed informing them that a prepayment penalty would be charged and that they should refer to the accompanying loan documents for the details of the provision.even if there was some confusion on the davises part during the closing and there may well have been,at no time during the closing nor at anytime within the three day grace period did the davises ever question,much less challenge the documents they had signed.in sum,there is no evidence to establish by clear and convincing evidence that gn engaged in a deceptive act in the course of obtaining the loan agreement from the plaintiffs 
plaintiffs request to conduct additional discovery 
finally,the davises claim that it was an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial judge to deny their motion for a continuance to conduct additional discovery.federal rule of civil procedure f provides that,if a party opposing a summary judgment motion has demonstrated that it is unable to present by affidavit facts essential to justify its opposition,the court may refuse the application for judgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may make such other order as is just.f.the davises argue that,had they been allowed extra time to depose their own broker as well as the title company representative present at the closing bogdanovich and various other employees of the of whom,according to the davises unsupported representations,they were unable to obtain statements from through their own they would have been able to produce evidence sufficient to withstand summary judgment.
a trial judge decision to consider a defendant motion for summary judgment before allowing the plaintiff to depose certain witnesses is a discovery matter,which we review under the abuse of discretion standard.grayson,cir.we are very troubled with the substance of the plaintiffs rule f motion,which leads us to conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying additional discovery.initially,we note that the davises assertion that no discovery occurred prior to the district court summary judgment ruling is inaccurate.to the contrary,by late november,both of the defendants had complied with their initial discovery obligations under federal rule of civil procedure a.in particular,they had disclosed complete copies of the davises loan file,neither of which included a signed or unsigned prepayment penalty addendum.
nonetheless,the davises argued before the district court that,because a question of fact exists with regard to the location of a prepayment penalty rider signed by the plaintiffs,they must be allowed to depose all employees,agents,or representatives of defendants who had any physical contact with plaintiffs loan file.edelman at.however,the plaintiffs fail to set forth any specific evidence which they might have obtained from these depositions that would create a genuine issue as to this material fact.the only reason to believe that additional,relevant evidence would materialize from deposing the defendants employees is the davises apparent hope of finding a proverbial smoking gun that is,someone who will testify that he or she knows that a signed,prepayment penalty provision did actually exist at some time and that the defendants have either hidden,destroyed,or otherwise disposed of this document.this,however,is based on nothing more than mere speculation and would amount to a fishing expedition,which is an entirely improper basis for reversing a district court decision to deny a rule f motion.grayson,at united states on leong chinese merch,cir.likewise,the davises desire to now depose the gn and countrywide officials that had authority over their loan brian brandt and patrice mcpherson,respectively is also an insufficient reason for this court to hold that the district court abused its discretion.both brandt and mcpherson stated via affidavit that the davises loan file did not contain either a signed or unsigned prepayment penalty addendum and the depositions sought would be solely for purposes of casting doubt on the affiants credibility and to reach the unlikely possibility that an adverse witness may contradict an earlier statement or volunteer an admission.on leong,at.however,this is not a valid reason for a court to grant a motion for a continuance to conduct additional discover
