the town of narragansett the town,a sleepy seaside community in southern rhode island,boasts some of the most beautiful beaches on the eastern seaboard.each summer,the town experiences a substantial influx of seasonal residents.each fall,the town empties out,leaving a large number of dwellings unoccupied.the town proximity to the university of rhode island uri makes these dwellings attractive for student housing.
this thriving rental market among college students has proven to be both a blessing and a curse.on the one hand,the clamor for student housing is an economic boon to property owners willing to rent their dwellings.on the other hand,the sheer mass of exuberant young people and their predilections have proven to be a threat to the quality of life in a quiet enclave.
in an effort to balance these competing concerns,the town adopted a novel ordinance authorizing local police officers to post a bright orange sticker at the front entrance of any residence found to have hosted an unruly gathering.the ordinance has had its detractors,and this case was brought as a multifaceted challenge to it.the challengers complain that the ordinance is both preempted by state law and unconstitutional on its face.
the district court,in a thoughtful and comprehensive rescript,rejected these plaints.see uri student senate town of narragansett,d.after careful consideration,we find that the town unorthodox solution to the problems caused by unruly gatherings does not,on its face,offend either state law or the united states constitution.accordingly,we affirm.
background 
we first recount the circumstances surrounding the adoption of the ordinance and summarize its terms.we then limn the travel of the case.
a.the ordinance.
the narragansett town council initially adopted an unruly gatherings ordinance in.it amended that ordinance in.the amended version the ordinance,codified at chapter,article ii,of the town code of ordinances,remains in force.we refer throughout to that version,which is reprinted in the appendix.
section of the ordinance empowers local police officers to intervene at and disperse gatherings that are sparking a substantial disturbance.the police may only do so,however,when the disturbance involves a violation of law.subsection a provides an illustrative list of instances of unlawful conduct that might constitute such a violation,excessive noise,obstruction of public streets,illegal parking,public drunkenness or urination,service of alcohol to minors.
once the police have abated and dispersed an unruly gathering,subsection a authorizes them to prominently post a notice on the premises.this notice takes the form of a bright orange sticker,which is affixed on or near the front entrance of the building the sticker contains an explicit message.it admonishes that,should police intervention be required in response to another violation at the same address during the same posting period,various parties,the owners and residents of the premises,the sponsors of the unruly gathering,and any guests who cause a nuisance will be held jointly and severally liable.landlords are informed by mail of both the posting and the violation that led to it.
the ordinance makes explicit allowance for certain defenses to prosecution for a subsequent violation.for example,under subsection a,a showing that only uninvited participants engaged in the proscribed conduct serves as a defense for innocent landlords,tenants,or event sponsors.to assert this defense,a landlord,tenant,or sponsor must show that she took all steps reasonably necessary to exclude the responsible individuals.as to landlords,such exclusionary actions include actively attempting to evict boisterous tenants.
the posting periods prescribed by subsection a correspond with the economic realities of the seasonal housing cycle.if a building is posted between the beginning of september and the end of may,the sticker must remain in place until may.if a building is posted between the beginning of june and the end of august,the sticker must remain in place until august.
under subsection b,landlords and tenants are jointly responsible for maintaining the notice in place.if a landlord or tenant removes the sticker,abets its removal,or tampers with it during the posting period,she is subject to a fine.
section delineates the penalties associated with infractions at previously posted dwellings.under subsection a,the first intervention during a given posting period incurs a fine the second,a fine and any further intervention,a fine.under subsection b,violators may be required to perform community service or,for repeat offenders,community service is mandatory.
the town routinely compiles statistics relating to its enforcement of the ordinance.its roster of offending dwellings includes all addresses at which police officers have intervened to abate and disperse unruly gatherings.it also maintains a list that features data relating to ordinance violations committed by uri students.
travel of the case.
in may of,the appellants challenged the ordinance in a rhode island court.the defendants removed the case to the district court in pursuance of federal question jurisdiction.see.
the lead is the uri student senate,which claims to represent the interests of uri students generally.the remaining plaintiffs,also appellants here,can be sorted into three categories.the first group comprises individual uri students who reside in narragansett and have felt the sting of the ordinance.these appellants claim,among other things,that they have been subjected to university disciplinary procedures as a result of violating the ordinance the second group consists of uri students whose rented abodes have been posted with orange stickers.these appellants claim that they were evicted from their homes and referred to the uri student life office as a result.the last group comprises landlords who have had their rental properties posted.these appellants claim that they have been unable to their properties and,consequently,have lost rental income.the defendants,appellees here,are the town and a galaxy of municipal officials.for ease in exposition,we refer to the town as if it were the sole defendant.
the complaint is cast mostly,but not entirely,as a series of constitutional challenges.the exception is a preemption claim positing that the ordinance is preempted by a state statute.the constitutional claims allege variously that the ordinance i violates substantive due process,ii is unconstitutionally vague,iii is overbroad,iv offends the requirements of procedural due process,and v deprives the appellants of equal protection of the law.
in due season,the parties for summary judgment on stipulated facts.the district court denied the appellants motion and granted the.uri student senate,d at.the court expressed concern about the absence of any opportunity to challenge the orange stickers,id.at,but nonetheless upheld the ordinance.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.analysis 
we begin our analysis with the preemption claim and then move to the constitutional claims.before undertaking this exegesis,we pause to memorialize the standard of review.
we review an appeal from the entry of summary judgment de novo.osediacz city of cranston,cir.in so doing,we take the facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most hospitable to the nonmoving party.borges ex rel,cir.we will affirm only if the record reveals no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.vineberg bissonnette,f d,cir quoting.c.
preemption.
the appellants assert that the ordinance is preempted by the rhode island residential landlord and tenant act l t act,laws to.as its title implies,the l t act speaks to the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants within rhode island.see id.in advocating preemption,the appellants rely on section,which gives most tenants the right to cure any material breach of a rental agreement prior to eviction 
under rhode island law,a municipal ordinance may be preempted by a state statutory scheme either if the ordinance conflicts with the statutory scheme or if it can be shown that the general assembly intended its statutory scheme to occupy the whole of the regulatory field in connection with a given subject.amico mattos,town of warren.the appellants preemption argument rests on the first of these lines of attack the supposed existence of a conflict between the ordinance and the l t act 
the appellants contend that the ordinance conflicts with section of the l t act because it requires a landlord to evict an offending tenant without providing the tenant with an opportunity to cure.eviction is required,the appellants say,so that the landlord can avoid liability for subsequent ordinance violations at posted properties.
this argument represents a triumph of hope over reason.the ordinance does not require a landlord to initiate eviction proceedings against an offending tenant.rather,section a explains that the owner of a previously posted property may avoid liability for a subsequent unruly gathering at that location as long as the owner is actively attempting to evict a tenant from the premises.affording the landlord an ongoing eviction defense is not tantamount,either legally or practically,to compelling him to institute eviction proceedings.
the appellants try to dodge this bullet.they note that,under the l t act,the first step in evicting a tenant is the issuance of a noncompliance notice.laws.the appellants declare that this provision grounds a preemption claim because sending a notice of noncompliance is antithetic to an active attempt at eviction.
this ipse dixit is not accompanied by any explanation as to why or how the transmittal of a notice of noncompliance interferes with,let alone negates,the active pursuit of eviction.bearing in mind that sending such a notice is the first step in the eviction pavane,the two acts seem entirely compatible.certainly,there is nothing in either the text of the ordinance or the letter of the l t act that precludes simultaneous compliance with both.
in all events,conflict preemption requires a direct conflict or something very close to it.see,freightliner myrick,explaining that implied conflict preemption may exist where it is impossible for a party to comply with both requirements or where a provision stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of the legislature quotations omitted.an awkward fit,without more,will not support a claim of conflict preemption.
in the instant case,we are unable to discern either a direct conflict or an irreconcilable inconsistency between the provisions of the ordinance and the provisions of the l t act.we therefore hold,without serious question,that the l t act does not preempt the ordinance.
constitutional claims.
the appellants advance a compendium of constitutional challenges to the ordinance.because they have not pressed either their generalized substantive due process or equal protection claims,we eschew any further discussion of those initiatives.without exception,what remains are facial challenges 
procedural due process.we start with the contention that the ordinance deprives both landlords and tenants of procedural due process.the appellants pounce on the fact that the ordinance allows the police to plaster an orange sticker on a dwelling without affording either the landlord or the tenants any opportunity for a hearing 
it is familiar lore that the essence of procedural due process is prior notice and an opportunity to be heard.bd.of regents roth.but this principle does not operate in a vacuum.in order to show a deprivation of procedural due process,a party must first show that the challenged action implicates a constitutionally protected liberty or property interest.id.at dep t of hud,cir see also const.amend.xiv.
in an effort to cross this threshold,the appellants focus on reputational harm,that is,the allegedly stigmatizing effects of the ordinance.they say that when a residence is posted with an orange sticker,both the landlord and the tenants are publicly branded as criminals.they add that this stigma is heightened by the town action in keeping a publicly available register of all posted premises.
student tenants are alleged to suffer a further detriment.when an orange sticker is posted on premises occupied by a university student,the town informs uri.in the appellants view,this additional step exposes student tenants to disciplinary proceedings and exacerbates the stigmatizing effect of the postings.
this argument can not withstand scrutiny.in constitutional jurisprudence,stigmatization is a term of art.the supreme court has made clear that a procedural due process claim can not rest upon reputational harm alone.paul davis.thus,when a person alleges that she has suffered stigmatization at the hands of a government actor,she must show an adverse effect on some interest more tangible than reputational harm.id.to use the popular catch phrase,the complaining party must satisfy a stigma plus standard.pendleton city of haverhill,cir.
the plus part of this formulation is not an empty formality.in determining whether there exists a cognizable harm,the stigma plus standard requires us to address two distinct components i the nature of the incremental harm to which the appellants point and ii the source of that harm.
a party who claims a violation of her procedural due process rights based on reputational harm must show that the challenged governmental action adversely impacted some right or status previously enjoyed by her under substantive state or federal law.see paul,at silva worden,cir.for this purpose,harm to a right or status that does not emanate from substantive state or federal law is insufficient.such harm thus does not qualify as harm to a more tangible interest within the purview of the stigma plus standard.see pendleton,at.
the nature of the affected interest is not the only hurdle that a complaining party must overcome in order to satisfy the stigma plus standard.the standard requires that the change in rights or status be directly attributable to the challenged governmental action.id.where the stigma and the incremental plus from distinct sources,a party can not make out a viable procedural due process claim.see,hawkins lottery comm n,cir.that is true even if both sources are government entities.see id.
the appellants acknowledge that a showing beyond purely reputational harm is required by the stigma plus standard.to meet that requirement,they describe two injuries that they claim result from the postings 
first,the appellants aver that the l t act provides them with rights to housing,to cure breaches,to notice,and to possession.second,they tout the right to rent and live in narragansett free of public branding.these rights,they insist,implicate protected liberty and property interests,and the infringement of them suffices to trigger the stigma plus standard.
there is,however,no cognizable harm.the appellants say that some landlords have been unable to posted dwellings.taking this as true,the resulting loss of rent is not a viable plus factor.nothing in the l t act or elsewhere in state law,for that matter confers on landlords an entitlement to have rental units fully occupied.rather,the l t act for the most part leaves the negotiation of leases and rates to the is,to the landlord and each prospective tenant.see laws a.this framework plainly contemplates that rental income is contingent on the availability of willing renters.viewed against this backdrop,it can not seriously be suggested that state law creates an entitlement to a steady stream of rental income that would qualify as a more tangible interest and,thus,as a plus factor.
similarly,the vacancies that the appellants lament do not result from state action but,rather,from the actions of third parties.after all,it is prospective tenants,acting without government compulsion,who decide whether or not to rent particular dwellings.a prospective tenant can base her decision not to rent on a multitude of factors including cost,location,amenities,and condition.there is nothing that prevents her,as a private party,from weighing in this balance the presence of an orange sticker.these decisions are not attributable to state action in the requisite sense.see lugar edmondson oil,describing circumstances in which private party actions may be considered fairly attributable to the state logiodice trs.of me.cent,cir similar.when a specified harm is predicated on voluntary behavior,it can not serve as a plus factor.pendleton,at.
the student tenants proposed plus factor is no more robust.this claim relies on evictions as a source of harm.it suggests that a tenant has a right to peaceable enjoyment of a rented dwelling free from eviction and that,therefore,eviction represents a cognizable plus factor.this is too sanguine a view.
the student tenants claim is defeated by the fact that their residential rights derive primarily from private contracts leases between private parties landlords and tenants,which entail private obligations.the l t act does not itself create a right to tenancies of any particular duration.in the last analysis,it is the lease terms and the tenant compliance with them that generally determine the tenant right to remain in a rented dwelling that is dispositive because a constitutionally protected property interest must rest on a right or status conferred by state law,not merely on the complaining party unilateral expectations.see paul,at roth,at.
of course,we recognize that there are situations in which the ordinance might be enforced in such a way as to implicate the legitimate,constitutionally protectable property rights of affected landlords and tenants.the record in this case,however,does not contain any indication that such events have transpired.though we conclude that,on the record before us,the appellants have failed to show that enforcement of the ordinance has resulted in harm to a cognizable liberty or property interest,this conclusion does not preclude the possibility of a meritorious challenge premised on more fully developed facts.
the district court also considered whether the fact that students had been subjected to uri disciplinary procedures could serve as a plus factor.uri student senate,d at.it rejected that hypothesis.id.at.the appellants do not mount a credible challenge to this conclusion although they note in their briefs that students were referred to uri for possible discipline,they do not point specifically to these referrals as a source of incremental harm.nor do they offer any explanation as to how disciplinary referrals might constitute a plus factor.any argument to this effect is,therefore,waived.see united states.zannino,cir.
the appellants have one last arrow in this quiver.they complain that the ordinance prevents them from living in narragansett.that is codswallop pure and simple the ordinance does not prevent anyone from living anywhere.although the ordinance creates consequences for those who choose to reside in the town but fail to abide by the law,these consequences,whether viewed singly or collectively,do not constitute harm to any tangible interest enjoyed by the appellants.
let us be perfectly clear.we,like the district court,are uneasy about the absence of a hearing.in addition,we recognize that there are potential applications of the ordinance that might impair constitutionally protected liberty or property interests say,if the police were to enforce the ordinance in an invidiously discriminatory way.but the appellants have brought a facial challenge,not an challenge,and the record is barren of evidence that unconstitutional applications have occurred.the mere possibility of misuse is insufficient to invalidate an ordinance on a facial attack.see ohio akron ctr.for reprod.health.
to conclude,the appellants have failed to demonstrate,as would be required to sustain a facial challenge,that any of the incremental harms to which they point in the hope of satisfying the requirements of the stigma plus standard inevitably results from the ordinance implementation.we therefore reject the appellants procedural due process claim.
overbreadth.the appellants complain that the ordinance is overly broad.the focal point of this plaint is their allegation that the ordinance penalizes landlords and tenants merely because of their association with a place or an event and,thus,trenches upon the first amendment right of association landlords and tenants,they say,are free to host social gatherings and invite such persons as they may wish.
we need not linger long over this asseveration.t he overbreadth doctrine permits the facial invalidation of laws that inhibit the exercise of first amendment rights if the impermissible applications of the law are substantial when judged in relation to the statute plainly legitimate sweep.chicago morales,quoting broadrick oklahoma.thus,i n a facial challenge to the overbreadth of a law,a court first task is to determine whether the enactment reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct.if it does not,then the overbreadth challenge must fail.vill.of hoffman estates flipside,hoffman estates,accord whiting town of westerly,cir.the supreme court has warned that t he overbreadth doctrine is strong medicine that is used sparingly and only as a last resort.state club ass city of new york,quoting broadrick,at see also mccullen coakley,cir new engl.accessories trade ass city of nashua,cir.
the appellants overbreadth argument misses the mark.the constitutionally protected right of association can not be reinvented to suit a plaintiff fancy.it has never been expanded to include purely social gatherings.rather,it is contingent on the presence of underlying individual rights of expression protected by the first amendment.see wine spirits retailers,rhode island,cir.as we explain below,there is no such underlying right at stake here.
the court has identified two types of freedom of association that merit constitutional protection i choices to enter into and maintain certain intimate human relationships and ii association for the purpose of engaging in those activities protected by the first amendment.roberts jaycees.these categories can not be stretched to form a generic right to mix and mingle.city of dallas stanglin,concluding that ordinance restricting attendance at dance halls did not reach the kind of expressive association that the first amendment has been held to protect.in the teeth of these authorities,the appellants urge us to sanctify a generalized right to congregate and socialize.this right far outstrips the bounds of recognized first amendment protections.
in the case at hand,we have construed the ordinance as requiring that the prosecution prove that an offending gathering created not only a substantial disturbance but also one involving a violation of law.see infra part ii b.mere police intervention is not enough.see id.in light of this construction,we conclude that the ordinance does not reach a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct.vill.of hoffman estates,at.
the concern that the ordinance,if applied in certain instances,could infringe upon constitutionally protected rights by,say,being invoked to interfere with a political gathering or to disband a prayer meeting may be valid in the abstract.but we do not deal here in abstractions,and the appellants have neither pressed nor adduced evidence to support an challenge.more is needed to sustain a facial overbreadth challenge.morales,at declining to invalidate ordinance on facial overbreadth grounds because it prohibited neither speech nor any form of expressive conduct.
vagueness.finally,the appellants maintain that section of the ordinance is unconstitutionally vague.they bemoan the ordinance use of undefined terms such as substantial disturbance,public nuisance,and a significant segment of a neighborhood.these terms,the appellants theorize,do not provide landlords,tenants,or other persons fair notice as to what behavior is proscribed.furthermore,the phrases fail to provide objective standards under which those charged with enforcing the ordinance can do so.
it is a basic principle of due process that an enactment is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined.grayned city of rockford.a law that survives an overbreadth challenge because it does not reach a substantial amount of conduct protected by the
