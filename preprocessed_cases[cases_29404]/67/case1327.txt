plaintiffs price discrimination claims.
plaintiffs complaints allege that the insurers used a rate structure based in whole or in part on the racial composition of kansas city zip code areas with the intentional unintentional unlawful effect of extracting higher premium rates from homeowners in the predominantly black community.their allegations of issues common to the class include 
whether the insurers used separate rating territories to charge higher premium rates for risks located in the community than for comparable risks located in white communities.
whether the insurers can provide any loss histories,or other actuarial or statistical data,to support their use of such segregated and discriminatory rating territories.
plaintiffs allege that the insurers violated b,which bars race discrimination in the terms,conditions,or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling,or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith,as well as and.their prayers for relief seek a declaration that the insurers violated these civil rights statutes,an injunction against any further conduct violating plaintiffs rights,compensatory and punitive damages,and attorneys fees and costs.
plaintiffs allegations of unintentional unlawful discrimination seek relief on a disparate impact theory of fair housing act liability,that is,challenges to practices that are fair in form,but discriminatory in operation.griggs duke power,d.in a number of prior cases,we have recognized a disparate impact cause of action under the fair housing act against governmental authorities.see,tenant ass bd.louis hous,cir.applying department of housing and urban development standards,we have recognized a disparate impact fair housing act claim against private actors in another context.see united states badgett,cir.but at least with respect to insurers,the question is not free from doubt.see naacp am.family mut.ins,cir.however,the insurers have not raised the issue and therefore we assume,without deciding,that private insurers may be liable under the fair housing act on a disparate impact theory 
seeking to deflect the significance of their disparate impact theory on the act analysis,plaintiffs on appeal note that they complain of racially disparate treatment,or intentional discrimination,as well as disparate impact.they did not argue this distinction in the district court,which is reason enough to ignore it on appeal.moreover,after twelve years of litigation,plaintiffs provide no factual basis for their conclusory allegations that the insurers intentionally charged rates based on a homeowner race.their factually explicit allegations are that the insurers used rating zones based on facially neutral risk factors that have a disparate racial impact.it is these disparate impact allegations that satisfied the threshold pleading requirement of rule a allegations plausibly suggesting not merely consistent with unlawful conduct.bell atl.twombly,d.viewing the complaints in their entirety,the lengthy litigation history,and plaintiffs categorical argument that no fair housing act claims are barred by the act,we conclude their conclusory allegations of discriminatory intent are mere labels and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.id.at.the point is important.our opinion should not be read as deciding whether disparate treatment claims against missouri insurers are barred by the act.in this case,t he allegations of intentional race discrimination do not appear to be preempted,but they are a diversion.dehoyos allstate,cir jones,dissenting.
ii.missouri regulatory regime.
like most states,missouri thoroughly regulates the business of insurance.the premium rates charged by property and casualty insurers are governed by chapter of the missouri statutes.insurers must file their rates and policy forms and,in the case of homeowners insurance,may only charge the filed rates.see.in setting rates,insurers must consider past and prospective loss experience within and outside this state,catastrophe hazards,past and prospective expenses both countrywide and those specifically applicable to this state,a reasonable margin of underwriting profit and contingencies,and all other relevant factors,including trend factors.in establishing rates,insurers may group risks by classifications that measure any differences among risks that can be demonstrated to have a probable effect upon losses or expenses.missouri prohibits rates that are excessive or unfairly discriminatory,terms carefully defined in 
no rate shall be held to be excessive unless such rate is unreasonably high for the insurance coverage provided and a reasonable degree of competition does not exist in the area unfair discrimination shall be defined to include,but shall not be limited to,the use of rates which unfairly discriminate between risks having essentially the same hazard and having substantially the same degree of protection against fire and allied lines.
plaintiffs note that two provisions in chapter specifically address the issue of race discrimination,prohibiting an insurer from canceling or refusing to insure or refusing to continue to insure because of race,g.but they cite no authority extending those statutes beyond their plain meaning to cover a disparate impact claim of racially discriminatory pricing.thus,discrimination in pricing is governed exclusively by.
the missouri department of insurance is charged with the execution of all laws in relation to insurance and insurance companies doing business in this state.the director of insurance may examine an insurer at any time he may deem it advisable,but at least once every four years.if the director finds that any rate filed by an insurer may not comply with the provisions of chapter,he shall hold a public hearing in connection therewith.if he finds after a
