the chemehuevi indian tribe and of its members collectively the tribe appeal from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the secretary of the united states department of the interior interior or secretary.the tribe alleges that the secretary,acting through the bureau of indian affairs bia,violated the administrative procedure act apa by determining that interior was not authorized to approve the tribe assignments of land to certain of its members.we affirm.
the chemeheuvi reservation reservation sits on acres in san bernardino county,california.title to the tribe reservation lands is owned and held in trust by the united states government.the reservation beautiful location belies a more turbulent history.
in the early,in order to provide water to burgeoning communities in california and nearby states,congress condemned the bottom land of the reservation where all the members lived in order to construct parker dam and create lake havasu.the dam left the reservation flooded,and all but one of the tribal families were forced to relocate off reservation.many of the displaced members resettled in locations not far from the reservation,including burbank,los angeles,and phoenix.
eventually,the flooding subsided and the land became hospitable.as a result,in,members of the tribe sought to reorganize the tribal government and provide incentives for its members to move back to the reservation.specifically,the tribe has attempted over the past ten years to convey exclusive rights of use and possession of land to certain of its members,having concluded that many members who had resettled owned homes in their new communities and would likely need a large incentive before selling their existing homes and relocating to build new homes on the reservation.
to that end,in the tribe adopted ordinance a,which established procedures under which the tribal council can approve land assignment deeds to tribal members.pursuant to the ordinance and deeds,tribal members would be allowed to occupy unassigned tribal trust lands for residential purposes in a manner similar to fee simple ownership in land off the reservation.the ordinance describes the assignments as formal exclusive right s to use and possess tribal land.the tribe itself described the assignments as interest s in the parcel of tribal land that were as close to fee simple absolute as possible.
pursuant to the ordinance,the tribe issued deeds to some of its members,which the tribe then submitted to the bia western regional director,seeking their approval under section.the regional director declined to approve the deeds,and the tribe appealed to the interior board of indian appeals ibia 
reaching the merits of the appeal,the ibia concluded that the deeds can not be approved under section because doing so would violate section.chemehuevi indian tribe reg l,ibia.section b provides that n o agreement or contract with an indian tribe that encumbers indian lands for a period of or more years shall be valid unless that agreement or contract bears the approval of the secretary.section d requires the secretary to reject agreements that violate federal law.id.
the ibia determined that the deeds are encumbrances under section,and no party disputes this conclusion.as the ibia explained,t he tribe land assignment deeds meet this criteria because they grant to third parties the assignees a right of entry on,a claim to,and nearly exclusive proprietary control over a parcel of the tribe trust land to the exclusion of all others,including the tribe.chemehuevi indian tribe,ibia at.
the ibia also concluded that the deeds are conveyances under.section provides that n o purchase,grant,lease,or other conveyance of lands,or of any title or claim thereto from an indian tribe is valid unless it is approved by congress.thus,the ibia concluded that while the deeds encumber lands pursuant to section and therefore would otherwise be eligible for approval under that section they also convey an exclusive possessory interest that is intended to be perpetual under section.chemehuevi indian tribe,ibia at.reading the two sections together,and noting that congress has not approved these types of assignments under section,the ibia determined that the secretary could not approve the assignments.id.at.
the tribe then filed this action in district court for the central district of california,alleging that the secretary violated the apa by not approving the deeds.the tribe contended that the secretary final decision was erroneous because the deeds do not completely extinguish the tribe interest in the land and thus do not violate section.the tribe also contended that congress amended section so that assignments falling under that statute are no longer subject to section.
upon considering multiple motions,the district court granted summary judgment to the secretary,concluding that the ibia interpretation of the relevant statutes and regulations was reasonable under chevron,natural resources defense council.this timely appeal followed.

we review the ibia interpretation of federal statutes under the methodology described in chevron and its progeny.in reviewing the ibia decision,we first address whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,at.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.if,employing the traditional tools of statutory construction,we determine that congress has directly and unambiguously spoken to the precise question at issue,then the unambiguously expressed intent of congress controls.id.at.in determining congressional intent,we not only examine the precise statutory section in question but also analyze the provision in the context of the governing statute as a whole,presuming a congressional intent to create a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme.fda brown williamson tobacco,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
thus,at the first step of the chevron analysis,if we conclude that congress has directly spoken to the question,then we must give effect to congress clearly expressed intent.adams forest,cir see also chevron,at if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter.
however,if the statute is silent or ambiguous,we proceed to step two and defer to the agency interpretation if it is based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,at.because we conclude that the intent of congress is clear as to the statutes at issue in this appeal,we need not proceed to step two 
this case turns on the interpretation of two federal statutes section and section.section is part of the indian nonintercourse act,whose overriding purpose is the protection of indian lands.it acknowledges and guarantees the indian tribes right of possession and imposes on the federal government a fiduciary duty to protect the lands covered by the act.united states for and on behalf of santa ana indian pueblo of new mexico,cir citations omitted.the goal of the statute is to ensure that tribal lands remain in tribal hands.see fed.power comm tuscarora indian nation.
section provides that 
no purchase,grant,lease,or other conveyance of lands,or of any title or claim thereto,from any indian nation or tribe of indians,shall be of any validity in law or equity,unless the same be made by treaty or convention entered into pursuant to the constitution.
section has been interpreted as prohibiting a great deal of transactions absent congressional authorization.see,oneida indian nation of oneida cnty.of,holding that tribe prohibited from giving land to state without federal government approval united states acres of land,cir holding that indian land may not be taken from tribe via adverse possession without government approval mashpee tribe town of mashpee,holding that agreements between tribe and its members not exempt.

prior to the amendments,section provided that 
no agreement shall be made by any person with any tribe of indians,or individual indians not citizens of the united states,for the payment or delivery of any money or other thing of value,in present or in prospective,or for the granting or procuring any privilege to him,or any other person,in consideration of services for said indians relative to their lands unless such contract or agreement bear the approval of the secretary and the commissioner of indian affairs indorsed upon it.
prior to march,amendments.
however,the former section language proved to be untenably broad.because it required the secretary approval to contract for services for indians relative to their lands,the former section was susceptible to the interpretation that any contract that touches or concerns indian lands must be approved,at emphasis added.indeed,neither tribes,their partners nor the bia could predict with any certainty whether a court might ultimately conclude that a transaction was void because it was not approved pursuant to section.id.at.as a result of this uncertainty over the statute language,and the draconian penalties that could be meted out for violating it,the secretary received applications for approval of such commonplace contracts as sales of vehicles.id.at.
this confusion led congress to clarify which agreements require federal approval.id.at.congress did so by amending section in two important ways it limited the section to apply to only agreements concerning a duration of or more years,and it replaced relative to indian lands with encumbering indian lands.section as amended in provides that 
b no agreement or contract with an indian tribe that encumbers indian lands for a period of or more years shall be valid unless that agreement or contract bears the approval of the secretary.
d the secretary or a designee of the secretary shall refuse to approve an agreement or contract that is covered under subsection b of this section if the secretary or a designee of the secretary determines that the agreement or contract 
violates federal law 
the amendments to section also granted authority to the secretary to promulgate regulations implementing the statute.e.the regulations most relevant to this appeal include,which provides that u nless otherwise provided in this part,contracts and agreements entered into by an indian tribe that encumber tribal lands for a period of seven or more years require secretarial approval under this part.
provides that 
encumber means to attach a claim,lien,charge,right of entry or liability to real property referred to generally as encumbrances.encumbrances covered by this part may include leasehold mortgages,easements,and other contracts or agreements that by their terms could give to a third party exclusive or nearly exclusive proprietary control over tribal land.
the regulations further explain which agreements are exempt from the secretary review,including those that convey to tribal members any rights for temporary use of tribal lands,assigned by indian tribes in accordance with tribal laws or customs.d.finally,the secretary clarified that t he secretary will disapprove a contract or agreement that requires secretarial approval under this part if the secretary determines that such contract or agreement v iolates federal law.
we conclude that congressional intent is clear.section prohibits the grant,lease,or other conveyence of lands,or of any title thereto from an indian tribe unless approved by congress.congress has not approved the transactions at issue here.therefore,the secretary properly denied approval of the deeds under section because such conveyences would violate federal law.
the tribe first contends that the assignments do not violate section under the fifth circuit tonkawa tribe of oklahoma richards,cir.the tribe asserts that,under tonkawa,only conveyances that completely extinguish a tribe interests must be approved under section.because the deeds do not completely extinguish the tribe title to the land,the tribe argues that they do not require congressional approval.
as an out of circuit case,tonkawa does not bind us.however,even if it did,it would not alter the outcome because it applies to situations in which a tribe loses all possible rights to the land,which is not the case here.in tonkawa,the tribe asserted that the state of texas had completely divested tribal title to the land.id.the court held that a tribe,to prevail on a claim of a violation of section,must show,among other things,that the t ribe title or claim to the interest in land has been extinguished without express consent of the united states.id.at.thus,tonkawa explains what is necessary for a tribe to succeed on a section claim when the right to the land has been completely extinguished.as the ibia put it,i t is beyond cavil that applies to such conveyances.chemehuevi indian tribe,ibia at.
the statutory language of section confirms our reading of tonkawa.section requires congressional approval of leases,grants,or other conveyance s of lands,or of any title or claim thereto.emphasis added.in other words,section by its very language applies to conveyances of less than complete divestment,which is how the section has been interpreted by other bodies as well.see,lease of indian lands for grazing purposes,op.att y,solicitor opinion,m,i op.solic,explaining that section applies whether or not a transaction attempts to convey complete title united states pac,cir easements granting railroad rights of way on tribal land are subject to section,and thus invalid without congressional authorization.
the tribe also asserts that even if the deeds are subject to section,they may nevertheless be approved by the secretary under section.the tribe contends that the deeds may be approved under the present section because congress amendments expanded the scope of the secretary authority to approve these types of encumbrances.in other words,the tribe asserts that congress,by amending section,authorized the secretary to approve conveyances of land that section would otherwise prohibit.
the plain language of section does not support the tribe reading.as explained above,section as amended explicitly prohibits approval of an agreement that is subject to its approval requirements if the agreement or contract violates federal law.d.section is part of federal law and prohibits any purchase,grant,lease,or other conveyance of lands,or of any title or claim thereto,from any indian nation or tribe of indians that is not authorized by congress.
without the support of the plain language of the statutes,the tribe argument instead becomes an argument that the amendments impliedly repealed section.but repeal by implication is disfavored,ahlmeyer nevada system of higher education,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted,and nothing in the statute language suggests that congress intended to give the secretary the authority to approve an agreement that otherwise falls w
