in this appeal from the district court order granting in part defendant motion for summary judgment as to plaintiff claims of retaliation for the exercise of her first amendment rights and denying in part defendant motion as to plaintiff related state tort law claims but dismissing those claims without prejudice,plaintiff,sue fritz,argues that the allegations in her complaint were sufficient to state a claim for retaliation under.for the reasons that follow,we reverse the district court order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
because this appeal is from what was treated as a motion to dismiss on the pleadings,the facts as set forth in the complaint are taken as true for the purposes of this appeal.plaintiff was an independent agent for the farm bureau insurance company farm bureau doing business as the fritz agency out of an office in her home in comstock,michigan.the home had been purchased contingent upon approval for a home office,so plaintiff applied for and received a special use permit in october.
while plaintiff special use permit application was pending,she attended several comstock planning commission and board of trustees meetings related to the approval of her home office and some other meetings,during which she noticed procedural irregularities.at one meeting,defendant township supervisor tim hudson became irritated with plaintiff presence when she was not on the agenda and in another meeting he expressed frustration with plaintiff monitoring of the meetings,allegedly in an attempt to intimidate her from attending in the future.
plaintiff then learned that comstock zoning restrictions and ordinances restricted the way she could conduct her business with regards to a sign describing the business,employees working in the home office,and the proportion of the home used as an office.she applied for a zoning variance,which was denied,and subsequently plaintiff was issued a signage violation.plaintiff applied for a signage variance,which also was denied.during the application process,plaintiff continued displaying her sign,but then removed it when her variance was denied.
in late and early,citizens and township officials allegedly made false statements about plaintiff and her home office.in july,plaintiff complained to defendant hudson about township officials falsely accusing her of zoning and other violations and about a neighbor harassment.
on three,november,and march,hudson spoke via telephone with plaintiff supervisors at farm bureau plaintiff employer or employer about her activities in comstock,including her attendance of public meetings,public comments and advocacy of her business,her petitioning of comstock for a redress of grievances related to her business,and her overall public relations with the community of comstock in the first phone conversation,defendant hudson discussed plaintiff comments in planning commission meetings,a petition in the neighborhood against plaintiff,and a letter to the editor written by plaintiff in which defendant hudson alleged she bashed comstock,compl.defendant hudson said that if plaintiff would tone down her speech and remove her sign,her problems might go away,compl.in the second phone call,defendant hudson emphasized that plaintiff public comments and her petitioning for redress of grievances would create adverse consequences for her and farm bureau from a public relations perspective,compl.finally,in the third phone conversation,defendant hudson again commented on the same issues and warned that farm bureau presence in comstock was in jeopardy because of plaintiff conduct inasmuch as the community was allegedly in an uproar about it,compl.
between the first and second phone conversations in september,another comstock planning commission member,steve gazdeg,spoke with plaintiff employer to express displeasure that plaintiff had brought her attorney to a planning commission meeting.
after the first phone call,plaintiff employer spoke with her about changing her behavior in the community,and three weeks after the third conversation plaintiff employer terminated her relationship with farm bureau because of her controversial community relations with her neighbors and with the local governmental unit,compl.
plaintiff attendance at public meetings and her comments in public forums and in the press began prior to,but continued after the phone conversations and after her termination by farm bureau.before the first phone conversation,she contacted defendant hudson on several occasions to complain about comstock officials accusing her of zoning and other violations and to complain about harassment from a neighbor.after the second conversation,in january,plaintiff criticized comstock administrators in a public meeting,which was reported in a local newspaper.following her termination,plaintiff attended a comstock public meeting in april and engaged in a heated discussion with a comstock resident,during which time the video camera plaintiff brought to record the meeting was broken.
plaintiff filed this lawsuit seeking damages,injunctive relief,and attorney fees on december,in the united states district court for the western district of michigan alleging that the charter township of comstock comstock and its supervisor,tim hudson,engaged in unlawful retaliation,under,against her for exercising her first amendment rights by speaking critically of comstock in public forums and in the press and that this retaliatory conduct also resulted in several state tort law violations raised under supplemental jurisdiction.
on may,defendants comstock and hudson filed a motion that was styled as a motion for summary judgment,but which the court treated as a motion for judgment on the pleadings under.c since defendants relied upon that rule and did not offer any matters for consideration beyond the pleadings.on november,the district court granted defendant motion as to the retaliation claims,but denied it as to the state tort law claims,electing instead to dismiss those claims without prejudice under its discretionary power to decline jurisdiction over supplemental state law claims when the federal claim has been dismissed.fritz charter tp.of comstock,wl at citing novak metrohealth med,cir see also musson theatrical fed.express,cir.

defendant motion to dismiss regarding the first amendment retaliation claima.standard of review 
appeals from motions to dismiss on the pleadings under.c are reviewed de novo,pursuant to the same standards that should have been applied in the district court.tucker place,cir.the standard of review for a rule c motion is the same as for a motion under rule b for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.ziegler ibp hog market,cir citing mixon ohio,cir.for purposes of a motion for judgment on the pleadings,all material allegations of the pleadings of the opposing party must be taken as true,and the motion may be granted only if the moving party is nevertheless clearly entitled to judgment.jpmorgan chase bank,winget,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
the factual allegations in the complaint need to be sufficient to give notice to the defendant as to what claims are alleged,and the plaintiff must plead sufficient factual matter to render the legal claim plausible,more than merely possible.ashcroft iqbal.however,a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation need not be accepted as true on a motion to dismiss,nor are recitations of the elements of a cause of action sufficient.hensley propride,cir quoting bell atlantic twombly,see also delay rosenthal collins group,cir.
plaintiff complaint was sufficient to state a claim for first amendment retaliation 
to survive a motion to dismiss a claim under,the plaintiff must allege two elements the defendant acted under color of state law and the defendant conduct deprived the plaintiff of rights secured under federal law.bloch ribar,cir.
defendants acted under color of state law 
plaintiff alleged in her complaint that defendant hudson was employed as the township supervisor,but she made no clear allegations that he was acting under color of state law when he had three phone conversations with her employer.however,the district court assumed that plaintiff had adequately alleged state action for purposes of this motion and the defendants did not dispute that characterization in their brief on appeal.therefore,it does not appear from the pleadings to be in dispute whether defendant hudson acted under color of state law,and so it will be assumed that plaintiff sufficiently pled state action for purposes of evaluating the motion to dismiss.see black barberton citizens,cir discussing the contours of acting under color of state law for purposes of litigation and its similarity to state action for purposes of the fourteenth amendment.
plaintiff allegations of retaliatory conduct by defendants 
the second prong of the defendant conduct amounts to a deprivation of a right protected by federal analyzed in the context of retaliation claims under as a three factor analysis.the plaintiff must plead factual allegations to establish that 
the plaintiff engaged in constitutionally protected conduct an adverse action was taken against the plaintiff that would deter a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in that conduct and 
the adverse action was motivated at least in part by the plaintiff protected conduct.

plaintiff conduct is protected by the first amendment 
plaintiff allegations that she engaged in public comment at public meetings for comstock and that she made comments in the press via letters to the editor certainly suffice as protected conduct under the first amendment.see leonard robinson,cir see also pickering board of ed.of tp.high school dist,will county,illinois.defendants do not contest that plaintiff conduct is protected by the first amendment.fritz,wl at.
defendants alleged conduct was sufficient to state a claim for an adverse action 
the parties primarily disagree on whether there was an adverse action by the defendants against plaintiff that would deter a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in the kinds of protected conduct in which plaintiff was engaging.mezibov,at.the three phone conversations between defendant hudson and plaintiff employer are the crux of the alleged adverse actions,which plaintiff characterizes as follows 
tim hudson acts of informing farm bureau of his dislike and opposition to plaintiff speech that she made in comstock township forums,that she should refrain from doing so in the future,and warning farm bureau that its presence in the community would be jeopardized if she did not refrain from doing so in the future.
record,pl.br.in opp.plaintiff also alleged that she was denied zoning and signage variances in retaliation for her protected conduct.defendant contend in their motion to dismiss that the adverse action is actually the termination of plaintiff by farm bureau because only that kind of conduct amounts to an adverse action under established law,record,defs.br.in supp,but in order to give effect to the factual allegations in plaintiff complaint,this court must instead decide,as the district court did,whether the phone conversations and the denial of variances are legally sufficient to give rise to a claim of an adverse action.
the term adverse action arose in the employment context and has traditionally referred to actions such as discharge,demotions,refusal to fire,nonrenewal of contracts,and failure to promote,at.however,this circuit has held that any action that would deter a person of ordinary firmness from exercising protected conduct will suffice,which may include harassment or publicizing facts damaging to a person reputation.id.at.the analysis of this factor must be tailored to the circumstances such that prisoners might have to endure more than public employees,who in turn might have to endure more than the average citizen.mezibov,at citing,at.plaintiff is not a public employee,official,or prisoner,and so the level of injury she must allege would be the lower limit of a cognizable injury for a first amendment retaliation claim.the appropriate formulation for these circumstances is whether the actions of defendant hudson and other comstock officials would be sufficient to deter an average citizen from participating in public meetings and criticizing local officials about matters directly relevant to the citizen business interests in the community.
there are very few cases in this circuit addressing first amendment retaliation against private individuals.since our en banc decision in setting forth the applicable standard of law,this case is one of the first concerning private individuals and is the first in which this court must address whether it constitutes retaliation for a public official to speak with a private employer about an employee protected conduct in such a way as to either defame the employee or to threaten her economic livelihood directly or indirectly.most of the case law in the circuit involving retaliation claims involves public employees who publicly criticize the government,their employer,or involves prisoners who are harassed or threatened by prison officials for engaging in protected conduct.see,hughes region vii area agency on aging,cir public employee terminated after conversations with and publishing letter to editor regarding budget see city of elyria,cir police officer fired after speaking with fbi regarding corruption in the police department lockett suardini,cir prisoner alleging retaliation by prison guards for comments made in an administrative hearing thomas eby,cir prisoner claiming retaliation in the form of misconduct ticket for filing a grievance.our caselaw therefore provides insufficient guidance on whether plaintiff complaint is sufficient to state a claim of retaliation,especially with regards to the alleged adverse action.
several years prior to,this circuit found conduct that was factually quite similar to this case sufficient to state a claim for first amendment retaliation.mcbride village of michiana,cir qualified immunity appeal in which journalist claimed retaliation based on her reporting of public meetings when village officials called her employer to urge the newspaper to remove plaintiff from political beat mcbride is instructive in showing that this circuit has previously held that the very kinds of actions alleged by plaintiff can amount of first amendment retaliation,even if there have been few cases since to address the particular context of public official retaliating against a private individual 
plaintiff alleges essentially two forms of adverse action in her complaint the three conversations between defendant hudson and her employer and the denial of her zoning and signage variances.
defendant hudson conversations with farm bureau 
the primary allegation in plaintiff complaint is that defendant hudson conversations with plaintiff employer amounted to threats to her economic livelihood,an injury that she alleges to be an adverse action that would deter a person of ordinary firmness from exercising his or her first amendment rights.plaintiff complaint alleges that defendant hudson statements were designed to both pressure fritz to discontinue attending comstock meetings and express opinions on comstock issues publicly and privately and discontinue petitioning comstock for a redress of grievances,as well as pressure farm bureau to move out of comstock or terminate its relationship with fritz or both,compl.this factual allegation may be better understood as an inference from what defendant hudson is alleged to have communicated to plaintiff employer rather than a fact that must be accepted as true for purposes of evaluating the motion to dismiss.still,plaintiff factual allegations,construed in the most favorable light for her position,show that defendant hudson communicated his dislike and opposition to her speech and commented on his opinion of its effect on her reputation and on the reputation of farm bureau in comstock.
while plaintiff may not have pled specific facts to support her claim that defendant hud
