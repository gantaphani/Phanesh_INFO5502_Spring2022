background 
arthur and rita clark acquired several parcels of land in westfield,massachusetts,which they sought to develop as a residential subdivision.in furtherance of this plan,they transferred portions of their real estate holdings to various family trusts collectively,the clarks and hired an engineering firm to prepare the necessary subdivision plans.
the clarks first subdivision plan was submitted to the city of westfield planning board in.following a hearing,the planning board rejected the plan because it included a strip of land surrounding chapin pond that was allegedly owned by the city.the clarks unsuccessfully revised and resubmitted the plan four times between and in the clarks also filed a petition in the massachusetts land court to compel the city to try title to chapin pond.nine years later on march,the land court found the city of westfield to be the record title holder of chapin pond 
in,the clarks entered into an agreement with their neighbor and theodore pérez to combine their contiguous lands and develop them into residential subdivisions.together they created the golden acres development corporation and in december submitted plans for two proposed subdivisions to the westfield planning board the planning board summarily rejected both these proposals in february.
these same two plans were revised and resubmitted one month later.concurrently,the clarks attorney sent a letter to the westfield city council requesting that the city master plan take into account the increased water and sewage capacity required by the clarks proposed subdivisions.the request was unanimously rejected by the city council and in april,the planning board also rejected at least one of appellants revised subdivision plans because it included property over which the city claimed ownership.
in june,the clarks engineer met with the westfield water commission to connect the proposed subdivisions to the municipal water supply.at that meeting the engineer was advised that the commissioners did not intend to grant appellants municipal water service because the city did not want the project there.despite the finding by a water department contractor that the loop created by the proposed subdivisions would benefit the entire city with increased water pressure and flow,the water commission voted to formally deny the clarks request on july.on september,appellants filed suit against the water commission in massachusetts superior court.the suit was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
appellants assert that they were denied municipal water service because they failed to first secure a connection to the municipal sewer line.while the request before the water commission was pending,however,the clarks engineer also petitioned the westfield sewer commission for service,and was turned down because appellants had not yet been connected to the municipal water line.the sewer commission was also concerned about the sewer system capacity and the appellants proposed number of lots,and it indicated that any excess capacity that existed in the sewer system would be allocated to other developers who had previously requested service.
in october,appellants submitted their final subdivision plan to the westfield planning board.due to the denial of municipal water and sewage service,this plan proposed fewer lots and relied on the use of water and waste disposal systems.this time the planning board solicited comments from all interested municipal boards and commissions,and the water commission responded by expressing its concern that the proposed subdivision would threaten the municipal water supply and that its primary access route crossed over a dam.the city health director also worried about the impact that the onsite septic systems would have on the underlying aquifer,and recommended that the city consider granting access to the municipal sewer and water lines.after a public hearing,the planning board voted to deny the modified plan on january.
on january,appellants responded by filing a complaint against the planning board and the water commission in massachusetts land court.the land court eventually dismissed all claims against the water commission for lack of jurisdiction in april,appellants also filed a new request with the westfield sewer commission to gain access to the municipal sewer line 
on october,the city of westfield exercised its eminent domain power to occupy acres of pérez property for the purpose of water supply protection.appellants allege that such taking rendered their development plans unfeasible,as the proposed subdivision access to the municipal roadway was planned through the pérez land.
appellants filed the instant suit in district court on july,asserting violations of the due process and equal protection guarantees of the fourteenth amendment,and requesting damages under they alleged that westfield conspired to interfere with the residential development of their lands.westfield moved to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b and the district court referred the matter to a magistrate judge.
on august,the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation that appellants claims be dismissed because land usage controversies between a plaintiff and state or local administrative and political entities do not rise to the level of due process violations,absent evidence of fundamental procedural irregularity,racial animus,or the like,which appellants did not allege or produce.report and recommendation with regard to defendants motion to dismiss at,clark boscher.august,quoting matney city of adams,d,internal quotations omitted.the magistrate judge also recommended dismissal for the equal protection claim.having failed to raise a colorable constitutional or federal statutory cause of action,appellants were not entitled to recovery under.the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation in its entirety and dismissed appellants claims.

recovery under 
does not endow plaintiffs with any substantive rights independent of those already granted under federal law,cir.to recover under,a plaintiff must prove that a deprivation of rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws of the united states was carried out by persons acting under color of state law.garcía,cir.our first line of inquiry then is to determine whether appellants facts demonstrate violations of their constitutional due process and equal protection rights under the fourteenth amendment.
substantive due process 
appellants contend that their averred facts state a valid substantive due process claim entitling them to relief under because the actions of all city officials amount to an sic pattern of arbitrary,unreasonable and capricious acts which deprive the plaintiffs of their right to reasonably and legally use their property.we disagree.
