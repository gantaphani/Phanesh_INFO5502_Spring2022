petitioner ppl montana,llc ppl,owns and operates hydroelectric facilities in montana.ten of its facilities are located on riverbeds underlying segments of the missouri,madison,and clark fork rivers.five hydroelectric dams on the upper missouri river are along the great falls reach,including on the three tallest waterfalls and ppl two other dams on that river are in canyons on the stubbs ferry stretch.these,together with two dams located in steep canyons on the madison river,are called the project.the thompson falls project is a facility on the clark fork river.both projects are licensed by the federal energy regulatory commission.ppl facilities have existed for many decades,some for over a century.until recently,montana,though aware of the projects existence,sought no rent for use of the riverbeds.instead,the understanding of ppl and the united states is that ppl has paid rents to the united states.in,parents of montana schoolchildren filed a federal suit,claiming that ppl facilities were on riverbeds that were state owned and part of montana school trust lands.the state joined the suit and,for the first time,sought rents from ppl for its use of the riverbeds.that case was dismissed,and ppl and other power companies filed a suit,claiming that montana was barred from seeking compensation for ppl riverbed use.montana counterclaimed,contending that under the doctrine it owns the riverbeds and can charge rent for their use.the trial court granted montana summary judgment as to navigability for purposes of determining riverbed title and ordered ppl to pay montana million in rent for riverbed use between and.the montana supreme court affirmed.adopting a liberal construction of the navigability test,it discounted this court approach of considering the navigability of particular river segments for purposes of determining whether a state acquired title to the riverbeds underlying those segments at the time of statehood.instead,the montana court declared the river stretches in question to be short interruptions of navigability that were insufficient as a matter of law to find nonnavigability,since traffic had circumvented those stretches by portage.based on evidence of,recreational use of the madison river,the court found that river navigable as a matter of law at the time of statehood.
held the montana supreme court ruling that montana owns and may charge for use of the riverbeds at issue was based on an infirm legal understanding of this court rules of navigability for title under the doctrine.
a the rule that the states,in their capacity as sovereigns,hold title in the soil of rivers really navigable,shively bowlby,has federal constitutional significance under the doctrine.pursuant to that doctrine,upon its date of statehood,a state gains title within its borders to the beds of waters then navigable.it may allocate and govern those lands according to state law subject only to the united states power to control such waters for purposes of navigation in interstate and foreign commerce.united states oregon.the united states retains title vested in it before statehood to land beneath waters not then navigable.to be navigable for purposes of title under the doctrine,rivers must be navigable in fact,meaning they are used,or are susceptible of being used,as highways for commerce,over which trade and travel are or may be conducted in the customary modes of trade and travel on water.the daniel ball,wall.this formulation has been used to determine questions of waterbed title under the doctrine.see united states utah.
b the montana supreme court erred in its treatment of the question of river segments and portage.to determine riverbed title under the doctrine,this court considers the river on a basis to assess whether the segment of the river,under which the riverbed in dispute lies,is navigable or not.see,utah,supra,at.the state supreme court erred in discounting this approach.a key justification for sovereign ownership of navigable riverbeds is that a contrary rule would allow private riverbed owners to erect improvements on the riverbeds that could interfere with the public right to use the waters as a highway for commerce.because commerce could not have occurred on segments nonnavigable at the time of statehood,there is no reason to deem those segments owned by the state under the doctrine.practical considerations also support segmentation.physical conditions affecting navigability vary over the length of a river and provide a means to determine appropriate start points and end points for disputed segments.a segment approach is also consistent with the manner in which private parties seek to establish riverbed title.montana can not suggest that segmentation is inadministrable when the state courts managed to apportion the underlying riverbeds for purposes of determining their value and ppl corresponding rents.the state supreme court view that the approach does not apply to short interruptions of navigability is not supported by this court utah decision.even if the law might find some nonnavigable segments so minimal that they merit treatment as part of a longer,navigable reach,it is doubtful that the segments in this case would meet that standard.applying its short interruptions approach,the state supreme court found the great falls reach navigable because it could be managed by way of land route portage,as done by lewis and clark.but a portage of even one day would demonstrate the need to bypass a nonnavigable river segment.thus,the state supreme court was wrong to conclude,with respect to the great falls reach and other disputed stretches,that portages were insufficient to defeat a navigability finding.in most cases,they are,because they require transportation over land rather than over the water.this is the case at least as to the great falls reach.in reaching a contrary conclusion,the state supreme court misapplied the montello,wall.there,portage was considered in determining whether a river was part of a channel of interstate commerce for federal regulatory purposes.the montello does not control the outcome where the quite different concerns of the riverbed title context apply.portages may defeat navigability for title purposes,and do so with respect to the great falls reach.montana does not dispute that overland portage was necessary to traverse that reach,and the trial court noted the waterfalls had never been navigated.the great falls reach,at least from the head of the first waterfall to the foot of the last,is not navigable for purposes of riverbed title under the doctrine.there is also a significant likelihood that some of the other river stretches in dispute fail this federal navigability test.the ultimate decision as to these other disputed river stretches is to be determined,in the first instance,by the montana courts on remand,which should assess the relevant evidence in light of the principles discussed here.
c the montana supreme court further erred as a matter of law in relying on evidence of,primarily recreational use of the madison river.navigability must be assessed as of the time of statehood,and it concerns a river usefulness for trade and travel.utah,at.river segments are navigable if they were used and if they were susceptible of being used as highways of commerce at the time of statehood,at.evidence of recreational use and poststatehood evidence may bear on susceptibility of commercial use at the time of statehood.see,at.in order for use to have a bearing on navigability at statehood,the watercraft must be meaningfully similar to those in customary use for trade and travel at the time of statehood,and the river poststatehood condition may not be materially different from its physical condition at statehood.the state supreme court offered no indication that it made these necessary findings.
d because this analysis is sufficient to require reversal here,the court declines to decide whether the state supreme court also erred as to the burden of proof regarding navigability.
e montana suggestion that denying the state title to the disputed riverbeds will undermine the public trust doctrine which concerns public access to the waters above those beds for navigation,fishing,and other recreational uses underscores its misapprehension of the and public trust doctrines.unlike the doctrine,which is the constitutional foundation for the navigability rule of riverbed title,the scope of the public trust over waters within the state borders is a matter of state law,subject to federal regulatory power.
f this court does not reach the question whether,by virtue of montana sovereignty,neither laches nor estoppel could apply to bar the state claim.still,the reliance by ppl and its predecessors in title on the state long failure to assert title to the riverbeds is some evidence supporting the conclusion that the river segments over those beds were nonnavigable for purposes of the doctrine.

on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of montana 
justice kennedy delivered the opinion of the court.
this case concerns three rivers which flow through montana and then beyond its borders.the question is whether discrete,identifiable segments of these rivers in montana were nonnavigable,as federal law defines that concept for purposes of determining whether the state acquired title to the riverbeds underlying those segments,when the state entered the union in.montana contends that the rivers must be found navigable at the disputed locations.from this premise,the state asserts that in it gained title to the disputed riverbeds under the constitutional doctrine.based on its title claims,montana sought compensation from ppl montana,llc,a power company,for its use of the riverbeds for hydroelectric projects.the montana courts granted summary judgment on title to montana,awarding it million in rent for the riverbeds for the period from to alone.that judgment must be reversed.
the three rivers in question are the missouri river,the madison river,and the clark fork river.the missouri and the madison are on the eastern side of the continental divide.the madison flows into the missouri,which then continues at length to its junction with the mississippi river.the clark fork river is on the western side of the continental divide.its waters join the columbia river system that flows into the pacific ocean.each river shall be described in somewhat more detail.
the missouri river originates in montana and traverses seven states before a point just north of louis where it joins the mississippi.encyclopedia americana int l ed.if considered with the continuous path formed by certain streams that provide the missouri river headwaters,the missouri is over miles long,the longest river in the united states.ibid.the missouri river basin the land area drained by the river is the second largest in the nation,surpassed only by the mississippi river basin of which it is a part.rivers of north america benke cushing eds.hereinafter rivers of north america.as a historical matter,the river shifted and flooded often,and contained many sandbars,islands,and unstable banks,at.the river was once described as one of the most variable beings in creation,as inconstant as the action of the jury,sioux city register,and its high quantity of downstream sediment flow spawned its nickname,the big muddy,rivers of north america.
the upstream part of the missouri river in montana,known as the upper missouri river,is better characterized as rocky rather than muddy.while one usually thinks of the missouri river as flowing generally south,as indeed it does beginning in north dakota,the upper missouri in montana flows north from its principal headwaters at three forks,which is located about feet above sea level in the rocky mountain area of southwestern montana.it descends through scenic mountain terrain including the deep gorge at the gates of the mountains turns eastward through the great falls reach,cascading over a roughly stretch of cataracts and rapids over which the river drops more than feet and courses swiftly to fort benton,a fur trading post,before progressing farther east into north dakota and on to the great plains.encyclopedia americana,supra,at new encyclopaedia britannica ed.hereinafter encyclopaedia britannica columbia gazetteer of the world ed.hereinafter columbia gazetteer warner,montana and the northwest territory.in,just after montana became a state,the upper missouri river above fort benton was seriously obstructed by numerous rapids and rocks,and the portion flowing eastward f rom fort benton to carroll,was called the rocky river.annual report of the chief of engineers,army,in exec.doc,pt,hereinafter exec.doc.
the great falls exemplify the rocky,rapid character of the upper missouri.they consist of five waterfalls located over a stretch of the upper missouri leading downstream from the city of great falls in midwestern montana.the waterfall farthest downstream,and the one first encountered by meriwether lewis and william clark when they led their remarkable expedition through the american west in,is the eponymous great falls,the tallest of the five falls at feet.clark,dear brother letters of william clark to jonathan clark,holmberg ed.hereinafter dear brother.lewis recorded observations of this sublimely grand specticle

the upper missouri river,both around and further upstream of the great falls,shares the precipitous and character of the falls themselves.as it moves downstream over the great falls reach,a stretch that begins somewhat above the head of black eagle falls,the river quickly descends about feet in elevation,see montana power federal power comm n,cadc mt,dropping over feet within miles from the first rapid to the foot of great falls,parker,black eagle falls dam,transactions of the am.soc.of civil engineers.in,that stretch was a constant succession of rapids and falls.warner,supra,at see also the journals of the lewis clark expedition moulton ed.hereinafter journals of the lewis clark expedition a continued rapid the whole way for miles lewis noted the water was so swift over the area that buffalo were swept over the cataracts in considerable quantities and were instantly crushed.lewis and clark journals.well above the great falls reach,the stubbs ferry stretch of the river from helena to cascade also had steep gradient and was much obstructed by rocks and dangerous rapids.report of the secretary of war,doc,pt.

it is appropriate to begin the analysis by discussing the legal principles that control the case.
the rule that the states,in their capacity as sovereigns,hold title to the beds under navigable waters has origins in english common law.see shively bowlby.a distinction was made in england between waters subject to the ebb and flow of the tide royal rivers and nontidal waters public highways.with respect to royal rivers,the crown was presumed to hold title to the riverbed and soil,but the public retained the right of passage and the right to fish in the stream.with respect to public highways,as the name suggests,the public also retained the right of water passage but title to the riverbed and soil,as a general matter,was held in private ownership.riparian landowners shared title,with each owning from his side to the center thread of the stream,as well as the exclusive right to fish there.see idaho coeur tribe of idaho,summarizing angell,a treatise on the common law in relation to kent,commentaries on american law ed.
while the distinction for bed title was the initial rule in the colonies,after the revolution american law moved to a different standard.some state courts came early to the conclusion that a state holds presumptive title to navigable waters whether or not the waters are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide.see,carson blazer,binn.executors of cates wadlington,wilson forbes,bullock wilson,port.elder burrus.the tidal rule of navigability for sovereign ownership of riverbeds,while perhaps appropriate for england dominant coastal geography,was ill suited to the united states with its vast number of major inland rivers upon which navigation could be sustained.see houck,law of navigable rivers,packer bird.by the late century,the court had recognized the now prevailing doctrine of state sovereign title in the soil of rivers really navigable.shively,supra,at see barney keokuk,in this country,as a general thing,all waters are deemed navigable which are really so this title rule became known as navigability in fact.
the rule for state riverbed title assumed federal constitutional significance under the doctrine.in,the court declared that for the original states,the people of each state,based on principles of sovereignty,hold the absolute right to all their navigable waters and the soils under them,subject only to rights surrendered and powers granted by the constitution to the federal government.martin lessee of waddell,pet.in a series of cases,the court determined that the same principle applied to states later admitted to the union,because the states in the union are coequal sovereigns under the constitution.see,lessee of pollard hagan,how,knight united states land,shively,supra,at see united states texas.these precedents are the basis for the doctrine,under which a state title to these lands was conferred not by congress but by the constitution itself.oregon ex rel.state land bd.corvallis sand gravel.it follows that any ensuing questions of navigability for determining state riverbed title are governed by federal law.see,united states utah,united states oregon.
the title consequences of the doctrine can be stated in summary form upon statehood,the state gains title within its borders to the beds of waters then navigable or tidally influenced,see phillips petroleum mississippi,although that is not relevant in this case.it may allocate and govern those lands according to state law subject only to the paramount power of the united states to control such waters for purposes of navigation in interstate and foreign commerce.oregon,supra,at see montana united states,united states holt state bank.the united states retains any title vested in it before statehood to any land beneath waters not then navigable and not tidally influenced,to be transferred or licensed if and as it chooses.see utah,supra,at oregon,supra,at.
returning to the navigability in fact rule,the court has explained the elements of this test.a basic formulation of the rule was set forth in the daniel ball,wall,a case concerning federal power to regulate navigation 
those rivers must be regarded as public navigable rivers in law which are navigable in fact.and they are navigable in fact when they are used,or are susceptible of being used,in their ordinary condition,as highways for commerce,over which trade and travel are or may be conducted in the customary modes of trade and travel on water.at.
the daniel ball formulation has been invoked in considering the navigability of waters for purposes of assessing federal regulatory authority under the constitution,and the application of specific federal statutes,as to the waters and their beds.see,the montello,wall,united states appalachian power,and federal power act rapanos united states,plurality opinion clean water act,at kennedy,concurring in judgment same.it has been used as well to determine questions of title to water beds under the doctrine.see utah,supra,at oklahoma texas,holt state bank,supra,at.it should be noted,however,that the test for navigability is not applied in the same way in these distinct types of cases.
among the differences in application are the following.for state title under the doctrine,navigability is determined at the time of statehood,see utah,supra,at,and based on the natural and ordinary condition of the water,see oklahoma,supra,at.in contrast,admiralty jurisdiction extends to water routes made navigable even if not formerly so,see,ex parte boyer,artificial canal and federal regulatory authority encompasses waters that only recently have become navigable,see,philadelphia stimson,were once navigable but are no longer,see economy light power united states,or are not navigable and never have been but may become so by reasonable improvements,see appalachian power,supra,at.with respect to the federal commerce power,the inquiry regarding navigation historically focused on interstate commerce.see the daniel ball,supra,at.and,of course,the commerce power extends beyond navigation.see kaiser aetna united states.in contrast,for title purposes,the inquiry depends only on navigation and not on interstate travel.see utah,supra,at.this list of differences is not exhaustive.indeed,e ach application of the daniel ball test is apt to uncover variations and refinements which require further elaboration.ap palachian power,supra,at.
the primary flaw in the reasoning of the montana supreme court lies in its treatment of the question of river segments and overland portage.
to determine title to a riverbed under the doctrine,this court considers the river on a basis to assess whether the segment of the river,under which the riverbed in dispute lies,is navigable or not.in united states utah,for example,the court noted,
the controversy relates only to the sections of the rivers which are described in the complaint,and the master has limited his findings and conclusions as to navigability accordingly.the propriety of this course,in view of the physical characteristics of the streams,is apparent.even where the navigability of a river,speaking generally,is a matter of common knowledge,and hence one of which judicial notice may be taken,it may yet be a question,to be determined upon evidence,how far navigability extends.at.
the court went on to conclude,after reciting and assessing the evidence,that the colorado river was navigable for its first roughly stretch,nonnavigable for the next roughly stretch,and navigable for its remaining miles,at.the court noted the importance of determining the exact point at which navigability may be deemed to end.at.
similarly,in oil gas united states,the court examined the segment of the arkansas river that ran along the osage indian reservation,assessing whether the arkansas river was navigable in fact at the locus in quo.the court concluded that the united states originally,and the osages as its grantees,unequivocally held title to the riverbeds because the arkansas river is and was not navigable at the place where the river bed lots,here in controversy,are.at.the court found the segment of river along the reservation to be nonnavigable even though a segment of the river that began further downstream was navigable.ibid.see also oklahoma,supra,at,noting that how far up the streams navigability extended was not known assessing separately the segments of the red river above and below its confluence with the washita river within oklahoma borders and concluding that neither segment,and hence no part of the river within oklahoma,was navigable.
the montana supreme court discounted the approach of this court cases,calling it a piecemeal classification of navigability with some stretches declared navigable,and others declared.at,at.this was error.the approach to navigability for title is well settled,and it should not be disregarded.a key justification for sovereign ownership of navigable riverbeds is that a contrary rule would allow private riverbed owners to erect improvements on the riverbeds that could interfere with the public right to use the waters as a highway for commerce.while the federal government and states retain regulatory power to protect public navigation,allocation to the state of the beds underlying navigable rivers reduces the possibility of conflict between private and public interests.see utah,supra,at packer,at.by contrast,segments that are nonnavigable at the time of statehood are those over which commerce could not then occur.thus,there is no reason that these segments also should be deemed owned by the state under the doctrine.
practical considerations also support segmentation.physical conditions that affect navigability often vary significantly over the length of a river.this is particularly true with longer rivers,which can traverse vastly different terrain and the flow of which can be affected by varying local climates.the missouri river provides an excellent example between its headwaters and mouth,it runs for over miles out of steep mountains,through canyons and upon rocky beds,over waterfalls and rapids,and across sandy plains,capturing runoff from snow melt and farmland rains alike.these shifts in physical conditions provide a means to determine appropriate start points and end points for the segment in question.topographical and geographical indicators may assist.see,utah,supra,at gradient changes oklahoma,at location of tributary providing additional flow.
a segment approach to riverbed title allocation under the doctrine is consistent with the manner in which private parties seek to establish riverbed title.for centuries,where title to the riverbed was not in the sovereign,the rule for allocating riverbed title among riparian landowners involved apportionment defined both by segment each landowner owns bed and soil along the length of his land adjacent and thread each landowner owns bed and soil to the center of the stream.see angell,a treatise on the law of watercourses ed.tyler wilkinson,cas,cc ri story.montana,moreover,can not suggest that segmentation is inadministrable when the state courts managed to divide up and apportion the underlying riverbeds for purposes of determining their value and the corresponding rents owed by ppl.
the montana supreme court,relying upon utah,decided that the approach is inapplicable here because it does not apply to short interruption s of navigability in a stream otherwise navigable.at,at quoting utah,at.this was mistaken.in utah,this court noted in passing that the facts of the case concerned long reaches with particular characteristics of navigability or rather than short interruption s.at.the court in utah did not say the case would have a different outcome if a short interruption were concerned.ibid.
even if the law might find some nonnavigable segments so minimal that they merit treatment as part of a longer,navigable reach for purposes of title under the doctrine,it is doubtful that any of the segments in this case would meet that standard,and one the great falls reach certainly would not.as an initial matter,the kinds of considerations that would define a de minimis exception to the approach would be those related to principles of ownership and title,such as inadministrability of parcels of exceedingly small size,or worthlessness of the parcels due to overdivision.see heller,the tragedy of the anticommons,harv,explaining that dividing property into parcels,could,absent countervailing legal mechanisms,paralyze the alienability of scarce resources or diminish their value too drastically an analysis of segmentation must be sensibly applied.a comparison of the nonnavigable segment length to the overall length of the stream,for instance,would be simply irrelevant to the issue at hand.
a number of the segments at issue here are both discrete,as defined by physical features characteristic of navigability or nonnavigability,and substantial,as a matter of administrability for title purposes.this is best illustrated by the great falls reach,which is miles long and has distinct drops including five waterfalls and continuous rapids in between.there is plenty of reason to doubt that reach navigability based on the presence of the series of falls.there is also reason to think that title to that segment of bed would not be worthless or inadministrable.indeed,the state sought and was awarded rent in the amount of million for ppl various hydroelectric facilities attached to the riverbeds,half of which are along the great falls reach.
applying its short interruptions approach,the montana supreme court decided that the great falls reach was navigable because it could be managed by way of land route portage,at,at.the court noted in particular the portage of lewis and clark expedition.ibid.yet that very portage reveals the problem with the montana supreme court analysis.leaving behind their larger boats,lewis and clark transported their supplies and some small canoes about miles over land,which took at least days and probably more.see lewis and clark journals journals of the lewis clark expedition dear brother.even if portage were to take travelers only one day,its significance is the same it demonstrates the need to bypass the river segment,all because that part of the river is nonnavigable.thus,the montana supreme court was wrong to state,with respect to the great falls reach and other stretches of the rivers in question,that portages are not sufficient to defeat a finding of navigability.at,at.in most cases,they are,because they require transportation over land rather than over the water.this is such a case,at least as to the great falls reach.
in reaching its conclusion that the necessity of portage does not undermine navigability,the montana supreme court misapplied this court decision in the montello,wall.see,at,at.the consideration of portage in the montello was for a different purpose.the court did not seek to determine whether the river in question was navigable for title purposes but instead whether it was navigable for purposes of determining whether boats upon it could be regulated by the federal government,at.the primary focus in the montello was not upon navigability in fact but upon whether the river was a navigable water of the united states.at.the latter inquiry is doctrinally distinct.it turns upon whether the river forms by itself,or by its connection with other waters,a continued highway over which commerce is,or may be,carried with other states or foreign countries in the customary modes in which such commerce is conducted by water.at citing the daniel ball,wall.it is language similar to continued highway that montana urges the court to import into the title context in lieu of the court established segmentation approach.brief for respondent.
the montello reasonably concluded that the portages required in that case did not prevent the river from being part of a channel of interstate commerce.portages continued that channel because goods could be successfully transported interstate,in part upon the waters in question.this provided sufficient basis to regulate steamboats at places where those boats could and did,in fact,navigate portions of the river,at.here,by contrast,the question regards ownership of the bed under river segments that the montana supreme court,by calling them interruptions in the navigation,at,at,acknowledges were nonnavigable.the reasoning and the inquiry of the montello does not control the outcome where the quite different concerns of the riverbed title context apply.
having clarified that portages may defeat navigability for title purposes,and do so with respect to the great falls reach,the court sees no evidence in the record that could demonstrate that the great falls reach was navigable.montana does not dispute that overland portage was necessary to traverse that reach.indeed,the state admits the falls themselves were not passable b
