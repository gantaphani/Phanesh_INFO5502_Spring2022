on april,a fire ravaged the open flame restaurant open flame,a valparaiso,indiana establishment owned and operated by john skoutaris.hamilton mutual insurance company hamilton mutual,a subsidiary of employers mutual casualty company,insured the building,business personal property,and business lost income.hamilton mutual,an ohio corporation with its principal place of business in ohio,filed a declaratory judgment action in in the northern district of indiana,claiming that skoutaris failed to abide by the insurance policy provisions governing skoutaris duty to cooperate and duty to submit to an examination under oath.skoutaris,in turn,brought claims of breach of contract and bad faith against hamilton mutual.the district court eventually granted hamilton mutual motion for summary judgment and denied skoutaris motion for partial summary judgment.skoutaris appeals.we affirm.
john skoutaris opened the open flame on february.he had purchased the valparaiso building from porter national bank for and had personally made a variety of improvements before opening for business.skoutaris held insurance policies from both hamilton mutual and ohio casualty group covering damage to the open flame,and the policies contemplated dividing any loss between the two insurance companies.
as this case involves the duties and procedures under the hamilton mutual policy once a claim is filed,we examine the relevant policy provisions in detail.the hamilton mutual policy covered three distinct areas of loss building business personal property and business income when making a claim under the hamilton mutual policy,skoutaris had certain obligations 
a.you must see that the following are done in the event of loss or damage to covered property 
give us prompt notice of the loss or damage.include a description of the property involved.
at our request,give us complete inventories of the damaged and undamaged property.include quantities,costs,values,and amount of loss claimed.
as often as may be reasonably required,permit us to inspect the property proving the loss or damage and examine your books and records.
also permit us to take samples of damaged and undamaged property for inspection,testing and analysis,and permit us to make copies from your books and records.
cooperate with us in the investigation or settlement of the claim.
b.we may examine any insured under oath,while not in the presence of any other insured and at such times as may be reasonably required,about any matter relating to this insurance or the claim,including an insured books and records.in the event of an examination,an insured answers must be signed.
in addition to these provisions relating to the insured duties,the hamilton mutual policy also provided an appraisal process to determine the value of a particular loss.the policy did not call for the parties to automatically undergo the formal appraisal process upon the filing of a claim.rather,the parties had the opportunity to conduct some preliminary investigation and attempt to resolve the claim in a mutually agreeable fashion.however,the policy stated 
if we and you disagree on the value of the property or the amount of loss,either may make written demand for an appraisal of the loss.in this event,each party will select a competent and impartial appraiser.the two appraisers will select an umpire.if they can not agree,either may request that selection be made by a judge of a court having jurisdiction.the appraisers will state separately the value of the property and amount of loss.if they fail to agree,they will submit their differences to the umpire.a decision agreed to by any two will be binding.each party will 
pay its chosen appraiser and 
bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.
if there is an appraisal,we will still retain our right to deny the claim.
in addition,skoutaris elected for replacement cost coverage,which entitled him to receive the full replacement cost of the destroyed property,but only after the property was repaired or replaced.to allow an insured to begin reconstruction after a loss,one aspect of this coverage was that an insured could elect to receive a payment of the actual cash value,a depreciated portion of the full replacement cost,in advance of the full replacement cost payment.having received such an actual cash value payment,an insured could only recover the remainder of the replacement costs after all repairs or replacements were made.
open flame turned out to be an unfortunately apt name,as the restaurant suffered a massive fire on april.hamilton mutual and skoutaris both retained the services of adjusters to investigate the fire and determine the loss.there was no suggestion of arson.
the two adjusters produced radically different damage assessments.skoutaris adjuster found that the building,including the basement,was a complete loss,with a replacement cost value of,and concluded that the business personal property loss was.hamilton mutual through its own adjuster responded with a substantially lower assessment and claimed that skoutaris submission lacked the necessary detail or documentation to support the figures.hamilton mutual also concluded that the basement was not a total loss.it found that the replacement value of the building was,while pegging the replacement cost value of the business personal property at.hamilton mutual adjuster explained that he assigned values to the business personal property items claimed by attempting to match the item to an invoice,or,if an invoice could not be found,looking up the replacement cost in restaurant catalogs.hamilton mutual offered an actual cash value payment of approximately on its portion of the claim eventually skoutaris accepted the as the actual cash value payment under the hamilton mutual policy.
although skoutaris accepted hamilton mutual payment,the parties continued to disagree about the replacement value of the building and business personal property destroyed in the fire.for several months,the parties exchanged correspondence on this subject,culminating in a november,meeting.at the meeting,the parties made some progress towards a resolution hamilton mutual agreed to consider the basement a complete loss and raise its valuation of the building loss commensurately,but ultimately the parties continued to have serious disagreements about the value of the business personal property.specifically,hamilton mutual took issue with skoutaris valuations of the business personal property because of the little supporting documentation and the fact that skoutaris results conflicted with the values determined by hamilton mutual adjuster using catalogs and industry standards.hamilton mutual repeatedly asked for more documentation,as well as any response by skoutaris or his adjuster explaining how they determined value.
thereafter,hamilton mutual received some additional documentation and raised the replacement cost value of the business personal property to approximately,based on the inclusion of certain items previously thought to be leased.meanwhile,skoutaris also submitted a revised business personal property replacement cost valuation of approximately.although skoutaris turned over further documents to hamilton mutual in january,hamilton mutual believed most of these were bills for purchases of food rather than confirmation of prices for improvements made to the building or business personal property.
given the lengthy period of investigation and the persistent gap between the parties estimates of the replacement cost value,hamilton mutual decided to proceed with appraisal,formally initiating the process in a january,letter.hamilton mutual indicated in that letter that it would be represented by an attorney and that it needed skoutaris examination under oath an euo.hamilton mutual appointed james stivers as its appraiser,while skoutaris retained the services of tim zeak.stivers received from hamilton mutual its full file of materials,which he believed were the same materials given to the initial appraiser.according to stivers,any additional materials should have come from zeak,though stivers received little information from him.
while the appraisal process started out cordially,relations between the parties deteriorated.hamilton mutual,through its attorney,wrote skoutaris attorney in february,requesting a date for the euo,as well as a litany of documents,including any appraisals of the property by porter national bank the previous owner and the specific figures relied upon during the valuation process.over the next three months,hamilton mutual attorney sent three additional letters asking for the responsive documents so that he could take skoutaris euo.
beginning in may,the correspondence exchanged between the representatives of the parties began to crystallize certain positions regarding the euo and further production of documents.over the next five months,hamilton mutual consistently and repeatedly asserted that hamilton mutual had a right to take the euo of skoutaris on any and all matters and sought the documents requested in the february letter,including a detailed list of what was destroyed in the fire.hamilton mutual felt that the initiation of the appraisal process had no effect on its right to receive documents or take the euo.hamilton mutual also reminded skoutaris representatives several times that failure to comply would result in the denial of his claim.between may and october,hamilton mutual attorney sent seven letters asking for documents and attempting to set skoutaris euo.in response,skoutaris indicated that he had previously produced all documents in his possession to hamilton mutual initial adjuster and that the documents hamilton mutual sought were either duplicative or had been destroyed.skoutaris representatives also suggested that hamilton mutual was only entitled to documents or an euo relating to the business interruption claim,and not the building or business personal property claims,since the parties were in the appraisal process.
even while the exchanges between the parties were growing testier,the appraisal process continued.as the parties were not able to agree upon an umpire,hamilton mutual proceeded under the appraisal clause in the policy,which provided that the parties could request a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an umpire.hamilton mutual filed such a petition in the porter county superior court,the indiana state court with jurisdiction over valparaiso,and that court appointed attorney russell millbranth as umpire in august.stivers felt that he stivers did not have enough documentation for a meaningful appraisal process,but millbranth continued nonetheless.
by late september and early october,the tension between the parties over skoutaris cooperation boiled over.after several aborted attempts to set the euo,hamilton mutual resolved to examine skoutaris on october.however,in a letter on september,skoutaris attorney stated that hamilton mutual had received all documentation by november or december,and contested whether hamilton mutual had a right to an euo.
i am completely bewildered as to your continuing demand to take my client statement when the matter is,at your option and election,now pending before an umpire.please provide me with the authority which supports your legal conclusion that your client continues to have right to take the statement when your client elected to place the matter before an umpire for a decision.
hamilton mutual attorney responded on october,that hamilton mutual had never received a complete list of all improvements to the property,the specific figures utilized by skoutaris appraiser that produced the replacement value,a list of all items of personal property that were included in the purchase price of the building from porter national bank,and a list of expenses from the date of purchase to the date of loss.regarding skoutaris claim that the request for euo was improper,hamilton mutual attorney stated that the policy clearly provided a right to take an euo.finally,hamilton mutual attorney suggested that hamilton mutual would be unable to make an appraisal submission with regard to the damage evaluation without the documents requested and your client statement under oath.no euo occurred on october.
in an october letter,skoutaris attorney replied that hamilton mutual letter was the first time that hamilton mutual had specifically stated that it was missing a complete list of improvements.skoutaris attorney noted that the list of business personal property submitted by skoutaris adjuster,as well as the various building evaluations,should have been sufficient.it is beyond me how your client can now say that they do not have a list of all improvements made when they based their appraisal and made partial payment a year ago i have to consider your request as again being evidence of your client bad faith skoutaris attorney further suggested that hamilton mutual initial adjuster had received all documentation in november or december,and had,in fact,removed certain documents without authorization,which had never been returned.turning to the euo,skoutaris attorney stated that hamilton mutual had met with skoutaris about the building and business personal property claims in november,and that hamilton mutual should have asked any questions at that time.finally,skoutaris attorney suggested that hamilton mutual alone was to blame if it did not have sufficient information to proceed with the appraisal.
at a later deposition,skoutaris admitted that he was aware that hamilton mutual wished to take his euo for several months but decided not to submit based on advice of counsel.moreover,skoutaris also knew that hamilton mutual wanted further documentation,though he was unaware whether any further documents were produced by either his initial appraiser or lawyer.
on november,hamilton mutual rejected skoutaris claim based on his failure to appear for an euo and his refusal to produce either copies of requested records or a statement advising which documents were destroyed.according to hamilton mutual,these actions constituted a material breach of the insurance policy,and the company refused to pay any additional benefits.three days later,hamilton mutual filed a declaratory judgment action in the northern district of indiana,seeking a judgment that skoutaris had breached the contract and hamilton mutual was not required to pay any additional sums under the policy.
hamilton mutual also withdrew from the appraisal process.despite hamilton mutual absence,millbranth proceeded with the appraisal process,which he conducted in stages.on november,millbranth decided that the replacement cost of the building was,a decision which was filed in porter county superior court on december.at that point,ohio casualty group was still an active participant in the appraisal and was being represented by stivers,who had earlier been retained by hamilton mutual.on february,skoutaris attorney offered hamilton mutual a chance to rejoin the appraisal process regarding the business personal property and business interruption claims and offered skoutaris for an euo.before the final stage of the appraisal concluded,ohio casualty group settled its liability on the remaining issues,leaving only the portion attributable to hamilton mutual.on march,millbranth determined that hamilton mutual was responsible for in business personal property damage and for the business income loss skoutaris eventually opened a replacement restaurant on september.
while the appraisal process was winding down,an issue regarding the judgment arose before the porter county superior court,which had appointed millbranth.after millbranth submitted the appraisal of the building replacement cost to the porter county superior court,that court indicated that it would enter judgment on the appraisal.hamilton mutual objected and asserted that the porter county superior court had no jurisdiction to enter such an award,and the court agreed.on february,skoutaris filed claims of breach of contract and bad faith by hamilton mutual in the porter county superior court,which hamilton mutual subsequently removed to the northern district of indiana and designated as to hamilton mutual federal declaratory judgment action.the parties subsequently consented to a federal magistrate judge presiding over the
