defending oneself from a class action lawsuit is a costly task.and so it comes as no surprise that these two parties are before us to determine who should foot the bill for the defense of a lawsuit filed by approximately current or former chicago housing authority cha residents who claimed they have been exposed to and harmed by environmental contaminants while living on cha public housing property.the housing authority risk retention group,harrg,a risk retention group made up of various housing authority members,asserts that it has neither the duty to defend nor indemnify cha in the underlying environmental litigation.
harrg provided commercial general liability coverage to the cha from june,through july,under separate annual policies.each of the policies provided,among other coverage,coverage and defense for bodily injury claims subject to a limit of million per occurrence per policy year.bodily injury,included,among other things,sickness,disease,death,mental anguish,and mental injury,and harrg does not dispute that the class action plaintiffs allegations of bodily injury and mental anguish fell within this definition.harrg filed the underlying action against cha seeking a declaratory judgment that it has no duty to defend or to indemnify cha with respect to the underlying litigation,because,as harrg argues,the claims asserted by the plaintiffs in the underlying class action are not covered by the policy.
the district court concluded that the policy language included what amounted to an absolute pollution exclusion,that is,an exclusion that bars coverage for all claims for pollution,whether or not the contaminants originated on the insured property,and consequently granted harrg motion for judgment on the pleadings.housing authority risk retention group,chicago housing authority,c,slip op.at.
cha objects to the district court finding and further argues that the district court failed to address potential injury claims arising out of exposure,did not address claims that the cha improperly sited altgeld gardens,and did not address claims arising from environmental discrimination,and other nontraditional environmental claims.to the contrary,these claims were adequately addressed when the district court concluded that the insurance policies contained an absolute pollution exclusion which applies regardless of the origin of the pollution or the identity of the polluter.id.slip op.at.furthermore,after considering all of the claims,the district court concluded that the the type of pollution alleged in the underlying litigation does constitute traditional environmental contamination,to which the absolute pollution exclusion would apply.id.at.
because the district court issued a thorough and memorandum opinion and order,we adopt the reasoning of the district court september,memorandum opinion and order addressing those claims challenged on appeal and affirm the judgment of the district court.a copy of the district court order is attached.

on or about october,several thousand current and former tenants of the altgeld gardens development,located at east street,chicago,illinois,during the period to the present brought an action against cha in the circuit court of cook county captioned aaron et chicago housing authority,case number l,seeking damages for alleged injuries resulting from alleged exposure to environmental contamination at or around altgeld gardens hereinafter the underlying litigation.id.plaintiffs in the underlying litigation have filed five amended complaints the last of which deals only with defendant commonwealth edison alleging negligence,breach of contract,and conspiracy against cha.defendant corrected answer to plaintiff complaint for declaratory judgment hereinafter corrected ans.plaintiffs assert that cha built the altgeld gardens housing development in an industrialized area,in and around a former sewage waste site,fourth amended complaint to aaron et chicago housing auth.hereinafter,aaron fac,ex.to defendant corrected answer to plaintiff complaint for declaratory relief,that cha knew that certain contaminants,toxic substances and chemicals,including but not limited to pcbs,pahs,selenium,arsenic,lead,mercury and pesticides were introduced,released and allowed to remain in the environment in altgeld gardens by the surrounding industrial plants,abandoned factories,toxic waste dumps,landfills and a metropolitan sanitary district plant,and their agents and employees,id,that cha caused and was responsible for introducing,releasing and allowing pcbs and pahs to remain in the environment in altgeld gardens,id,and that cha failed to advise,warn or educate the plaintiffs of the full nature and extent of the presence and existence of the pcb s and pahs,the risks associated with such,or the precautions that the plaintiffs could take.id.
the fourth amended complaint asserts four claims in count i,plaintiffs assert that cha was negligent in introducing pcbs to altgeld gardens,in failing to test for and clean up pcbs and pahs,and in failing to handle pcbs properly as a result,the aaron plaintiffs seek damages for bodily injury in excess of for each plaintiff,and injunctive relief in the form of relocation of current residents.id.in count ii,they contend that cha breached its lease agreement provisions to provide plaintiffs with living space in decent,safe and sanitary condition and to keep the development in a clean and safe condition,as a result,they and seek to recoup rent.id.in count iii,they aver that cha conspired with the illinois environmental protection agency and the department of housing and urban development to conceal the extent of the dangers to the plaintiffs health and safety from the contaminants,thereby causing them to suffer bodily injury or to be exposed to increased risk of bodily injury.id.count iv,alleging negligence,seeks damages for bodily injury and is substantially similar to count id.

discussion 
applicable legal standards 
in their motions for judgment on the pleadings,the parties dispute a number of issues.as a threshold matter,the parties dispute which law the court should apply.cha claims the policy includes a choice of law provision requiring application of vermont law,reply in support of defendant motion for judgment on the pleadings hereinafter def.reply mem,at,while harrg contends that the choice of law provision appears in an entirely separate agreement and that illinois law governs in this diversity case.plaintiff reply in support of motion for judgment on the pleadings hereinafter pl.reply mem,at.the court need not resolve this dispute,however,for analysis under either illinois or vermont law leads to the same outcome,and thus,the court will discuss the laws of both states.

pollution exclusion 
the threshold question for count i negligence,count iii conspiracy,and count iv negligence of the fourth amended complaint in the underlying litigation is whether the policies pollution exclusion language bars coverage with respect to claims for bodily injury in the underlying litigation.the parties dispute the significance of the term at or from within the language dispersal,seepage,migration,release or escape of pollutants a t or from any cha premises,site or location in the policies pollution exclusion.see,pl.reply,at defendant response to plaintiff motion for judgment on the pleadings hereinafter def.resp.mem,at.cha claims the term at or from means the pollution exclusion does not apply to contaminants which have their origin or source elsewhere and contaminate the premises through the actions of persons other than the cha.thus,cha contends,those claims relating to contaminants that originated outside of the cha property should be covered by the policies.see defendant memorandum in support of motion for judgment on the pleadings hereinafter def.mem,at.harrg argues,tot he contrary,that the policy language at issue constitutes an absolute pollution exclusion which applies regardless of the origin of the pollution or the identity of the polluter pl.reply,at.
the case law supports plaintiff interpretation of the policy language as an absolute pollution exclusion.see maska,kansa ins,cir each of insurer policies contains an absolute pollution exclusion,which excludes all coverage for l iability of the insured arising out of the actual,alleged or threatened discharge,dispersal,release or escape of pollutants at or from premises owned or occupied by or rented to the insured.applying vermont law am.states ins.koloms,noting that language excluding bodily injury arising out of actual,alleged or threatened discharge,dispersal,release or escape of pollutants a t or from premises you own,rent or occupy is commonly known as the absolute pollution exclusion.in a handful of cases,courts have examined the issue presented here whether the absolute pollution exclusion bars coverage of all claims for pollution,whether or not the contaminants originated on the insured property.these authorities albeit none,to this court knowledge in illinois or vermont have concluded that the exclusion does bar coverage in such circumstances.
gregory tennessee gas pipeline company,cir,is instructive.in gregory,the adjoining landowners to a reservoir,occupied by the city of natchitoches,louisiana,brought suit against the city for bodily injury and property damage resulting from the presence of pcbs in the water.the contamination apparently resulted from discharges into the lake from a neighboring facility owned by a gas company.in response to the lawsuit against it,the city filed a declaratory judgment action against its commercial general liability insurer alleging that the insurer owed it coverage and the duty to defend in the underlying actions.defendant insurer invoked policy language similar to the language at issue here the policy excluded damage arising out of the actual,alleged or threatened discharge,dispersal,release or escape of pollutants a t or from premises you own,rent or occupy id.at.the city urged that the alleged discharge of pollutants occurred not at or from the lake,but rather from the gas company facility and gas pipelines above the waters,but the court was unpersuaded.noting that the plaintiffs in the underlying litigation had alleged only that their use of the lake caused their bodily injury and property damage,the court concluded that the claims against the city arose solely from pollutants at or from the lake.id.at.
similarly,in east quincy servs.dist.continental insurance company,a seller of residential property sought a declaration that its liability insurer was required to defend and indemnify it in a suit brought by purchasers of the property which was contaminated by coli and other bacteria,possibly from the septic tanks and leachfields of surrounding homes.the policy excluded coverage for b odily injury arising out of the actual,alleged or threatened emission,discharge,dispersal,seepage,migration,release or escape of pollutants a t or from any premises,site or location which is or was at any time owned or occupied by any insured id.at.plaintiff insured argued,as cha does here,that the pollution exclusion did not apply to the underlying litigation because the pollution originated.id.at.the court found,however,that the language of the exclusion included pollution at as well as from the site,so that there was no limiting language as to the origination of the pollution.id.the court characterized the insured argument to the contrary as sophistry,citing gregory,at,and observed that plaintiff insured did not contest that the pollution was at the site.id.
finally,harrg cites legarra federated mutual ins,th,d.there,individual property owners brought a declaratory action seeking to establish their insurer duty to defend and indemnify them in connection with a demand by the california regional water quality control board for certain response costs due to groundwater contamination on their property.the policy contained an exclusion nearly identical to the ones at issue in gregory,east quincy,and here it carved out any coverage for b odily injury arising out of the actual,alleged or threatened discharge,dispersal,release or escape of pollutants a t or from premises owned,rented or occupied by the named insured id.at,d.the insured property owners contended that the exclusion applied only if the pollution originated on the insured property,and that since the groundwater contamination was caused by sources off their property,the pollution exclusion did not apply.id.at,d.the court rejected this contention,finding that the at or from language did not speak to the origin of the pollution and,since the claim related to pollution at the site,the exclusion applied.id.
although neither illinois nor vermont courts appear to have addressed the question whether the absolute pollution exclusion bars coverage for pollution that originates off the insured premises,courts in both states have enforced such an exclusion.in maska,the insured claimed that the insurance policy covered a suit against it for environmental contamination brought by the vermont department of environmental conservation for contamination due to wastewater discharges observed during a routine inspection.at.the court noted that the policy contained the absolute pollution exclusion covering pollution at or from the insured premises.id.at.the court held that such a pollution exclusion clause did not violate vermont public policy.id.at.in kim state farm fire and casualty company,a cleaning company sought a declaratory judgment that its insurer had breached its duty to defend and indemnify after the insured settled an action for damages brought by the insured landlord resulting from the release of tetrachloroethane perc by one of the insured machines onto the floor and into the underlying soil of the premises.d,dist.the court found that the language in the policy stating that the absolute pollution exclusion clause excluding property damage arising out of the actual,alleged or threatened discharge,seepage,migration,dispersal,spill,release or escape of pollutants barred coverage for injuries caused by traditional environmental pollution,that is,hazardous material discharged into the land,atmosphere,or any watercourse or body of water.id.at,citing koloms,at,see also economy preferred insurance company grandadam,the court d.dist finding that absolute pollution exclusion precluded coverage for damage and injuries caused when insured spilled container of mercury in neighbor home.
the only authority cha cites to support its position is,in this court view,inapposite.the policy at issue in agency of natural resources united states fire insurance company did not contain an absolute pollution exclusion instead it excluded insurance coverage for the costs of a of pollutants.state of vermont cna ins,was an action by the state of vermont to determine whether its insurance carrier was responsible for damages arising from environmental contamination of a state prison site.the court had no occasion to construe the pollution exclusion in the policy starting in,the policies included a pollution exclusion,and the state represents that it has not claimed coverage for any period after.id.at,at.in koloms,the court found that the alleged accidental release of carbon monoxide by a broken furnace did not constitute traditional environmental pollution contemplated by the absolute pollution exclusion clause.at,at.cha protestations notwithstanding,it is clear that the type of pollution alleged in the underlying litigation here does constitute traditional environmental contamination,the gradual or repeated discharge of hazardous substances into the environment,rather than contamination of the sort involved in koloms see id.at citations omitted.
in the underlying litigation,the plaintiffs claim to have been injured by hazardous materials that were introduced,released and allowed to remain in the environment in altgeld gardens by the surrounding industrial plants,abandoned factories,toxic waste dumps,landfills and a metropolitan sanitary district plant,aaron fac,and by pcbs and pahs that cha introduced,released,and allowed to remain in the environment of altgeld gardens.id.the clause within each of the policies excluding b odily injury arising out of the actual,alleged or threatened discharge,dispersal,seepage,migration,release or escape of pollutants a t or from any premises,site or location which is or was at any time owned or occupied by,or rented or loaned to,any insured is identical or nearly identical to absolute pollution exclusion as defined by the case law from other courts.the court concludes that,under both vermont and illinois law,the absolute pollution exclusion bars coverage for bodily injuries resulting from exposure to pollution,regardless of origin.
vermont policy filing requirement 
cha contends that,even if the exclusionary language bars coverage,the court can not rule on harrg motion for judgment on the pleadings because a key piece of evidence is necessarily missing from the pleadings whether harrg properly filed the policies with,and obtained approval from,the vermont department of banking and insurance vdbi.def.resp,at.vermont law provides that n o basic insurance policy,certificate or annuity contract form shall be delivered,or issued for delivery in this state,unless the form has been filed with and approved by the commissioner of the vdbi.stat.ann.tit,a.cha contends that vermont courts will void a pollution exclusion from a policy that has not been properly filed with the vdbi.because harrg has not and,indeed,can not in a rule c motion,demonstrate that the policies at issue were filed and approved by the commissioner of vdbi,cha contends,the court must deny harrg motion for judgment on the pleadings.def.resp,at.
the maska court addressed a similar argument.plaintiff there urged that the exclusions in the insurer policies were invalid because the insurer had not timely filed its policy forms with vdbi.see maska,at.the court found some support for plaintiff contention in vermont law.id.at.for example,in vermont american american employers insurance company,the court found that i t would be unreasonable to allow insurers to benefit from a failure to comply with vermont insurance regulations or a failure to prove that the exclusions were properly filed.the court,therefore,will not void the entire policy but will conclude the pollution exclusions are void.wncy,slip op.at.washington county.likewise,in agency of natural resources glens falls insurance company,the court held that an agreement between the state and a private insurance carrier to share costs of cleaning up petroleum contamination was void because the vermont statute that authorized state expenditures for petroleum covered only uninsured cleanup costs.the court
