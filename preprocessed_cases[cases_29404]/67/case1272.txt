this dispute stems from marty and laura nevel desire to install vinyl siding on a home they own which is located at lexington court within the village of schaumburg,illinois the property.because the property had been designated as a historic landmark,appellees,which include the village of schaumburg the village and various village officials,denied the nevels request to install the vinyl siding and revoked a building permit that had been obtained by the nevels siding contractor.instead of challenging appellees actions in state court,the nevels elected to file a federal suit,which alleged a claim for denial of equal protection along with two state law claims.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees on the equal protection claim and one of the state law claims and then declined to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining state law claim.the nevels appeal.
background 
the property,known as the mansion,was a large home built in.the nevels purchased the property at an auction in march.the property previous owner,girard kretzschmar,had owned the property since february on december,the village enacted an ordinance designating the property as a historic landmark the designation ordinance.under village of schaumburg ordinance a,prior to enacting a designation ordinance,
the commission shall notify the owner of such property of the proposed designation.the commission shall schedule a public hearing on the question of the proposed designation,setting forth a date,time and place and causing written notice to be given to the owner or any person having a legal or equitable interest in said property being proposed for designation.
in preparation for the hearing on the property,the village sent the requisite notice to neighboring property owners however,instead of notifying kretzschmar,the village sent certified mail notice to alison schmidt france,who had owned the property prior to kretzschmar the village also published notice of the hearing in a local newspaper.it is undisputed that the village failed to serve kretzschmar with notice of its intent to designate the property as a historic landmark or to notify him of the public hearing on the matter.in fact,kretzschmar only learned of the designation ordinance after it had been enacted by reading about it in the newspaper.the landmark designation was,however,properly recorded with the cook county recorder of deeds.
once a property is designated a historic landmark,village of schaumburg ordinance makes it 
unlawful for any person to construct,move,alter,change,make addition to,make any improvement to,add structures or buildings on a lot or tract with a designated historical landmark,demolish or remove the exterior or any aspect of the exterior of any designated historic landmark,unless the village has previously authorized such work.
despite these restrictions,there is nothing in the record to indicate that kretzschmar did anything to challenge the historical designation of the property once he became aware of it.
when the nevels purchased the property,they were aware that it had historical significance,but they claim they were unaware of its historic landmark designation.additionally,the nevels title insurer did not discover the properly recorded landmark designation in its investigation prior to issuing its title insurance policy to the nevels.at the time the nevels purchased the property,it had wood siding.in april,marty nevel told village senior planner timothy teddy that he was considering covering the property exterior with a stucco material known as dryvit to eliminate a lead paint hazard connected with the wood siding.according to the nevels,teddy recommended against the dryvit and instead suggested that the nevels use either aluminum or vinyl siding.the nevels further assert that teddy told marty nevel to obtain building permits from the village when he was ready to begin the project but said nothing about the property historic landmark status.
the nevels determined that it would cost to install vinyl siding on the property compared to to replace the existing siding with new wood.the nevels decided to use vinyl siding and,in august,hired a contractor,incorporated,to do the job.the nevels then spent over for siding materials,and performed preparatory work on the property.the nevels assert that marty nevel spoke with teddy about the siding again at the end of august and contend that teddy again told him to apply to the village for building permits,but did not mention the property landmark status.
on september,village planner frank robbins called marty nevel at his office and inquired about the nevels plans for the property.robbins informed marty of the property status as a historic landmark and told marty that the installation of vinyl siding would require approval by the village following a recommendation by the olde schaumburg centre commission the commission.that same day,marty nevel sent a letter to robbins requesting approval to install vinyl siding.robbins also sent marty nevel a letter dated september,as a to the telephone conversation.after receiving robbins letter,marty nevel understood that he would need to appear before the commission to seek approval for the siding.
on september,applied for and obtained a building permit from the village to install vinyl siding on the property.the nevels assert that,at the time the permit was issued,was not aware of marty nevel contacts with robbins,and the nevels did not know was applying for a permit.the permit was issued by a secretary in the building and code enforcement department for the village.the secretary followed normal procedure in issuing the permit,checking only to see if was licensed and bonded.the secretary did not know that the property was a designated landmark,and the permit process did not require her to ask the applicant whether the proposed work was being performed on a designated landmark.
with the permit in hand,began to install the vinyl siding.it is unclear from the record when the nevels found out that work had begun.approximately two to three weeks after installation had begun,marty nevel informed that the commission was going to hold a hearing to determine what,if any,restrictions applied to the exterior of the property.marty nevel did not ask to stop working until the commission determination was made,and the installation continued.
on october,robbins sent a letter to marty nevel,advising him that the nevels request would be considered at the commission october,meeting.robbins stated that the commission staff was going to recommend that the commission either deny the request for vinyl siding or revoke the landmark status of the property as altered with the vinyl siding based on the fact that preservation authorities generally concur that vinyl siding should not be applied to landmark buildings.
on october,teddy issued a report on behalf of the commission staff.teddy report indicated that the nevels were requesting either approval to install vinyl siding or revocation of the property historic landmark designation which would remove the architectural controls placed on the property.teddy recommended that the commission deny both requests.robbins signed off on teddy report.
the nevels were unable to attend the commission october meeting,so a subsequent meeting was set for november.on october,employees of the village building and code enforcement department posted a stop work order on the property.the village,however,did not revoke the september building permit before posting this stop work order.by this time,had installed vinyl siding on a portion of the property exterior.
at the november commission meeting,the nevels requested either a variance allowing the use of vinyl siding or that the property landmark status be removed.marty nevel stated his goal was not to remove the landmark status however,he added that he and his wife wanted to remodel rather than restore the property the nevels were planning on using the property as their private residence and were funding the project personally and not pursuing any tax credits,and therefore,the landmark status did not matter to them.at the conclusion of the november meeting,the commission voted unanimously to recommend the denial of both the request to remove the landmark status and the request to allow vinyl siding.this recommendation was conveyed to the village board.the village board discussed the nevels requests in a meeting held november.the board unanimously voted to deny the request to revoke the property historical landmark designation.the board then denied the nevels request to allow vinyl siding by a four to three vote.
following the november meeting,the nevels,after consulting with their attorney,resumed the installation of vinyl siding,relying on the september building permit that had not been revoked.work continued until december,at which point percent of the siding had been completed.on december,employees from the building and code enforcement department again posted a stop work order on the property.the building and code enforcement department also issued and served citations to marty nevel and for failure to obey a stop work order.village police ordered employees to leave the property immediately or face arrest.the village then suspended business license.
after december,village police patrolled the property with instructions to arrest anyone caught working on the siding.nels hornstrom,the director of building and code enforcement for the village,wrote marty nevel a letter dated december,in which he stated that because the stop work order had been ignored,no certificate of occupancy would be issued for the property.hornstrom stated that he had requested that water and sewer services not be authorized for the property and that he would inform other utility companies that no utility services could be begun.hornstrom closed by informing marty nevel that as the property owner he was responsible for removing any of the siding that had been placed illegally.on january,marty nevel was served with additional citations for making nonconforming alterations to a historic landmark and for performing work without a building permit.
trial on all of the citations began on february,before a cook county circuit judge.following two days of trial,at the close of the village,the judge granted a directed verdict against the village on all of the citations,stating that no evidence had been presented to show any misrepresentation in obtaining the september building permit and that under village ordinance,the village was required to revoke the building permit before it could attempt to enforce a stop work order.
on february,hornstrom sent the nevels a letter which purported to revoke the permit based on a misrepresentation of material fact in the application.in march,the village refused to replace a broken water meter at the property until the nevels signed an acknowledgment which stated,the issuance of this permit does not in any way waive the requirement that all exterior work conform to the prior decision of the village board with respect to the use of vinyl siding and stucco.several village officials also made comments to the press about the controversy,stating that in their opinions,the focus of the dispute had shifted from vinyl siding to what they perceived to be the nevels complete disregard for the law and the village board decisions.
on may,the nevels filed a complaint against appellees in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois.the complaint alleged that the historical landmark designation ordinance dealing with the property was void ab initio based on the village failure to give requisite notice prior to its enactment count i,that the revocation of the september building permit was illegal as a matter of state law count ii,and an equal protection violation under count iii.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees on counts i and iii.the district judge then declined to exercise jurisdiction over count ii state law claim,entering judgment in favor of appellees on counts i and iii and dismissing count ii for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the nevels filed this timely appeal,challenging the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of appellees on counts i and iii.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing all of the facts and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,here the nevels.see purze village of winthrop harbor,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
validity of historic landmark designation ordinance 
the nevels contend that the designation ordinance enacted by the village on december,was void ab initio because the village failed to give kretzschmar proper notice before enacting the ordinance.the nevels assert that this lack of notice violated village ordinance,state law,and the due process clause of the united states constitution.under illinois law,
a court can not handle matters which in effect are attempts to overrule decisions of a legislative body based upon alleged failure to follow requirements imposed by the body on itself we have authority to invalidate legislation only upon grounds that the enactment violates a provision of the federal or state constitutions or violates the mandate of a state or federal statute.

in the present case,the nevels can not show a violation of state or federal law.any due process violation that may have occurred affected kretzschmar rights,not those of the nevels.the nevels lack standing to raise a claim based on the due process rights of a third party.see valley forge christian college americans united for separation of church and state,d.furthermore,the enactment of the designation ordinance did not violate any illinois statute.the nevels contend that the notice provisions of village of schaumburg ordinance are mandated by of the historic preservation division of the illinois municipal code.comp.stat.section provides,in relevant part 
no action taken by the municipality under this section directing a private owner to do or refrain from doing any specific thing,or refusing to permit a private owner to do some specific thing he desires to do,in connection with property designated by ordinance hereunder,shall be taken by the municipality except after due notice to such owner and opportunity for him to be heard at a public hearing.
appellees contend,and the district court held,that is superceded by the later ordinance enacted under the village home rule power.the nevels assert that applies concurrently with regulations established by home rule municipalities.section does not expressly address its applicability to home rule units 
the nevels rely on patrick media group,d,in which the illinois appellate court held that,absent a clear statement negating the state concurrent regulation,zoning provisions of the illinois municipal code which were amended and reenacted after the effective date of the illinois constitution of applied to home rule units.this ruling was based on the fact that the illinois constitution of allows home rule units to exercise powers concurrently with the state to the extent that the legislature does not impose limitations on such concurrently exercised powers or declares the state exercise to be exclusive.id.at.the nevels contend that under patrick media group,obligated the village to enact and comply with the notice provisions set out in village ordinance a.however,even assuming applies concurrently with the village home rule power,the nevels fail to show a violation of state law.section requires due notice to the property owner.the nevels cite no cases and can not point to anything in the statute to support their contention that due notice under requires personal,written notice.in the present case,it is undisputed that the village gave notice by publication prior to enacting the designation ordinance.the nevels fail to show that this is insufficient under therefore,their claim that the designation ordinance is void because it was enacted in violation of state law fails.
we turn now to the nevels contention that under in re a
