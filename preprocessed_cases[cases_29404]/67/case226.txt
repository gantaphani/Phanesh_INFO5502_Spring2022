this appeal challenges a jury verdict and award of in damages for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in connection with an attempted sale of a home on nantucket island,in massachusetts.the appellants jeffrey lee,susan lee,and jeffrey lee real estate,lee real estate or the lees assert two errors on appeal that the district court erred by denying their motion for judgment as a matter of law brought under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,and that the district court should not have admitted appellees ned and janet zachar the zachars expert report into evidence in its entirety.after a careful review of the record,we affirm.
i.the facts 
we take the facts and the reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most hospitable to the jury verdict.see correa hosp.san francisco,cir sanchez puerto rico oil,cir wagenmann adams,cir.
on august,the zachars,enamored with nantucket in summer,signed a purchase and sale agreement the p s with the lees to purchase property located at anne lane on nantucket the property.the purchase price for the property was.in accordance with the p s,the zachars made the required ten percent deposit of to the lees attorney,and the purchase of the property was scheduled to close on february.
like the setting sun,however,by late december,the zachars desire to purchase the property began fading to the west when zachar accepted a job as a telecommunications stock analyst in san francisco.however,under the terms of the p s,the zachars failure to close on the property would result in their forfeiture of the deposit.in an attempt to avoid this result,the zachars proposed an alternative arrangement that might allow them to recoup,in whole or in part,the deposit they placed on the property.on january,the zachars and lees entered into an agreement the agreement that required the lees to list the property for sale on july,and keep it on the market through february.under the terms of the agreement,if the property sold before february,the lees were obligated to pay the zachars any funds in excess of the sale price set forth in the p s up to a maximum of.
the agreement also provided that lee real estate,as the sole broker for the property,would use reasonable and commercially acceptable means to sell the property.the agreement provided,in pertinent part,that 
and lee agree to list the property with lee real estate,for sale commencing july,at a price to be chosen by them.lee real estate shall market and attempt to sell the property in a reasonable commercial manner as comparable properties are marketed on nantucket.
agreement at.on july,the lees listed the property for sale with lee real estate.because the median sales prices of nantucket homes in had been increasing substantially,lee real estate set the asking price for the property at higher than the price of the property at the time the zachars and lees entered into the p s.the lees did not lower the asking price for the property during the term of the agreement,and when the agreement expired on february,the property had not sold.the zachars were therefore unable to recoup any of their deposit.
ii.the proceedings below 
the zachars brought suit against the lees and their real estate company asserting five causes of action breach of contract misrepresentation breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing conversion and a violation of.laws ch.following a trial,the zachars case was submitted to the jury on the breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims the jury found that the lees did not breach the agreement and returned a verdict on that count in their favor.however,the jury found that the lees breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and awarded the zachars in damages with respect to that count.
pursuant to.rule,the lees moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the evidence and again following the jury verdict.the district court denied both motions.this appeal followed.
iii.analysis 
sufficiency of the evidence on the plaintiffs implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim.
the lees argue that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that they breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.specifically,the lees contend that because the jury found that they did not breach the agreement including the provision regarding the reasonable marketing of the property,it could not have considered evidence relating to the marketing of the property to find a breach of the implied covenant.accordingly,the lees contend there was insufficient evidence,absent evidence,to find a breach of the implied covenant and the district court should therefore have granted their rule motion.
in most instances,we review de novo the district court decision to deny a rule motion for judgment as a matter of law.see gibson city of cranston,cir.in undertaking this review,we look to all evidence in the record,drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom in the nonmovants favor,and resist the temptation to weigh the evidence or make our own credibility determinations.see reeves sanderson plumbing,d correa,at gibson,at.we may reverse the denial of such a motion only if reasonable persons could not have reached the conclusion that the jury embraced.correa,at citing sanchez,at.
however,before we undertake this review we must be satisfied that the lees properly preserved their arguments for appeal.rule a requires that challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence must be raised initially at the close of the evidence.such challenges must be sufficiently specific so as to apprise the district court of the grounds relied on in support of the motion.see.a correa,at.accordingly,a motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the evidence preserves for review only those grounds specified at the time,and no others.id.citing sanchez,at.if the rule a motion is denied and the case is submitted to a jury,the movant must renew the motion once again in order to preserve the issue for appeal.see.b martin redish,moore federal practice ed.the grounds for the renewed motion under rule b are limited to those asserted in the earlier rule a motion.see correa,at the movant can not use a rule b motion as a vehicle to introduce a legal theory not distinctly articulated in its motion for a directed verdict.sanchez,at.
the lees argued in their rule a motion that the zachars claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was indistinguishable from their claim for breach of contract.they further argued that,to the extent that these claims could be treated separately,there was no breach of the implied covenant.the district court denied this motion.following the jury verdict,the lees renewed their motion under rule b.the rule b motion tried a new tack arguing that because the jury found in their favor on the breach of contract claim implicitly finding that they had acted in a commercially reasonable manner when marketing the property,the jury could not have relied upon the lees marketing efforts to conclude that the lees breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.absent that evidence,the lees argued that there was insufficient evidence to support a verdict on the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim.unpersuaded,the district court also denied this motion.in this appeal,the lees press the same grounds argued in the rule b motion.
the lees challenge to the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim is one that was not advanced in their rule a motion.at the close of the evidence,the lees sought judgment as a matter of law arguing that the breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims were essentially duplicative.such an objection however is simply not sufficient to preserve,and certainly can not be read to encompass,the legal theory underlying the lees rule b motion and this appeal that a finding of breach of contract is a prerequisite to a finding of breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
given the lees failure to comply with the strictur
