federal law requires home sellers to alert potential home buyers to the presence of paint hazards.the city of laconia,new hampshire sidestepped this requirement when it sold jameson randall his house.some years later,after learning that paint was present in his home,randall filed suit.the sole question is whether his lawsuit is.we agree with the district court that it is,and therefore affirm.
background 
in,the appellee,the city of laconia the city or laconia,purchased a house located at elm street in laconia the property or home.the property was an older house,built before.the city purchased the property,which at the time was a group home,to provide extra storage and parking for the adjacent branch of the laconia public library the library.in connection with the transaction,the seller turned over a lead paint inspection report,which detailed the results of a inspection performed by alpha lead consultants,the alpha report.the alpha report indicated that paint was present in the home.after the purchase,the library maintained a copy of the alpha report in its files.
some years later the city decided to sell the property and in,the appellant,jameson randall,contracted to purchase it.when randall signed the purchase and sale agreement he received a blank,standard paint disclosure form titled disclosure of information on lead based paint and lead based paint hazards for housing sales the disclosure form.the disclosure form included a section titled seller disclosure,in which the seller the city was to indicate whether it had any knowledge of paint in the home and whether it had any reports or records pertaining to the same.the disclosure form also provided for a purchaser acknowledgment that included an acknowledgment that the buyer randall had a window in which to conduct a paint hazard inspection.randall and his buyer agent signed the blank disclosure form.the buyer agent then informed randall that the city would complete the disclosure form later.however,the city never completed the form nor did it turn over the alpha report randall opted not to have his own inspection performed 
despite not having received the completed disclosure form from the city,randall went ahead and closed on the property,taking title on july.he then moved into the home with his wife and two daughters.in,the couple had a third child,a son.in,tests taken at the son physical revealed an elevated blood lead level.as a result,the state of new hampshire sent a representative to the property to perform an inspection for lead.the inspection the results of which were given to randall in an october,letter revealed paint hazards in the home.elimination or control of the hazards was recommended.
on february,approximately six and years after he purchased the property randall filed this lawsuit.the sole count in the complaint alleged that the city had violated,which requires the disclosure of paint hazards in connection with the sale of homes built before.though at the time of filing suit randall had not had any removal or abatement of the paint performed,he alleged that he had received an estimate of approximately to perform the work and that he would not have purchased the home if he had known about the hazards.as part of the discovery process,randall propounded a request for document production on the city.the city responded on may,and one of the documents that it turned over was the alpha report.this was the first time randall had seen the report.
a few months later,the city moved for summary judgment,alleging that randall cause of action was barred by the applicable state statute of limitations.the city position was that randall cause of action accrued when he took title to the property on july,and therefore his suit,filed six and years later,came too late.the district court agreed and granted summary judgment in favor of the city.randall appealed.
we review a grant of summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds de novo,construing the record in the light most favorable to the.see montalvo gonzalez amparo,cir.we affirm if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.
residential lead based paint hazard reduction act 
randall filed suit under the residential lead based paint hazard reduction act the act,and in particular under,which allows for a private cause of action for three times the amount of any damages incurred by the buyer,id.b.the act provides for the promulgation of regulations that require a seller to disclose to the purchaser the presence of any known paint,or any known paint hazards,in such housing and provide to the purchaser any lead hazard evaluation report available to the seller.id.a b.such regulations were promulgated.see a housing and urban development a environmental protection agency.
the city does not attempt to argue that it met these requirements,nor does it appear that it truthfully could make this argument.it is undisputed that prior to selling randall the property the city did not complete the disclosure form,turn over the alpha report,or otherwise inform randall about the paint hazards in the home.the only question is whether the city should be excused on grounds.
ii.applicable statute of limitations 
does not contain a limitations period and therefore a question below was what limitations period applied.there was not much debate.the city argued that the new hampshire statute of limitations for personal actions governed,randall did not disagree,and the district court followed suit applying the state statute.see randall city of laconia,cv lm,wl,at,applying.ann.this approach is in accord with our practice of applying the most analogous statute of limitations in the state where the action was brought when a federal statute does not include a statute of limitations.greenwood ex rel.estate of greenwood pub.utils.comm n,cir citing wilson garcia.
now,for the first time,randall asserts that instead of looking to the new hampshire limitations statute,the district court should have applied the federal statute of limitations for civil actions.see a stating that,e xcept as otherwise provided by law,a civil action arising under an act of congress may not be commenced later than years after the cause of action accrues.randall admits that he would fare no better under a,as opposed to a,limitations period should we agree with the district court that his cause of action accrued when he purchased the property six and years before filing suit.perhaps for this reason,randall only briefly raises this issue in a footnote and provides no supporting argumentation.his perfunctory treatment,as well as his raising this argument for the first time on appeal,waives the issue.see farris shinseki,cir declining to consider an issue that was never raised before the district court,nor briefed or argued on appeal.consequently we need not get into the merits of this particular statute of limitations debate.we assume for purposes of this decision that the new hampshire limitations period applies to randall action.
iii.the separate cause of action argument 
before we go any further,we wish to dispose of an argument of randall.it is a meritless argument that unfortunately for randall permeates his entire position on appeal.in a nutshell randall characterizes the city failure to turn over the alpha report as a separate and distinct violation from the city other alleged violations of the act,not completing the disclosure form,not providing a lead information pamphlet,not including a lead warning statement in the sales contract.and,in randall mind,each such violation is its own cause of action complete with its own statute of limitations.so,while he now concedes that all of the city other violations are barred by the statute of limitations,randall argues that his cause of action for the city failure to turn over the alpha report survives.relying on the discovery rule,randall stance is that accrual did not occur until may when he learned that the alpha report existed after the city turned it over in discovery.randall claims he could not have discovered the factual basis for his claim until this time.
