in this case,we must decide whether title ii of the americans with disabilities act ada requires local governments to provide accessible parking in the absence of regulatory design specifications for parking facilities.we hold that it does.
background 
robin fortyune is a paraplegic who uses a wheelchair for mobility.he filed suit against the city of lomita city in state court,alleging that he experiences great difficulty,discomfort and,even fear for his safety when frequenting facilities in the city because none of the city public parking is accessible to people with disabilities.he brought claims under the ada,et,and the california disabled persons act cdpa,cal.et.
the city removed the case to federal court,and moved to dismiss fortyune complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b.the city argued that,absent the adoption of ada implementing regulations specifically targeted toward parking,it is not required to provide accessible parking.the district court denied the motion to dismiss,concluding that the broad language of the ada requires public entities to ensure that all services,including parking,are reasonably accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.the city filed a motion to certify the district court order for interlocutory appeal pursuant to b,which the district court granted.the city then timely petitioned for leave to appeal,and a motions panel of this court granted the petition.

iii.analysis 
congress enacted the ada in to remedy widespread discrimination against disabled individuals.pga tour,martin.the statute provides a comprehensive,broad mandate to eliminate discrimination against disabled persons,addressing both outright intentional exclusion as well as the failure to make modifications to existing facilities and practices.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also cohen city of culver city,cir b.we construe the language of the ada broadly to advance its remedial purpose.cohen,at.
title ii of the ada,the provision at issue in this case,applies to state and local governments.id.at.it provides that no qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,or activities of a public entity,or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.the ada was modeled on the rehabilitation act,which prohibited any program or activity that received federal funds from discriminating against disabled individuals.a pierce cnty.of orange,cir bay area addiction research treatment,city of antioch baart,cir.the rehabilitation act defines program or activity as all of the operations of a department,agency,special purpose district,or other instrumentality of a state or of a local government.b.we have recognized that the term services,programs,or activities as used in the ada is similarly broad,bringing within its scope anything a public entity does.barden city of sacramento,cir brackets omitted quoting lee city of,cir.whether a particular public function is covered by the ada turns simply on whether it is a normal function of a government entity.id.quoting baart,at.
recognizing the broad reach of the ada,we have held that title ii requires public entities to maintain accessible public sidewalks,notwithstanding the fact that no implementing regulations specifically addressed sidewalks.id.at.in barden,we explained that local governments must maintain accessible sidewalks because maintaining public sidewalks is a normal function of a city and without a doubt something that the city does.id.at brackets omitted quoting hason med,cir.the same reasoning leads us to conclude that local governments must maintain accessible public parking.
the city argues that barden is distinguishable because,in that case,existing regulations concerning curb ramps clearly contemplated sidewalk accessibility.here,however,the city contends that no existing regulation implicates onstreet parking.the city argument fails for several reasons.first,although the barden court noted that its conclusion was consistent with an existing curb ramp regulation,its holding was based on the text of the ada.see id.at interpreting the phrase services,programs,or activities and considering similar text in the rehabilitation act.second,we have previously recognized that,as a general matter,the lack of specific regulations can not eliminate a statutory obligation.see reich.sulphur chem,cir explaining that although the occupational safety and health act contemplated that the secretary of labor would promulgate specific safety standards,such regulations could only amplify and augment the statute general duty clause and their absence did not displace the statutory mandate to provide a safe workplace.
third,existing regulations do require accessible parking.two regulations in particular apply to public onstreet parking.the first is,which applies to all existing facilities pursuant to this regulation,public entities must operate each service,program,or activity so that the service,program,or activity,when viewed in its entirety,is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.a.because the provision of public parking is a service,program,or activity,a applies to it.under the regulation,however,public entities have some flexibility in handling existing inaccessible facilities.for instance,they are not required to make structural changes to all existing parking facilities if they can make public parking accessible by other means,such as by providing accessible parking at other nearby sites.b cohen,at noting that in order to comply with,a public entity may require disabled individuals to take a marginally longer route internal quotation marks omitted.but,at bottom,the regulation mandates program accessibility for all normal governmental functions,including the provision of public parking.
the second regulation,governs only facilities that were constructed or modified after the ada effective date.unlike,it requires that each facility constructed or altered after june,be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.a,b.by its terms,then,this regulation extends to newly constructed or altered parking facilities.the city seeks to avoid this conclusion by pointing out that the technical specifications governing newly constructed or altered facilities are silent with respect to parking.in addition to the general mandate of accessibility set forth in subsections a and b,also requires that newly constructed or altered facilities meet the technical standards set forth in the uniform federal accessibility standards ufas,the standards for accessible design standards,or the standards for accessible design standards.see id.c the ufas,the standards,and the standards contain detailed specifications for a range of different facilities,but none of them address parking however,nothing in suggests that when technical specifications do not exist for a particular type of facility,public entities have no accessibility obligations.in fact,such an interpretation of the regulation can not be reconciled with subsections a and b,which mandate that each newly constructed or altered facility be readily accessible.therefore,we read to require that all public parking facilities constructed or altered after the ada effective date be accessible.
our interpretation of is also consistent with the doj interpretation.the doj issues a technical assistance manual ta manual to assist individuals and entities to understand their rights and obligations under the ada in a supplement to the ta manual,the doj offered the following guidance on complying with when neither the ufas nor the americans with disabilities act accessibility guidelines for
