plaintiff judy holman appeals the may,order of the district court denying her motion for leave to file a fourth amended complaint under the truth in lending act,et.tila,and the march,order granting defendant rock financial corporation motion for summary judgment and denying plaintiff for summary judgment and motion for class certification.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
the background facts of this litigation are more fully set forth in the court published opinion in inge rock financial,cir hereafter inge i.suffice it to say that plaintiff judy holman borrowed money from defendant,a real estate lender,to refinance the purchase of her home.in making and settling the loan,defendant assessed plaintiff certain fees as part of defendant finance charge.prior to closing the loan,defendant disclosed some,but not all,of these fees to plaintiff.specifically,the settlement statement provided to plaintiff at closing identified two previously undisclosed fees a charge of for document preparation and a charge of to the title office for settlement or closing.plaintiff holman and latonya inge no longer part of this litigation then filed a complaint,styled as a class action,asserting various state law causes of action against defendant.they subsequently amended the complaint to add tila claims.the district court dismissed plaintiff second amended complaint on the merits and denied leave to file a third amended complaint that purportedly cured the defects in the prior complaint.
on appeal in inge i,this court noted that the tila requires a creditor to disclose its estimated finance charge when extending credit to a consumer in a residential mortgage transaction.inge i,at citing a,b.further,a creditor who fails to make the required disclosures is liable to the consumer for damages,costs,and attorney fees.id.citing a.although the tila permits a creditor to exclude document preparation fees from estimated finance charges,e,regulation z,promulgated by the federal reserve board and appearing at,clarifies that document preparation fees are excludable only if the fees are bona fide and reasonable.c ii.in addition,the tila excludes settlement fees imposed by third party closing agents from the definition of finance charge,but only if the creditor does not require the imposition of the charges for the services provided and does not retain the charges.id.quoting a 
plaintiff judy holman second amended complaint alleged that defendant had failed to disclose its fees for document preparation and settlement or closing as part of its finance charge and demanded damages.inge i,at.plaintiff alleged that defendant document preparation fee was not bona fide and reasonable because defendant prepared the mortgage and promissory note but retained a fee in excess of defendant cost.id.she further alleged that defendant the creditor required the services for which the settlement or closing fee was imposed and,therefore,defendant violated the tila when it failed to disclose the settlement fee as a finance charge.id.
defendant argued,and the district court agreed,that plaintiff second amended complaint failed to state a claim with regard to the bona fides of the document preparation fee because plaintiff was required to allege that the amount defendant disclosed as the finance charge varied from the amount it actually charged by more than,pursuant to the tolerances for accuracy provision of tila,f id.at.on appeal,this court reversed the district court because f treats disclosure variances as accurate if within the tolerance,but does not include any language explicitly absolving creditors from liability.id.at quoting f.the court held that f does not impose an independent pleading hurdle for tila plaintiffs,but rather,is a potential affirmative defense.id.at.
the court buttressed its conclusion by citing the statements of senator sarbanes offered during senate consideration of the amendments to the tila 
this bill increases the tolerance for statutory damages,lifting the bar that determines what constitutes a violation 
this increased tolerance for errors is intended to protect lenders from the small errors of judgment that occurred in the rodash aib mortgage,cir case it is obviously not intended to give lenders the right to pad fees up to the tolerance limit of.for example,if a delivery associated with the closing cost on a home mortgage costs,should be charged and disclosed as part of the finance charge.a lender can not arbitrarily raise an additional simply because there is a wider tolerance.
id.at quoting cong.rec.daily ed,statement of senator sarbanes.the court observed that senator sarbanes comments reinforce the congressional intent to balance the need to protect consumers from questionable lending practices against the need to shield lenders from challenges to their disclosure practices that only minimally deviate from the actual amount charged,practices that represent no more than a variance between actual and disclosed finance charges.to strike this balance,the court held that plaintiff need not plead a variance greater than,yet afforded defendant the option to plead the tolerance limit as an affirmative defense.id.
defendant further argued in inge i that the allegations of plaintiff second amended complaint failed to state a tila disclosure claim because defendant was under no obligation to include the fees for document preparation and settlement or closing in its presettlement disclosures.the court agreed with defendant only with respect to the settlement or closing fees.id.as to the document preparation fee issue,defendant argued that it was insufficient for plaintiff to allege that the document preparation fee,which defendant imposed ostensibly to cover its costs of preparing the mortgage and promissory note,exceeded defendant actual cost of preparing the note and mortgage,without also alleging that defendant charges differed from those of other local businesses.id.at.the court held that plaintiff could conceivably have alleged the unreasonableness of the fees with more detail and specificity,but we do not conclude that her merely describing the fees as not bona fide and reasonable fails to state a claim as a matter of law.id.citations omitted.the court noted,however,that the issue of the fee reasonableness might be resolvable on summary judgment after discovery.id.
as to the settlement fee issue,the court noted that a creditor has fairly broad,but not unlimited,authority to exclude lump sum charges for services provided by third parties,such as a lump sum charge for a lawyer or title company conducting or attending a closing.id.at.however,the charge must be primarily for excludable services that is,services related to the preparation or review of documents involving the title or loan on the property.id.quoting,supp.i,official staff interpretations,c.the court held that for plaintiff to claim that defendant violated tila by excluding the lump settlement or closing fee paid to a title company primarily for services that allegedly were not excludable,plaintiff needed,at a minimum,to identify the service provided by the title company.id.at.in the absence of any allegation of what service the title company provided,plaintiff second amended complaint failed to state a tila violation arising out of undisclosed fees for settlement or closing.id.at.
the court then reversed the district court refusal to permit plaintiff to file a third amended complaint.id.fed.civ.b requires a district court to enter a scheduling order for matters such as amendments to the pleadings and indicates that the order shall not be modified except upon a showing of good cause.the court found that plaintiff had good cause to amend her complaint after the december,deadline because she had acted diligently in seeking to file an additional amended pleading her request to amend was a prompt effort to remedy pleading deficiencies identified by the district court in the dismissal order and the amendment would not prejudice defendant.id.at.further,based on its earlier holding concerning the tila tolerances for accuracy provision,the court held that the district court erred in refusing permission to amend on the ground that plaintiff had failed to plead a variance between disclosed and actual fees exceeding.id.at.the court ordered that o n remand,the district court shall permit plaintiff to file her third amended complaint.id.the court noted,however,that plaintiff third amended complaint does not alter her allegations pertaining to fees charged for settlement or closing,and therefore does not affect the conclusion that she has not properly pleaded a violation of the tila with regard to those fees.id.at.
the court filed its opinion in inge i on february.the district court received the opinion on february,and on april,the district court granted plaintiff motion for leave to file her third amended complaint,pursuant to this court order in inge because the district court could not locate the original of the third amended complaint,it asked plaintiff to submit another original,signed version of the pleading.counsel for plaintiff,however,did not wish to endorse a draft of the third amended complaint that this court reviewed and found partially deficient in inge instead,on april,plaintiff filed a renewed motion for leave to file a third amended complaint.the motion attached a revised version of the third amended complaint that purportedly corrected the defect this court found with regard to the settlement fee claim.the revised complaint alleged,in relevant part 
the settlement or closing fee assessed by rock financial was for a service required by rock,and was not primarily for an excludable activity rather the fee was primarily for the following activities 
a witnessing execution of closing documents 
b disbursing settlement proceeds and 
c recording mortgage discharge of mortgage.
plaintiff motion to amend was ripe for decision in early may,the court did not rule on plaintiff motion to amend for ten months,during which the parties completed expert discovery and prepared for summary judgment on the only claim plaintiff was able to present without a decision on the document preparation fee claim.on march,the district court denied plaintiff renewed motion for leave to file her third amended complaint.the court held that plaintiff motion was in reality a motion seeking leave to file a fourth amended complaint because it was not the same complaint that was the subject of this court decision in inge i.the court found that plaintiff had already endorsed the third amended complaint by virtue of filing her original,signed motion seeking leave to file that pleading and by appealing the court decision denying leave to file that complaint.the court also expressed the view that it would be in violation of this court order in inge i not to file the third amended complaint that was the subject of inge i.the court therefore denied plaintiff motion to file a fourth amended complaint,without prejudice to her right to her motion under federal rule of civil procedure.
also on march,the court ruled on the parties for summary judgment on plaintiff claim based on the document preparation fee and on plaintiff motion for.because plaintiff had not yet sought leave to file a fourth amended complaint containing new allegations about defendant fee for settlement costs,the court ruled that the issue of the settlement fee was not properly before it.the court found that there was no evidence that defendant document preparation fee was unreasonable given the prevailing practices in the relevant market.quoting brannam huntington mortgage,cir.plaintiff expert on the issue,thomas myers,opined that defendant fees were unreasonable based on the practices of a limited number of document preparation service providers.according to the court,however,myers analysis was flawed under brannam because he failed to compare defendant fees within the relevant of lenders,not the market consisting of document preparation service providers.even accepting,arguendo,myers opinion that defendant document preparation fee was higher than the reasonable market price,the court found that plaintiff could not premise a tila claim on this fact because the tila tolerates up to a variance between the actual and disclosed fees under f a.the court also denied plaintiff motion for class certification because she had failed to plead a claim capable of surviving summary judgment.
on april,plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a fourth amended complaint.plaintiff supporting brief consisted of three short paragraphs spanning less than a half of a page.plaintiff argued that she should be permitted to file yet another amended complaint because the district court vault ed form over substance by rejecting plaintiff revised third amended complaint purportedly on the ground that it was actually a fourth amended complaint.to justify the filing of a fourth amended complaint,plaintiff entire argument consisted of the following sentence plaintiff relies upon.a and the february,opinion and judgment of the sixth circuit in this action in support of her motion for leave to amend.
the court denied plaintiff motion on may,because she could not satisfy the standard for amendment under fed.civ.a.the court noted that the case was no longer at the pleading stage when plaintiff sought leave to file a fourth amended complaint,but rather,discovery had closed even before the first appeal.the court therefore held that,in evaluating plaintiff proposed amendment for futility,it is apparent that plaintiff proposed fourth amended complaint must be able to survive not merely a rule motion,but rather a rule motion for summary judgment.citing republic bank hales,d.the court then noted that the closing fee charged to plaintiff was set by and paid to the title office,the company that conducted the closing of plaintiff loan.consistently,plaintiff proposed complaint alleged that the closing was held at the title office,and plaintiff settlement statement indicates that the settlement or closing fee was paid to the title office.the tila makes it clear,however,that fees for services and the preparation of documents are excluded from the computation of the finance charge.citing e,e,e c.accordingly,the court held that plaintiff proposed amendment would be futile.
the district court also ruled that amendment was not appropriate in light of plaintiff repeated failure to cure deficiencies,undue delay,and prejudice.although this court in inge i viewed plaintiff motion to file a third amended complaint as a prompt effort to remedy pleading deficiencies identified by the district court in the dismissal order,inge i,at,plaintiff failed to include the amendment to the settlement or closing fee claim set forth in the proposed fourth amended complaint.instead,plaintiff waited until after her appeal,wherein this court held that the settlement or closing fee claim was deficient.relying on troxel schwinn bicycle,cir,the district court found that amendment would be unfair to defendant because plaintiff was attempting to litigate the same claim that this court already had found to be deficient.plaintiff could not justify her purported need to amend on difficult heightened pleading requirements or on the ground of newly discovered evidence.for these reasons,and because amendment would have been futile in any event,the district court denied plaintiff leave to file her proposed fourth amended complaint.
on june,plaintiff appealed the may,order denying her motion for leave to file a fourth amended complaint and the march,order granting defendant motion for summary judgment and denying plaintiff for summary judgment and her motion for class certification.
