the court granted rehearing en banc to consider the proper standard for applying the provision of the religious land use and institutionalized persons act.that provision states that no government shall impose or implement a land use regulation in a manner that treats a religious assembly or institution on less than equal terms with a nonreligious assembly or institution.b.
the appellant,river of life,is a small church it has members,only about half of whom attend services on an average sunday that at present operates out of rented space in a cramped,dirty warehouse in chicago heights,a town miles south of downtown chicago.it wanted to relocate to a building in the village of hazel crest,a town of some people located two miles north and slightly west of chicago heights.the building,however,is in a part of the town designated by the town zoning ordinance as a commercial district.the district is in the town oldest part,which is run down indeed the entire town has been in economic decline for years.the area designated as a commercial district is close to the train station,and the presence of commuters might enable the district to be revitalized as a commercial center.the zoning ordinance has therefore been amended to exclude new noncommercial uses from the district,including not only churches but also community centers,schools,and art galleries.
river of life sued the village under the provision and moved for a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of the zoning ordinance.the district judge denied the motion and a panel of this court affirmed,mainly on the ground that the church was unlikely to prevail when the case was fully litigated.cir.the existence of an intercircuit conflict with respect to the proper test for applying the provision,combined with uncertainty about the consistency of our decisions,persuaded the full court to hear the case in order to decide on a test.
two of our sister courts of appeals have proposed tests.the third circuit in lighthouse institute for evangelism,city of long branch,cir,ruled that a regulation will violate the equal terms provision only if it treats religious assemblies or institutions less well than secular assemblies or institutions that are similarly situated as to the regulatory purpose emphasis in original.the court must identify first the goals of the challenged zoning ordinance and second the secular assemblies meeting places that are comparable to the plaintiff religious assembly in the sense of having roughly the same relation to those goals.if the reasons for excluding some category of secular traditional reasons such as effect on traffic or novel ones such as creating a street of fun,see,clifton hill,fun by the falls,visited may,are applicable to a religious assembly,the ordinance is deemed neutral and therefore not in violation of the provision.but if a secular assembly is allowed and the religious assembly banned even though the two assemblies do differ in any way material to the regulatory purpose behind the ordinance,then neutrality has been violated and equality denied.that was the situation in the lighthouse case.the zoning ordinance permitted meeting halls in the district in which the church wanted to locate and there was no way to distinguish between meeting halls and churches on the basis of the purpose of the ordinance.the third circuit therefore ordered summary judgment in favor of the church with respect to its challenge to the ordinance though not its challenge to a newer redevelopment plan,saying that long branch the defendant has failed to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the ordinance treated religious assemblies or institutions on less than equal terms with assemblies or institutions that caused equivalent harm to its governmental objectives.at.
an alternative test was adopted by the eleventh circuit in midrash sephardi,town of surfside,cir,and followed in prima iglesia bautista hispana of boca raton,broward county,cir,and konikov orange county,cir per curiam.the eleventh circuit reads the language of the provision literally a zoning ordinance that permits any assembly,as defined by dictionaries,to locate in a district must permit a church to locate there as well even if the only secular assemblies permitted are hospital operating theaters,bus terminals,air raid shelters,restaurants that have private dining rooms in which a book club or professional association might meet,and sports stadiums.in midrash the court held that where private clubs are allowed,so must churches be.
pressed too hard,this approach would give religious land uses favored a zoning ordinance that permits private clubs but not meeting halls used by political advocacy groups.the court indicated,however,that a seemingly unequal treatment of religious uses that nevertheless is consistent with the strict scrutiny standard for determining the propriety of a regulation affecting religion would not violate the provision.midrash sephardi,town of surfside,supra,at.
our own cases dealing with that provision had cited midrash without criticism but had not been centrally concerned with the interpretive issue presented in this case.in digrugilliers consolidated city of indianapolis,cir,the issue was whether by granting churches rights that,though unlikely to be exercised,would conflict with rational zoning policy,a municipality could exclude churches from a district in which otherwise similar secular assemblies were permitted we held it could not.in vision church village of long grove,cir,which we decided against the church plaintiff,the restaurants and health clubs that the church considered comparable land users that were treated more favorably than it was were located in a commercial district rather than in the residential district in which the church sought to build,and the fact that the church and the elementary schools which the church also contended were comparable,and which were permitted under a prior city ordinance but would have been excluded under the current ordinance were subject to different standards because of the year in which their special use applications were considered compels the conclusion that there was no unequal treatment.id.at.
neither the third circuit nor the eleventh circuit approach,though in application they might yield similar or even identical results moreover that would strike most judges as entirely satisfactory.we are troubled by the eleventh circuit rule that mere differential treatment between a church and some other company of persons collected together in one place usually for some common purpose the court preferred dictionary definition of assembly violates the provision.midrash sephardi,town of surfside,supra,at.assembly so understood would include most secular land usesfactories,nightclubs,zoos,parks,malls,soup kitchens,and bowling alleys,to name but a few visitors to each of these institutions have a common purpose in visiting even though most of them have different effects on the municipality and its residents from a church consider just the difference in municipal services required by different land uses,including differences in the amount of police protection.the land use that led the eleventh circuit in midrash to find a violation of the provision was,however,a private club,and it is not obvious that it has different effects on a municipality or its residents from those of a church.thus our quarrel is not with the result in midrash but with the eleventh circuit test.
a subtler objection to the test is that it may be too friendly to religious land uses,unduly limiting municipal regulation and maybe even violating the first amendment prohibition against establishment of religion by discriminating in favor of religious land uses.see sts.constantine helen greek orthodox church,city of new berlin,cir.the supreme court had held in employment division smith,that the clause of the first amendment that guarantees the free exercise of religion does not excuse churches from having to comply with nondiscriminatory regulations,such as the prohibition of drugs believed to be dangerous,even if the regulation interferes with church rituals or observances we have never held that an individual religious beliefs excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting conduct that the state is free to regulate.id.at.if they were excused,this might be deemed favoritism to religion and thus violate the establishment clause.
suppose a zoning ordinance forbids all assemblies except gymnasiums.then because a gymnasium is an assembly as defined by the eleventh circuit,a church could locate in the district but a secular humanist reading room could not,unless secular humanist organizations such as american atheists,the american humanist association,the freedom from religion foundation,the godless americans political action committee,internet infidels,and the skeptics are all real organizations were defined as religions.nor could the local chapter of the cat fanciers association,which might have local members,only about half of whom show up on average at the chapter meetings.it was to avoid making its test overprotect religious assembles in comparison to their closest secular counterparts that the eleventh circuit added its strict scrutiny can bar religious land uses from particular zones if the regulation satisfies the strict scrutiny test for regulations that treat religious and secular activities differently.there is no textual basis for the gloss,and religious discrimination is expressly prohibited elsewhere in the statute.the gloss was needed only to solve a problem of the court own creation.
a further objection to the eleventh circuit test is that equality,except when used of mathematical or scientific relations,signifies not equivalence or identity but proper relation to relevant concerns.it would not promote equality to require that all men wear shirts that have collars,or that the number of churches in a state equal the number of casinos,or that all workers should have the same wages.but it does promote equality to require equal pay for equal work,even though workers differ in a variety of respects,such as race and sex.if a church and a community center,though different in many respects,do not differ with respect to any accepted zoning criterion,then an ordinance that allows one and forbids the other denies equality and violates the provision.
this understanding of the provision is imperfectly realized by the third circuit test as well.that test centers on identifying the zoning authorities regulatory purpose in adopting an ordinance that excludes a church.our concern is not that the provision as drafted by congress omits the term regulatory purpose or some cognate term.as we explained,equality is a complex concept.the fact that two land uses share a dictionary definition does make them equal within the meaning of a statute.but the use of regulatory purpose as a guide to interpretation invites speculation concerning the reason behind exclusion of churches invites testimony by zoning officials and hired expert witnesses facilitates zoning classifications thinly disguised as neutral but actually systematically unfavorable to churches as by favoring public reading rooms over other forms of nonprofit assembly and makes the meaning of equal terms in a federal statute depend on the intentions of local government officials.midrash sephardi,town of surfside,supra,at.
that was our point in digrugilliers consolidated city of indianapolis,supra,at,when we rejected the argument that a city could exclude churches from districts zoned residential by ordaining that a residential use of land does not include the grazing of sheep but a religious use does,and therefore the federal act does not require the city to permit churches in residential zones,as to do so would give churches more rights than the other users of land in those zones have.such an effect defining religious assembly or institution as a church plus a sheep be bootstrapping.
the problems that we have identified with the third circuit test can be solved by a shift of focus from regulatory purpose to accepted zoning criteria.the shift is not merely semantic.purpose is subjective and manipulable,so asking about regulatory purpose might result in giving local officials a free hand in answering the question equal with respect to what regulatory criteria are it is federal judges who will apply the criteria to resolve the issue.
so let us consider those criteria,noting by way of background that originally zoning was cumulative that is,higher uses,such as residential land uses,were permitted in districts in which lower uses,such as manufacturing,were permitted,though the lower uses were excluded from districts zoned for the higher ones.cumulative zoning soon gave way to noncumulative or exclusive zoning,in which specified land uses were confined to specified districts and thus could be and often were separated.see,state ex rel.berndt iten,mcdonough apton,grubel maclaughlin,daniel mandelker,land use law ed.as explained in people ex rel.skokie town house builders,village of morton grove,the dangers of heavy traffic are greater in mixed or districts than in districts devoted to just one purpose.industrial and commercial districts are not good places to bring up families from a health standpoint and the presence of children in and about industrial and commercial districts leads to a demand for school,park and facilities in an area where there is either no land available or the land available is to such uses.in short,whether industry and commerce are excluded from the residential areas,or residences from industrial and commercial areas,it is not unreasonable for a legislative body to assume that separation of the areas would tend in the long run to insure a better and a more economical use of municipal services,such as schools,providing police protection,preventing and fighting fires,and better use of street facilities.the general welfare of the public may be enhanced if industry and commerce are provided with a favorable climate.the sale of a few lots at important points in a district may make industrial or commercial expansion impossible or prohibitively expensive.to protect the residents in the district,traffic may be slowed down unduly and thus detract from the efficiency of production and trade.in final analysis,it seems clear that industry and commerce are also necessary and desirable and that a proper environment for them will promote the general welfare of the public.
or as patricia salkin,american law of zoning ed,explains with specific reference to commercial districts all commercial uses are not created equal.some require pedestrian traffic others create hazards for pedestrian traffic.some commercial uses cause pedestrian traffic during the daylight hours others operate at night and are quiet in the daytime.the list of characteristics could be extended,but this small sample suggests that residential uses in commercial neighborhoods will injure,as well as be injured by,the adjacent commercial uses.and it suggests further that some commercial uses will be incompatible with others the most common drafting answer to the problems sketched above is the exclusive zoning ordinance districts are established for named uses,or groups of uses,and all others are excluded.the chief virtue of such ordinances is that they create districts for commerce and industry,and exclude from such districts residential and other uses which are capable of interfering with the planned use of land.
and in like vein we read in harry madsen,noncumulative zoning in illinois,that if municipalities wish to retain their commercial and industrial tax plums they must compete with the advantages to be gained in the wide open spaces where the flow freely.commerce and industry must be recognized for what they are,necessary and desirable elements of the community m uch of the exodus of commerce and industry would be checked by reasonable security that an already bad situation would not get worse.the noncumulative zoning ordinance is peculiarly well suited to provide this security.
exclusion of churches from a commercial zone though generally not from every commercial zone in the municipality,along with other noncommercial assemblies,such as exhibition halls,clubs,and homeless shelters,is thus not unique to the village of hazel crest.see,fairfield,california municipal code,art.i,a,tab.village of lincolnwood,illinois zoning code tab,skokie,illinoiszoningordinance,ch,app.a,north beach,maryland zoning ordinance,art.iii,tab,all visited may.
a reader might worry that commercial is a synonym for secular.it is not.there are many secular noncommercial land uses,and if the village of hazel crest were concerned for example about the sufficiency of parking space in some part of the village,the commercial or noncommercial character of land uses that generated similar vehicular traffic flows would be irrelevant.suppose maintenance of regular as opposed to sporadic and concentrated vehicular traffic were the zoning objective.from that standpoint,a church is more like a movie theater,which also generates groups of people coming and going at the same time,than like a public library,which generates a smoother flow of traffic throughout the day.the provision would therefore require the zoning authorities to allow the church in the zone with the movie theater because the church was more like the use the movie theater than the use the public library.
parking space and traffic control are not the only concerns of regulation.another is generating municipal revenue and providing ample and convenient shopping for residents,and can be promoted by setting aside some land for commercial uses only,which generate tax revenues.hazel crest has therefore created a commercial district that excludes churches along with community centers,meeting halls,and libraries because these secular assemblies,like churches,do not generate significant taxable revenue or offer shopping opportunities.see robert ellickson vicki been,land use controls cases and materials ed.similar assemblies are being treated the same.the permitted land use that is most like the plaintiff is a commercial gymnasium,and that not close enough because a commercial assembly belongs in an district and a noncommercial assembly,secular or religious,does not.
of course we ca be certain,or even confident,that a particular zoning decision was actually motivated by a concern that is neutral from the standpoint of religion.but if religious and secular land uses that are treated the same such as the noncommercial religious and secular land uses in the zoning district that river of life wants to have its church in from the standpoint of an accepted zoning criterion,such as commercial district,or residential district,or industrial district,that is enough to rebut an claim and thus,in this case,to show that river of life is unlikely to prevail in a full litigation.another section of the c,which provides that no church services may be conducted in any building designed for a business use appears not to be at issue.
indeed,this case is straightforward because,after the amendment to its zoning ordinance,hazel crest really was applying conventional criteria for commercial zoning in banning noncommercial land uses from a part of the village suitable for a commercial district because of proximity to the train station.we are likely to have cases in the future challenging zoning ordinances that are harder to classify,as variances and permits and grandfathered nonconforming uses blur the character of particular zoning districts.but should a municipality create what purports to be a pure commercial district and then allow other uses,a church would have an easy victory if the municipality kept it out.
if the test we are adopting seems less than airtight,bear in mind that the provision is not the only or even the most important protection against religious discrimination by zoning authorities.think of the religious clauses of the first amendment.it is not even the only protection in the religious land use and institutionalized persons act.for the act provides that a regulation that imposes a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a religious assembly or institution is unlawful unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.a see world outreach conference center city of chicago,cir sts.constantine helen greek orthodox church,city of new berlin,supra,at westchester day school village of mamaroneck,cir.and it further provides that no government shall impose or implement a land use regulation in a manner that discriminates against any assembly or institution on the basis of religion or religious denomination,b see church of the lukumi babalu aye,city of hialeah,bloch frischholz,cir en banc,or that totally excludes religious assemblies from a jurisdiction.b a.but as none of these other provisions is before us on this appeal,the appeal must fail.
i join the majority opinion,as well as the concurrence of judge williams,but offer these comments with respect to the relation of the proposed test to the third circuit test,which is arguably more subjective.as a general matter,the provision seems to be a somewhat mysterious and unprecedented device for providing an requirement,without incorporating the usual limiting characteristics of discrimination as a traditional concept.although congress may have intended to prescribe a standard more than traditional discrimination,its application,as a practical matter,requires,for reasons suggested by the majority,some limitations to be provided by the judiciary.the third circuit requisite of regulatory purpose may be imperfect,but i think it is acceptable in the vast majority of cases and that this test is generally appropriate.although the majority opinion does provide insights that are important and helpful,i see little real contrast in basic approach or result between the third circuit and the majority analysis and i would regard them both as equally valid.ultimately,i suspect that the practical distinction between regulatory purpose and regulatory criteria may not be as pronounced as the majority opinion suggests.in the last analysis,the search by the different circuits for an entirely objective test is probably in vain.
this case is difficult not because of the facts,but because of the hypotheticals.i agree with the court that under the facts of this case,river of life does not have a likelihood of success on the merits of its equal terms challenge.to be treated on less than equal terms a church must be equal to a assembly allowed under the zoning ordinance.at this point,river of life church is not equivalent to any of the allowable uses in hazel crest commercial district 
the challenge before our court is crafting a standard for analyzing all of the hypothetical equal terms cases yet to come.the difficulty in this task is highlighted by the fact that the court agrees with the outcomes of the third and eleventh circuit decisions in this area,but finds neither circuit approach entirely satisfactory although the court also believes that,in application,the different standards might yield similar or even identical results.opinion at.judge sykes in her dissent foresees other problems with this court standard.while i disagree with judge sykes conclusion that river of life was treated on less than equal terms of other assemblies,her dissent persuasively identifies potential flaws with the court standard,given the statutory text and historical and legislative background to the religious land use and institutionalized persons act.even the court acknowledges that the test is not air tight and that future zoning cases will be harder to classify.opinion at.given that the facts of this case do not lay a solid foundation for crafting a universally governing standard,it might be more prudent to resolve the straightforward case before us rather than speculating on how to resolve a more difficult question in a future case.
more discomforting is the court observation that if religious beliefs excused an individual from compliance with otherwise valid regulations,this might be deemed favoritism to religion and thus violate the establishment clause,and the court further statement that a subtler objection to the eleventh circuit test is that it may be too friendly to religious land uses,unduly limiting municipal regulation and maybe even violating the first amendment prohibition against establishment of religion by discriminating in favor of religious land uses.opinion at.only dicta supports this statement.sts.constantine helen greek orthodox church,city of new berlin,cir.in turn,sts.constantine cites dicta from westchester day sch.village of mamaroneck,cir.and westchester day dicta relies solely on justice stevens concurrence in city of boerne flores,stevens,concurring.another supreme court concurrence,however,supports the view that the government may grant exemptions to religious observers without violating the establishment clause.wallace jaffree,concurring even where the free exercise clause does not compel the government to grant an exemption,the court has suggested that the government in some circumstances may voluntarily choose to exempt religious observers without violating the establishment clause.see,gillette united states,d braunfeld brown,d.because there is no need to delve into this complicated question and one which was not briefed to resolve the case at hand,we should not imply that religious exemptions violate the establishment clause.
for these reasons,i concur.
i join the majority in reaffirming that river of life is not entitled to a preliminary injunction,and i also join judge cudahy concurrence.i write separately to reiterate my belief that the third circuit regulatory purpose test adopted by the original panel is the most appropriate application of the provision.
the original panel applied the third circuit approach from lighthouse institute for evangelism,city of long branch,cir,reasoning that differentiation between religious and assemblies under a zoning ordinance was insufficient to establish an violation unless the assemblies had a comparable effect on the village regulatory purpose.thus,the question was simply whether the different treatment of a religious assembly and a assembly was consistent with the zoning ordinance regulatory purpose.here,the village regulatory purpose in establishing the commercial zone was to create a tax commercial district centered near the mass transit area because the church was not similar to the entities permitted in the of which were commercial in panel found that the church had not been treated on less than equal terms with the commercial entities.
i have great respect for the majority attempt to carve out a compromise between the eleventh circuit approach and that of the third circuit and original panel.however,i still think the regulatory purpose test is the best approach.the regulatory purpose test is simpler and does not require federal judges to determine which zoning districts fit within accepted regulatory criteria and indeed,what those accepted criteria are in the first place.moreover,the majority opinion is unclear as to how a judge should proceed with its analysis when presented with a unique,zoning scheme.second,to the extent that traditional zoning classifications are important,a judge assessing a regulatory purpose already uses them as guidance.finally,the majority approach does not solve the problem it perceives in the third circuit approach.zoning officials could just as easily use accepted criteria as a pretext for action as they could articulate a regulatory purpose.the accepted regulatory criteria test therefore presents a risk of testimony just as the majority believes the regulatory purpose approach would.
this is an important case.we took it en banc to decide a key question of statutory interpretation involving b of the religious land use and institutionalized persons act of rluipa,b the statute equal terms to resolve a conflict the panel opinion created in our caselaw.
the circuits are divided over how to read this part of rluipa.until this case we had followed the eleventh circuit interpretation of the provision,first announced in midrash sephardi,town of surfside,cir,and explained in konikov orange county,cir,and primera iglesia bautista hispana of boca raton,broward county,cir.see digrugilliers consolidated city of indianapolis,cir vision church vill.of long grove,cir.the en banc court now prefers the third circuit approach,announced in lighthouse institute for evangelism,city of long branch,cir,though in a slightly modified form.this interpretation departs from the text,structure,and history of rluipa,and the conflict in our circuit caselaw remains.with respect,i can not join the court opinion.we were right in vision church and digrugilliers to follow the eleventh circuit lead i would build on that start,with some elaboration.
the provision of rluipa is straightforward.it prohibits governments from imposing or implementing regulations in a manner that treats a religious assembly or institution on less than equal terms with a nonreligious assembly or institution.b.river of life kingdom ministries is a small evangelical christian church with a mission aimed at uplifting the disadvantaged.the church bought a building in the village of hazel crest,illinois,and sought to move from a rented warehouse in chicago heights to its new location in hazel crest.the property formerly housed a car wash and is in a struggling part of town known as hazel crest proper,which was zoned as a service business district under the village zoning ordinance.a wide variety of commercial and retail uses were permitted in this zone but not churches.
more specifically,the hazel crest zoning ordinance authorized a ll general commercial and retail uses in the district and also enumerated the following specific permitted uses art galleries automobile service stations establishments and laundries funeral parlors gymnasiums,health clubs,and salons hotels and motels laboratories medical and dental clinics meeting halls newspaper offices business,professional,and public offices resale or secondhand stores restaurants taverns or cocktail lounges and accessory uses to the foregoing permitted uses.in addition,the ordinance authorized certain special uses by permit in the district art galleries and museums centers schools of any kind public libraries parking lots and storage garages a variety of utility and buildings recreational buildings and community centers and taverns,cocktail lounges,and restaurants featuring live entertainment.the ordinance also specifically prohibited church services from being held in any business use building this restriction was applicable in all business districts in the village,including the district.
river of life applied for a permit to allow it to move its church from chicago heights to its property in hazel crest proper,but this application was denied.the church then sued hazel crest alleging a rluipa violation among other statutory and constitutional claims and moved for a preliminary injunction.in the meantime the village amended its zoning ordinance in an apparent effort to cure the rather obvious facial violation of rluipa provision the amended ordinance removed certain secular assemblies from the list of permitted and special uses authorized in the halls,art galleries,museums,schools,libraries,recreational buildings,community centers,and certain other secular assembly continued to expressly permit commercial gymnasiums,health clubs,and salons hotels and motels restaurants and taverns and centers as an allowed special use.river of life maintains that these remaining permitted uses are nonreligious assemblies within the meaning of b of rluipa,and that allowing these uses in the district while excluding churches like river of life treats religious assemblies on less than equal terms than a nonreligious assembly or institution in violation of rluipa.
the district court denied river of life motion for a preliminary injunction.relying on our decisions in vision church and digrugilliers,the court followed the eleventh circuit interpretation of b and concluded that river of life had a slight likelihood of success on the merits.but the court also held that this slight likelihood was not enough to tip the balance of harms in the church favor.river of life appealed.a panel of this court abandoned the eleventh circuit interpretation of the approved in vision church and instead adopted that of the third circuit in lighthouse institute.we ordered rehearing en banc to address this shift in circuit caselaw and because the interpretation of the provision is an important and recurring legal issue that has divided the circuits and warranted the attention of the full court.
the provision is best understood not in isolation but in the context of rluipa other protections for religious land uses and against the backdrop of the tug of war between congress and the supreme court over the protection of religious liberty.see cutter wilkinson,rluipa is the latest of congressional efforts to accord religious exercise heightened protection from burdens,consistent with this court precedents.rluipa was enacted in the wake of city of boerne.flores,which invalidated the broader religious freedom restoration act of rfra,et,as exceeding congress authority under of the fourteenth amendment to enforce the limits on state power imposed by of the amendment,see also sts.constantine helen greek orthodox church,city of new berlin,cir.rfra,in turn,had been adopted in response to the supreme court decision in employment division smith,which altered the prevailing standard of sherbert verner,applicable to laws that substantially burden the first amendment right to the free exercise of religion.see city of boerne,at congress enacted rfra in direct response to the court decision in employment,of human resources of oregon smith.citation omitted.
smith held that facially neutral and generally applicable laws that burden rights need not satisfy a heightened standard of the standard of sherbert nor any more rigorous form of review than the test for basic rationality that is applicable to all laws.at.three years later,the court clarified that f acial neutrality alone is not determinative official action that targets religious conduct for distinctive treatment can not be shielded by mere compliance with the requirement of facial neutrality.church of the lukumi babalu aye,city of hialeah.without retreating from smith,the court held in lukumi that a facially neutral,generally applicable law is subject to strict scrutiny if it amounts to a religious gerrymander or is enforced in a way that discriminates against religion or targets a particular religious group or practice for discriminatory treatment.id.at see also bloch frischholz,cir en banc.of course it remains true that the minimum requirement of neutrality is that a law not discriminate on its face.lukumi,at.finally,the court reiterated in lukumi that a law permitting individualized governmental assessment of the reasons for the relevant conduct is not considered generally applicable.id.at quoting smith,at.in a regulatory system where exemptions from otherwise applicable rules are permitted,denying a exemption requires a compelling justification.id.
while the lukumi case was making its way to the supreme court,congress was considering legislation in response to the court decision in smith rfra was enacted soon after the court decision in lukumi was announced.rfra restored the standard of sherbert and applied broadly to all governmental actions that substantially burdened rights.see city of boerne,at.in city of boerne,however,the supreme court invalidated the new statute as exceeding congress enforcement power.the court drew a distinction between laws that remedy or prevent constitutional violations and laws that attempt to determine what constitutes a constitutional violation.id.at.only the former are valid uses of the enforcement power.id.laws enacted under,the court said,require a congruence and proportionality between the constitutional injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.id.at.based on the sheer breadth of the statute as well as the inadequacy of the legislative record supporting it,the court concluded that rfra is so out of proportion to a supposed remedial or preventive object that it can not be understood as responsive to,or designed to prevent,unconstitutional behavior.it appears,instead,to attempt a substantive change in constitutional protections.id.at.
so congress went back to the drawing board,narrowed its focus,and began compiling a legislative record of violations in two discrete areas laws affecting land use by religious organizations and laws affecting the religious exercise of institutionalized persons.rluipa was the result of this effort and was adopted in,three years after the court decided city of boerne for more on this history,see generally,sarah keeton campbell,note,restoring rluipa equal terms provision,duke,patricia salkin amy lavine,the genesis of rluipa and federalism evaluating the creation of a federal statutory right and its impact on local government,urb.law,roman storzer anthony picarello,the religious land use and institutionalized persons act of a constitutional response to unconstitutional zoning practices,geo.mason,douglas laycock,state rfras and land use regulation,davis.
rluipa stipulates that the use of real property for religious purposes is a form of religious exercise,see b t he use,building,or conversion of real property for the purpose of religious exercise shall be considered to be religious exercise of the person or entity that uses or intends to use the property for that purpose,and codifies several strands of first amendment jurisprudence.see world outreach conference ctr.united states,cir see also cong.rec.joint statement of hatch and kennedy the right to build,buy,or rent in a physical space is an indispensable adjunct of the core first amendment right to assemble for religious purposes each of rluipa subsection s closely tracks the legal standards in one or more supreme court opinions,codifying those standards for greater visibility and easier enforceability.
more specifically,rluipa provision recognizes that regulation can interfere with rights in a variety of ways and creates statutory remedies for several different kinds of wrongs 
protection of land use as religious exercise 
a substantial burdens 
general rule 
no government shall impose or implement a land use regulation in a manner that imposes a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person,including a religious assembly or institution,unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person,assembly,or institution 
a is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and 
b is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.
b discrimination and exclusion 
equal terms 
no government shall impose or implement a land use regulation in a manner that treats a religious assembly or institution on less than equal terms with a nonreligious assembly or institution.
nondiscrimination 
no government shall impose or implement a land use regulation that discriminates against any assembly or institution on the basis of religion or religious denomination.
exclusion and limits 
no government shall impose or implement a land use regulation that 
a totally excludes religious assemblies from a jurisdiction or 
b unreasonably limits religious assemblies,institutions,or structures within a jurisdiction.
emphasis added.
subsection a of substantial burdens the free exercise clause right to be free from state action that substantially interferes with the practice of religion without compelling justification.this provision codifies the sherbert standard to the extent permitted by smith and lukumi.that is,where a regime permits individualized exemptions from regulatory almost all of them government must have a compelling justification for denying an exemption from a restriction that substantially burdens the exercise of religion.stated differently,a government that has a system for granting individual exemptions from a general rule must have a compelling reason to deny a religious group an exemption that is sought on the basis of hardship or,in the language of the act,of a substantial burden on religious exercise.world outreach,at quoting city of new berlin,at internal quotation marks omitted.
subsection b of enforces the free exercise clause right to be free from state action that discriminates on the basis of religion or religious practice,or discriminates among or between religions.the remedies provided in subsection b do not require proof that the challenged state action amounts to a substantial burden on religious exercise.this subsection is divided into three parts.subsection b is the provision,at issue here.it codifies a particular kind of equality principle no regulation may treat a religious assembly or institution on less than equal terms than a nonreligious assembly or institution.b.subsection b states a more general antidiscrimination rule it prohibits the imposition or implementation of a regulation that discriminates against an assembly or institution on the basis of religion or religious denomination.id.b.subsection b prohibits regulations that operate to totally exclude a religious assembly from and sustains congress use of its power.world outreach conference ctr.united states,cir.rluipa also expressly invokes the spending and commerce clause latter through the device of a jurisdictional element requiring that the burden in question affect interstate commerce.see id.at a a,b.we have not had occasion to consider the constitutionality of b of rluipa hazel crest does not challenge its constitutionality in this case.a jurisdiction or unreasonably limit a religious assembly,institution,or structure within a jurisdiction.id.b a,b.
there is some obvious overlap in these statutory provisions.a regulation that totally excludes a religious assembly from a jurisdiction in violation of subsection b will also likely be a substantial burden on the religious assembly in violation of subsection a.a substantial burden on a religious assembly might also be discriminatory in violation of subsection b.but each of rluipa subsections captures a distinct kind of harm and must be given its own force and effect.see.bank germain,redundancies across statutes are not unusual events in drafting,and so long as there is no positive repugnancy between two laws,a court must give effect to both.internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also city of new berlin,at civil liberties for urban believers city of chicago,cir rluipa provisions are operatively independent of one another.
the provision appears first in rluipa list of remedies for d iscrimination and exclusion but is not phrased as a general antidiscrimination rule.rluipa has one of those b contains general antidiscrimination language prohibiting governments from imposing or implementing any regulation that discriminates against any assembly or institution on the basis of religion or religious denomination.emphasis added.the language of the provision is different it prohibits governments from imposing or implementing a regulation in a manner that treats a religious assembly or institution on less than equal terms with a nonreligious assembly or institution.b emphasis added.this language is plain.to prove an violation,a plaintiff religious assembly or institution need only establish that the challenged regulation treats it on less than equal terms with a nonreligious assembly or institution.there is no requirement that the challenged regulation or the regulatory authority that adopted or enforced it have a discriminatory purpose or motive or evince antireligious bias.this contrasts with the antidiscrimination provision contained in b,which targets regulations that discriminate on the basis of religion.emphasis added.accordingly,a regulation that on its face or in its operative effect or application treats a religious assembly or institution less well than a nonreligious assembly or institution will violate the provision even if it was adopted or implemented for reasons unrelated to religious discrimination.
the eleventh circuit was the first to consider the scope of the provision and has the most extensive body of caselaw interpreting and applying this part of rluipa.in midrash sephardi the eleventh circuit held that although the provision has the feel of an equal protection law,it lacks the similarly situated requirement usually found in equal protection analysis.at.accordingly,the court declined to import a similarly situated comparator requirement into rluipa analysis.instead,the court said,the provision has a more direct and narrow focus and by its terms requires the court to evaluate whether the challenged regulation treats a religious assembly or institution on less than equal terms than a assembly or institution.id.at.because rluipa does not define assembly or institution,the court consulted dictionary definitions and concluded that a natural and ordinary understanding of assembly i s a group gathered for a common purpose.id.at.the zoning ordinance at issue in midrash sephardi permitted private clubs and lodge halls in the municipality business district but excluded churches and synagogues.because private clubs and lodge halls were commonly understood as secular assemblies and were permitted in the zone while churches and synagogues were excluded,the midrash sephardi court concluded that the challenged ordinance facially violated the provision.id.
the court took the analysis a step further,however,and applied strict scrutiny to the statutory violation.rluipa equal terms provision codifies the smithlukumi line of precedent,the court reasoned,so a violation of b equal treatment provision,consistent with the analysis employed in lukumi,must undergo strict scrutiny.id.at.the municipality proffered justification for excluding churches and synagogues from the business interests of retail synergy flunked the test.id.at.the eleventh circuit completed its analysis in midrash sephardi by considering whether the provision was a permissible use of congress enforcement power as understood in city of boerne.the court concluded that it was,largely because the provision codified the supreme court free exercise clause jurisprudence.id.at holding that b reflects jurisprudence and is consistent with existing equal protection and establishment clause caselaw.
in two subsequent cases,the eleventh circuit elaborated on midrash sephardi and adapted its analysis to as applied challenges under the provision.see primera iglesia,at konikov,at.primera more recent of the two this summary of the circuit approach to rluipa cases 
based on a review of our case law construing the equal terms provision and reviewing closely related supreme court precedent arising under the free exercise clause of the first amendment,we can discern at least three distinct kinds of equal terms statutory violations a statute that facially differentiates between religious and nonreligious assemblies or institutions a facially neutral statute that is nevertheless gerrymandered to place a burden solely on religious,as opposed to nonreligious,assemblies or institutions or a truly neutral statute that is selectively enforced against religious,as opposed to nonreligious assemblies or institutions.
at.in the first two types of claims,the provision focuses on the content of the challenged regulation to determine whether it expressly treats a religious assembly or institution on less than equal terms than a nonreligious assembly or institution,or was gerrymandered so that its unequal effect falls almost entirely on a religious assembly or institution,as in lukumi.id.at.in an selective enforcement claim,however,the court held that an plaintiff will generally be required to identify a similarly situated nonreligious assembly or institution that was treated more favorably.id.at konikov,at.
we have cited midrash sephardi,konikov,and primera iglesia with approval and specifically followed the eleventh circuit approach in two prior cases.see digrugilliers,f d at vision church,at.the claimant in vision church maintained among other statutory and constitutional claims that a permit requirement in a local zoning ordinance violated rluipa provision.to resolve this claim,we relied on the eleventh circuit decision in konikov,noting first that as a general matter,there was no need to identify a similarly situated nonreligious land use for comparison against the religious claimant.for purposes of a rluipa equal terms challenge,the standard for determining whether it is proper to compare a religious group to a nonreligious group is not whether one is similarly situated to the other,as in our familiar equal protection jurisprudence.vision church,f d at quoting konikov,at.we looked instead to the text of the provision to find the relevant comparison t he pertinent question is whether the land use regulation treats a religious assembly or institution on less than equal terms with a nonreligious assembly or institution.id.at.vision church then quoted at length from the passage in primera iglesia summarizing the three ways in which rluipa provision might be violated.id.quoting primera iglesia,at.because the permit requirement at issue in vision church was facially neutral,did not target religion through religious gerrymandering,and had not been selectively enforced against the claimant church,there was no violation.id.
digrugilliers built on vision church and is very much like this case.in digrugilliers a municipal zoning ordinance excluded churches from a commercial district but permitted a variety of other secular assemblies,including auditoriums,assembly halls,community centers,senior centers,centers,art galleries,civic clubs,and libraries.at.a baptist minister sued,claiming an violation,and like river of life,moved for a preliminary injunction.the district court denied the motion and the minister appealed.like the village of hazel crest here,the municipality in digrugilliers argued that the exclusion of churches from the commercial district was justified because churches would inhibit commercial development within the zone.as additional support for this argument,the municipality noted that state law prohibited the sale of alcohol or pornography within and feet,respectively,of a church.we reversed,relying on vision church and the eleventh circuit decisions in primera iglesia and midrash sephardi.id.at.we focused not on the objectives of the municipality but on the ordinance facial differentiation between religious and nonreligious assemblies,and dismissed the municipality reliance on state laws protecting churches from incompatible adjacent land uses.we said government can not,by granting churches special privileges the right of a church to be free from offensive land uses in its vicinity,furnish the reason for excluding churches from otherwise suitable districts.id.we concluded in digrugilliers that the minister claim had at least some,and possibly great,merit,id.at,and remanded for application of the remaining criteria.
after our decisions in vision church and digrugilliers,the third circuit weighed in on the provision,disagreeing with the eleventh circuit and requiring all plaintiffs to identify a similarly situated nonreligious assembly or institution for comparison the similarity between the claimant and the comparator,moreover,was to be evaluated by reference to the purpose of the regulation.more specifically,in lighthouse institute a divided third circuit panel held that a land use regulation will violate the equal terms provision only if it treats religious assemblies or institutions less well than secular assemblies or institutions that are similarly situated as to the regulatory purpose.at.
my colleagues change course from our previous adherence to the eleventh circuit interpretation of the provision,though they do so while leaving digrugilliers and vision church in place the en banc court adopts the third circuit approach,albeit with a slight shift of focus.majority op.at.i think this is a mistake.the third circuit interpretation departs from the text of the provision and from the structure of rluipa provisions read as a whole.it conflates the specific protections contained in the provision with the more general antidiscrimination rule contained in subsection b.on the third circuit understanding,there is no difference in the two provisions.see corley united states,o ne of the most basic interpretive canons is that a statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions,so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous,void or insignificant.internal quotation marks omitted.
tellingly,the lighthouse institute majority did not try to make an argument for its interpretation from the text and structure of the statute.instead,the court rested its holding on a reading of the supreme court particular,on smith and lukumi.at.these cases,the court held,call for a narrow interpretation of the provision,one that focuses on the negative effect of the religious land use on the zoning authority objectives.the third circuit thus requires an plaintiff to show that it was treated less well than a nonreligious comparator that had an equivalent negative impact on the aims of the regulation.id.at.my colleagues substitute accepted zoning criteria for regulatory aims or purposes,majority op.at,but otherwise the test is the same.this minor shift in focus changes nothing of significance.the distinction between accepted zoning criteria and the regulatory purpose of exclusionary zoning is nonexistent or too subtle to make any difference in individual cases.zoning decisions are always tied to accepted criteria.
regardless,under either formulation,the test dooms most,if not all,claims.zoning authorities will have little difficulty articulating their objectives in such a way as to prevent an excluded religious assembly from identifying a nonreligious comparator that has an equivalent negative effect on either the purpose or the criteria of the challenged regulation.routine economic development and can be characterized as regulatory purposes or accepted zoning criteria will immunize the exclusion of religious land uses from commercial,business,and industrial districts because religious assemblies do not advance these objectives and secular assemblies do.traffic control,density management,and objectives will tend to immunize the exclusion of religious land uses from residential districts because religious land uses may be inconsistent with these purposes or criteria in ways that secular assembly uses are not.indeed,the municipality very generic objectives in lighthouse create a retail main street and a modern district were sufficient to prevent the plaintiff church from meeting the third circuit similarly situated test id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the lighthouse institute majority thought its reading of the provision was required by smith and lukumi,but i disagree.there is no similarly situated requirement in the supreme court jurisprudence neither smith nor lukumi suggests a need to graft such a requirement onto the provision.as the eleventh circuit held in primera iglesia and we noted with approval in vision church,to the extent that rluipa provision parallels the supreme court jurisprudence,three kinds of violations are contemplated facial violations regulations that by their terms treat a religious assembly less well than a secular assembly religious gerrymanders facially neutral regulations designed or constructed to affect only religious assemblies or a particular religious practice and violations facially neutral regulations that are selectively enforced against religion or a particular religious practice.
this understanding is fully consistent with lukumi,we recently noted in our en banc decision in that smith standard is not necessarily the inquiry in free exercise clause cases.bloch,at.in some cases it might be a law that is not facially neutral and generally applicable is invalid unless justified by a compelling governmental interest.but even a facially neutral law of general applicability might be discriminatory in violation of the free exercise clause because of its design,operation,or effect,or in the manner in which it is enforced.that was the point of lukumi,as we recognized in bloch.accordingly,the neutrality inquiry starts with the text of the challenged law or regulation and proceeds from there to its operative effect,and finally,to its application.lukumi,at apart from the text,the effect of a law in its real operation is strong evidence of its object.if a law lacks neutrality or general
