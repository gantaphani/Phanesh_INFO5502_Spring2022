background 
in,as part of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,congress amended the federal sovereign immunities act fsia to create an exception to sovereign immunity for terrorist acts.see a providing that a foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the united states in any case in which money damages are sought against a foreign state for personal injury or death that was caused by an act of torture,extrajudicial killing,aircraft sabotage,hostage taking,or the provision of material support or resources.the exception applies only if the foreign state had been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism when the terrorist act occurred or was so designated as a result of the act that caused the injury.see a a.former secretary of state george schultz designated iran as a state sponsor of terrorism on january.
on december,members of the aforementioned hezbollah hijacked a kuwaiti airways aircraft bound for pakistan.one of the passengers on the plane was charles hegna,an american citizen employed by the united states agency for international development.the terrorists ultimately forced the pilot to land at iran tehran airport.thereafter,the terrorists fatally shot hegna and threw his body from the plane.
hegna wife and children brought suit against iran in april under a seeking compensation for his murder.the iranian government defendants did not appear,and in january the district court entered a default judgment in the amount of million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages.hegna islamic republic of iran,amended order and judgment.
until november,the hegnas had no means for enforcing the judgment against iran.at that time,congress enacted of the terrorism risk insurance act of tria,stat,codified at note.tria subjects a class of iran property in the united states to execution and attachment in aid of execution.section a of tria states 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,and except as provided in subsection b of this note,in every case in which a person has obtained a judgment against a terrorist party on a claim based upon an act of terrorism,or for which a terrorist party is not immune under section a of title,united states code,the blocked assets of that terrorist party including the blocked assets of any agency or instrumentality of that terrorist party shall be subject to execution or attachment in aid of execution in order to satisfy such judgment to the extent of any compensatory damages for which such terrorist party has been adjudged liable.
note.blocked asset is defined by tria as any asset seized or frozen by the united states under section b of the trading with the enemy act.b or under sections and of the international emergency economic powers act.tria d a.expressly excluded from the definition of a blocked asset is property subject to the vienna convention on consular relations that is being used exclusively for consular purposes.see tria d b.
five years prior to hegna murder,president carter had responded to the iran hostage crisis by issuing executive order pursuant to the international emergency economic powers act,et,blocking all property and interests in property of the government of iran subject to the jurisdiction of the united states.exec.order.despite executive order,the united states permitted iran to continue to occupy its diplomatic and consular properties until april,when the president severed diplomatic and consular relations with iran and ordered iranian diplomatic and consular officials to leave the united states.since that time,all of the iranian diplomatic and consular properties located in this country have been in the custody of the united states government pursuant to the united states obligation under article of the vienna convention on consular relations and article of the vienna convention on diplomatic relations to respect and protect the property of the consular and diplomatic posts following the severance of diplomatic relations.the properties have been maintained by the office of foreign missions of the united states department of state since pursuant to the foreign missions act,c 
invoking tria a,the hegnas sought to recover on their a judgment by executing against and attaching certain blocked properties of iran,including the chicago properties prior to the severance of consular relations between the united states in iran,the chicago properties had been used as residences by employees of the consulate of iran.the hegnas obtained writs of attachment on january,from the united states district court for the northern district of illinois seeking the levy and sale or turnover of the chicago properties iran did not appear to defend the action.
in addition to pursuing attachment and execution of the chicago properties in aid of execution of their judgment,the hegnas also pursued relief under the victims of trafficking and violence protection act vtvpa,a a,stat,amended by tria c.section authorized the secretary of the treasury to buy judgments from of iran and cuba.these payments by the united states were intended to provide an alternative to enforcing their a judgments against iran.vtvpa a provided the option of collecting either percent or percent of the amount of compensatory damages that they had been awarded on a a claim,in exchange for the relinquishment of certain rights to enforce their judgments.all who collected payment under had to relinquish all claims and rights to compensatory damages and amounts awarded as judicial sanctions.a b.additionally,those creditors who elected to collect percent of compensatory damages awarded were required to further relinquish all claims and rights to punitive damages awarded in connection with such claim.a c.lastly,those who elected to collect percent of compensatory damages awarded were required to relinquish all rights to execute against or attach property that is at issue in claims against the united states before an international tribunal a d.
as originally enacted,a a ii provided for payment to a limited group of,and at that time,the hegnas were not statutorily eligible for compensation.the tria amendments to expanded eligibility for payment to a of iran who had filed suit before october.see tria c amending vtvpa a a ii.the hegnas were thus eligible for payment.recognizing that the funds allocated for making payments under might be inadequate to cover the full amount of compensatory damages awarded to each of the newly eligible,tria c authorized partial payment to on a pro rata basis,to be calculated in proportion to the amount of compensatory damages awarded to each claimant.see tria c amending vtvpa d.in light of the possibility that these might collect only a pro rata payment,tria excused these from the preexisting vtvpa requirement that they forgo other attempts to collect compensatory damages owed on the judgment.see tria c amending vtvpa d.however,in exchange for receiving a pro rata payment in an amount less than the full amount of compensatory damages awarded,the newly eligible were required to relinquish their rights to collect punitive damages and to enforce their judgments against property that is at issue in claims against the united states before an international tribunal.see tria c amending vtvpa d a,b.
on or about march,the hegnas applied for payment under vtvpa a a ii,as amended by tria c.in doing so,they were required to submit documentation to the office of foreign assets control ofac of the department of treasury describing all ongoing attachment execution proceedings relating to the outstanding judgment.payments to persons who hold certain categories of judgments against cuba or iran,available at wl.as discussed above,the hegnas had obtained writs of attachment seeking the levy,sale,or turnover of the chicago properties two months prior to submitting their application,and they informed ofac of the pendency of those proceedings in their applications.additionally,the ofac application required the hegnas to submit the following disclosures regarding their statutory relinquishment of rights in the event of a pro rata payment 
in the event that the payment that i receive will be less than the full amount of compensatory damages awarded to me i hereby relinquish all rights and claims to punitive damages awarded in connection with the claim or claims i brought under a and all rights to execute against or attach property that is at issue in claims against the united states before an international tribunal or that is the subject of awards by such tribunal.i understand that the relinquishment that i make in the event of any pro rata distribution is irrevocable once the payment is credited to the bank account i have identified in this application 
while the hegnas applications for payment from ofac were pending,they continued to pursue relief through the attachment of the chicago properties.after the district court issued writs of attachment seeking the levy and sale or turnover of the chicago properties,the matter was referred to a magistrate judge.on april,shortly after applying for payment from ofac,the hegnas moved for a turnover order to obtain title to the properties.the united states appeared pursuant to and moved to quash the writs of attachment.the united states argued that the chicago properties were not subject to attachment under tria d b ii,because that section exempts from the definition of blocked asset property subject to the vienna convention on consular relations that is being used exclusively for consular purposes.
while the matter was pending before the magistrate judge,ofac responded to the hegnas applications for payment.in june,following the receipt of the hegnas applications and disclosures,richard newcomb,the director of ofac,sent a letter to them reiterating that their statutory relinquishment of rights would take effect on the date upon which ofac issues a pro rata payment.on or about july,the hegnas collected the first installment of their partial payment under vtvpa a few days later,on august,the magistrate judge recommended that the united states motion to quash the writs of attachment be denied,but the turnover order stayed pending resolution of hegna et snow.also on august,the united states filed a supplemental memorandum before the magistrate judge arguing that the hegnas had relinquished their rights to attach the chicago properties upon receipt of the vtvpa payments,by operation of the relinquishment provisions of the amended d.the united states urged that the chicago properties were at issue before an international tribunal,and that the hegnas receipt of vtvpa funds had therefore precluded them from attaching those properties in aid of execution of their a judgment.the district court agreed with the united states and dismissed the enforcement action on the ground that the hegnas had relinquished their rights to attach the chicago properties in aid of execution of their judgment.hegna islamic republic of iran,c,order dismissing enforcement action with prejudice.the district court quashed the writs of attachment on december,and this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
the hegnas challenge the district court order quashing the writs of attachment on the chicago properties,arguing that district court erred in concluding that the receipt of payment pursuant to vtvpa d as amended by tria c forced a relinquishment of their rights to pursue attachment remedies against the chicago properties.we review the district court determinations of law de novo.see hileman maze,cir.
the hegnas present several arguments in attempts to persuade this court that the statutory relinquishments have no application to their pursuit of the attachment and execution of the chicago properties.we begin with the hegnas argument that the application of the statutory relinquishments is solely prospective in nature.according to the hegnas,their,efforts to attach the chicago properties could not be defeated by their collection of payment on that date that is,they believe that,so long as they had begun the process of attaching property prior to the actual receipt of funds from the department of treasury,the receipt of those funds is irrelevant to the completion of the attachment and execution process.
the hegnas argument conflicts with the language of vtvpa a d,and for that reason,it must be rejected.the amended vtvpa d incorporates the requirement set forth in a d that an applicant relinquish all rights to execute against or attach property that is at issue in claims against the united states before an international tribunal see vtvpa d b,as amended by tria c emphasis added.the word all communicates that no right to execute or attach property survives the acceptance of payment,regardless of when the claimant initiated the attachment process.
however,the hegnas argue that their july acceptance of partial payment could not supercede their efforts to obtain the chicago properties because their interest in the properties had already been perfected by that time.citing federal rule of civil procedure a,the hegnas urge that illinois execution procedure governs the attachment and execution of the chicago properties.see.a directing that execution proceedings shall be in accordance with the practice and procedure of the state in which the district court is held.analogizing to illinois law of personal property,the hegnas argue that a lien is considered perfected as of the date of service of the citation.see cacok covington,cir.the hegnas urge that after the marshal returned the writs of attachment on january,the levy was complete,the chicago properties brought into the custody of the district court,and the levy was not subject to defeat by any subsequent events.
this theory must fail.despite the hegnas perfection of their interest in the chicago properties,no turnover order had issued their interest remained open to challenge while the motion for turnover was pending in the district court.see monroe partnership carlson,d.dist a citation lien remains subject to attack and modification until the turnover order.it is the turnover order which makes the lien irrevocable.in ruling on the hegnas motion to turnover the chicago properties,the district court was required by federal rule of civil procedure to enforce applicable federal law.see.providing that federal law is to govern execution proceedings to the extent that it is applicable.in this case,the relinquishments set forth in a d as amended by tria c were directly applicable,and those relinquishments required the defeat of the hegnas efforts to execute the chicago properties,regardless of the effect of the levy under illinois law.after the hegnas accepted partial payment under the amended,the ongoing attachment proceedings were rendered moot.
next,the hegnas argue that a d precludes only efforts to execute against or attach tribunal properties,but does not intend to preclude the sale or tur
