omni behavioral health omni appeals the district court order granting detective steven miller miller motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity,and dismissing omni fair housing act and section claims.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm.
background 
omni is a corporation that provides foster care services to wards of the state of nebraska.as part of this business,omni operated the woodlawn group home located in bellevue,nebraska.woodlawn provided housing and foster care to children pursuant to a contract with the nebraska department of health and human services ndhhs.the contract cancellation section provided that,
e ither party hereto may cancel this contract for any reason upon thirty days written notice to the other party.if it is determined that the contractor practices are harmful to the,abusive,contrary to department policy,the contract can be canceled immediately upon written notice.
detective miller is a police officer with the bellevue police department and for the past several years has specialized in investigating child abuse cases.he has extensive experience in this area.he developed the child abuse unit at the bellevue police department and has completed approximately three hundred hours of training regarding child abuse in the last nine years.from november to november,miller investigated eight allegations of abuse of residents at the woodlawn group home.in each instance,miller investigated the allegations of abuse after receiving reports from teachers,nurses,or woodlawn residents.
during the course of his investigation,miller arrested four woodlawn staff members for various charges arising from physical altercations with two different residents.charges against three of the staff members were ultimately dismissed and the fourth staff member was acquitted.the woodlawn staff members allege that they were harassed by miller because of their race.miller insists that he followed established protocol and acted in the best interests of the children.shortly after the arrests,the ndhhs provided omni with thirty days advance written notice that it was cancelling its contract with woodlawn.upon the cancellation of the contract,woodlawn ceased operations and shut down.
omni argues that miller investigation and arrests were discriminatory,unfounded,and resulted in the cancellation of its contract with the ndhhs.omni alleges that miller conduct violated omni rights under the fair housing act,et seq pursuant to,omni also alleges that miller conduct deprived omni of its right to equal protection and due process by engaging in a discriminatory campaign to shut down the woodlawn facility.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.wilson spain,cir.de novo review is also applicable where summary judgment is granted on the basis of qualified immunity.lambert city of dumas,cir.summary judgment is properly granted when,the record,when viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the party moving for summary judgment is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.greeno little blue valley sewer,cir.
section due process claim 
omni alleges that miller misused his position as a detective to carry out a campaign of harassment designed to close down the woodlawn facility.miller conduct,omni argues,violated the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment and it now seeks to recover civil damages from miller.section affords redress against a person who,under color of state law,deprives another person of any federal constitutional or statutory right.city of oklahoma city tuttle,d.but,public officials are entitled to qualified immunity and shielded from liability when their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.
t o withstand a motion for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds,a civil rights plaintiff must assert a violation of a constitutional right demonstrate that the alleged right is clearly established and raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether the official would have known that his alleged conduct would have violated plaintiff clearly established right.habiger city of fargo,cir.omni claim fails all three prongs of this test.
in order to survive summary judgment on this claim,omni must first establish that its due process rights were violated.to do this,omni must identify a protected liberty or property interest of which it was deprived by miller.in addition,the supreme court has held that,the due process clause is substantively violated by executive action only when the executive action can properly be characterized as arbitrary,or conscience shocking,in a constitutional sense.county of sacramento lewis,d quoting collins city of harker heights,d.omni asserts that it was deprived of a liberty interest because miller interfered with omni right to operate a legitimate business without unreasonable governmental interference.omni cites meyer nebraska.for the proposition that it has the right to engage in any of the common occupations of life.omni claims that because miller investigation led the ndhhs to cancel its contract with omni its occupational liberty interest was infringed upon.miller responds to this contention by claiming that this court en banc decision in singleton cecil,cir forecloses omni argument based on meyer because singleton held that there was no protected liberty interest in an individual employee government job.miller claims that omni contract with the ndhhs was terminable at will and,therefore,singleton requires the conclusion that omni does not have a protected liberty interest.
even if meyer and singleton can respectively and effectively be recruited for duty in this conflict,which we doubt,the cases do not determine the outcome of this litigation because we need not decide whether a protected liberty interest exists in an government contract.omni needs to demonstrate that miller conduct was arbitrary,or conscience shocking,in a constitutional sense.lewis,at.quoting collins,at,and it has failed to do so.
the supreme court has cautioned that the due process clause does not entail a body of constitutional law imposing liability whenever someone cloaked with state authority causes harm.lewis,at.lewis described the spectrum of conduct that can give rise to different types of liability and reasoned that constitutional liability requires egregious conduct on the part of a government official 
we have rejected the lowest common denominator of customary tort liability as any mark of sufficiently shocking conduct,and have held that the constitution does not guarantee due care on the part of state officials liability for negligently inflicted harm is categorically beneath the threshold of constitutional due process.it is,on the contrary,behavior at the other end of the culpability spectrum that would most probably support a substantive due process claim conduct intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government interest is the sort of official action most likely to rise to the level.

miller reports of child abuse at a foster care not approach the unconstitutional end of the culpability spectrum.miller investigated the woodlawn facility after reports of potential abuse were made to him by school officials or woodlawn residents.it is clearly reasonable that a detective specializing in child abuse investigations would investigate claims that children were being abused at a group home facility.in addition,diane martig,a protection and safety worker with ndhhs for over twelve years,accompanied miller on virtually all of his investigations and attested that she thought miller conduct was in line with standard investigative protocol.the only evidence omni presents regarding miller reasonableness is conclusory statements made by woodlawn employees who were convinced miller was out to undermine the facility.these allegations are not sufficient to raise a fact issue in the face of voluminous evidence that miller investigations were conducted in a professi
