petitioner,arkansas game and fish commission commission,owns and manages the dave donaldson black river wildlife management area management area or area,which comprises acres along the black river that are forested with multiple hardwood oak species and serve as a venue for recreation and hunting.in,the army corps of engineers corps constructed the clearwater dam dam upstream from the management area and adopted a plan known as the water control manual manual,which sets seasonally varying rates for the release of water from the dam.periodically from until,the corps,at the request of farmers,authorized deviations from the manual that extended flooding into the management area peak timber growing season.the commission objected to the deviations on the ground that they adversely impacted the management area,and opposed the corps proposal to make the temporary deviations part of the manual permanent plan.after testing the effect of the deviations,the corps abandoned the proposed manual revision and ceased its temporary deviations.
the commission sued the united states,alleging that the temporary deviations constituted a taking of property that entitled the commission to compensation.the commission maintained that the deviations caused sustained flooding during season,and that the cumulative impact of the flooding caused the destruction of timber in the area and a substantial change in the character of the terrain,necessitating costly reclamation measures.the court of federal claims judgment in favor of the commission was reversed by the federal circuit.the court of appeals acknowledged that temporary government action may give rise to a takings claim if permanent action of the same character would constitute a taking.it held,however,that flooding can give rise to a taking claim only if the flooding is permanent or inevitably recurring.the federal circuit understood this conclusion to be dictated by sanguinetti united states,and united states cress.
held flooding temporary in duration gains no automatic exemption from takings clause inspection.
a no magic formula enables a court to judge,in every case,whether a given government interference with property is a taking.this court has drawn some bright lines,but in the main,takings claims turn on factual inquiries.see penn central transp.new york city.
as to the question whether temporary flooding can ever give rise to a takings claim,this court has ruled that flooding,pumpelly green bay,wall,and seasonally recurring flooding,cress,at,can constitute takings.the court has also ruled that takings temporary in duration can be compensable,united states causby.this court precedent thus indicates that flooding of limited duration may be compensable.none of the court decisions authorizes a blanket exception to the court takings clause jurisprudence,and the court declines to create such an exception in this case.
b in advocating a exception,the government relies primarily on sanguinetti,which held that no taking occurred when a canal overflowed onto the claimant land.in its opinion,the court summarized prior flooding cases as standing for the proposition that in order to create an enforceable liability against the government,it is,at least,necessary that the overflow be the direct result of the structure,and constitute an actual,permanent invasion of the land.at.the government urges the court to extract from the quoted words a definitive rule that there can be no temporary taking caused by floods.but the court does not read the passing reference to permanence in sanguinetti as having done so much work.sanguinetti was decided in,well before the world war cases and first english evangelical lutheran church of glendale county of los angeles,in which the court first homed in on the matter of compensation for temporary takings.there is no suggestion in sanguinetti that flooding cases should be set apart from the mine run of takings claims.
the court thus finds no solid grounding in precedent for setting flooding apart from other government intrusions on property.and the government has presented no other persuasive reason to do so.its primary argument is that reversing the federal circuit decision risks disrupting public works dedicated to flood control.while the public interests here are important,they are not categorically different from the interests at stake in myriad other takings clause cases in which this court has rejected similar arguments when deployed to urge blanket exemptions from the fifth amendment instruction.
the government argues in the alternative that damage to downstream property,however foreseeable,is collateral or incidental it is not aimed at any particular landowner and therefore is not compensable under the takings clause.the court expresses no opinion on this claim,which was first tendered at oral argument and not aired in the courts below.for the same reason,the court declines to address the bearing,if any,of arkansas law on this case.
c when regulation or temporary physical invasion by government interferes with private property,time is a factor in determining the existence vel non of a compensable taking.see,loretto teleprompter manhattan catv.also relevant to the takings inquiry is the degree to which the invasion is intended or is the foreseeable result of authorized government action.see,john horstmann united states.so,too,are the character of the land at issue and the owner reasonable expectations regarding the land use,palazzolo rhode island,as well as the severity of the interference,see,penn central,at.in concluding that the flooding was foreseeable in this case,the court of federal claims noted the commission repeated complaints to the corps about the destructive impact of the successive planned deviations and determined that the interference with the commission property was severe.the government,however,challenged several of the trial court factfindings,including those relating to causation,foreseeability,substantiality,and the amount of damages.because the federal circuit rested its decision entirely on the temporary duration of the flooding,it did not address those challenges,which remain open for consideration on remand.

arkansas game and fish commission,petitioner united states 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court.
periodically from until,the army corps of engineers corps authorized flooding that extended into the peak growing season for timber on forest land owned and managed by petitioner,arkansas game and fish commission commission.cumulative in effect,the repeated flooding damaged or destroyed more than million board feet of timber and disrupted the ordinary use and enjoyment of the commission property.the commission sought compensation from the united states pursuant to the fifth amendment instruction n or shall private property be taken for public use,without just compensation.the question presented is whether a taking may occur,within the meaning of the takings clause,when flood invasions,although repetitive,are temporary.
ordinarily,this court decisions confirm,if government action would qualify as a taking when permanently continued,temporary actions of the same character may also qualify as a taking.in the instant case,the parties and the courts below divided on the appropriate classification of temporary flooding.reversing the judgment of the court of federal claims,which awarded compensation to the commission,the federal circuit held,to,that compensation may be sought only when flooding is a permanent or inevitably recurring condition,rather than an inherently temporary situation.we disagree and conclude that recurrent floodings,even if of finite duration,are not categorically exempt from takings clause liability.
the commission owns the dave donaldson black river wildlife management area management area or area,which comprises acres along both banks of the black river in northeast arkansas.the management area is forested with multiple hardwood timber species that support a variety of wildlife habitats.the commission operates the management area as a wildlife and hunting preserve,and also uses it as a timber resource,conducting regular harvests of timber as part of its efforts.three types of hardwood oak species nuttall,overcup,and willow account for percent of the trees in the management area.the presence of these hardwood oaks is essential to the area character as a habitat for migratory birds and as a venue for recreation and hunting.
the clearwater dam dam is located miles upstream from the management area.the corps constructed the dam in,and shortly thereafter adopted a plan known as the water control manual manual to determine the rates at which water would be released from the dam.the manual sets seasonally varying release rates,but permits planned deviations from the prescribed rates for agricultural,recreational,and other purposes.
in,the corps approved a planned deviation in response to requests from farmers.from september to december,the corps released water from the dam at a slower rate than usual,providing downstream farmers with a longer harvest time.as a result,more water than usual accumulated in clearwater lake behind the dam.to reduce the accumulation,the corps extended the period in which a high amount of water would be released.the commission maintained this extension yielded downstream flooding in the management area,above historical norms,during the season,which runs from april to october.if the corps had released the water more rapidly in the fall of,in accordance with the manual and with past practice,there would have been waves of flooding which would have receded quickly.the lower rate of release in the fall,however,extended the period of flooding well into the following spring and summer.while the deviation benefited farmers,it interfered with the management area season.
the corps adopted similar deviations each year from through.the record indicates that the decision to deviate from the manual was made independently in each year and that the amount of deviation varied over the span of years.nevertheless,the result was an unbroken string of annual deviations from the manual.each deviation lowered the rate at which water was released during the fall,which necessitated extension of the release period into the following spring and summer.during this span of years the corps proposed manual revisions that would have made its temporary deviations part of the permanent plan.on multiple occasions between and,the commission objected to the temporary deviations and opposed any permanent revision to the manual,on the ground that the departures from the traditional plan adversely impacted the management area.ultimately,the corps tested the effect of the deviations on the management area.it thereupon abandoned the proposal to permanently revise the manual and,in,ceased its temporary deviations.
in,the commission filed the instant lawsuit against the united states,claiming that the temporary deviations from the manual constituted a taking of property that entitled the commission to compensation.the commission maintained that the deviations caused sustained flooding of its land during the season.the cumulative impact of this flooding over a period between and,the commission alleged,resulted in the destruction of timber in the management area and a substantial change in the character of the terrain,which necessitated costly reclamation measures.following a trial,the court of federal claims ruled in favor of the commission and issued an opinion and order containing detailed findings of fact.fed.cl.
the court of federal claims found that the forests in the management area were healthy and flourishing before the flooding that occurred in the,and that the forests had been sustainably managed for decades under the plan contained in the manual,at.it further found that the commission repeatedly objected to the deviations from the manual and alerted the corps to the detrimental effect the longer period of flooding would have on the hardwood timber in the management area,at.
as found by the court of federal claims,the flooding caused by the deviations contrasted markedly with historical flooding patterns.between and,the river level near the management area reached six feet an average of days per year during the growing season the number of such days had been even lower on average before the clearwater dam was built.between and,however,the river reached the same level an average of days per year,an increase of more than percent over the historic average.although the management area lies in a floodplain,in no previously recorded time span did comparable flooding patterns occur,at.evidence at trial indicated that half of the nuttall oaks in the management area were saturated with water when the river level was at six feet,at the evidence further indicated that the saturation of the soil around the trees root systems could persist for weeks even after the flooding had receded,at.
the court concluded that the corps deviations caused six consecutive years of substantially increased flooding,which constituted an appropriation of the commission property,albeit a temporary rather than a permanent one.important to this conclusion,the court emphasized the deviations cumulative effect.the trees were subject to prolonged periods of flooding year after year,which reduced the oxygen level in the soil and considerably weakened the trees root systems.the repeated annual flooding for six years altered the character of the property to a much greater extent than would have been shown if the harm caused by one year of flooding were simply multiplied by six.when a moderate drought occurred in and,the trees did not have the root systems necessary to sustain themselves the result,in the court words,was catastrophic mortality.at.more than million board feet of timber were destroyed or degraded,at.
this damage altered the character of the management area.the destruction of the trees led to the invasion of undesirable plant species,making natural regeneration of the forests improbable in the absence of reclamation efforts,at.to determine the measure of just compensation,the court of federal claims calculated the value of the lost timber and the projected cost of the reclamation and awarded the commission million.
the federal circuit reversed.it acknowledged that in general,temporary government action may give rise to a takings claim if permanent action of the same character would constitute a taking.but it held that cases involving flooding and flowage easements are different.at.flooding can give rise to a taking claim,the federal circuit concluded,only if the flooding is permanent or inevitably recurring.at.the court of appeals understood this conclusion to be dictated by this court decisions in sanguinetti united states,and united states cress.we granted certiorari to resolve the question whether government actions that cause repeated floodings must be permanent or inevitably recurring to constitute a taking of property.
the takings clause is designed to bar government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which,in all fairness and justice,should be borne by the public as a whole.armstrong united states.see also first english evangelical lutheran church of glendale county of los angeles,penn central transp.new york city.and w hen the government physically takes possession of an interest in property for some public purpose,it has a categorical duty to compensate the former owner.preservation council,tahoe regional planning agency,citing united states pewee coal.these guides are fundamental in our takings clause jurisprudence.we have recognized,however,th
