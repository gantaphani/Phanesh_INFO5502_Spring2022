the facts viewed in the light most favorable to the fraudulent misrepresentation claim and punitive damages award are as follows.in re knickerbocker,cir.
the schooleys purchased their home in and observed no signs of termite activity until.after discovering evidence of termites in,they contacted orkin.an orkin representative inspected the home and told the schooleys the company treatment process would create a complete chemical barrier against termites and protect the home.the schooleys purchased orkin treatment package,including an annual renewable option for a limited lifetime retreatment guarantee which stated orkin guarantees that it will,at no extra cost,apply any necessary additional treatment to the premises if an infestation of the aforesaid wood infesting organism is found in the treated premises during the period this guarantee is in force.
the house was first treated in to establish the complete chemical barrier against termites.in,orkin conducted an annual inspection and found no termite activity.satisfied the problem was under control,the schooleys began a remodeling project which initially consisted of a multilevel deck attached to the back of the home.in,laurie discovered evidence of termite activity and contacted orkin.orkin sprayed the infested area and assured the schooleys the problem was under control.at trial,however,kent heinzman,a branch manager for orkin,testified the appearance of termite activity within two years of an initial application indicated the application had been inadequately applied or the chemical barrier had broken down.he testified the complete chemical barrier from the initial application would generally be expected to last between six to fourteen years.the schooleys testified orkin never provided this information to them.
in,the schooleys expected orkin to conduct an annual inspection in march or did not.in october,laurie again discovered evidence of termite activity in the same location of the house and called orkin.an inspector inspected the home and recommended a complete retreatment to his superiors instead of a spot retreatment.the recommended complete retreatment was not approved by the branch manager and a second spot retreatment was performed.
at trial,an orkin technician testified spot retreatments generally do not provide complete termite control.indeed,they can force termites from the treated area to untreated points of entry.conversely,an unbreached chemical barrier completely prevents termites from entering the home.the schooleys testified they were not told the inspector had recommended complete retreatment or that spot treatments could be ineffective in treating termite infestations.
prior to,the schooleys had observed evidence of termite activity only on the walls of the basement.in july,laurie noticed for the first time the termite activity had moved from the basement to the inside wall of the front porch,the east interior wall of the dining room,the main floor,and an internal stairway in the center of the home.orkin told the schooleys this was probably old damage,performed another spot retreatment,and in october pronounced the home termite free.
in,the schooleys embarked on an extensive remodeling project.before doing so,laurie called orkin for assurances the termite problem was under control.laurie described their remodeling plans and,after inspecting and applying additional chemical prophylactically,orkin advised the schooleys there was no termite activity.the schooleys spent approximately on the remodeling project which included,among other improvements,finishing the previously unfinished basement.
upon completion of the project in,laurie again noticed termite damage around the front porch.orkin sprayed the area and told laurie it was old damage.in,she observed pin holes in newly hung wallpaper and indentations in newly decorated walls.nonetheless,in september and february,orkin conducted annual inspections and reported no termite activity.
soon after the february inspection,laurie noticed termite damage to the basement floor which had been installed as part of the remodeling project.faced with proof of an obvious reinfestation,orkin inspector reported termite activity.she complained as to the spot retreatments obviously not working and expressed concern because they had extensively remodeled the home.the possibility of a complete retreatment,as suggested by orkin inspector in,was never discussed with the schooleys.instead,the company installed a bait monitoring system and advised the schooleys it would resolve the problem in no time.the schooleys testified they relied on the company representations of expertise in the field of termite control,believed the inspectors who said the various treatments would control the termite problem,and accepted its invitation to trust it to solve the termite problem.
despite orkin promise to monitor the bait stations monthly,there were several months when no one came to the home.in october,after waiting four months for an inspector,laurie discovered evidence of termites in the basement stairway.she called orkin and two days later the branch manager,heinzman,came to the home and left a written message stating one bait trap containing dead termites had been consumed and there was no further evidence of termite activity.at trial,heinzman admitted there are upwards of one million termites in any given colony,capable of infesting several homes at the same time.in other words,the presence of dead termites was no indication the infestation was under control.
in,orkin only inspected the home and bait stations when laurie called requesting an inspection.during,she observed no further evidence of termites and concluded the bait stations were working.in january,however,she noticed termite damage to the main floor in the center of the home and to the floor in the bathroom.she also discovered damage to the stairway wall leading from the main floor to the second floor.further examination revealed the wood flooring in the bathroom had been eaten by termites.once again,orkin assured her this was old damage but agreed to install a bait station in the bathroom.days later,wayne discovered evidence of active termites in the basement directly under the bathroom.orkin was contacted and representatives assured the schooleys the bait stations would solve the problem.
in march,after being called by the schooleys,and in april,orkin inspected the schooleys home and reported no activity.two days after the april inspection,laurie discovered obvious evidence of termites in three different locations in the basement.she called the inspector and asked why only two days earlier he had reported no activity.she was told i sorry.that what they told me to put.you what known as a problem house.
in june,the schooleys discovered additional and extensive termite damage to the main floor of the home.they undertook repairs of the damage and in the process observed active termites in the walls of the home.a videotape documenting the damage,repairs,and live termites was presented to the jury.
at this juncture,orkin chose to apply a different chemical to reestablish a complete chemical barrier.a month later it removed all the bait stations.laurie asked how they would be able to monitor termite activity without the stations and was told by the branch manager he was running a business and could not afford to send someone out every month to check for termites.in the fall of,the schooleys discontinued their relationship with orkin and hired a different termite control business.
orkin argues the district court erred by denying its jaml motion on the schooleys claim for fraudulent misrepresentation.orkin contends its representatives only predicted the treatments would be successful and there was no evidence orkin suspected otherwise or intended to deceive the schooleys.additionally,orkin argues there was no evidence the schooleys relied on any alleged misrepresentations.for example,when orkin inspector reported no termite activity in april,laurie conducted her own inspection and discovered termites.according to orkin,this proves the schooleys were not relying on its representations.it also denies the schooleys consulted with orkin prior to undertaking the remodeling project and therefore did not undertake the project based on assurances from orkin.
we review de novo the district court denial of judgment as a matter of law.arabian ag.servs.chief,cir.judgment as a matter of law is only appropriate where the evidence adduced at trial is entirely insufficient to support the verdict.id.in making this determination,we consider all evidence in the record without weighing credibility,and resolve conflicts and make all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.id.an inference is reasonable when it may be drawn from the evidence without resort to speculation.id.quoting fought hayes wheels int l,cir internal quotation marks omitted.

the evidence presented at trial shows orkin had reason to believe as early as the initial treatment had been ineffective because the complete chemical barrier,which would normally be effective for six to fourteen years,failed to prevent reinfestation.in,orkin inspector recommended a complete retreatment instead of further spot retreatments but the request was denied the evidence further reveals orkin did not advise the schooleys of these facts.nor were the schooleys advised spot retreatments could be ineffective.in,the schooleys discovered termite damage in parts of the home previously unaffected but were advised it was old damage.in,after consulting with orkin about a major remodeling project,orkin pronounced the home free of termites.within months of completing the project,and again in and,after orkin reported no termite activity,additional new evidence of an ongoing infestation was uncovered.it was not until,when damage was discovered in the newly remodeled basement,that orkin admitted to an ongoing problem.notably,the admission came on the heels of an inspector report finding no termite activity only two days earlier.
even after the discovery of termite activity in,orkin continued to downplay the seriousness of the problem and exaggerate the effectiveness of its treatments.it installed a bait monitoring system and assured the schooleys the problem would be solved quickly.instead of monitoring the system on a monthly basis as promised,orkin ignored the schooley home and generally conducted inspections only if asked.when it was discovered one of the bait traps had been completely consumed by termites,the schooleys were led to believe all the insects had been killed.finally,in,after repeated inspections,repeated treatments,and repeated discoveries of new termite damage,an orkin inspector told laurie he had been instructed to ignore obvious evidence of active termites.later,the branch manager told her he was running a business and could not afford to send inspectors to perform promised inspections.
orkin attacks the credibility of this evidence but does not argue that,if believed,it is insufficient to sustain a finding of fraudulent misrepresentation.because we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,orkin attempts to discredit the evidence must be disregarded.a fair reading of the evidence shows orkin,over a period of ten years,intentionally minimized the termite infestation and overstated its ability to control the problem.moreover,despite evidence early on indicating the initial treatment had not worked,orkin refused to approve a complete retreatment in lieu of less effective,less expensive alternatives.finally,orkin instructed its inspector to disregard evidence of an ongoing infestation and to falsify his inspection report.accordingly,we affirm the district court denial of orkin jaml motion of the fraudulent misrepresentation claim.
the schooleys argue the district court erred by granting orkin jaml motion on the issue of punitive damages.we agree.
under iowa law,a jury may award punitive damages if the plaintiff proves by a preponderance of clear,convincing,and satisfactory evidence that the defendant conduct amounted to a willful and wanton disregard for the rights of another.iowa code.punitive damages are appropriate in fraud cases when,in addition to fraud,there is some aggravating factor such as legal malice.state savings bank,iowa.to establish legal malice it need only be shown that wrongful or illegal conduct was committed or continued with a reckless disregard at another rights.id.quoting kimmel iowa realty,iowa.willful and wanton means the defendant intentionally committed an unreasonable act in disregard of a known or obvious risk so as to make it highly probable harm would follow,and which is usually accompanied by a conscious indifference to the consequences.fell kewanee farm equip,iowa quoting page keeton et,prosser keeton on torts,at.
at the end of the schooleys case and again before the case was submitted to the jury,the district court denied orkin jaml motion on punitive damages.once the jury awarded punitive damages,orkin renewed its motion and the court reconsidered and reversed the award.in so holding,the court reviewed evidence offered by the schooleys in support of their claim for punitive damages and concluded it did not constitute clear,convincing,and satisfactory evidence of willful or wanton conduct.
for example,the schooleys offered an estimate prepared by an orkin employee regarding the amount of chemical necessary to adequately perform the initial treatment.the estimate called for sixty gallons more of the chemical than was actually applied,and the schoo
