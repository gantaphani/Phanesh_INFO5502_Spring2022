east dubuque,illinois,is a small town on the mississippi river.one local company that has profited from the river proximity is iei barge services,iei.iei stores coal in an outdoor pile and loads it onto river barges.as the coal is moved around,coal dust is thrown off into the air.one of iei neighbors,charles mcevoy,objected to the coal dust from iei operations,because it was drifting into his home he filed suit in federal court.mcevoy concerns were shared by others in the area.kkl development,llc kkl,which owns commercial property in east dubuque,and vroom auto mall and rv plaza,vroom,which runs its business on kkl property,worried that the dust would accumulate on their inventory and would create a hazard for their employees.the companies filed their own lawsuit,which mirrored mcevoy.
law students and professors around the country might find this story familiar in a famous hypothetical,pollution emanating from a nearby factory sullies recently cleaned laundry drying on a clothesline.see,robert cooter thomas ulen,law economics ed guido calabresi douglas melamed,property rules,liability rules,and inalienability one view of the cathedral,harv.frank michelman,pollution as a tort a perspective on calabresi costs,yale.the facts offer a pedagogically useful vehicle for discussing how different legal rules can be used to internalize external costs.this appeal is not,however,about clean laundry or the proper allocation of costs.rather,it is about which legal tools are available to someone who wants to shift the cost of pollution to the polluter.we must consider whether the clean air act the act,et,supports a private right of action permitting neighbors adversely affected by this coal dust to enforce two illinois environmental regulations that iei allegedly violated.the district court concluded that the act provision does not support such an action.while we have no trouble recognizing why plaintiffs are seeking a remedy,we too conclude that the plaintiffs allegations fall outside the scope of the act.
in the,dubuque sand gravel began operations in east dubuque.in,the company was renamed iei it has conducted operations on the mississippi under that name ever since.iei works with bulk materials,including coal.the company receives the materials from train cars,and either immediately loads them onto river barges or stores them on its premises in east dubuque for later loading.according to the plaintiffs,all of iei activities release coal dust that is blown by the wind onto adjacent properties.
as we have mentioned,each of the plaintiffs has a stake in nearby property that is affected by the coal dust.mcevoy owns residential property.he alleged that he routinely observes coal dust crossing iei property line he shuts his doors and windows to prevent the dust from accumulating in his home.kkl owns commercial property,which it leases to vroom for use as a car and dealership.the companies alleged that coal dust is regularly deposited on the dealership inventory.they also worried that constant exposure to the coal dust would adversely affect employee health.
fed up with this situation,the plaintiffs repaired to federal court.mcevoy filed a complaint in april,and kkl and vroom followed in january.the complaints alleged theories of recovery under the provision of the act.see a.they also raised claims under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra,et,and,trespass,negligence,and nuisance.as described in further detail below,the act provides for citizen suits to enforce certain limits set by federal and state environmental laws.invoking this mechanism,the plaintiffs asserted that iei was violating five illinois environmental regulations.two of those regulations are at issue in this appeal.the first is section,entitled prohibition of air pollution,which provides 
no person shall cause or threaten or allow the discharge or emission of any contaminant into the environment in any state so as,either alone or in combination with contaminants from other sources,to cause or tend to cause air pollution in illinois,or so as to violate the provisions of this chapter,or so as to prevent the attainment or maintenance of any applicable ambient air quality standard.

no person shall cause or allow the emission of fugitive particulate matter from any process,including any material handling or storage activity,that is visible by an observer looking generally toward the zenith at a point beyond the property line of the source.

iei responded with motions for summary judgment in both cases it asked the court to find that the plaintiffs had failed to state a federal claim and then to dismiss the supplemental claims without prejudice.the district court did just that on september,granting iei motions for summary judgment.of particular relevance to this appeal,the district court concluded that the act did not provide a private right of action to enforce the two illinois regulations quoted above.the district court amended its judgment to comply with the federal rules on may,but the substantive decisions remained the same.
the plaintiffs appeal only from the district court judgment barring them from using the act to enforce illinois prohibition of air pollution and fugitive particular matter regulations.they do not challenge the district court disposition of the claims based on the other illinois regulations,nor have they complained about its decisions on their rcra and claims.we consolidated these appeals for our review.
the act brings together federal,state,and private resources for the purpose of protecting and enhancing the quality of the nation air.central among the tools that the act creates to effectuate these objectives are the national ambient air quality standards the naaqs,see id.the naaqs are set by the federal environmental protection agency the epa and further implemented through state implementation plans sips,see id.we apologize for this mess of alphabet soup,but these abbreviations are in such common use that it would only confuse to adopt anything more felicitous.sips are required if the state wants additional emission limitations they also establish the regime governing pollution permits.id.
setting standards is just the first step without effective enforcement those standards would be so many words on a piece of paper.the act authorizes the epa to enforce its provisions and implementing rules.in addition,the act includes a citizen suits provision,which provides that private citizens may bring civil actions in federal courts against,among others,violators of emission standards or limitations.id.a a.provisions in environmental laws empower individual persons to serve as private attorneys general and to enforce standards set at the federal or state level.the theory is that the efforts of these private parties will supplement governmental enforcement.
as we have already noted,mcevoy and his fellow plaintiffs have alleged that iei violated illinois prohibition of air pollution and fugitive particulate matter regulations.they identified the act provision as the source of their entitlement to seek a remedy for those alleged violations.this appeal asks us to look closely at the types of provisions that a citizen may enforce through the act.the plaintiffs invoked the act express right of action against any person who is alleged to have violated or to be in violation of a an emission standard or limitation under this chapter a a.one learns immediately from this language that the right to sue is tethered to the act definition of the phrase emission standard or limitation under this chapter.see id.f.paragraph f creates four categories of enforceable standards and limitations.the plaintiffs are relying on subparagraphs f and f,and so we reprint only those parts of the definition here.emission standards and limitations enforceable through a a include 
a schedule or timetable of compliance,emission limitation,standard of performance or emission standard,or 
any other standard,limitation,or schedule established under any permit issued pursuant to or under any applicable state implementation plan approved by the administrator,any permit term or condition,and any requirement to obtain a permit as a condition of operations,
which is in effect under this act including a requirement applicable by reason of or under an applicable implementation plan.
f.to establish a right of action,therefore,the plaintiffs must identify a regulation that qualifies as an emission standard or limitation as defined in subparagraphs and.we begin by examining what these subparagraphs tell us about the types of emission standards or limitations that are enforceable under the act,and then we consider whether the particular illinois regulations on which plaintiffs rely meet those criteria.
a plaintiff may sue to enforce a regulation if that regulation is a schedule or timetable of compliance,emission limitation,standard of performance or emission standard.f.we look to the definitions section of the act for the meaning of the key terms,including emission limitation,emission standard,standard of performance,and schedule and timetable of compliance.id.k,l p.
the plaintiffs take the position that because f is itself a definition,it trumps any other definitions provided in the statute,by which they seem to mean that when it came to this subsection,congress for some mysterious reason wanted its more precise definitions not to apply.pressing on,the plaintiffs argue that f is independent of.this does not make sense.there is nothing in the provision indicating that congress intended it to be insulated from the rest of the statute.in fact,congress said the opposite in the chapeau to the definitions section that introductory sentence begins by instructing readers that the definitions apply w hen used in this chapter.id.the provision is most certainly part of this chapter,and there is no language in the statute indicating that the definitions are not applicable.
the plaintiffs citations to first and fifth circuit decisions do not rescue their position.they rely on a footnote from a first circuit decision,conservation law foundation federal highway administration,cir suggesting the trumping theory,but that court has since applied the definitions section to f,see conservation law foundation busey,cir.the fifth circuit decision addressed f.see cleancoalition txu power,cir.subparagraph f unlike f uses terms that are not defined in,and so there is nothing strange about a conclusion that f to that extent stands on its own legs,while at the same time realizing that terms defined in retain those definitions when they appear in f.
we therefore proceed on the understanding that plaintiffs are bound to the statutory definitions,wherever the defined terms appear.their argument on appeal can thus be boiled down to the proposition that the illinois provisions constitute emission standards or emission limitations under k.they do not assert that iei has violated any standards of performance and schedules or timetables of compliance under l and p.accordingly,in order to prevail,they must identify an illinois regulation that establishes 
a requirement which limits the quantity,rate,or concentration of emissions of air pollutants on a continuous basis,including any requirement relating to the operation or maintenance of a source to assure continuous emission reduction,and any design,equipment,work practice or operational standard promulgated under this chapter.
k defining emission limitation and emission standard.
in addition to this general definition of emission standard or limitation under this chapter,there is a catchall provision in the act that allows citizens to sue to enforce 
any other standard,limitation,or schedule established under any permit issued pursuant to or under any applicable state implementation plan approved by the administrator,any permit term or condition,and any requirement to obtain a permit as a condition of operations 
f.plaintiffs seek to enforce both of the illinois regulations under this provision as well.
the question that perplexed the district court was whether a plaintiff is authorized to enforce standards and limitations found only in an sip through this provision.the key phrase for this purpose is under any applicable state implementation plan.the district court concluded that this text lends itself to two reasonable interpretations.under the first,the statute authorizes citizen enforcement of any other standard,limitation,or schedule established under any applicable state implementation plan,while under the narrower reading it would allow enforcement only of any other standard,limitation,or schedule established under any permit issued under any applicable state implementation plan.emphasis added.under the former view,a plaintiff is entitled to enforce all particular standards spelled out in an sip,while the latter view contemplates private enforcement only of standards,limitations,or schedules reiterated in a permit issued under an sip.the district court concluded that the language of the statute was ambiguous,but that other tools of statutory interpretation favored the latter option.since mcevoy and his fellow plaintiffs were not seeking to enforce a permit term,the district court concluded that their case had to be dismissed.
contrary to the district court,we find that the statute permits citizen enforcement of standards found in an sip,even if those standards are not repeated in a permit.we begin with the language of the statute.unlike the district court,we do not find the statute to be ambiguous.it can and should be read in the first way that the district court identified.looking again at the language,we see that citizens may sue to enforce standards under any permit or under any applicable state implementation plan f.that does not suggest that permits are always necessary to the contrary,it indicates that the state plans are an alternate legal basis for suit.the district court distinguished between permits issued pursuant to the statute and permits issued under an sip.but that disregards the fact that the advantage of cooperative enforced more generally through state plans.at least in states that have an approved sip,like illinois,there are no permits somehow issued directly under the act.the most natural grammatical reading also has the advantage of avoiding this tension with the overall statutory scheme.
since the district court found the statute ambiguous,it turned to legislative history,policy,and other decisions for assistance.we see no need to delve into the legislative history,but we will say a word about the court other concerns.
first,the district court thought that the plaintiffs reading of subparagraph f,under which they would be authorized to enforce any standard or limitation found in an sip,would render the more particularized definition from f redundant and superfluous.if subparagraph f applied to standards found in an sip that are not in a permit,it feared,then plaintiffs would never need to show that a particular regulation in an sip met the definition in.to avoid this problem,the district court limited f to suits about permits.but the district court reading of f and f failed to acknowledge the subtle differences between these two subparagraphs.recall that f defines the term emission standard or limitation under this chapter as a schedule or timetable of compliance,emission limitation,standard of performance or emission standard,and f is a catchall that sweeps in any other standard,limitation,or schedule established under any permit issued pursuant to the act or under any applicable state implementation plan there would have been no reason to include subpart f if congress wanted enforcement only of permit terms that is the specific topic of f,and may also overlap with f.we will not assume that congress had no purpose in mind for f.the fact that the different subparagraphs of f may overlap to a degree is no reason to reject the natural reading of a statute.congress may choose a approach to promote its policy objectives,and it appears that this is what it was doing when it added the broader provision to the statute through a later amendment.see clean air act amendments,adding subparagraph f to the existin
