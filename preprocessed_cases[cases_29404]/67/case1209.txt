background 
the city of chicago,through its city council,promulgates zoning ordinances governing where various entities may locate within the city.the portion of the chicago zoning ordinance czo at issue in this case,municipal code of chicago article,has already been the subject of litigation in civil liberties for urban believers city of chicago,cir,reh g en banc denied,wl.lexis.in that case,civil liberties for urban believers club and five individual member churches argued that the czo treatment of places of worship as compared to similar assembly uses was unconstitutional and violated the religious land use and institutionalized persons act rluipa,et.notably,the city amended the czo in february in response to club lawsuit.in doing so,it attempted to equalize the treatment of churches and other like organizations within its zoning scheme.for example,the city amended the czo to require clubs,lodges,meeting halls,recreation buildings,and community centers to obtain special use approval to locate within any b business or c commercial districts.this placed those assembly uses on the same footing as churches,which prior to and following the amendments also had to obtain special use permits to locate in any b or c district.club,at describing the city czo amendments.
even after the amendments,club continued to press that the czo failed to comply with rluipa by substantially burdening religious exercise and discriminating against churches.it also claimed that the czo violated the first and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution by prohibiting the free exercise of religion and denying churches equal protection under the law,among other challenges.in club,we upheld the czo under rluipa,finding that the february amendments did not substantially burden religious exercise and simply place churches on an equal footing with nonreligious assembly uses,thereby correcting any potential violation of rluipa nondiscrimination provision.id.at.
we also held that the czo,as amended in february,was constitutional.we discerned no violation of the free exercise clause,and we determined that the zoning scheme satisfied the requirements of the equal protection clause.as to the equal protection challenge,we found that any remaining differences in treatment between religious and nonreligious assembly uses after the february amendments were rationally related to chicago legitimate interest in regulating land use within its city limits.id.at.
the club court examined the czo amendments in their entirety,as introduced through ma mayoral application at the january,session of the city council zoning committee.was passed by the city council on february.it went into effect march,after the mayor had an opportunity to review the ordinance as passed and after publication in the city council journal of proceedings.
contained nine sections amending language in several different czo articles.the present matter deals only with the amendment to czo article,contained in of.it is before us because of an unfortunate wrinkle in the chicago city council efforts to enact.specifically,the version of the amended czo released to the public contained a misprint.instead of correctly representing that article,as amended,removed recreation buildings and community centers as permitted uses in m manufacturing districts the deletion,it continued to list them as allowed.the city council corrected the misprint,but not until two years later,in february.
although the parties in the club case noted the misprint in footnotes in their appellate briefs,it was not an issue before the club court.thus,our decision in that case,although finding the czo constitutional and in compliance with rluipa as of the february amendments,did not address the effect,if any,of the misprint on the enactment of the deletion.we must do so here,as explained below.
christ universal mission church purchased property in an m district in june.churches,unlike recreation buildings and community centers,have never been permitted uses in m districts,either before or after the february czo amendments.christ universal challenged the czo as unconstitutional and illegal under rluipa when it discovered that it could not operate in its chosen location without seeking a map amendment but that community centers could according to the published version of the czo christ universal sought a preliminary injunction to prevent the city from enforcing the czo prohibition on churches in m districts in this instance,which would allow christ universal to function as a church on its property.
the district judge determined that the city council did not effectively amend article of the czo barring recreation buildings and community centers from m districts until february when it issued a correction to its journal of proceedings.the district court then went on to grant christ universal request for a preliminary injunction.it found no rational basis for the city to permit community centers in m districts yet exclude churches,resulting in a violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment and rluipa.it did note,however,that the february correction effectively amended the czo to ban both churches and community centers from m districts and brought the czo into compliance with the equal protection clause.but,because the czo was unconstitutional at the time christ universal purchased and starting using its property as a church,the district court held that it could continue operating there as a nonconforming legal use.the district court subsequently made the preliminary injunction permanent,based on the record compiled in the preliminary injunction hearing and briefing.this appeal followed.
iii.analysis 
we review a district court decision to grant a permanent injunction for abuse of discretion.pribyl,cir citing knapp northwestern,cir.findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and legal conclusions de novo.id.a factual or legal error may be sufficient to establish abuse of discretion.id.we begin our inquiry with the district court legal determination that article of the czo was not effectively amended until february.
according to illinois statute 
whenever municipal ordinances are printed in book or pamphlet form,and purport to be published by authority of the corporate authorities,such book or pamphlet shall be prima facie evidence of the contents,passage and legal publication of such ordinance,as of the dates mentioned in such book or pamphlet,in all courts and administrative tribunals.
comp.stat.emphasis added.christ universal presented the district court with ample prima facie evidence that the czo,as amended in february,did not eliminate recreation buildings and community centers as permitted uses in m districts.it produced evidence of three different publications of the czo that continued to list recreation buildings and community centers as allowed in m city council own journal of proceedings,the czo as published by index publishing corporation,and the city of chicago department of zoning web page.
the city council journal of proceedings for february,as certified by the city clerk,reflects the passage of the czo amendments and,according to the testimony of the deputy corporation counsel in charge of the legislative and intergovernmental division of the city of chicago law department,generally is the document upon which the public can rely in determining the current state of the law.according to the deputy corporation counsel,the information contained in the journal of proceedings is supposed to include the amended articles in full,with additions in italicized print and deletions in brackets.in this circumstance,the journal publisher omitted any reference to subsection of article subsection referring to recreation buildings and community centers.instead it showed only subsection renumbered as subsection and the deletion of subsection,referring to private clubs and lodges
