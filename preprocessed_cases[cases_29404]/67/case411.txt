the district court granted declaratory judgment in favor of the plaintiff,bleecker charles,the developer of an apartment cooperative,ruling that the defendant,bleecker street apartment,the cooperative was untimely in terminating a lease of a parking garage to the plaintiff.the developer had caused the cooperative to enter into a lease at a time when the developer was in complete control of the cooperative and thus capable of unimpeded.the cooperative appeals,asking us to rule that its termination of the lease was timely.
in enacting the condominium and cooperative conversion protection and abuse relief act,the act,congress recognized that certain leasing arrangements for recreation and other facilities which have been used in the formation of cooperative and condominium projects may be unconscionable.a.because a cooperative sponsor or developer typically exercises almost total control over the affairs of a cooperative in its early days,prior to the developer sale of cooperative units,the developer may cause the cooperative to enter into a disadvantageous lease with the developer itself or with an affiliated entity.
to curtail such abuses,the act allows a cooperative to terminate certain contracts,without proof of unconscionability or,tenants,cir.to be terminable,the contract must first provide for operation,maintenance,or management of a condominium or cooperative association in a conversion project,or of property serving the condominium or cooperative unit owners in such project.a.second,the contract must be between the unit owners or association and the developer or an affiliate of the developer.a.third,the association must have entered into the contract while the developer still had special developer control or because the developer held a majority of votes in the association.a.finally,the contract must extend for more than three years.a.
to terminate a qualifying contract,the owners of of the units other than those owned by the developer or its affiliates must vote for termination.c.the unit owners must act within a period that begins on the earlier of the dates on which special developer control over the association is terminated or the developer owns per centum or less of the units in the conversion project.b.
this appeal turns on the interpretation of section b limitations period and,more specifically,on both the of units in the of units owned by the to determine when a developer owns or less of the units in the conversion project plaintiff bleecker charles company sponsor or developer contends that the number of units in a condominium or cooperative project is determined for all time when the project is created.defendant bleecker street apartment corporation cooperative argues that the number of units changes over time as units are subdivided or combined.the cooperative also maintains that two units owned by acquaintances or associates of the developer sole principal should have been attributed to the developer.if the cooperative is correct either that the number of units constituting the denominator changes as units are subdivided or combined,or that both of the apartments owned by persons associated with the developer should be attributed to the developer,its july,notice terminating a lease between the cooperative and the sponsor was timely.we hold that the number of cooperative units was fixed when the cooperative was created.because we also find that at least one of the two couples that the cooperative seeks to count as a developer is not a developer,we affirm.
background 
i.the offering plan and closing 
in december,the sponsor filed an offering plan for the building and land located at bleecker street in manhattan.the plan,as amended,called for the sponsor to transfer fee simple interest in the bleecker street property to the cooperative,which would simultaneously issue proprietary leases and related shares for residential units to the sponsor.
prior to closing,entities other than the sponsor contracted to purchase of the units.therefore,at the july,closing,the sponsor conveyed its fee simple interest in the property to the cooperative,and the cooperative issued leases and related shares to the new unit owners as well as leases and related shares to the sponsor for the units it continued to own at the same closing,the cooperative,as landlord,and the sponsor,as tenant,entered into a year lease for two ground floor commercial spaces and the basement parking garage at bleecker street the garage lease.
ii.purchases by individuals with ties to the sponsor 
also on july,kathleen gianetti bought the lease and related shares for one unit from the sponsor.at the time of closing and until november,gianetti worked for blumenthal lynne,pc,the sponsor counsel and the landlord for the sponsor principal law firm,kenneth newman.in,giannetti lease and shares were transferred to her and to her husband,anatole iwanczuk,as tenants in common.
in,shirley and anthony lomanto purchased the lease and related shares for another unit from the sponsor.lomanto worked then and still works for kenneth newman,
iii.combined units 
article of the cooperative bylaws authorizes it to grant a request by the owner or owners of one or more proprietary leases covering one or more apartments in the apartment building and of the shares issued to accompany the same to subdivide an existing apartment or combine all or portions of one or more existing apartments.the board must then reallocate shares to reflect the new alignment,but the total number of the shares so reallocated must remain the same.
between the closing and june,the date on which the cooperative members voted to terminate the garage lease,several persons purchased multiple units and received permission to combine them.the cooperative claims that sixteen original apartments had been combined into seven existing apartments by the time of the termination vote.except where a hallway space was added to existing apartments,combinations did not result in any change in stock ownership.that is,the owner of a combined unit continued to own the stock originally issued for each of the apartments.the board did not issue new leases for combined apartments.
iv.sponsor percentage of ownership 
both parties agree that the sponsor now owns less than of the units on the property.however,the date on which the sponsor ownership percentage dropped below and consequently the timeliness of the cooperative july,attempt to terminate the on the choice of a numerator and denominator.using the units described in the offering plan as a denominator and attributing neither the iwanczuk nor the lomanto unit to the sponsor in the numerator,the sponsor first owned or less of the units in the cooperative on october.however,if the number of combined units rather than the number of original units is the proper denominator,the cooperative claims that the sponsor ownership percentage did not drop to until november,when the sponsor owned thirty of existing units.if both the iwanczuk and lomanto units are added to the numerator attributable to the sponsor but the number of units existing at the time the cooperative was created is the proper denominator,the sponsor ownership percentage also first dipped below on november.other permutations are possible,but these examples demonstrate the importance of determining the correct denominator and numerator.
v.the termination vote 
on june,the cooperative board held a meeting of to consider termination of the garage lease.with the exception of the sponsor,the board allowed the owners of all units designated in the original plan to vote.after the vote,the presiding officer announced that the resolution had passed to zero with abstentions including the lomantos and iwanczuks,based upon one vote for each sponsor unit sold by the sponsor from july,until the date of the meeting.
on july,the cooperative sent the sponsor a notice of termination.
vi.proceedings in the district court 
on october,the sponsor filed a lawsuit in which it sought a declaration that the termination letter was ineffective and an order enjoining the cooperative from interfering with the rights of the sponsor and those of its subtenant,
