this appeal by midwest real estate investment company arises out of a diversity suit to foreclose a mortgage that aurora,the plaintiff,had on the craddieths home.the substantive issues are governed by illinois law.
the suit was filed,and a foreclosure judgment entered,in.but for reasons that are unclear,the foreclosure sale was not conducted until october.midwest was the high bidder,bidding.the appraised value of the property was.however,two or three weeks before the sale the craddieths had obtained alternative financing that would have enabled them to retain their home they had arranged for a loan in the form of a sale they would sell their home to a third party pursuant to an installment land contract that provided that the buyer would hold the title to the property until the craddieths had made their final payment of the sale price,that is,had fully repaid the loan,at which point the title would revert to the craddieths.
on the morning of the day of the foreclosure sale,the craddieths lawyer notified the court that his clients had made an alternative arrangement for paying back aurora.but he mistakenly described the alternative as a real sale of the home to someone other than midwest,rather than as a financing arrangement that would allow the craddieths to keep their home.the judge,thinking that therefore the craddieths were going to be out of their house no matter what,refused to stop the foreclosure sale,at which midwest was the high bidder.midwest tendered the purchase price to the court official who had conducted the sale,and the official issued midwest a certificate of sale.
but before midwest could take title to the property,the foreclosure sale had to be confirmed by the district court.on november the district judge convened a hearing on aurora motion to confirm the sale to midwest.at the hearing,at which midwest was not present,it was revealed that the craddieths had indeed found a lender who was willing to pay the amount due aurora on the mortgage.so,on december,the judge denied aurora motion to confirm the sale.
eight days later,midwest moved the district court for leave to intervene in the foreclosure suit under rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure.without ruling on the motion,the judge vacated the foreclosure judgment,explaining i not going to allow this poor man who has lost his house due to a fault of attorney problems and now he willing to pay the lived there his house to be basically taken away from him.for what had seemed inevitable to the loss of the craddieths home either to midwest or to the substitute buyer now seemed preventable.later,the craddieths lender having paid off aurora mortgage,the judge dismissed the foreclosure suit,whereupon he also dismissed all pending motions,including midwest motion to intervene,on the ground that they were moot in light of that dismissal.
so midwest has appealed but it must overcome a series of jurisdictional obstacles before we can consider the merits of the appeal.there is first a question whether midwest had standing to intervene in the district court under rule a of the civil rules.there is no contention that it might qualify for intervention as a matter of right under rule a,and we need not consider whether it might have a compelling case for permissive intervention,under rule b.if it did not have standing,it has no right to appeal the dismissal of the suit.the standing article iii requires must be met by persons seeking appellate review,just as it must be met by persons appearing in courts of first instance.arizonans for official english arizona,d see also diamond charles,d korczak sedeman,cir tachiona united states,cir.
rule a entitles a person to intervene who claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action,provided that the outcome of the suit would impair his ability to protect that interest and his interest is not adequately protected by an existing party.there was no doubt that midwest ability to protect its interest in acquiring the craddieths house would be impaired unless it intervened and that no existing party to the foreclosure suit would protect midwest was indifferent it was going to be paid in full either by midwest or by the craddieths new lender and the craddieths opposed.the question is whether midwest had the kind of interest that rule a requires.
to be entitled to intervene under that provision,with the full rights of a party including critically in this case the right to appeal,the applicant interest must be one on which an independent federal suit could be based,consistent with article iii requirement that only a case or controversy can be litigated in a federal court at any stage of the proceeding.arizonans for official english arizona,supra,at.korczak sedeman,supra,at.the interest must be a claim to a legally protected right that is in jeopardy and can be secured by the suit,tachiona united states,supra,at city of cleveland nuclear regulatory commission,per curiam.the principle is one of federal law but the nature and extent of the interest that a certificate confers,and therefore whether it can be the ground of a federal suit,depend on the law that defines the rights that such a certificate creates.fmc boesky,cir bochese town of ponce inlet,cir cantrell city of long beach,cir.in this case,that is the law of illinois.so we look to that law to see whether the holder of the certificate has the kind of stake that article iii requires.
the right that the certificate confers resembles the right created by a contract for the purchase of land.such a contract does not confer ownership of the land,but normally one can bring a suit for specific performance if the seller reneges,and the suit if successful will compel the seller to hand over to the buyer the title to the property.resolution trust ruggiero,cir.of course there are defenses to a suit to enforce a contract,but no one would suppose that the fact that a contract claim may fail deprives the suitor of a solid interest in the contract,interest enough certainly to justify intervention under rule a.otherwise article iii would bar many federal court actions for breach of contract even when the requirements of diversity jurisdiction were satisfied.
similarly,although there are defenses to the confirmation of a foreclosure sale,they are limited by statute to lack of notice the terms of the sale were unconscionable the sale was conducted fraudulently or justice was otherwise not done.ilcs b.the first three defenses would be normal defenses in a contract case.the last is pretty,though this depends in part on what exactly doing justice means in this context.we examine that issue later suffice it here to say that it is not so as to make the interest conferred by a certificate illusory.it is a solid legally protected interest,its solidity being further suggested by the fact that the vast majority of foreclosure sales are confirmed routinely.basil mattingly,the shift from power to process a functional approach to foreclosure law,marquette.in colon option one mortgage,cir,we called the interest of the high bidder at the foreclosure sale a potentially binding contract,and explained that under illinois state law,after the completion of the judicial sale,assuming that the redemption period has run,the purchaser at that sale has a presumptive right to eventual ownership of the property,a right contingent on the highly circumscribed authority of the state court to void the sale on any of the four grounds set forth in the statute.
twice,illinois appellate courts have held that the high bidder at a foreclosure sale has a legally protected interest even though that interest evaporates upon the trial court determination that the judicial sale will not be confirmed.citicorp savings first chicago trust,d,commercial credit loans,espinoza,d.citing citicorp,the court in espinoza said that as certified high bidders in the foreclosure sale of espinoza property,appellants have some interest in litigation involving the property.high bidders should be able to pursue their appeal.id.the court in citicorp had said that it is settled law that a may bring an appeal when that person has a direct,immediate and substantial interest in the subject matter,which would be prejudiced by judgment or benefited by its reversal i t can not be disputed that the bilanzics were adversely affected by the trial court order or that they will have the right to the property should the sale be confirmed.this is sufficient to allow the bilanzics to bring this appeal regardless of the decision by the trial court to deny intervention,at.
the quoted language has,it is true,a procedural rather than a substantive flavor.if all it means is that illinois procedure allows intervention by high bidders,this can not rule our decision,because illinois is under no obligation to conform its criteria for intervention to those of federal law.but what underlies the procedural judgments in these cases is a determination that the high bidder really does have a solid interest,an inference anyway compelled by the statute that delimits the defenses to confirmation of a foreclosure sale.
the craddieths do not contend otherwise.rather,pointing to the statement in the espinoza and citicorp opinions that what the trial court decides to do with the property after it determines the sale will not be confirmed is a matter in which the high bidders have no discernible legal interest,commercial credit loans,espinoza,supra,at citicorp savings first chicago trust,supra,at,they argue that midwest lacks standing to challenge the district court order that vacated the judgment of foreclosure and by doing so cut the ground out from under midwest claim.but in both espinoza and citicorp the appellate court reached the conclusion about the high bidder lack of standing to challenge the reinstatement of the defendant mortgage only after the court determined that the trial court had properly refused to confirm the foreclosure was that determination that extinguished the high bidder interest in the property.commercial credit loans,espinoza,supra,at.until then he had a legally protected interest.a contrary ruling confirming the have perfected rather than extinguished the high bidder interest,and thus,according to the logic of these cases,would have allowed him to challenge any subsequent reinstatement of the mortgage.the high bidder must be allowed to challenge a rejection of the sale in order to establish that he indeed has a legally protected interest,namely in obtaining the property for which he was the high bidder.
the point is not that to establish standing a plaintiff must establish that a right of his has been infringed that would conflate the issue of standing with the merits of the suit.it is that he must have a colorable claim to such a right.it is not enough that he claims to have been injured by the defendant conduct.the alleged injury must be legally and judicially cognizable.this requires,among other things,that the plaintiff have suffered an invasion of a legally protected interest.raines byrd,d,quoting lujan defenders of wildlife,d see also reid illinois state board of education,cir tachiona united states,supra,at city of cleveland nuclear regulatory commission,supra,at.t here is a sense in which i am injured when i become upset by reading about the damage caused that fine old vineyard in burgundy by a band of marauding teetotalers,yet that injury would not be an injury that conferred standing to sue under article iii.depuy,zimmer holdings,d.the injury must be to the sort of interest that the law protects when it is wrongfully invaded.the cases simply require litigants to possess such an interest,which is quite different from requiring them to establish a meritorious legal claim.
we next consider whether the fact that midwest is a citizen of the same state as the defendants blocks it from intervening,on the theory that its presence as a party to the foreclosure suit would eliminate the complete diversity that is required to maintain a diversity suit in federal court.considerations of judicial economy allow a federal court to exercise ancillary now a part of what is called supplemental jurisdiction over claims that could not be litigated in federal court were it not for their relation to a claim,party,properly before the court.the basic standard is stated in a a district court having original jurisdiction of a case shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under article iii.the next subsection states,however,that the supplemental jurisdiction does not extend to persons seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under rule if,as in this case,the only basis of the federal court original jurisdiction is diversity and if exercising supplemental jurisdiction over such claims would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of section the diversity statute.b.this provision might appear to doom midwest quest to intervene,since it is a citizen of illinois,as are the craddieths.
the evident purpose of the provision,however,is to prevent a evasion of the requirement of complete diversity of citizenship by a person who,being of the same citizenship as the defendant,waits to sue until a diverse party with which it is aligned sues the defendant,and then joins the suit as an intervening plaintiff.see stromberg metal works,press mechanical,cir state national ins.yates,cir viacom international,kearney,cir.section b reflects congress intent to prevent original plaintiffs from circumventing the requirements of diversity.id.emphasis added.
that is not what happened here.when aurora foreclosure suit began,midwest had no claim against the craddieths.its claim arose in the course of the foreclosure proceeding,after it obtained the certificate of sale and aurora,repayment of its loan assured,abandoned the suit.jurisdiction is not defeated by the intervention of a party who had no interest whatsoever in the outcome of the litigation until sometime after suit was commenced,k n energy,d per curiam american national bank trust bailey,cir salt lake tribune publishing v.at t,cir.section b purpose of preventing plaintiffs who would have destroyed federal jurisdiction had they joined a suit at its outset from using rule to circumvent the requirement of complete diversity has no application to a party forced to intervene to protect an interest that arose during the course of a federal litigation in which he had no stake at the outset.such a party has no say in deciding where the suit is brought and so can not be gaming the system.see mci telecommunications logan group.
this conclusion is further entailed by the rule that federal jurisdiction is with immaterial exceptions determined as of the date the complaint is filed.if on that date there is a claimant lurking in the indispensable party with a nondiverse claim that he hopes to attach to a diversity suit,as when two parties one from illinois,one from indiana who claim an interest in the same property want to adjudicate their rights against a third party,a citizen of illinois,stromberg metal works,press mechanical,supra,at later effort to intervene will be blocked.see also salt lake tribune publishing v.at t,supra,at.but,to repeat,at the time aurora sued,midwest had no claim at all.it did not enter the picture until the foreclosure sale five years later.midwest was not,and could not have been,an original plaintiff in aurora suit against the craddieths.it is difficult to see how midwest could vindicate its claim to the craddieths property but by intervening.
after the enactment of section,the supreme court reaffirmed that if jurisdiction exists at the time an action is commenced,such jurisdiction may not be divested by subsequent events,k n energy,supra,at,citing with approval the following language from wichita railroad light public utilities commission.jurisdiction once acquired is not divested by a subsequent change in the citizenship of the parties.much less is such jurisdiction defeated by the intervention,by leave of the court,of a party whose presence is not essential to a decision of the controversy between the original parties.
