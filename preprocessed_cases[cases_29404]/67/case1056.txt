in march,lorri mccalla mccalla sought to purchase property located at east ash in mason,michigan.plaintiffs bonita brody,mary lou keenon,and alex lebedovych collectively plaintiffs are all neighboring property owners.at the time mccalla was looking at the property,the neighborhood was zoned residential with surrounding blocks partially zoned for commercial use.mccalla,however,wanted to operate a beauty salon on the property,so she applied to the city of mason planning commission in march,for a special use permit.
under the city of mason zoning ordinance,article,a special use permit is required for all conditional uses of property ja an application for a special use permit is filed with the planning commission.ja each application must include specified documents and information before it will be accepted by the planning commission and must comply with the same substantive requirements as an application for a building permit,including having a scaled site layout plan.ja,
mccalla application,which included only a rough drawing of the building and future parking spaces,not a scaled layout plan,was discussed by the planning commission at a public meeting held on april,plaintiff lebedovych appeared at the meeting and voiced several concerns.deciding that it needed additional information before it could resolve mccalla application,the planning commission voted to table the issue until the next meeting and said that public comment on the application was closed.the public was,however,invited to submit additional written information in the interim.ja 
on may,the planning commission held a regular meeting.after hearing from the city attorney,the planning commission voted to grant mccalla the special use permit upon three conditions being satisfied although lebedovych was present at the meeting,the planning commission declined to allow him to say anything,reminding him that public comment on mccalla application had been closed after the previous meeting.the planning commission,however,allowed lebedovych to submit the notes that he had prepared in anticipation of speaking at the meeting.ja 
lebedovych appealed the commission decision to the city council,as provided under the city zoning ordinance ja on june,the city council conducted a public meeting on lebedovych appeal,immediately following a regular meeting.the meeting agenda had been publicly noticed by posting on june,but personal notice was not sent to plaintiffs or the other neighboring property owners plaintiffs were not present at the meeting mccalla,however,attended the meeting and was allowed to address the city council.based on the record before the planning commission,the city council voted to affirm the planning commission decision a letter announcing the city council decision was sent to lebedovych on june.ja plaintiffs attended a subsequent city council meeting held on july,to contest the city council decision and were allowed to speak.they were told that their only recourse was to go to the circuit court.ja 
mccalla purchased the property on june,ja and,going forward on the construction of the parking lot,submitted drainage and excavation plans to the city zoning administrator the plans were approved by the zoning administrator on june.after the paving of the parking lot was completed,it was inspected and approved by the zoning administrator on august.plaintiff keenon subsequently appealed the zoning administrator approval of the paving to the city zoning board of appeals zba ja a hearing on the appeal was held on september,at which all three plaintiffs spoke,expressing their objections to the zoning administrator approval because mccalla had not submitted an adequate grading plan.in addition to hearing from the mayor,the zoning administrator,and the city engineer,the zba also heard from an architect brought to the meeting by plaintiffs who told the zba that the parking lot did not have adequate drainage.after considering the issue for almost hours,the zba denied the appeal on the grounds that plaintiffs had failed to preserve the issue because plaintiffs had not appealed within days of the zoning administrator decision.ja plaintiffs,however,say that it was impossible to appeal the decision,as they did not have notice of the approval until after the days had passed.
lebedovych went on to file six more appeals contesting various decisions of the zoning administrator and the planning commission the appeals were each deemed untimely,or lacking in jurisdiction.keenon also filed another appeal with the zba which ended with the affirmation of the zoning administrator determination.
mccalla was eventually given a certificate of occupancy for the hair salon on september.
plaintiffs filed suit in state circuit court on august,seeking to enjoin construction of the parking lot and alleging many of the same issues as in this case.ja plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction was denied on august,and the case was dismissed with prejudice on december,for lack of progress.ja,
plaintiffs filed the instant case in ingham county circuit court and defendants removed it to federal court on october,on the basis of federal question jurisdiction.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the federal due process claims,and remanded the remaining state law claims to the state court on january.this appeal followed.
parties arguments 
on appeal,plaintiffs assert that their procedural due process rights were violated as follows when lebedovych,but not mccalla,was denied an opportunity to speak at the second planning commission meeting,even though there was no public comment period lebedovych says that more comment was needed because he disagreed with the city attorney opinion that use of the alley for ingress and egress to mccalla parking lot would not violate the law,and he knew that there was misinformation in front of the planning commission when the planning commission failed to make any written findings,as mandated by,of the zoning ordinance when lebedovych and the other plaintiffs were not personally notified of the date the city council heard lebedovych appeal of the planning commission decision,although notice of the meeting and its agenda was publicly posted when the city council submitted the minutes of the meeting at which lebedovych appeal was decided for approval at a special session,on june,following the conclusion of a school board meeting,rather than at the next scheduled city council meeting plaintiffs say this amounted to specific action to impede plaintiffs ability to seek legal redress and when plaintiffs appeal of the zoning administrator approval of the parking lot paving was denied as untimely even though plaintiffs were notified of the decision only after the period for objecting had run.
the city responds as follows all the plaintiffs had the opportunity to comment on mccalla special use permit application at the first planning commission meeting,which lebedovych did speci
