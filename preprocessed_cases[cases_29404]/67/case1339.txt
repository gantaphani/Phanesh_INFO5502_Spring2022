the parties to this suit,lackawanna and louis,are each successors to the entities that have owned and possessed delaware,lackawanna western railroad the railroad engine over the past century.the railway locomotive historical society historical society is the national organization,incorporated in massachusetts,which received from the railroad in.the historical society transferred ownership of to its lackawanna chapter in,and that local society is thus the here.
the national museum of transportation transportation museum in louis was a private corporation at the time it first displayed.louis,the here,exercised an option to acquire the transportation museum in after first acquiring through lease the museum assets in.
we recount separately the ownership of,possession of,and acquisition of the transportation museum by louis.
ownership of 
in the railroad engine entered service,a camelback locomotive utilizing a wide firebox to burn anthracite coal,was retired in and thereafter began its second life as a stationary museum piece.on april,the railroad transferred ownership of to the historical society,for exhibition as a museum piece.the transfer of from the railroad to the historical society is documented by a written agreement,signed by representatives of both parties.
in the historical society gave to its lackawanna chapter the here and the friends of the new jersey railroad transportation museum which transferred its interest in to lackawanna during this litigation.the transfer is recorded in a gift deed.
possession of 
despite the railroad transfer of to the historical society in,the engine remained in the railroad possession.then,in,the general manager of the railroad,white,notified the historical society that the railroad plans to sell or lease its back stop at scranton,pennsylvania,would require the historical society to relocate.according to correspondence in the record,the impending loss of the back stop lead the historical society to sound out the proper authorities in louis and see if they would be interested in adding this locomotive to their collection if that group would want it in the nature of a permanent loan.the historical society offered the locomotive to the transportation museum in for permanent exhibition.
the documents relating to the placement of at the transportation museum include only correspondence.after the historical society learned in october that the railroad would soon be unable to store the locomotive on its rails,charles fisher,president of the historical society,offered to the transportation museum.john smith,on behalf of the transportation museum,responded in a november letter 
t he members of the board of directors of the museum of transport have considered the matter of taking the lackawanna mother hubbard,as temporary or permanent loan,if it is desired to send the locomotive here.our group is unanimously in favor of accepting the engine for care and exhibition on a basis that will seem satisfactory in the judgment of the donor,for it is the purpose of this organization to preserve such items.
in subsequent correspondence,the historical society described the transfer as permanent loan,and the historical society president report stated that would be in the care of the transportation museum in the hope that her wanderings will end.after receiving,the transportation museum undertook several immediate improvements,including restoring the paint and stenciling to original design.
louis acquisition of the transportation museum 
the documents transferring the transportation museum property to louis include a warranty deed for the real property and a transfer agreement and bill of sale for other property owned by the museum and property held by the museum subject to the rights of others.regrettably,the record documents regarding the transfer do not mention 
d.the dispute regarding possession of 
at some point in or before october the historical society began its efforts to regain possession of.the correspondence,which included,at times,the department of the interior,the national parks service,the smithsonian national museum of american history,the office of the county executive of louis,the transportation museum,and the historical society,is extensive.evidently,the historical society hoped to return to its original home in pennsylvania,for display at the steamtown national historic site at scranton,and also feared that the transportation museum alleged neglect was endangering the locomotive.after reportedly leaving it to rust on an uncovered and overgrown sidetrack,the transportation museum began an effort to better maintain and preserve in,but that did not deter the historical society.
lackawanna,as the successor to the historical society interest in,first brought suit in the middle district of pennsylvania,though that court transferred the case to the eastern district of missouri.see lackawanna chapter of ry.locomotive historical,louis county,wl.louis soon moved for summary judgment,arguing that the correspondence did not constitute a written agreement that could support lackawanna claim for specific performance,as required for contracts with counties by.louis also asserted other defenses,including missouri statute of limitations for breach of contract claims,adverse possession of by the transportation museum,and abandonment by the historical society and lackawanna.
the district court granted louis motion for summary judgment.the court first found that n one of the documents establish a loan agreement between the rlhs the historical society and the transportation museum setting forth the terms of the transfer of the locomotive in.next,the court observed that the available writings do not define permanent loan.in the alternative,the court found that the missouri statute of frauds,precluded interpreting the documents as an agreement.finally,in the absence of an enforceable agreement,the court determined that louis possession of created a presumption of ownership that lackawanna did not rebut.see ross pendergast.
because our jurisdiction in this case is premised on the diversity of the parties,we apply state substantive law.see winthrop res.stanley works,cir.the district court,relying on the transfer of this case from the middle district of pennsylvania pursuant to a,see pony computer,equus computer of missouri,cir,applied missouri choice of law doctrine and concluded that missouri substantive law should govern this case.the parties have not challenged that determination,and thus we will also apply missouri law.
in the district court this case turned on whether the correspondence between the transportation museum and the historical society created a loan agreement.the court determined that the correspondence did not,because the agreement was not in writing and failed to define the term permanent loan.see marie malaro,a legal primer on managing museum collections discussing the legal difficulties arising from the term permanent loan.the absence of a written loan agreement in does not,however,lead to the court conclusion that lackawanna failed to rebut the ordinary presumption of ownership arising from louis exclusive possession and control over,ross,at.
the district confronting the unique legal doctrines that must be considered when a museum is party to a dispute over a piece of its on vagaries of ancient documents and louis possession and control of since to establish a presumption of ownership in favor of louis.see ge
