discussion 
placing plaintiffs property into reap did not violate plaintiffs substantive due process rights 
to determine whether reap violates plaintiffs substantive due process rights,we ask whether reap,as applied to plaintiffs,is rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose.richardson city and cnty.of honolulu,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we apply rational basis review because landlords are not a protected class,and they have no fundamental right to rent uninhabitable housing.see id.we affirm the district court dismissal because plaintiffs failed to state a claim that their constitutional rights were violated.
legitimate goal 
plaintiffs claim that while reap was originally implemented for legitimate reasons related to public health and safety,its current purpose is illegitimate.to survive plaintiffs challenge,reap must have a reasonable justification in the service of a legitimate governmental objective.cnty.of sacramento lewis,d.
the los angeles city counsel enacted reap out of concern that large numbers of owners of rental housing are not meeting the city minimum code requirements.zev yaroslavsky,los angeles city council file,hereinafter yaroslavsky,
o ne of the most important and fundamental duties a city can perform is to protect its residents from unsafe housing conditions.city and cnty.of san francisco jen,th,d.it is not an easy task for california cities to fulfill this fundamental duty.in,the california legislature found that one in every eight dwelling units in the state is substandard and that unless health and safety problems are corrected,habitability conditions generally deteriorate until the units become life threatening and uninhabitable and must be removed from the housing stock through closure or demolition.cal.health safety code a.
the crisis of substandard housing is especially severe in los angeles.in,the united states census bureau surveyed units in los angeles and long beach and found of those units were infested with cockroaches were infested with rats had severe problems with their plumbing,heating,electricity,or upkeep and lacked consistently working toilets.census bureau,american housing survey for the los angeles long beach metropolitan area,indeed,plaintiffs own buildings had electrical,plumbing,fire safety,and cockroach problems.
california civil code requires landlords who rent residential property to maintain the property in habitable condition.cal.et.california state law provides limited remedies to tenants who live in uninhabitable housing.but as explained below,these remedies are insufficient to ensure that the habitability requirements of are met.
california civil code permits a tenant who lives in substandard housing to make repairs needed to render the housing tenantable,and then deduct the expenses of such repairs from the rent.cal.a.the repairs,however,can not exceed the cost of one month rent.id.furthermore,tenants may only employ this remedy twice in any period.id.these limitations demonstrate that the california legislature framed only to encompass relatively minor dilapidations in leased premises.green superior court,cal d,cal.
in addition,california courts developed the doctrine of constructive eviction.id.at.that doctrine allows a tenant to abandon rental housing when the premises become uninhabitable.id.but constructive eviction gives little help to the typical low income tenant today because to avail himself of the doctrine a tenant must vacate the premises.in the present housing market many tenants can not find any alternative housing which they can afford,and thus constructive eviction has in reality provided little comfort to most needy tenants.id.at,internal citations omitted.
in response to a growing crisis of substandard housing,in the city of los angeles enacted reap.los angeles city council ordinance,amending lamc chapter reap was introduced as part of the city more vigorous stand against landlords of rental housing who allow their buildings to deteriorate to the point where tenants are living in substandard conditions.yaroslavsky.between and,reap proved extremely effective in forcing owners of slum dwellings to bring their buildings up to at least minimum standards of habitability.zev yaroslavsky,los angeles city council file,
in,an apartment fire in the pico union neighborhood of los angeles killed ten people.id.the building that burned was in violation of numerous city fire codes and although citations had been issued,the building was never brought up to code.id.in response to the prevalence of fire safety violations,the city council amended reap to strengthen the program enforcement powers.id.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.reap continues to enforce fire safety regulations.in,city inspectors cited one of the in this case for inoperable or missing smoke detectors.
currently,the city places property into reap when the landlord fails to correct health,safety,or habitability violations on the rented property.lamc racr n.landlords may challenge the placement of their property into reap through a hearing and appeals process.lamc racr.property is released from reap once it is repaired and passes inspection.lamc racr.
by allowing tenants to pay a reduced rent into an escrow account to be used to repair their landlord uninhabitable property,reap addresses the health and safety problems created by substandard housing and encourages landlords to prevent those problems.see lamc racr.these are legitimate goals.
reap is one of numerous tools that the city employs to enforce its housing code.other tools include criminal prosecutions and referrals to the state franchise tax board.in the past,the city criminally prosecuted one of the in this case for owning unpermitted and uninspected units.that prosecution resulted in a fine,probation,and house arrest.nonetheless,the housing code violations persisted,and the city referred the plaintiff case to the state franchise tax board.the tax board prohibits income tax deductions for interest,taxes,amortization,or depreciation on property that does not comply with the local or state housing code.see california revenue and taxation code.simultaneously,the city placed the plaintiffs property in reap.this history demonstrates that reap works in conjunction with other
