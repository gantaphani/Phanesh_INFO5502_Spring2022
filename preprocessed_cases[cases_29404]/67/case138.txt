this case involves a taking by the united states of acres of land.juan the defendant,the owner of the property,appeals from the final judgment of the district court awarding compensation in the amount of.the defendant claims that the district court committed a number of errors in the course of the valuation proceedings.because we conclude that the district court did not err,we affirm.
the approximately tract at issue is the site of a radio beacon used by the federal aviation administration for aircraft navigation.the tract was originally part of approximately contiguous acres of land owned by the defendant.the acre portion was leased to the government by the defendant during the period from to.in late,a dispute arose between the government and the defendant over the amount due under the lease,and the government indicated that it would initiate condemnation proceedings to acquire the land.in anticipation of a taking by the government,in the defendant formally segregated the tract from the acres into a separate parcel,but the ownership of both the parcel and the acres remained with the defendant,and the use of the land did not change.in the united states initiated a condemnation proceeding with respect to the parcel in answer to the complaint in condemnation,the defendant conceded the public purpose of the condemnation and the power of the government to take the property,disputing only the amount of just compensation.
for environmental reasons,the parcel has been,and continues to be,restrictively zoned by the puerto rico planning board board.because of this zoning,the uses of the land are restricted primarily to coastal protection,scientific investigation,passive recreation,fishing and the construction of fishermen piers so long as they do not affect the surrounding mangroves.these uses are referred to as conservation and passive recreation.most other uses of the land are forbidden without a variance or permit or some such permission from the board and other regulatory bodies.
in accordance with,at the time of the taking the government deposited in the district court registry as estimated just compensation.the government estimate was based on a highest and best use of the property of conservation and passive recreation under the applicable zoning.the defendant disagreed with the government estimate,and requested a jury trial on the quantum of just compensation pursuant to rule h of the federal rules of civil procedure 
in october,both parties filed motions asking the court to decide the method by which the value of the parcel should be calculated.the court held an evidentiary hearing and ultimately issued an order addressing the question 
the government supports the most commonly used method,known as the before and after method by which the value of the entire parcel is determined before the expropriation,and then the remaining parcel is reevaluated after the condemned portion is removed.defendant juan,owner of the property,wants the condemned portion,which is at the center of the larger parcel,valued independently,because it was segregated on december.we note that segregated the portion after his dispute with the government arose over the amount of rent to be paid.
in order to use the method,the government must demonstrate a unity between the separate parcels 
united states acres,dkt,slip op.at.the court noted that there was unity of ownership and contiguity between the parcels,but that there was a dispute about the unity of use of the parcels.id.after both parties provided additional evidence and briefing,the court concluded that there is an issue of fact as to the unity of the highest and best use of the condemned parcel and the remnant,which is for the jury to decide.if the jury finds that there is unity of use,the before and after method of valuation will be used.if the jury finds that the highest and best uses for the parcels are not the same,the segregated parcel will be evaluated as an independent parcel.united states acres,dkt,slip op.at may.
the defendant retained an expert,carlos gaztambide,to testify as to the value of the land.the expert filed two reports.the first report estimated the market value of the fee simple estate based on highest and best uses for construction of residences and sand extraction.neither use was permissible under the applicable zoning,absent permission from the planning board.
the first report opined that the tract had two sections of different value,an upland section of about acres and a lowland section of about acres.the report opined that the upland section was suited to residential use and sand extraction,and was therefore worth about per acre per cuerda this value was based on three comparable land sales,two of which had already been approved by the planning board for specific residential development projects.however,none of the three parcels appeared to involve zoned land.by contrast,the expert concluded that the lowland section had a highest and best use of conservation or mitigation,and was therefore worth about per acre or per cuerda.based on these figures,the report claimed a total market value for the parcel of.
the report also opined that there was a reasonable probability that residential development and sand extraction may be approved if adequate protection to or mitigation of the wetland is provided.plaintiff motion in limine ex.a at,united states acres,dkt.for support,the report stated that zoning is not an absolute negation to development and that residential subdivisions have been approved in numerous properties that have this zoning.id.the report included aerial photographs,zoning records,and other documents as support.however,none of the documentary evidence indicated that the allegedly comparable property on which residential development or sand removal had been approved had been zoned.the expert admitted in deposition that he had not spoken to anyone at the planning board about the parcel.
the second report was created after the first report as an addendum which estimates the value of the fee simple estate of the sand deposits in the subject property.this report estimated the value of the sand deposits by capitalizing the value of an estimated income stream from selling the sand,using a discount rate to determine present value and an estimated cost of extraction of of the anticipated gross income.by this method,the expert arrived at a value of the sand of between and.
the government filed motions in limine to exclude gaztambide testimony.the district court referred the motions to a magistrate judge.the magistrate judge recommended that the court grant the motions and exclude the testimony because many of gaztambide assumptions are either unsupported or contrary to existing facts.report and recommendation at,united states acres,dkt.the magistrate judge found that defendant had failed to establish that the land was improperly zoned or that a variance would have been granted gaztambide opinion,by itself,fails to establish a reasonable probability that the planning board would either change the zoning or grant a variance at any time in the near future.id.at.specifically with respect to residential development,the magistrate judge found that defendant has failed to document a single instance that supports gaztambide assertion that the puerto rico planning board has ever,or is likely to,approve residential housing developments on land zoned.id.at.similarly,the magistrate judge determined that gaztambide opinions concerning sand extraction were also unsupported and overly speculative.id.at.the magistrate judge also noted that the expert was improperly double counting the value of the sand deposits by first including sand extraction as a highest and best use increasing the fee simple appraisal of the land,and second as a separate mineral deposit estate with a value independent of the rest of the land value.the magistrate judge further criticized the second report for appraising the value of the sand deposits by lost income,rather than by comparable land sales.id.at.
over the defendant objection,the court adopted the magistrate judge recommendation and excluded gaztambide expert testimony
