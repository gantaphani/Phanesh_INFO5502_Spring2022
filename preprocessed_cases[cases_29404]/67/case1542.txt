this appeal raises the question whether an individual seeking access to his state mining claims over real property owned by the federal government and third parties can bring an action asserting a over such real property.we conclude that mills claims against the federal government are barred by sovereign immunity,but that the district court erred in concluding that his claims against doyon limited and hungwitchin corporation were barred by principles of prudential standing.we therefore affirm in part and reverse in part the district court dismissal of this action.
carey mills has an ownership interest in two state mining claims on land.according to mills,the only economically feasible and environmental ly friendly transportation route to access these claims is over the fortymile station eagle trail the fortymile trail or the trail,a trail that runs from a point approximately eight miles south of eagle,alaska a city near the united states canada border in eastern alaska,across various federal and nonfederal lands.
alaska has enacted legislation asserting it has a to the fortymile trail under a federal statute commonly referred to as,which had been codified at but was repealed in.see repealed.stated that t he right of way for the construction of highways over public lands,not reserved for public uses,is granted.id.has been construed as presenting a free which takes effect as soon as it is accepted by the state.lyon gila river indian,cir quoting wilderness soc.y morton,the state statute provides that alaska claims,occupies,and possesses each granted under,and lists the fortymile trail among the that have been accepted by public users and have been identified to provide effective notice to the public of these.alaska stat.a,c d.
the defendants in this action have varying property interests in the land crossed by the trail.first,the trail crosses federal land that is subject to unpatented federal mining claims owned by scott wood the united states and wood have different property interests in these parcels the united states owns the legal title to the land,best humboldt placer mining,d,while wood has exclusive possessory rights to use of the surface within the area of the claim.united states locke,d.second,the trail crosses land that is subject to the interests of doyon limited and hungwitchin corporation,two alaska native corporations that hold patents issued by the federal bureau of land management blm in for most of these lands,hungwitchin holds the patent for the surface estate and doyon holds the patent for the subsurface estate.doyon claims it also holds title to the surface estate in some portion of these lands.
mills first attempted to obtain access to the fortymile trail administratively by filing an application with the blm.in november,mills applied to the blm for a for the construction,maintenance,and use of an access road from taylor highway to his mining claim across the land subject to wood unpatented mining claims.the blm denied this application on the ground that it lacked the authority to approve a,and its decision was upheld on administrative appeal.mills subsequently asked the blm to amend the conveyances to doyon and hungwitchin to include a reservation of an easement for the fortymile trail.again,the bia denied the request in march on the ground that it lacked the legal authority to do so.mills has not appealed either of these administrative decisions,and they are not before us.
in april,in response to mills inquiry,the state confirmed that it was the owner of the to the fortymile trail.
in november,mills,proceeding pro se,filed this action raising numerous claims against the federal government,wood,doyon,and hungwitchin on the ground that he was entitled to use the trail for access to his state mining claims.mills sought a declaration that he is entitled to a to access his state mining claims on the fortymile trail both under and because he has an easement by implication or necessity,and that the real property interests claimed by wood,doyon,and hungwitchin collectively,the defendants are subject to this.
in considering mills claims,the district court concluded that legal title to any was vested in alaska.accordingly,the court held that mills had no independent property interest in the fortymile trail and instead was merely attempting to enforce the rights of alaska.because the state was not a party to the suit,but was the party in the best position to assert its own rights,the district court tentatively granted mills motion to join alaska as a party.after alaska objected,both under the eleventh amendment and because it had not yet decided whether to file a quiet title action against the federal government to confirm the state title to the fortymile trail,the district court dismissed mills joinder motion.
after allowing mills to amend his complaint twice,the district court dismissed mills claims against all defendants.as relevant here,the district court dismissed certain claims against hungwitchin and doyon on the ground that mills lacked prudential standing to bring an action seeking to establish a under.further,the district court dismissed certain claims against the united states pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure on sovereign immunity grounds.finally,the district court dismissed mills claim that he was entitled to a under a provision of the general mining law,mills timely appealed these issues,and has continued to proceed pro se.

in construing the scope of the qta waiver,we have read narrowly the requirement that the title at issue be disputed.see alaska united states,cir.for a title to be disputed for purposes of the qta,the united states must have adopted a position in conflict with a third party regarding that title.see id.in alaska united states,we held that the title to a riverbed underlying the black river was not disputed because the government had not expressly asserted a claim with respect to that real property.see id.even though the united states did not disclaim its interest to the riverbed,and reserved the right to make a claim to the riverbed in the future,we reasoned that whatever dispute there may be,it has not yet occurred,and concluded that a title can not be said to be disputed by the united states if it has never disputed it.id.at.because the title to the riverbed was not disputed for purposes of the qta,we remanded for the district court to dismiss the claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.id.
as in alaska united states,here the united states does not expressly dispute the existence of an for the fortymile trail.the blm stated only that the united states lacked the authority to make a determination as to the existence of an.nor has the united states taken an action that implicitly disputes the fortymile trail.although mills complaint alleges that a blm employee denied him access to the fortymile trail,this isolated allegation is insufficient to raise the inference that the united states disputes the.first,the government stat
