one of the concerns that led up to the enactment of the telecommunications act of,et,was that zoning decisions by local governments were unreasonably retarding the growth of cellphone and other wireless services.congress decided not to preempt local regulation entirely,but instead so far as bears on this case to require that the denial by a zoning board or other state or local government body of a permit to construct personal wireless service facilities,such as an antenna high enough to be in the line of sight of cellphone users,as required for cellphone service,shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.c b iii see,voicestream minneapolis,croix county,cir.this requirement is enforceable by suit in any court of competent jurisdiction.c b v.but congress did not prescribe a standard to guide the local authorities determination whether to grant a permit.
turned down by the planning commission of the city of mequon,a suburb of milwaukee,and on appeal by the city board of zoning appeals without opinion,so that the only written record of the evidence and reasoning supporting denial is the transcript of the planning commission deliberations,for a permit to build an antenna in its preferred location,verizon sued the city in the federal district court in milwaukee.it contended that the denial of its application was not supported by substantial evidence.it based federal jurisdiction on the presence of a federal question,namely whether the city had complied with the provision that we quoted from the telecommunications act.the district judge granted summary judgment for verizon and ordered mequon to issue the permit.the city has appealed.verizon has from the denial of attorney fees.
the substantial evidence standard is conventionally used for judicial review of agencies decisions,and though it is unusual for a federal court to be reviewing the decision of a nonfederal agency,we are given no reason to suppose that the term substantial evidence in the telecommunications act bears a different meaning from the usual one.and indeed we have held that it bears the same meaning.voicestream minneapolis,croix county,supra,at aegerter city of delafield,cir.so have the other federal courts of appeals that have considered the question.see preferred sites,llc troup county,cir,and cases cited there.as there is no practical difference between the standard and the even more familiar standard when the latter standard is used to guide the application of a legal standard to district court factfindings,school district of wisconsin dells ex rel.littlegeorge,cir,and cases cited there,the question in this case comes down to whether the mequon planning commission was clearly in error to turn down verizon application,in light of the evidence that had been placed before the commission.
a reasonable decision whether to approve the construction of an antenna for cellphone communications requires balancing two considerations.the first is the contribution that the antenna will make to the availability of cellphone service.the second is the aesthetic or other harm that the antenna will cause.the unsightliness of the antenna and the adverse effect on property values that is caused by its unsightliness are the most common concerns,as in voicestream minneapolis,croix county,supra,at,and southwestern bell mobile systems,todd,cir.but adverse environmental effects are properly considered also,degrees communications board of supervisors,cir at t wireless pcs,zoning bd.of adjustment,cir,and even safety effects fear of adverse health effects from electromagnetic radiation is excluded as a factor,c b iv,but not,for example,concern that the antenna might obstruct vision or topple over in a strong wind.see generally timothy tryniecki,cellular tower siting jurisprudence under the telecommunications act of first five years,real propery,probate trust.
the balancing test can be refined a bit.the availability of cellphone service is a function of the number of existing service providers and the coverage and quality of service that the applicant could achieve by constructing his antenna in another location where its unsightliness or other harmful effects,but none is suggested here would be less of a problem or by sharing an already existing telecommunications tower.the unsightliness of an antenna depends on its height,thickness,and general appearance,the number of other antennas in the area,and the character of the area land uses for example,residential versus commercial,including the height of other buildings in the area.coverage is a function of the number of providers,the coverage by each provider,and the increase in overall coverage at the disputed site if the antenna is built there,compared to alternative locations.thus a new firm that has from a service standpoint two equally good alternative sites can rightly be compelled to place the antenna in the less conspicuous location,which might be an existing telecommunications tower.see metropcs city county of san francisco,d.
verizon was having trouble providing cellphone service along a stretch of a busy street called mequon road.a nearby church in an area zoned institutional,though largely residential,was willing for a price that verizon was willing to pay to allow an antenna to be built in the church backyard.the antenna would be feet high and inches in diameter originally it was to be both higher and thicker,but its dimensions were changed in an unsuccessful bid to make it more palatable to the planning commission.to reduce its unsightliness,it would be disguised as a flagpole.
the planning commission hired a reputable telecommunications consulting firm to analyze the issue of availability of service.the firm reported that the antenna would increase verizon coverage of the area along mequon road from percent of the area to percent.two alternative locations,one a high school and the other a country club,both of which the planning commissioners preferred to the church backyard,were analyzed but were adjudged unsuitable.this was less because they would give verizon coverage of only percent of the mequon road area than because their proximity to other verizon antennas would interfere with the service provided from those antennas.
the fact that verizon would be unable to cover percent of the area along the mequon road is not decisive evidence that denial of the permit would impair cellphone service.we do not know how many potential customers for such service there are in the area including commuters and other transients as well as local residents,nor how many other providers of cellphone service serve them and with what quality of service and at what price.for all we know,the impact of the denial of the permit sought by verizon would be negligible.but the only reason the planning commission gave for attaching little weight to the interest of cellphone users was that percent coverage,while not percent,is good in so reasoning the commission overlooked uncontradicted evidence that because of interference the quality of service in the area of the percent increase in coverage percent minus percent if the antenna were placed in an alternative location would be degraded.the city brief states that the greater the interference,the lower the coverage.that is not true.you could have percent coverage,but lousy service because of interference.this concern seems not to have registered on the members of the planning commission.
against the impact on verizon coverage the commission set aesthetic considerations.but no evidence or reasoned analysis can be found in the transcript of the commission meetings,and except for the commission letter turning down verizon application on the ground that alternative locations for its antenna were available which is not issue is how inferior they are,that transcript is the only record of the basis for the commission decision.we know that the church in the backyard of which verizon wants to put its antenna is located in an area in which institutional land uses are permitted,though apparently residential uses predominate but that is all we know,except the dimensions of the flagpole tha
