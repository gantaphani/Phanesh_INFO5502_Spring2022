atc realty,llc and sba towers,filed suit in district court seeking an order directing the town of kingston,new hampshire to grant them all the permits necessary to construct a wireless telecommunications tower in the town.the district court granted summary judgment in plaintiffs favor on the ground that there was insufficient evidence to support the town of kingston decision to deny plaintiffs application to construct a tower.town of kingston town or kingston appeals the district court grant of summary judgment,arguing that the town rejection of the plaintiffs application is supported by substantial evidence.because we conclude that there was substantial evidence to support the town decision in the record,we reverse entry of summary judgment for plaintiffs and direct that summary judgment be entered for the town.
factual background 
wireless service companies provide consumers with mobile telephone service.to activate the technology upon which their service relies,these companies must construct a network of telecommunication towers that transmits,radio signals.incapable of building this network alone,they rely on plaintiffs sba towers and atc realty collectively,to develop such telecommunication towers for them.plaintiffs,in turn,lease antenna facilities on these towers to the wireless service companies.
in,several wireless service providers noticed a significant coverage gap along route in the northern region of kingston,new hampshire.this gap left customers in the area without wireless telecommunications service and disconnected the telephone calls of mobile phone users passing through the gap.seeking to rectify this problem,applied to the kingston planning board planning board or board for permission to construct an unlighted foot free standing telecommunication tower on marshall road in kingston two months after the plaintiffs submitted their application,however,american tower,a direct competitor,applied for a permit to construct a similar tower on depot road in kingston.
after holding several public hearings,conducting inspections of the proposed tower locations,and consulting a telecommunications expert,the planning board voted on october,to approve the construction of only one of the two proposed towers.in the same meeting,the board voted to deny the plaintiffs application for a construction permit and,in a subsequent vote,to grant american tower application.finally,the board voted again to deny plaintiffs application.
shortly thereafter,the planning board issued a written decision formally adopting the results of the votes taken at the october meeting.using the town telecommunications facility ordinance to define its criteria,the board rejected the plaintiffs application on four grounds 
based upon the purposes section of the kingston zoning ordinance letters c and e it is the responsibility of the kingston planning board to provide for minimal impact siting and to require cooperation and coordination between telecommunications service providers in order to reduce cumulative negative impacts upon kingston.
the location of proposed location is in close proximity to residential abutters.while there are commercial users backing into the property,the majority of the abutting and nearby properties are residential and of a rural nature.the siting of this tower does not meet the intent of the ordinance to reduce adverse impacts on neighborhood aesthetics.
the design of the tower does not prevent nor reduce the visual intrusive ness sic along the nh route corridor.minimizing the adverse visual impact is required by the town ordinances.
the planning board hired a telecommunication consultant to assist in determining the technical viability of the site.this consultant provided evidence that two proposed sites offered the same ability to cover existing service gaps.as a result,the site failed to meet the standard of section d of the town ordinance which indicates that all other reasonable opportunities have been exhausted.in addition section vii,paragraph h and j require the planning board to consider other factors in making decisions that include availability of existing towers and other structures and the availability of alternative siting locations.the planning board has done this with respect to this denial.
after their application was rejected in writing,filed this suit in the united states district court for the district of new hampshire,claiming that the board decision was not supported by substantial evidence as required by statute.see c b iii.the district court granted summary judgment in plaintiffs favor,and the town filed this timely appeal.
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.see straughn delta air lines,cir.
summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.t o defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment,the nonmoving party must establish a issue by presenting enough competent evidence to enable a finding favorable to the nonmoving party.leblanc great am.ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in exercising our review,we construe the record evidence in the light most favorable to,and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of,the nonmoving party.feliciano de la cruz el conquistador resort country club,cir.
discussion 
the telecommunications act tca works like a scale that,inter alia,attempts to balance two objects of competing weight on one arm sits the need to accelerate the deployment of telecommunications technology,while on the other arm rests the desire to preserve state and local control over zoning matters.c a b supp.ii see generally southwestern bell mobile todd,cir.accordingly,though state and local governments have the power to deny request s to place,construct,or modify personal wireless service facilities,their decisions must be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.c b iii.this balance strengthens the decision making authority of local zoning boards,while protecting wireless service providers from unsupported decisions that stymie the expansion of telecommunication technology.see generally brehmer planning bd.of wellfleet,cir.
plaintiffs argue that they are entitled to summary judgment because the town rejection of their application is not supported by substantial evidence.the tca substantial evidence test is a procedural safeguard which is centrally directed at whether the local zoning authority decision is consistent with the applicable zoning requirements.omnipoint communications mb operations lincoln,d,citing amherst omnipoint communications,cir.substantial evidence does not mean a large or considerable amount of evidence,but rather such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.cellular.zoning bd.of adjustment of,cir internal citations omitted.the board decision will thus withstand our scrutiny if it is supported by more than a scintilla of evidence.cellular.oyster bay,cir accord nlrb grand canyon mining,cir substantial evidence requires more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.internal citations omitted.
this case does not involve a claim that the board has effectively prohibited the provision of telecommunication services needed to close a service gap.see c b i ii.rather,the board has granted permission to plaintiffs competitors to build a tower which will close the service gap along route.
the only question before us is whether the board decision to deny the plaintiff application is supported by substantial evidence.in determining that question,in the absence of any claim of procedural irregularity by the board,we restrict our review to the record before the board.see tower,llc plainville zoning bd.of appeals,cir todd,at quoting penobscot air,fed.aviation,cir.we do not review the question de novo we must uphold the board decision unless it is not supported by substantial evidence.
before scrutinizing the factors cited by the board in defense of its decision to reject plaintiffs application,we pause to consider what mode of analysis to apply.the town argues that,in determining whether the board decision is supported by substantial evidence,we should not compare the relative merits of the two applications.instead,we should simply focus on whether there is sufficient evidence in the record to reject the plaintiffs application.conversely,the plaintiffs claim that the board votes to deny their application and to grant american tower application should essentially be treated as one decision.this approach,then,would require the board to provide substantial evidence for its decision to choose american tower application over the plaintiffs.
for the purposes of this appeal,we assume,without deciding,that the comparative model proposed by plaintiffs is the proper analytical framework.even after employing this more exacting model,however,we find that the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that the board selection of american tower bid instead of the plaintiffs is not supported by substantial evidence.
in its written decision,the board offered four reasons for rejecting the plaintiffs application to construct a telecommunication tower.we address each justification in turn.
cooperation among service providers 
the first reason set forth in the board written decision for denying plaintiffs application concerns the town responsibility to provide for minimal impact siting and to promote cooperation between competitors.under the telecommunications facility ordinance,the town is required to limit the construction of telecommunication towers by encouraging cooperation between competitors and having as many wireless service providers on a single tower as possible.art.vii,ii c.the board felt that the plaintiffs application did not adequately meet these objectives.
in defense of the board reliance on this factor,the town cites persuasive evidence in the record to support the conclusion that only one tower was necessary to rectify the coverage gap.for instance,tony wells,a radio frequency engineer for american tower,stated that the coverage for either tower proposal would be equivalent.in addition,ivan pagacik,an independent telecommunications consultant,informed the board that t he proposed american tower site at feet does fill in th e coverage gap.
though this evidence may justify the board decision to construct only one tower,however,it provides no basis for choosing american tower application over the plaintiffs.the crucial question,then,is whether the plaintiffs have shown that the board reliance on this factor to select american tower proposal over the plaintiffs is not supported by substantial evidence both and american tower assured the planning board that they would allow competing wireless service providers to use the antenna facilities on their towers.the only difference between the proposals is that whereas the plaintiffs proposed tower could accommodate six wireless service providers,american tower could only hold five providers on its tower.thus,in terms of willingness to cooperate and ability to serve wireless companies,the proposals are virtually identical,with the plaintiffs application being marginally better 
impact on residential properties and neighborhood aesthetics 
the board second reason for denying plaintiffs application for a conditional use permit was that their proposed tower was too close to residential abutters and had an adverse impact on neighborhood aesthetics.under the telecommunications facility ordinance,the town is authorized to consider the proximity of proposed towers to residential development and their impact on the surrounding aesthetics.art.vii,ii b.
the two proposed sites are largely indistinguishable with respect to their proximity to residential areas.both sites have residential abutters and commercial businesses within close proximity.they are also essentially equidistant from the areas zoned for commercial use.thus,the proposals are quite similar,if not identical,with respect to this factor.
in regard to the aesthetic impact of the towers,the board considered comments from residential abutters to the proposed sites.see,todd,at finding substantial evidence of adverse visual impact where residents specifically complained that the proposed tower was of a different magnitude than anything else in the vicinity and was inconsistent with the residential uses around it.several residential neighbors to the plaintiffs site criticized tower for its adverse aesthetic impact.resident abutters elisha and steven blaisdell objected to the proposed tower,arguing that it would destroy the picturesque quality of the surrounding area.mariah champagne submitted a letter characterizing plaintiffs tower as an eyesore that should be situated in a more rural location.she also took issue with the fact that the tower would be located on property that was once listed by the state as being historically significant.tina staublin echoed concerns over the adverse aesthetic impact the tower would have on the neighborhood.finally,andrea and almus kenter expressed their displeasure over having a clear view of the proposed tower from their home.they also emphasized the fact that the tower construction would be inconsistent with the surrounding bucolic area.
thus,nearly forty percent of the residential abutters to the plaintiffs proposed site opposed the application on aesthetic grounds.conversely,the board did not receive a single aesthetic objection to the american tower proposal.moreover,at least one board member attended a crane test on american tower proposed site,which involved elevating a crane to feet to determine the visibility of the proposed tower from the surrounding neighborhood.the results of the test demonstrated that the crane was very difficult to see,which may explain why no aesthetic objections were made to the american tower proposal.
plaintiffs largely ignore the results of this empirical test and concentrate their attack on what they perceive to be the easier target the residential abutters comments.argue that local residents can not defeat a tower proposal merely by trumpeting negative comments that are applicable to any tower,regardless of location.todd,at.because they characterize the residential abutters comments as generalized aesthetic objections,plaintiffs conclude that the board incorrectly relied upon this evidence to distinguish between the two proposals.
though several of the abutters objections to the visual impact of the plaintiffs tower specifically addressed why the proposed facility was inappropriate for the chosen site,we will assume,for the sake of argument,that the abutters comments were so general that they could apply to any tower.even assuming as much,however,the board correctly relied on this evidence in light of the facts of this unusual case.as noted,courts have consistently held that a few generalized expressions of concern with aesthetics can not serve as substantial evidence on which a town could base a denial.oyster bay,at.however,these rulings have not been made in the context of a town deciding between two proposed towers.rather,they have been made in cases in which towns have rejected the only proposed tower application before them.see,todd,at preferred sites troup county,cir telespectrum,pub.serv.comm of,cir omnipoint zoning hearing bd.of pine grove,cir.in the latter context,courts fear that local governments may be relying on abutters general aesthetic objections to mask a de facto prohibition of wireless service.see generally todd,at.
in contrast,the instant case,given the mode of analysis we have employed,involves the board comparison between two competing proposals and its selection of american tower application over the plaintiffs.the fact that the board ultimately granted a permit to the plaintiffs competitor demonstrates that the board is not generally hostile to the construction of telecommunication towers.in this context,when a planning board has decided to construct a tower and must decide which of several proposed towers to construct,it is perfectly reasonable for the board to consider,and be swayed by,the
