the district court stayed its injunction pending jake prior appeal.when the stay expired on may,jake continued to offer live nude dancing.but jake eliminated the prior five dollar cover charge,instead charging a five dollar fee to park outside the establishment,regardless of whether a customer entered.in addition,jake began selling soft drinks outside instead of inside the building.the city filed a contempt motion.after a hearing,the district court held jake in contempt and ordered jake to close the business at clayton avenue in coates and to pay a civil contempt sanction of one thousand dollars per day for any future continued operation.in addition,finding that jake did not oppose the contempt motion in good faith,the court ordered jake to pay the city costs and attorney fees of.jake appeals these rulings in case.
a few days after the contempt order issued,jake reopened at the same location.the business no longer featured live nude dancing.instead,dancers offered patrons lap or couch dances for twenty dollars and more private vip couch dances for.after undercover law enforcement officers determined that these dances involved dancers rubbing their clothed breasts and groins on patrons clothed genitals,the city again moved to hold jake in contempt for operating a business on the premises.finding clear and convincing evidence of willful and intentional violations of the court prior orders,the district court again held jake in civil contempt.applying the penalty established in the first contempt order,the court ordered jake to pay into court for the days it had operated in continued violation of the injunction.in addition,the court increased the prospective fine for future violations to two thousand dollars per day,granted judgment to the city for in additional costs and an unpaid deficiency relating to the first contempt order,and ordered jake to close the business at its current location and reopen only when they have complied fully with this order.jake appeals this second contempt order in case.we consolidated the appeals and now affirm in part and reverse in part 
the first contempt order.
in case,jake challenges the district court first contempt ruling and the award of attorney fees and costs as a civil contempt sanction.jake first argues that,after eliminating the cover charge and the sale of soft drinks where the live nude dancers performed,it no longer engaged in operating a business as defined in the city zoning ordinances and therefore did not violate the court injunction.the ordinances define different types of businesses.relevant here is the adult entertainment facility category,defined as 
a building or space wherein an admission is charged for entrance or food or beverages are intended for consumption and wherein may be observed live presentation or entertainment distinguished or characterized by an emphasis on matters depicting,describing or relating to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas as defined herein.
jake argues that its five dollar parking fee was not an admission charged for entrance because the parking fee was charged for any use of the parking lot and because patrons could enter and watch the live nude dancing without paying the five dollar fee if they arrived on foot,by taxi,or parked elsewhere.jake argues that selling soft drinks for consumption outside the building was not the sale wherein live nude dancing may be observed.
the district court rejected these contentions.it concluded that jake had continued to operate a business within the meaning of the ordinance because t he parking fee is the functional equivalent of the admission charge plaintiffs seek to avoid,and alternatively because the mere relocation of beverages from inside the bar to just outside the door does not change the fact that such beverages continue to be sold and are intended for consumption on the premises where nude dancing occurs.noting that jake conceded it was operating a business earlier in the litigation,the court held jake in contempt,refusing to allow jake to dodge the force of the court orders by engaging in games of labeling and semantics.

on appeal,jake argues that the district court failed to construe the zoning ordinances strictly in favor of the property owner,as minnesota law requires.but the primary issue is whether jake violated the court decree,not whether they violated the ordinances.in the proceedings leading up to that decree,jake conceded that live nude dancing was a business within the meaning of zoning ordinances that prohibited conducting a business at the location in question.thus,when the district court rejected jake first amendment attacks on the ordinances and granted the city injunctive relief,it obviously intended to enjoin jake from continuing to offer live nude dancing on the premises.jake conduct violated that core prohibition.the fact that the decree broadly and in our view improvidently incorporated entire ordinances by reference raises difficult issues that we must address in connection with the second contempt decree.but the breadth and potential ambiguity of the injunction do not undermine the district court conclusion that the city demonstrated,by clear and convincing evidence,that jake acted in contempt of the injunction by continuing to offer live nude dancing,conduct jake had previously conceded would violate the ordinances.
jake further argues that the district court erred in awarding the city its attorney fees and costs because jake opposition to the contempt motion had a basis in the ordinance and thus was made in good faith.in response,the city argues that even if jake had a good faith basis for opposing the contempt motion,we should still affirm the fee award because a lack of good faith need not be shown.in this circuit,a lthough willfulness is not necessarily a prerequisite to an award of fees,it may properly be considered in deciding whether to tax costs and attorney fees in an action to enforce compliance with an injunction.hartman lyng,cir citation omitted see mccomb jacksonville paper.but see king allied vision,cir.
when an injunction has issued at the request of a government agency,an award of reasonable attorney fees and expenses incurred by the agency in seeking to enforce the decree is a form of compensatory relief that is well within a district court remedial discretion in civil contempt proceedings.see united states rue,cir.here,jake argued that it did not violate the decree because it made minimal and tangential changes to the way it conducted an admittedly nude dancing.the district court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting that argument as nothing more than an artful dodg
