in,the louisiana legislature passed an act ordering the orleans levee district to return land it had expropriated in to build a spillway.the levee district board of commissioners,however,stalled the return of the property and have until this day fought not to repay mineral royalties that belong to the landowners.in this litigation,the levee district persuaded the district court to dismiss the landowners constitutional takings claim.we reverse.the district is not immune under the eleventh amendment,and the landowners pleadings state a takings claim.
background 
the orleans levee district was created by the louisiana legislature in for the purpose of protecting the city of new orleans from floods.in,the state legislature authorized the levee district board of commissioners the levee board to acquire acres of land on the east bank of the mississippi river about miles south of new orleans in order to build the bohemia spillway between the river and the gulf of mexico.acts.approximately half of this land was public property transferred from the state the other half was either expropriated or purchased under threat of expropriation from private owners.acts.acts.
in,the louisiana legislature decided to return the land taken for the bohemia spillway.act declared 
that the public and necessary purpose set forth in act of,which may have originally supported the expropriation of property,or any right of ownership thereto,on the east bank of the mississippi river in the parish of plaquemines for the construction of a spillway,known as the bohemia spillway,has ceased to exist insofar as it ever may have affected the ownership of property,including mineral rights.the legislature of louisiana hereby orders the board of levee commissioners of the orleans levee district,the board,to return the ownership of said property to the owners or their successors from whom the property was acquired by expropriation or by purchase under threat of expropriation.
acts,art.vii,b.act also directed the levee board to provide a thorough accounting concerning all revenues received from the affected property.the act was signed by the governor and went into effect on june.
the levee board was reluctant to hand over the bohemia spillway lands.the expropriated land had proved to be useful for more than just a spillway,and by the,the levee district was receiving about million a year in mineral royalties from the land the board had expropriated in.board of levee commissioners of the orleans levee bd.huls,cir.the levee board challenged the constitutionality of act,but both state and federal courts rejected the argument that act was an unlawful taking of the levee district property in violation of article i,section of the louisiana constitution as well as the fifth and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution.board of commissioners of the orleans levee dist.dep t of natural resources,so d,huls,at.
following these adverse judgments,the levee board issued quitclaim deeds in and,and title passed to the original landowners or their successors.however,the levee board refused to remit the mineral royalties that the levee district had received between june and the time the land was returned.
a group of landowners then filed suit in state court requesting a declaratory judgment confirming their ownership of the disputed mineral royalties,an accounting of all mineral royalties paid to the levee board after june,and a money judgment for the royalties that the levee board had not repaid.the louisiana court of appeals held,based on the clear language of act,that the levee board had no right to revenues from the expropriated property after the effective date of act.vogt board of levee commissioners of the orleans levee,so d.cir,writ denied,so d.after an accounting,the louisiana courts ordered the levee board to reimburse the landowners for in unpaid mineral royalties.vogt board of commissioners of the orleans levee,so d.cir,writ denied,so d.
the levee board has refused to satisfy this million judgment for unlawfully retaining the mineral royalties from to.the landowners sought a writ of seizure,but article,section c of the louisiana constitution provides that property of the state,a state agency,or political subdivision is not subject to seizure.the landowners then sought a writ of mandamus,but louisiana courts have long held that a judgment creditor may not use a writ of mandamus to force a political subdivision to appropriate funds to pay the judgment 
the landowners filed this action in federal court,claiming that the levee board refusal to pay the judgment is an unconstitutional taking of their property without just compensation.the levee board now asserts that it is an arm of the state and is thus entitled to eleventh amendment immunity.
the district court concluded,based on the weight of the case law,that the levee board is an arm of the state.the court granted the levee board rule b motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,and the landowners now appeal.the district court determinations are reviewed de novo as questions of law,like other questions of subject matter jurisdiction.united states texas tech,cir.
ii.eleventh amendment immunity 
federal court jurisdiction is limited by the eleventh amendment and the principle of sovereign immunity that it embodies.seminole tribe of florida florida,d reickenbacker foster,cir.the ultimate guarantee of the eleventh amendment,as the supreme court recently stated,is that a state may not be sued in federal court by private individuals,including its own citizens.board of trustees of the of alabama garrett,d.
even in cases where the state itself is not a named defendant,the state eleventh amendment immunity will extend to any state agency or other political entity that is deemed the alter ego or an arm of the state.regents of the of california doe,d.in other words,the eleventh amendment will bar a suit if the defendant state agency is so closely connected to the state that the state itself is the real,substantial party in interest.hudson city of new orleans,cir.the eleventh amendment will not bar a suit,though,if the political entity possesses an identity sufficiently distinct from that of the state.pendergrass greater new orleans expressway comm n,cir.
there is no test for determining whether a political entity is an arm of the state for purposes of eleventh amendment immunity.instead,the matter is determined by reasoned judgment about whether the lawsuit is one which,despite the presence of a state agency as the nominal defendant,is effectively against the sovereign state.earles state board of certified public accountants of louisiana,cir.in making this inquiry,this circuit traditionally has considered six factors whether state statutes and case law characterize the agency as an arm of the state the source of funds for the entity the degree of local autonomy the entity enjoys whether the entity is concerned primarily with local,as opposed to statewide,problems whether the entity has authority to sue and be sued in its own name and whether the entity has the right to hold and use property.see,cozzo tangipahoa parish,cir anderson red river waterway comm n,cir t he most significant factor in assessing an entity status is whether a judgment against it will be paid with state funds.delahoussaye city of new iberia,cir.
the district court did not discuss these six factors because it concluded that prior decisions of the fifth circuit and louisiana supreme court expressly identified the levee board as an arm of the state.however,the decisions cited by the district court involved issues fundamentally different from the one presented here 
the district courts relied in part on the louisiana supreme court decision in board of commissioners of the orleans levee dist.dep t of natural resources,so d,holding that the legislature divestiture of levee district property does not constitute a taking of property by the state.while this decision provides a thorough discussion of the scope of the state police power with respect to political subdivisions,it offers little,if any,support for the proposition that the orleans levee district is an arm of the state.
the levee board points out that board of commissioners refers several times to the levee district as a creature or agency of the state.id.at.contrary to the levee board assertions,however,calling the levee district a creature or agency of the state does not necessarily mean that it is an arm of the state within the meaning of eleventh amendment jurisprudence.this point has been made repeatedly in our prior decisions.see,southwestern bell telephone city of el paso,cir earles,at richardson southern,cir mcdonald board of mississippi levee commissioners,cir a reference to the levee board as an agency of the state by mississippi courts does not amount to a characterization of the levee board as an arm of the state.minton bernard parish sch,cir.
the principal reason for distinguishing between a creature or agency of the state and an arm of the state is that the former concept is far too inclusive to be useful for eleventh amendment analysis.as the supreme court succinctly observed,
u ltimate control of every entity resides with the state,for the state may destroy or reshape any unit it creates.p olitical subdivisions exist solely at the whim and behest of their state,yet cities and counties do not enjoy eleventh amendment immunity.
hess,at.at citations omitted.
on this same point,consider the louisiana supreme court explanation why the property held by the levee district was,to all practical intents and purposes,still the property of the state itself.board of commissioners,so d at.after determining that flood protection falls within the state police power,dennis explained that 
t he legislature may delegate,either expressly or implicitly,the exercise of the police power to subordinate boards,commissions or political corporations.such power,however,belongs to the state the police power may be exercised by agencies of the state only under a delegation of authority.the state retains the right to recall,abrogate or modify the delegation.consequently,the legislature prior delegation of police power to its creature or agency,the orleans levee district,authorizing it to levy taxes and to acquire land by expropriation,purchase or donation to build a spillway and maintain it for flood protection purposes can not prevent the state from recalling,abridging or modifying this delegation of power.
id.at.the court discussion of the state police power with respect to its creatures or agencies makes no distinctions among the subordinate political entities.that is to say,departments within the executive branch,public universities,parishes,sheriff departments,school boards,and municipalities are all creatures or agencies of the state.all of these entities exercise a slice of state power,and all are subject to having their powers recalled,abridged,or modified by the state.southwestern bell,at,jacintoport,at.nevertheless,many of these creatures or agencies of the state indisputably are not protected by eleventh amendment immunity and can not be considered arms of the state.
the appellees make a similar mistake by relying on this court decision in board of levee commissioners of the orleans levee bd.huls,cir.the issue in huls was whether an agency of the state the levee district may sue the state under the fifth and fourteenth amendments for an uncompensated taking of property.id.at.according to the district court,huls expressly identified the levee board as an arm of the state and held that the levee board was a state agency that employed the power of the state to expropriate land and therefore could not sue the state for an uncompensated taking of property.the district court interpretation of huls conflates two distinct categories agency of the state and arm of the state.
huls,like board of commissioners,is predicated on the traditional understanding of the state police power.the court explained that a political subdivision acts for the state.its power and its property come about only because it has the power of the state.huls,at.when the legislature revoked the levee district authority to hold the bohemia spillway property,the levee board qua agent had no legal right to challenge the decision of the principal.
the focus in huls is on political subdivisions or agencies of the state categories which include political entities that are beyond the purview of the eleventh amendment.tellingly,the panel in huls considered itself bound by a supreme court decision involving a municipality that sued a state 
virtually the identical issue was raised in city of trenton state of new jersey.in that case,the city argued that a state tax on the water the city took from the delaware river violated the contract clause and the due process clause.the court holding was clear and unequivocal those provisions of the constitution do not apply against the state in favor of its own municipalities.id.at.at.city of trenton controls our decision.the levee board can not sue the state for an uncompensated taking of property.
huls did not hold that the levee board could not sue the state of louisiana because the levee district was an arm of the state.instead,huls held that the levee board was a creature or agency of the state,and,like other creatures of a levee board could not prevent the state,in the exercise of its police power,from revoking a prior delegation of authority.as in board of commissioners,the levee board status as an agency or creature of the state is not determinative of the eleventh amendment question because many creatures or agencies of the state,notably municipalities,are not arms of the state for purposes of eleventh amendment immunity.
the issue the orleans levee district is an arm of the state for purposes of the eleventh not yet been decided.we must examine the particular entity and its powers and characteristics as created by state law to determine whether the suit is in reality a suit against the state itself.richardson,at citations omitted.this examination is guided by the six factors listed above.
characterization under state law.louisiana statutes define a levee district as a political subdivision of this state organized for the purpose and charged with the duty of constructing and maintaining levees,and all other things incidental thereto within its territorial limits.ann.a political subdivision is defined as any parish,municipality,special district,school board,sheriff,or other public or governmental body of any kind which is not a state agency.ann.b see also wynat development board of levee commissioners,so d,stating that the orleans levee district is a special district within the meaning of b.
the statutory classification of levee districts as political subdivisions is significant.our decision in cozzo suggests that political subdivision under b and arm of the state are mutually exclusive.cozzo,at.while this may not be a rule,virtually every other government entity classified as a political subdivision has been denied eleventh amendment immunity,perhaps because political subdivisions are more local in character.hudson,at.moreover,political subdivisions are not part of any department within the executive branch of government.in every recent case in which a louisiana political entity has been held to be an arm of the state,the state agency being sued was part of a department within the executive branch our prior decisions have gone so far as to suggest that all louisiana executive departments have eleventh amendment immunity.champagne,at.but in this case,the levee districts are separate political subdivisions and are not constituted as part of the executive branch of government.
because the louisiana constitution and laws classify levee districts as political subdivisions,which are usually local governmental units with no connection to the executive branch of government,the first factor points against eleventh amendment immunity.
source of the levee district funding.this second factor is given the greatest weight because one of the principal purposes of the eleventh amendment is to protect state treasuries.cozzo,at jacintoport,at.although this court traditionally uses the broad phrase source of funding,our inquiry is more specific in assessing this second factor,we conduct inquiries into,first and most importantly,the state liability in the event there is a judgment against the defendant,and second,the state liability for the defendant general debts and obligations.hudson,at.
the state liability for a judgment is often measurable by a state statutes regarding indemnification and assumption of debts.in hudson,the court focused on the same indemnification provision that is applicable in this case.the statute defining who is a state employee for purposes of indemnification specifically excludes an official,officer,or employee of a municipality,ward,parish,special district,including without limitation a levee district,school board,parish law enforcement district,or any other political subdivision or local authority.ann.e a hudson,at.and the louisiana constitution provides that no judgment against the state,a state agency,or a political subdivision shall be exigible,payable,or paid except from funds appropriated therefor by the legislature or by the political subdivision against which the judgment is rendered.const.art,c emphasis added.although the legislature has the authority to appropriate funds to pay a judgment against a levee district,the legislature certainly has no legal obligation to do so.thus,no legal liability arises against the state in the event of a judgment against the levee district or its officers.on the other hand,judgments against state agencies or departments within the executive branch are treated as liabilities of the state itself.see,delahoussaye,at darlak,at voisin oyster house,at.
the levee board acknowledges that the state has no duty to pay a judgment against the levee district.the levee board has suggested,though,that it could go to the legislature and request that state money be appropriated to pay the judgment.this court has consistently dismissed such arguments as too speculative for eleventh amendment analysis w e do not consider a state voluntary,payment of a judgment to be a liability against the state treasury.williams,at quoting hudson,at.we have left open the possibility that a state entity could show that the where it is not obliged to do appropriates money to pay judgments against the entity.in this case,however,the levee board can point only to an appropriation made in to reimburse the levee district for expenses incurred when the orleans levee district assumed the indebtedness of another levee district.this argument falls far short of demonstrating the legislature de facto recognition of liability for judgments against levee districts.
the next step is to determine whether the state will indirectly fund a judgment against the levee district because the state either is responsible for general debts and obligations or provides the lion share of the levee district budget.
the louisiana constitution provides that the full faith and credit of the state shall be pledged to the repayment of all bonds and other evidences of indebtedness issued by the state directly or through any state board,agency,or commission the full faith and credit of the state is not hereby pledged to the repayment of bonds of a levee district,political subdivision,or local public agency.const.art.therefore,while the levee district has been granted the authority to issue bonds and incur debts,those debts are not backed by the state.see also pendergrass,at.
with regard to the more general question of the levee district budget,the orleans levee district receives very little funding from the state.the levee district generates its own revenues from the lakefront airport,a casino,leases of property,fees from boatslips and marinas,and taxes.the district also receives income from various investment accounts currently worth million.the levee board does not dispute these facts.at oral argument,counsel for the levee board pointed out that the district receives some state funds,even though they are usually in the form of capital outlays dedicated to specific projects.because the state funds are already earmarked for other purposes,the state monies can not be used to pay a judgment against the levee district.see hudson,at.
the levee board further contends that the state of louisiana provides funds to the levee district indirectly,by allowing the district to levy taxes on property within the district.however,the levee district exercise of a delegated power to tax does not speak to the question before us,namely,whether a judgment against the levee district will be paid out of the state treasury.see williams,at.
to sum up the second factor source of funds points against eleventh amendment immunity.the orleans levee district is almost entirely,and the funds provided by the state are earmarked for special projects.the levee district has the authority to tax and issue bonds,although the state specifically disclaims responsibility for any debts of the levee district.of greatest significance is that nothing in louisiana law,or in recent practice,suggests that the state has any obligation with respect to judgments against the levee district.
degree of local autonomy.in our circuit,the determination of an agency autonomy requires analysis of the extent of the entity independent management authority as well as the independence of the individual commissioners who govern the entity.jacintoport,at.
the orleans levee district has considerable management authority,as that term has been applied in fifth circuit caselaw.for example,the levee district is granted full and exclusive right,jurisdiction,power and authority over all matters within its territorial reach.ann.a.each levee district has the authority to issue bonds,raise taxes up to a certain rate,and make all contracts necessary to perform their functions.ann,a.the levee board has the authority to sell,lease,or otherwise dispose of property for the purpose of raising funds.ann.a.
in carrying out these functions,the levee board operates with no oversight from the executive branch of government.darlak,at emphasizing that the charity hospital of new orleans was under the direct control of the executive branch of government.furthermore,the state legislature exercises no oversight with respect to the levee district budgetary matters,except perhaps to the limited extent that the district is subject to audits.see williams,at.on the whole,however,no branch of state government exercises supervisory control over the operations of the levee district,and that fact counsels against eleventh amendment immunity here.mcdonald,at see also williams,at minton,at.
the levee board correctly points out,however,that six of the eight commissioners serve at the pleasure of the governor.ann.k.although the vulnerability of the commissioners to the governor pleasure militates against a finding of local autonomy,jacintoport,at,in this case,the governor discretion is limited by statutory requirements that a commissioner must be a resident of the levee district and recommended by the local legislative delegation.ann.this court stated in pendergrass that residency requirements and local nominations along with fixed terms,which are not present here tug ged strongly in favor of a finding of local autonomy,in spite of the governor role in the appointment process.pendergrass,at.moreover,jacintoport suggests that the appointment process is given less weight than the scope of the entity authority over its activities.jacintoport,at.on balance,then,the levee district considerable degree of local autonomy supports a finding of no eleventh amendment immunity.
local versus statewide problems.this factor properly centers on whether the entity acts for the benefit and welfare of the state as a whole or for the special advantage of local inhabitants.williams,at quoting pendergrass,at.
limited territorial boundaries suggest that an agency is not an arm of the state.see,cozzo,at noting that a sheriff duties are generally performed only within a single parish hudson,at w e have found it highly useful to examine the geographic reach of the district attorney prosecutorial powers.the levee district powers,considerable as they are,may be exercised only within clearly defined territorial limits.ann.on the othe
