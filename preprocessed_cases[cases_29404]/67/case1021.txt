defendants,maryland casualty company and northern insurance company of new york,appeal the district court judgment in favor of plaintiff,standard construction company.the district court ruled that defendants owed plaintiff both a duty to defend and a duty to indemnify under certain commercial general liability insurance policies.for the reasons set forth,we affirm the district court judgment.
factual background 
standard construction company is an asphalt paving contractor.maryland casualty company and northern insurance company of new york insured standard from january,through january,under three successive commercial general liability cgl and umbrella policies,respectively.
in march,standard entered into a contract with the state of tennessee to perform paving and road work as part of a project on highway near arlington,tennessee.under the contract,standard was responsible for the clearing and removal of certain debris,to be performed in accord with specifications issued by the tennessee department of transportation.these specifications required standard to remove debris from the construction area to take ownership of the debris and dispose of it elsewhere to secure written permission from landowners prior to dumping the debris on any private property and to make reparations for any damage to private or public property that might occur during disposal.
standard subcontracted this disposal work to ronald terry construction company.terry superintendent,gene bobo,obtained written permission from six owners of the property adjacent to highway to dump on their property construction debris from the project.with respect to a seventh property owner,the then old cassella love,bobo obtained a similar agreement signed by love daughter,louise poole,in love name.
terry,believing that it had love permission,proceeded to dump construction debris,including trees,corrugated metal pipes,concrete chunks with exposed steel,and asphalt,on love property.at that time,love property,which was zoned commercial,was the subject of condemnation proceedings brought by the state in connection with the widening project.william fisher,an attorney representing love in the condemnation action,retained an engineer to inspect love property.the engineer opined that the debris dumped on love property rendered the land unsuitable for development.
after receiving the engineer report,fisher wrote to standard by letter,dated may,demanding that the company cease dumping on love property,revoking any authority standard may have had for such dumping,and requesting that standard remove the debris.fisher also stated that love suffered from senile dementia and that her ability to enter into a binding contract was questionable.
after attempting unsuccessfully to locate a copy of the first love agreement,standard obtained a second dumping agreement,signed either by love or by poole in love name,dated june.handwritten on the agreement was the notation agree to asp halt driveway dump loads of dirt in front yard.thereafter,standard paved love driveway and spread dirt on her land.
on november,love,by and through her daughter,filed suit in tennessee state court against standard,terry,bobo and the state of tennessee.love asserted various claims for damage to her property,including a claim for trespass.standard tendered defense of the love case to maryland and northern,but the insurers denied coverage on several different grounds.following amendments to the love complaint,the insurers again refused to defend standard.standard eventually settled the love matter for approximately.
on january,standard filed the instant declaratory judgment action alleging that the insurers breached their duties to defend and indemnify standard in connection with the love lawsuit.the parties consented to the jurisdiction of united states magistrate judge diane vescovo,pursuant to c.
after discovery,the parties filed for summary judgment.by order,dated may,magistrate judge vescovo granted summary judgment in standard favor as to the duty to defend,ruling that property damage resulting from trespass would constitute a covered claim under the applicable policies and that certain business risk exclusions relied upon by the insurers were inapplicable to claims by a stranger to the construction contract for damages resulting from a trespass.magistrate judge vescovo denied the motions as to the duty to indemnify,however,finding that there were genuine disputes of material fact as to whether a contract was entered into between love and standard through terry so as to trigger the business risk exclusions.
magistrate judge vescovo conducted a bench trial on june and,after which she entered findings of fact,conclusions of law,and a judgment in standard favor.specifically,magistrate judge vescovo found that terry disposal of construction debris on love property constituted a trespass because,although terry and standard believed it had love permission to dump the debris,in reality such consent was lacking because love herself was incompetent to enter into any agreement and because her daughter,poole,had neither actual nor implied authority to do so on love behalf.thus,no contract between love and standard ever existed,and terry dumping on the property was wrongful.
magistrate judge vescovo also concluded that standard had acted reasonably in settling the love case and that standard had not impaired the insurers subrogation rights.
the trial court awarded standard for its love defense costs for its settlement costs and in interest.
the insurers now appeal the grant of partial summary judgment to standard on the issue of the duty to defend,the denial of summary judgment on that issue to the insurers,and the judgment in favor of standard on the duty of indemnification.
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,employing the same legal standard applied by the district court.westfield ins.tech dry,cir citation omitted.the same standard applies where the district court denies summary judgment based upon purely legal grounds.id.the district court findings of fact are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard.see.a.
applicable law 
the district court held that tennessee law was applicable,and neither party contests this ruling.throughout the opinion and briefs,however,citations are made to authorities of many jurisdictions,since the policy provisions and cases interpreting them are reasonably uniform.we agree with this approach.
scope of coverage 
occurrence 
the insuring agreement of these policies states,in pertinent part 
a.we will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies.we will have the right and duty to defend any suit seeking those damages 
b.this insurance applies to bodily injury and property damage only if 
the bodily injury or property damage is caused by an occurrence that takes place in the coverage territory and 
the bodily injury or property damage occurs during the policy period.
the policies further define occurrence as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.the term accident,however,is not defined.in addition,the policy excludes from coverage bodily injury or property damage that is expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.
appellants argue that there was no coverage under the policies because standard intended to dump the debris on love land.this situation,it asserts,does not fit the policy definition of an occurrence.
the district court held that the dumping was an occurrence or accident within the meaning of the policy because,while the dumping was intentional,the fact that it was done without permission,thus making it wrongful,was not intended by the insured.
we agree with this conclusion.as pointed out by the trial court,if the resulting damages are unintended,the resulting damage is accidental even though the original acts were intentional.at order quoting state farm fire and cas.ctc development,so d.
