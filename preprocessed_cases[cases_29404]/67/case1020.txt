intervenor tryllous hossler appeals a november,order vacating a judgment lien,entered by the united states district court for the northern district of ohio,after intervenor filed a judgment lien pursuant to m b of the mandatory victims restitution act mvra,against an ohio property belonging to defendant anthony perry.this transaction occurred after perry pleaded guilty to various counts related to a securities fraud scheme and the court ordered restitution to his victims,including intervenor.
for the reasons set forth below,we vacate the order releasing intervenor judgment lien.
facts and procedural history 
on january,defendant anthony perry pleaded guilty to three counts related to securities fraud.the court sentenced perry to a prison sentence and ordered perry to make restitution in the amount of to his victims.intervenor,a year old woman,is one of perry victims.the restitution order required perry to reimburse her.the district court,however,ordered perry to make all payments to the clerk office so that the clerk could forward the money to victims pro rata until the full amount is paid.

the restitution order did not specify an order of priority among the victims.pursuant to the mandatory victims restitution act mvra,m b,intervenor obtained a judgment lien on perry wadsworth,ohio,real property.she recorded the lien in medina county,ohio,on august.
in september of,perry entered into a land contract and asset purchase agreement with dawn and boyd ferrebee,prospective buyers of the wadsworth property.perry owns a corporation as well,and perry also planned to sell the business assets to the ferrebees as well in an asset purchase agreement that would close with the closing of the land contract.the closing of the asset purchase agreement was contingent on the purchase of the land contract.if the land contract failed to close,the asset purchase agreement would fail to close as well 
perry civil attorney then moved to release intervenor lien on behalf of the other victims in findings and orders dated october,and november,the district court granted the motion and vacated the lien.intervenor filed her notice of appeal on november.
after the district court vacated the lien,the land contract and asset purchase agreement closed.perry turned the he received over to the district court,which disbursed the money proportionately to all investors,including intervenor.
on december,the government moved to dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction,arguing that intervenor lacked standing to appeal the district court order and that intervenor appeal was untimely.intervenor opposed the motion.on february,we ordered the parties to address both the standing and timeliness issues in their briefs.
discussion 
before reaching the merits,we must consider whether we lack jurisdiction because of intervenor allegedly untimely filing or intervenor lacks standing to prosecute this appeal.
we independently ascertain our own jurisdiction.united states true,cir.a timely notice of appeal is both a mandatory and a jurisdictional prerequisite.united states christunas,cir.
intervenor filed her notice of appeal days after the district court vacated her lien.appellees make a halfhearted attempt to argue that intervenor filed her notice of appeal late.fed.a provides 
time for filing a notice of appeal.
a in a civil case,except as provided in rules a b,a,and c,the notice of appeal required by rule must be filed with the district court within days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.
b when the united states or its officer or agency is a party,the notice of appeal may be filed by any party within days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.
fed.a covers civil proceedings.in contrast,fed.b provides less time for criminal appeals 
time for filing a notice of appeal 
a in a criminal case,a defendant notice of appeal must be filed in the district court within days after the later of 
i the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed or 
ii the filing of the government notice of appeal.
appellees claim that intervenor appeal falls under fed.b,which would make her notice of appeal thirteen days late.
this is not an ordinary appeal from a criminal judgment because it involves a civil matter initiated by a third party.fed.b a states that i n a criminal case,a defendant notice of appeal must be filed in the district court within days.emphasis added.intervenor was not the defendant below,and fed.b makes no provision for other parties 
in this and other circuits,a governs appeals in criminal cases.see,united states hayman.noting motions to set aside or correct criminal sentences are civil actions for purposes of fed.united states wade,holding petition for attorney fees filed by intervenors in federal criminal abatement proceeding was a civil case,rather than a criminal case,for purpose of determining time limits for taking appeal citing in re grand jury,cir palma united states,cir finding timely government appeal after days of the lower court decision,in a criminal proceeding,to restore defendant firearms privileges united states truesdale,cir holding action to recover attorneys fees arising out of a criminal matter is not part of the underlying criminal case,making fed.b applicable united states means,cir finding defendant had sixty days to appeal the denial of his motion to consolidate his original criminal proceedings with his motion to vacate his sentence filed pursuant to united states taylor,cir m any appealable orders technically in criminal cases look more civil than the return of bond money to motions under that parallel the civil petition for a writ of habeas corpus.united states martinson,cir treating motions for return of property pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure e as civil equitable proceedings even though brought under the rules of criminal procedure.thus,although the judgment lien is related to a criminal proceeding,a applies to intervenor appeal because a dispute over a lien is more appropriately classified as litigation.
we next consider intervenor standing.we find that she has standing under both the the mvra and article iii.
the victim and witness protection act vwpa,as amended in by the mandatory victims restitution act,provides a framework enabling victims of certain crimes to receive compensation from the perpetrators.see.the vwpa,as modified by the mvra,allows victims named in restitution orders to obtain and register a judgment lien on the defendant property that then operates as a lien on the property under state law.id.at m b,d a v.the law does not provide any limits on the victim ability to obtain a judgment lien and it provides no express means by which a district court can alter a victim lien rights post hoc.
the new law unquestionably reflects a dramatically more congressional attitude unlike its predecessor,restitution is mandatory rather than discretionary for defendants convicted of certain offenses.see a notwithstanding any other provision of law,when sentencing a defendant convicted of an offense described in subsection c,the court shall order that the defendant make restitution to the victim of the offense or,if the victim is deceased,to the victim estate.but see id.at c describing very limited circumstances,not applicable to this case,in which the district court may refrain from ordering restitution.also unlike the vwpa,district courts may no longer consider a defendant financial circumstances when determining the amount of restitution to be paid.id.at f a in each order of restitution,the court shall order restitution to each victim in the full amount of each victim losses as determined by the court and without consideration of the economic circumstances of the defendant.the mvra thus made restitution mandatory and creates a greater basis for victim.see a,a.most pertinent also unlike the new law allows victims to obtain judgment liens based on restitution orders.id.at m b.
significantly,the mvra also has its own legislative history.as the senate judiciary committee explained 
this provision the mvra is intended by the committee to clarify that the issuance of a restitution order is an integral part of the sentencing process that is to be governed by the same,but no greater,procedural protections as the rest of the sentencing process the committee believes that this provision fully comports with the requirements of the due process clause of the fifth amendment t he act ensures the protection of the victim right to a fair determination of the restitution owed.the committee believes this provision will ensure the streamlined administration of justice while at the same time protecting the rights of all individuals.
at,reprinted in.this makes clear that congress meant the mvra to protect the rights of all individuals,including victims,in a manner consistent with due process requirements.as the subsequent paragraphs explore,the heretofore unmentioned due process issue is an elephant in appellees rather tiny room.
to the extent any ambiguity exists as to whether intervenor has standing under the mvra,we must follow the doctrine of constitutional doubt and interpret statutes to avoid grave and doubtful constitutional questions.dep of corr.yeskey,d citing united states ex rel.attorney hudson.the government may not deprive people of property interests without due process.see,united states james daniel good real,d fdic mallen,d barry barchi,d.at least since louisville joint stock land bank radford,constitutionally protected property rights include the right to retain a lien until the indebtedness thereby secured is paid.id.at.
the mvra provides that a lien against the defendant property shall be a lien on the property of the defendant located in such state in the same manner and to the same extent and under the same conditions as a judgment of a court of general jurisdiction in that state.m b.in ohio,judgment liens create property interests,see central trust jensen,ohio,and the federal constitution prevents the deprivation of these ohio property interests without due process,see verba ohio cas.ins,cir.therefore,once intervenor obtained a valid lien under state fact not also obtained a property right of constitutional magnitude.
at least limited to the facts intervenor presents,interpreting the mvra as never authorizing appeals would create potentially significant due process problems.it is unclear from the record precisely what process intervenor received before the district court vacated her lien.she filed papers in opposition to the motion to vacate her lien,but it appears as though the court did not hold a hearing.more importantly,the district court order vacating the lien does not specify the law upon which the court relies.the order just assumes plenary authority to vacate state law judgment liens.
orders issued without legal basis,conflicts of interest,and generally mysterious conduct reflect exactly the sort of sloppy adjudication that a thorough district court proceeding,due process,is meant to avoid.of course,it may be that nothing untoward occurred below.process can vindicate superficially questionable behavior just as easily as it can uncover impropriety in seemingly ordinary activity.we would raise potentially serious due process issues by interpreting the mvra,when applied to this case,as not authorizing an appeal so that this court can determine whether the district court handled matters properly.particularly in light of the legislative history,it would make sense to read the statute in a manner that will allow intervenor to vindicate or attempt to vindicate her constitutionally recognized property interest.
our thesis is simple a judgment lien is a constitutionally protected property right.that is undisputed.congress may not make a law that interferes with constitutionally protected property rights without that law being subjected to meaningful judicial scrutiny.we must interpret the provisions of the mvra in a manner that avoids unwarranted constitutional problems.
article iii affords standing to for the purposes of appeal in some circumstances.yniguez arizona,cir stating that intervention for purposes of appeal may be appropriate if the intervenors meet traditional standing criteria quoting legal aid soc y of alameda county brennan,cir.
bryant yellen,d,is a leading example of a appeal bryant involved a federal statute governing the allocation of irrigation waters in the west meant to benefit smaller farmers by restricting access to the water to farmers holding no more than acres of land.id.at.the united states sued a california irrigation agency to force it to comply with the federal statute.id.at.the district court found that the statute did not apply to certain lands in california,owned in parcels larger than acres,that had vested rights to irrigation waters.id.the government did not appeal this decision.id.even though the government declined to appeal,the supreme court unanimously recognized the standing of a group of farmworkers to intervene and appeal the decision.id.at.the court reached this conclusion because the intervenors had a sufficient stake in the outcome of the controversy to afford them standing to appeal.id.at.
in linda richard,d,the court considered whether a had standing to challenge the government decision to apply a law in a particular manner.id.in linda,the appellant,the mother of an illegitimate child,sued to enjoin the local district attorney from failing to prosecute the father for refusing to pay child support.id.the district attorney generally prosecuted delinquent fathers of legitimate children but not those of illegitimate children.id the supreme court found the petitioner lacked standing,albeit in language that helps clarify the standing issues in this case.see id.at.
the court held that,appellant has failed to allege a sufficient nexus between her injury and the government action which she attacks to justify judicial intervention.id.at.the court conceded that the lack of child support meant that appellant suffered an injury,but stressed that t he party who invokes judicial power must be able to show that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as the result of a statute enforcement.id.at.citing massachusetts melon.emphasis added in linda.the court noted that the appellant has made no showing that her failure to secure support payments results from the nonenforcement of the child support statute rather,if appellant were granted the requested relief,it would result only in the jailing of the child father.the prospect that prosecution will,at least in the future,result in payment of support can,at best,be termed only speculative.id.thus,the court emphasized that the proposed remedy arrest would not redress the injury lack of child support.stated differently,the injury lack of child support was not traceable to the alleged impropriety.as the court concluded,c ertainly the direct relationship between the alleged injury and the claim sought to be adjudicated,which previous decisions of this court suggest is a prerequisite to standing,is absent in this case.id.
the court decided linda thirty years ago,and the court has since developed the direct relationship standing requirement into two more precise redressability,and fairly traceable.see,whitmore arkansas,d simon.welfare rights,d.in its first use of the specific phrase fairly traceable,the supreme court explained that standing requires that the injury is indeed fairly traceable to the defendant acts or omissions.village of arlington heights metro.housing dev,d citing,inter alia,linda,at.the court has described redressability as the causal connection between the injury and the relief sought.see allen wright,d explaining that redressability depends on whether the prospect of obtaining relief from the injury as a result of a favorable ruling is too speculative.
ultimately,in valley forge christian college americans united for separation of church state,d,the supreme court rearticulated its prior standing decisions in a test for standing someone has standing if he or she suffers an injury in fact that is fairly traceable to the alleged misconduct and redressable by the relief sought.id.at.see also allen,at.a plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.citing valley forge,at.
the dissent cites four cases for the critical proposition that b ecause restitution is part of criminal sentencing and is penal in nature,victims of crime do not suffer an injury in fact when a district court modifies or terminates a restitution order.given that the supreme court has held that such abstract injuries as aesthetic harm,see united states scrap,d,and stigmatization,see heckler mathews,d,qualify as constitutionally cognizable injuries,it is hard to accept that an inadequate restitution order conceivably depriving someone of thousands of dollars would not constitute an injury in fact when the statute has authorized restitution.if victims lack standing to challenge restitution orders,the justiciability defect has much more to do with the redressability and fairly traceable prongs of the standing test than with a lack of an injury in fact.
first,the dissent cites united states mindel,cir,in which the defendant attempted to appeal the district court decision to rescind a judgment it previously entered pursuant to the vwpa with regard to the disposition of the defendant property.id.at.next,the dissent discusses united states johnson,cir,which involved a bank attempting to appeal the district court decision to rescind a restitution order issued pursuant to the vwpa.id.at.third,the dissent references united states schad,wl,cir,an unpublished order that considered whether a victim could participate as a party to obtain a garnishment order.id.at.finally,the dissent cites one of this court unpublished rule orders,united states curtis,wl,cir.the order noted that the victim,as a to the criminal case,would not have standing to challenge the restitution order.id.this standing remark was entirely tangential to curtis,which involved a defendant appeal of a district court order denying his request to end interest charges on a restitution order.id.curtis did not involve a.
from the outset,none of the cases cited involve the mvra.curtis never mentions the mvra because curtis has little to do with the present issue,and courts decided mindel,johnson,and schad before congress implemented the mvra schad relied largely on the reasoning in both mindel and johnson,see schad,wl,and mindel primarily on johnson,see mindel,at.johnson,in turn,depends extensively on vwra legislative history,see johnson,at,which the mvra has now superseded.
notably,johnson also gains support from kelly robinson,d,in which the supreme court held that restitution obligations imposed as probation conditions are not dischargeable in bankruptcy proceedings.see johnson,at.according to the court 
the criminal justice system is not operated primarily for the benefit of victims,but for the benefit of society as a whole.thus,it is concerned not only with punishing the offender,but also with rehabilitating him.although restitution does resemble a judgment for the benefit of the victim,the context in which it is imposed undermines that conclusion.the victim has no control over the amount of restitution awarded or over the decision to award restitution.moreover,the decision to impose restitution generally does not turn on the victim injury,but on the penal goals of the state and the situation of the defendant.
kelly,at.although the rationale uses the phrase injury in fact,the reasoning of these opinions essentially tracks kelly.as the mindel court argued 
the eleventh circuit,however,has considered this issue and has held that crime victims do not have standing to appeal a district court rescission of a criminal restitution order.see united states johnson,cir.distinguishing the divergent interests of victims from those of the former being compensatory,while the latter eleventh circuit determined that a restitution order serves a penal rather than a compensatory purpose.id.at.thus,the victims had not suffered injury in fact,and therefore did not have standing to appeal the district court rescission order.
at.another case observing that victims may not appeal restitution orders,united states brown,cir,uses language taken from kelly almost verbatim 
t hough the vwpa was intended to compensate the victim,it does so in a manner distinct from the normal functioning of a civil adjudication.a court imposing an order of restitution is required to consider the defendant ability to pay.a.the victim may therefore be awarded less than full compensation solely because of the offender financial circumstances.furthermore,unlike a civil suit,the victim is not a party to a sentencing hearing and therefore has only a limited ability to influence the outcome.the victim can not control the presentation of evidence during either the criminal trial or the sentencing hearing and is not even guaranteed the right to testify about the extent of his losses.neither can he appeal a determination he deems inadequate.
id.at.since the cases holding that victims can not appeal restitution orders depend so heavily on the vwpa,the differences between the vwpa and the mvra help show why these older decisions do not preclude intervenor from appealing the district court elimination of her property interest.
as these cases mention,the vwpa does not guarantee the victim much under the vwpa,the victim may have received less based on the offender financial circumstances,and the victim had no right to receive anything at all.the vwpa also did not afford victims much ability to influence the outcome.id.at.as kelly explained,under the vwpa,the decision to impose restitution generally does not turn on the victim injury,but on the penal goals of the state and the situation of the defendant.at.none of this is true anymore.
as explained in section ii a,the mvra makes restitution mandatory for victims of certain offenses.see a.thus,the victims of many crimes now have a right to restitution.also unlike the vwpa,district courts may no longer consider a defendant financial circumstances when determining the amount of restitution to be paid.id.at f a.the mvra invites victims to participate in the sentencing process through the united states probation office id.at d.these changes reflect a more fundamental shift in the purpose of restitution,as explained in the mvra legislative history.the new restitution scheme is not merely a means of punishment and rehabilitation,but an attempt to provide those who suffer the consequences of crime with some means of recouping the personal and financial losses,at.
each case the dissent cites,mindel,johnson,and schad,involved the appeal of an order rescinding or modifying a restitution order,not an order vacating a constitutionally cognizable property interest see mindel,at johnson,at schad,wl.essentially,both the government and the dissent reason that because a victim lacks the injury in fact required to appeal a restitution order,a victim must also lack the injury in fact required to appeal anything sufficiently related to a restitution order.this flimsy principle forms the core of the appellees rationale for claiming intervenor did not suffer an injury in fact.
the issue,as the dissent frames it,is whether a litigant suffers an injury in fact when a district court rescinds or modifies its own restitution order which formed the basis from which the litigant had secured a state court judgment lien.even assuming,however,the dissent is correct in its view of the scope of the district court order,intervenor has undoubtedly suffered an injury in fact because the district court vacated intervenor property interest after it had been secured by the judgment lien.see valley forge christian,at.verba,at.standing looks at whether the challenged conduct vacating the judgment lien is the cause of her injury,and whether the relief requested restoring the lien would redress the injury.standing measures the distance between the intervenor demand and the problem source,and intervenor demand and the problem solution,but not the connection between intervenor demand and elements of perry trial and sentencing that might be sine qua non of intervenor complaint,but are not causa causans of her problem.
by this point,one should recognize two serious problems with appellees position.first,despite their attempt to characterize the inability to appeal a vwpa restitution order as a result of an inadequate injury in fact,the fairly traceable and redressability portions of the standing analysis offer a much more reasonable explanation for the inability to appeal a vwpa order.second,appellees are not seriously contending that the deprivation of a constitutionally protected liberty interest is not a constitutionally cognizable injury it is also easy to show that intervenor injury is fairly traceable to the order of which she complains and that a favorable ruling from this court would redress her injury.
beginning with the first issue,the vwpa made it difficult for victims to appeal restitution orders because their claimed injuries,inadequate restitution payments,were not fairly traceable to purportedly unlawful conduct,nor necessarily redressable by judicial action.as noted,under the vwpa,a court did not have to award restitution.restitution fell within the district court discretion,which meant that a decision to award restitution,or award arguably insufficient restitution,was not fairly traceable to any statutory violation.furthermore,one can plausibly claim that a restitution order found insufficient by a victim could not be redressed judicially because,as the case law quoted above emphasized,the vwpa used restitution only as a punitive and rehabilitative tool,not a mechanism to partly recompense victims.thus,particular features of the vwpa absent from the the decisions that deny standing to appeal a vwpa restitution order.
second,whether or not standing would exist for someone to appeal a restitution order under the mvra,it definitely exists for intervenor to appeal an order destroying a protected property interest.assuming the district court acted illegally in vacating intervenor lien,her loss is fairly traceable to the district court order.a decision by this court reversing the district court order would redress intervenor injury.this is straightforward.
once one concludes that intervenor has suffered an injury in fact,fairly traceable to the wrong of which she complains and redressable by the relief she seeks,courts must still consider whether prudential concerns make an appeal improper.this means that the alleged injury must fall within the zone of interests protected by the statute at issue.see data processing serv,camp,d dist,marine eng r beneficial ass burnley,cir.
the zone of interest test focuses on congressional intent.clarke securities indus,d.the challenged statute is victims rights legislation that expressly authorizes the disputed judgment lien.intervenor has raised an issue within the mvra zone of interests.
prudential concerns also prohibit us from affording standing to parties that attempt to raise nothing more than abstract grievances better handled by the legislative or executive branches,see.taxpayers union,romer,cir,groves sons fulton county,cir,or from affording standing to parties attempting to assert the legal rights of third parties.see,united states raines,d,tileston ullman.other circuits to have considered these issues have found that prudential concerns do not prevent a nonparty from appealing when that party participated in the proceedings and the equities favor hearing the appeal commodity futures trading comm topworth int l,cir davis scott,cir krebs,valley motors,cir searcy philips elecs.am,cir see also west orpheum,cir the reason for the appeals doctrine is that if not a party,the putative appellant is not concluded by the decree,and is not therefore aggrieved by it.but if the decree affects his interests,he is often allowed to appeal.
first,intervenor participated in the proceedings below because she filed papers in opposition to perry request that the district court vacate her lien.intervenor counsel also attended the original sentencing hearing.second,equities favor permitting this appeal.there is a substantial question as to whether the district court had the authority to vacate the lien because no mvra provision specifically grants district courts that right.since intervenor had an undisputed property interest,the district court decision to revoke that interest adversely affected intervenor interests even though she did not participate as a party to the criminal proceeding.as explained above,intervenor proposed,by letter,that she transfer her lien to the district court fund to remove any impediment to perry attempt to sell his assets,after which the court would resolve the legal issue of intervenor priority.the victims,albeit represented by perry counsel,declined intervenor offer.nevertheless,intervenor made an attempt to solve the problem.equity favors permitting this appeal.finally,intervenor is not attempting to raise some sort of generalized policy grievance nor does she seek to litigate someone else rights.see,raines,at.tileston,at.taxpayers union,at groves,at.
intervenor thus meets both the prudential and constitutional requirements for article iii standing.
because intervenor has standing under both the mvra and article iii itself,we proceed to consider the merits of her claim.intervenor argues that the district court had no authority to release her lien because the mvra does not provide such authority.appellees counter that the court below had the necessary authority under the all writs act,a.appellate courts review a district court assertion of jurisdiction under the all writs act de novo.see,united states,cir in re prudential ins.of am.sales practice,cir.
the all writs act provides that t he supreme court and all courts established by act of congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.the all writs act enables federal courts to issue such commands as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate and prevent the frustration of orders it has previously issued in its exercise of jurisdiction otherwise obtained.united states,d.the supreme court has also stressed,however,that the all writs act does not authorize courts to issue ad hoc writs whenever compliance with statutory procedures appears inconvenient or less appropriate.bureau of corr.united states marshals,d.where a statute specifically addresses the particular issue at hand,it is that authority,and not the all writs act,that is controlling.id.
although appellees cite two cases in which a court used the all writs act in connection with a restitution order,neither decision helps us much with respect to the issues the parties presently litigate.first,appellees cite united states friedman,cir.in friedman,the district court,pursuant to the all writs act,ordered the defendant to liquidate certain assets and deliver the proceeds to the marshals service,but only after all secured claims,liens,and other costs associated with the real estate closing are paid.id.at.unisource,a company not a victim of the defendant crimes,claimed to hold an equitable lien on the defendant property.id.unisource did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the defendant assets,however,because the marshals confiscated the proceeds.id.unisource then asked the district court for its share.id.at.the government argued that only victims may receive restitution,and that the court lacked authority under the vwpa to release funds to unisource stemming from the marshals seizure.id.the district court disagreed and paid unisource.on appeal,the first circuit affirmed,finding that the court original order protected and the all writs act gave the court the authority to issue a further order to prevent the frustration of its original order.id.
other than the hopelessly vague proposition that district courts may sometimes use the all writs act in relation to restitution orders,it is unclear what friedman tells us.friedman has little to do with the scenario we presently consider because no one argued in friedman that the second order either conflicted with the vwpa or violated a constitutional right.
second,appellees cite united states venneri,in which a district court vacated a defendant conviction by writ of error coram nobis because the defendant was originally convicted pursuant to a statute later found unconstitutional.id.at.the defendant was originally ordered to pay restitution to one of his victims.id.the court considered whether it had jurisdiction under the all writs act to direct the victim to repay restitution to the defendant.id.although the court noted the lack of statutory authority for such an order,it found that the all writs act provided the necessary mechanism.id.at.unlike the present case,however,there was no dispute in venneri that the victim lacked entitlement to the restitution award.id.as the court explained,d espite the dearth of statutory authority,it remains indisputable that the victim must repay the defendant.id.thus,the victim had no entitlement to the restitution,nor did the victim have a property right to the money.neither venneri nor friedman addresses the situation presently before us.
at first glance,the all writs act seems to authorize a district court to issue any subsequent order in furtherance of an initial order as long as the initial order was lawful.as one would expect,however,even if a court properly issues its initial order,it may not use the all writs act to issue a subsequent order to effectuate the first order if the subsequent order is itself unconstitutional.see,united states city of new york,cir nor can the all writs act confer on the courts the power to ignore the case or controversy requirement,which is rooted in article iii of the constitution definition of judicial power.in re single premium deferred annuities ins.litig,cir the act can not be used to circumvent or supersede the constitutional limitations of the eleventh amendment.this is consistent with the text of the all writs act,which only authorizes courts to issue writs agreeable to the usages and principles of law.a greeable to the usages and principles of law also suggests that courts may not use the all writs act to issue a second order to effectuate an initial,lawful order if the second order works by violating some other statutory provision.
this case involves two statutory provisions seemingly operating in conflict.in its entirety,m b states 
at the request of a victim named in a restitution order,the clerk of the court shall issue an abstract of judgment certifying that a judgment has been entered in favor of such victim in the amount specified in the restitution order.upon registering,recording,docketing,or indexing such abstract in accordance with the rules and requirements relating to judgments of the court of the state where the district court is located,the abstract of judgment shall be a lien on the property of the defendant located in such state in the same manner and to the same extent and under the same conditions as a judgment of a court of general jurisdiction in that state.
this provision,which authorizes intervenor lien,contains no language giving the court any right to vacate a lien if it conflicts with the restitution order.title d a v references m b by mandating that t he probation officer shall,prior to submitting the presentence report under subsection a,to the extent practicable provide notice to all identified victims of the availability of a lien in favor of the victim pursuant to subsection m b.
although the statute unambiguously allows victims to impose judgment liens in accordance with state law,the statute gives sentencing courts significant flexibility to tailor restitution orders to particular circumstances.as i explains,a restitution order may direct the defendant to make a single,payment,partial payments at specified intervals,payments,or a combination of payments at specified intervals and payments.the statute also clarifies that i f the court finds that more than victim has sustained a loss requiring restitution by a defendant,the court may provide for a different payment schedule for each victim based on the type and amount of each victim loss and accounting for the economic circumstances of each victim.f i.the mvra never mentions pro rata distribution,but f a and i appear to give trial courts the right to require reimbursement in that fashion.by definition,pro rata distribution means that no victim has priority,but a judgment lien is a device designed to give the priority.in this sense,the statutory provisions appear to conflict 
one of the most basic canons of statutory interpretation is that a more specific provision takes precedence over a more general one.see,green bock laundry mach,d stating that a general statutory rule does not govern unless there is no more specific rule radzanower touche ross,d holding that the general venue provision of the securities exchange act of does not trump the specific venue provision of the national bank act,cir a fundamental canon of statutory interpretation holds that,when there is an apparent conflict between a specific provision and a more general one,the more specific one governs,regardless of the priority of the provisions enactment.citing cal.ex rel.sacramento metro.air quality mgmt.dist.united states,cir.as the supreme court explained 
the reason and philosophy of the rule is,that when the mind of the legislator has been turned to the details of a subject,and he has acted upon it,a subsequent statute in general terms,or treating the subject in a general manner,and not expressly contradicting the original act,shall not be considered as intended to affect the more particular or positive previous provisions,unless it is absolutely necessary to give the latter act such a construction,in order that its words shall have any meaning at all.
radzanower,at.
the mvra expressly references a victim right to a judgment lien on two occasions,see d a v,m b,and,as recounted above,provides significant detail,see m b.in contrast,the mvra never mentions pro rata distribution.rather,pro rata distribution is simply one alternative a court might adopt under the highly general and flexible grants of authority in f a and i.in accordance with the specific over general canon of statutory construction,we are more inclined to read the lien provision as an exception to the trial court general authority to structure restitution orders,rather than assuming that the more vague powers congress granted in f a and i are an exception to the very precise lien provision.this suggests that federal courts do not have the authority to vacate an judgment lien based on their right to enforce mvra orders under the all writs act.
as already noted,the supreme court has made clear that we must construe statutes to avoid constitutional doubt when it is reasonably possible to do so.debartolo.gulf coast constr.trades council,d defining the canon of constitutional doubt as one that requires courts,where an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems,to construe the statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of congress crowell benson.when the validity of an act of the congress is drawn in question,and even if a serious doubt of constitutionality is raised,it is a cardinal principle that this court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided.hooper california.the elementary rule is that every reasonable construction must be resorted to,in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality.murray v.the charming betsy,cranch.a n act of congress ought never to be construed to violate the law of nations if any other possible construction remains.marshall.a construction that permits district courts to destroy constitutionally protected property interests without due process violates this precept if another reasonable construction is fairly possible.crowell,at.
there is another fairly possible construction of the statute.one might reasonably assume that congress only meant to allow states to record liens that reflect restitution orders,not liens that conflict with or exceed restitution orders.consider again the language mvra judgment lien provision,which states that,u pon registering,recording,docketing,or indexing the restitution order and judgment in accordance with the rules and requirements relating to judgments of the court of the state where the district court is located,the restitution order and judgment shall be a lien on the property of the defendant located in such state.m b emphasis added.the lien is then recognized and handled in the same manner and to the same extent and under the same conditions as a judgment of a court of general jurisdiction in that state.id.it seems more than fairly possible that congress meant for victims to obtain judgment liens in a manner that complied with the relevant state procedure.
no one can get a lien for more than the value of the supporting judgment.yet ohio perhaps erroneously gave intervenor such a lien,apparently without regard for the underlying judgment and restitution order authorizing only pro rata distribution.ohio may have erred,and perry could have moved in the ohio judiciary,rather than the federal district court,to vacate or modify the lien.such an action by perry protects the due process rights associated with the lien,because under ohio law,judgment liens receive constitutional protections,see central trust jensen,ohio,and a judgment by an ohio state court vacating a judgment lien is a final appealable order,see roach roach,ohio.this interpretation of the law protects intervenor due process rights and is fairly possible given the statutory language,further suggesting that federal courts do not have the authority to vacate an judgment lien based on their right to enforce mvra orders under the all writs act.
we may not construe a statute in a manner that renders part of the law superfluous.see,regions hosp.shalala,d united states nordic,d fed.election comm conservative political action,d.more than a century ago,the supreme court explained 
we are not at liberty to construe any statute so as to deny effect to any part of its language.it is a cardinal rule of statutory construction that significance and effect shall,if possible,be accorded to every word.as early as in bacon abridgment,it was said that a statute ought,upon the whole,to be so construed that,if it can be prevented,no clause,sentence,or word shall be superfluous,void,or insignificant.this rule has been repeated innumerable times.
market hoffman.thus,any interpretation of the mvra that makes one if its provisions irrelevant is presumptively incorrect.
appellees position,however,has exactly this effect.if one asserts that the district court always has the authority to invalidate a victim judgment lien and impose unsecured pro rata distribution,then the mvra would read as though the provision granting victims the right to judgment liens did not exist.victims could obtain judgment liens only at the sentencing court unlimited discretion.
the proposed alternative discussed victims to challenge an allegedly improper lien in state court rather than allowing a district court to invalidate it not render the judgment lien provision superfluous.at minimum,m b would compel state courts to approve judgment liens consistent with restitution orders to the extent allowed under state law,thereby giving the victim a security interest in the defendant property,even if because of the restitution order language that security interest is not permitted to rise above the victim pro rata share.thus,m b would still serve a purpose.
the rule against surplusage further supports the conclusion that federal courts do not have the authority to vacate an judgment lien based on their right to enforce orders under the all writs act.
finally,appellees argue that accepting intervenor position would create a race to the courthouse,if victims can obtain judgment liens despite a court order requiring pro rata distribution,then the victim fortunate enough to file the first lien has the greatest chance of recovery,and victims will have to compete for priority.
the mvra is not optimally structured.united states locke,d acknowledging that,for the statute under consideration,congress might have acted with greater clarity or foresight united states jackson,admitting that the statute under consideration was l amentably not meticulously drafted.regardless,the race to the courthouse is a concern.district courts have discretion to issue all sorts of orders that would interfere with the race to the courthouse pure pro rata distribution,distribution to the neediest victims first,distribution to the most seriously injured first,pro rata within classes of victims,and so forth.see f a and i.in all cases,victims who attempt to secure judgment liens beyond what the sentencing court authorized should fail to have their liens recognized by the state,and if the liens are recognized anyway,victims could attempt to vacate them in appropriate state court proceedings.victims would not scramble to perfect liens that should not and thus probably can not be perfected under state law,and would remain subject to challenge 
the feared race to the courthouse is specious and three major canons of statutory construction suggest that a victim has a right to a secured interest in the defendant property despite other less precise statutory language that appellees claim allows district courts to vacate judgment liens.a court may not use the all writs act to issue a second order to enforce an initial order when the second order renders statutory language superfluous and raises constitutional questions.consequently,the district court did not have the authority under the all writs act,a,to vacate intervenor judgment lien.
those who would disagree must demonstrate not just that the district court had the authority to issue an order altering or revoking a judgment lien,but that the order was substantively correct.
the all writs act only allows the district court to issue an order attempting to effectuate its earlier order,at.therefore,assuming the district court had authority to vacate intervenor judgment lien,that authority only extended to the part of intervenor lien that violated the court initial pro rata distribution order.defendant owed intervenor.assume,hypothetically,that there were only two other victims one victim a owed,and another victim b owed.under pro rata distribution,victim a would receive approximately seventeen cents of every dollar recovered,intervenor would receive approximately cents of every dollar recovered,and victim b would receive fifty cents of every dollar recovered.if,continuing the hypothetical,intervenor obtained a lien against the defendant house for the full,that conflicts with pro rata distribution.however,vacating the lien the district court did in this conflicts with pro rata distribution,because pro rata distribution would entitle intervenor to of anything recovered.again assuming the all writs act affords the district court has the power to alter judgment liens,the court would only have the authority to modify the hypothetical intervenor lien to the extent it would have entitled her to more than of the defendant assets value.
although the math is much more complex in the case presently before us than the calculations in the hypothetical,the principle is exactly the same.the court below did not merely vacate the portion intervenor judgment lien that conflicted with the initial pro rata order,the district court vacated the entire judgment lien.thus,the second order actually exceeded the first order victims have any rights at all under the statute judgment lien provision,intervenor had the right to a judgment lien large enough to cover her pro rata share.in this sense,the order vacating the judgment lien did not correctly apply the all writs act authority appellees mistakenly believes the district court possesses.
conclusion 
both appellees and the dissent misconstrue intervenor two compelling arguments for standing,either one of which provides sufficient basis for us to address the merits.with regard to the merits,the district court had no authority under the all writs act to vacate intervenor statutorily authorized judgment lien.anyone wishing to argue that the lien conflicted with the district court pro rata order had the right to dispute the lien in the ohio courts.
for all the aforementioned reasons,we vacate the order releasing intervenor judgment lien.
i dissent because i believe that hossler lacks standing to contest the district court order releasing her judgment lien.the district court was enforcing the terms of its prior restitution order,which was entered at sentencing in a criminal case in which hossler was not a party.the majority broad interpretation of the mvra would allow victims to appeal numerous decisions relating to the enforcement of restitution orders and would lead to victims participating in criminal proceedings in a manner that congress never intended when it enacted the mvra.hossler has not been deprived of a constitutionally protected right to receive restitution she has been deprived of the opportunity to enforce a restitution order in a manner that was contrary to what was intended by the district court and in a way that harms the rights of perry other victims to receive the restitution to which they are also entitled.
standing is a threshold issue in every case before a federal court.united states mcveigh,cir.to establish standing,plaintiffs must show that their claimed injury is personal,particularized,concrete,and otherwise judicially cognizable.raines byrd,d emphasis added.standing involves both constitutional requirements,which are based on the case or controversy clause in article iii,and prudential limitations,which are crafted by the courts.lujan defenders of wildlife,d mcclure ashcroft,cir.t o satisfy article iii standing requirements,a plaintiff must show it has suffered an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d citing lujan,at.beyond the constitutional requirements in article iii,the federal judiciary has also adhered to a set of prudential principles that bear on the question of standing.valley forge christian coll.americans united for separation of church and state,d.one of these prudential requirements is that the interest of a plaintiff seeking standing under a particular statutory provision must be within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.united states mindel,cir quoting allen wright,d.under the zone of interests test,plaintiffs lack standing if their interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it can not reasonably be assumed that congress intended to permit the suit.united states grundhoefer,cir quoting clarke sec.indus.ass n,d.
the district court granted the perry investors motion to vacate hossler lien upon finding that the lien would give preferential treatment to hossler.at sentencing,perry expressed a strong desire to make restitution,and his counsel described a plan for selling his property and liquidating his assets in order to pay his restitution obligations.the district court found that perry restitution payments should be made to the clerk of courts,who would then forward the money to the victims pro rata until the full amount is paid.in granting the perry investors motion to vacate hossler judgment lien,the district court noted that its restitution order unequivocally required that restitution be distributed to all the perry investors pro rata,and concluded that hossler lien would give preferential treatment to only one of perry numerous is plainly inconsistent with the court prior restitution order.for both constitutional and prudential reasons,hossler lacks standing to challenge the district court order.
prior to the mvra enactment in,courts consistently held that victims did not have standing to appeal a district court decision modifying or enforcing a restitution order.see mindel,at holding that beneficiary of criminal restitution order lacked standing to challenge modification of sentence to rescind restitution order united states johnson,cir.these courts have noted that while a criminal restitution order resembles a judgment for the benefit of the victim,restitution is penal,not compensatory.kelly robinson,d.thus,t he direct,distinct,and palpable injury in a criminal sentencing proceeding plainly falls only on the defendant who is being sentenced and he alone suffers the direct consequences.grundhoefer,at see also linda richard,d finding that a private citizen generally lacks standing to contest the policies of the prosecuting authority when he himself is neither prosecuted nor threatened with prosecution.because restitution is part of criminal sentencing and is penal in nature,victims of crime do not suffer an injury in fact when a district court modifies or terminates a restitution order.see mindel,at johnson,at united states schad,wl,at cir.april,holding that a crime victim lacked standing to appeal the district court order terminating the victim right to continue garnishing the defendant wages pursuant to a criminal restitution order.
as the majority opinion notes,mindel,johnson,and schad all involved appeals from orders rescinding or modifying restitution orders.in johnson,for example,the district court rescinded its prior restitution order when the defendant became delinquent in her restitution payments that were supposed to be made to the victim bank in monthly installments.id.at.the bank appealed the district court order rescinding the restitution obligation,and the eleventh circuit held that the bank lacked standing because it had not suffered a direct injury adequate to satisfy article iii constitutional requirements.id.at.but just as a victim does not suffer an injury in fact when a district court modifies or rescinds a restitution order,hossler has not suffered an injury in fact in this case because the district court decision vacating her judgment lien was in essence enforcing the terms of its prior restitution order.the fact that the district court in this case vacated hossler judgment lien instead of modifying or rescinding its restitution order does not mean that she has somehow been injured in a more concrete or particularized way than the plaintiffs in mindel and johnson.the majority opinion asserts that the mvra does not provide an express means by which a district court can alter a victim lien rights post hoc,but presumably a district court does exactly that when it rescinds or modifies restitution orders.however,prior cases have held that in those circumstances,victims have not suffered injury in fact and do not have standing to appeal.similarly,hossler has not suffered an injury in fact because the district court denied her the opportunity to make an end run around the schedule set forth in the court previous restitution order 
even if hossler has suffered an injury in fact different from that suffered by the victim bank in johnson,for example,prudential limitations counsel against according hossler standing to challenge the district court order in this case.critical to the issue of hossler standing is the context in which her appeal occurs hossler is appealing an order entered in a criminal case in which she was not a party.if the perry investors had gone to state court and filed a lawsuit seeking to vacate her judgment lien,hossler certainly would have standing to appeal from any subsequent decision by the state court,but that is not what is happening here.nothing in the language or legislative history of the mvra indicates that congress intended to provide victims with a private remedy to sue or appeal restitution decisions made in the context of criminal cases in which the victims were not parties 
as the majority notes,a comparison between the mvra and its predecessor,the vwpa,is relevant here because courts ha
