several owners and former owners of rental properties in paul,minnesota brought these consolidated actions,challenging the city of paul the city enforcement of its housing code.the property owners appeal the district court dismissal of their claims on summary judgment,denial of sanctions for spoliation of evidence,and denial of discovery regarding appellee steve magner.we affirm in all respects except the dismissal of appellants disparate impact claim under the fair housing act.
background 
in,the city enacted the property maintenance code the housing code,which e stablishes minimum maintenance standards for all structures and premises for basic equipment and facilities for light,ventilation,heating and sanitation for safety from fire for crime prevention for space,use and location and for safe and sanitary maintenance of all structures and premises.paul.sometime shortly before or during,the city established the department of neighborhood housing and property improvement dnhpi as an executive department responsible for administering and enforcing the housing code.dnhpi was empowered to inspect all one and dwellings and administer and enforce laws regulating maintenance of residential property.
appellee andy dawkins was the director of dnhpi from to.in that position,dawkins favored housing over rental housing for the sake of the neighborhood.toward that end,dawkins increased the level of housing code enforcement targeted at rental properties.in addition to responding to citizen complaints about particular properties,dnhpi inspectors conducted proactive sweeps to detect housing code violations.furthermore,dawkins raised inspection standards by directing dnhpi inspectors to code to the max,that is,writing up every just what was called writing up all the nearby just the reported properties.lastly,dnhpi instituted a system for inspectors and observers to report housing code violations.dawkins expected that this vigilance would help dnhpi raise an additional in revenue,which would cover the costs of additional inspections.
under dawkins leadership,dnhpi also increased its housing code enforcement efforts regarding problem properties.the dnhpi website defined a problem property by saying if you live next door to a problem property you know it constant calls to get rid of the junk,intolerable behavior by occupants and guests,dnhpi sought to compel property owners to take greater responsibility for their properties or,alternatively,force changes in ownership.to achieve its objectives,dnhpi employed a variety of strategies for dwellings,including orders to correct or abate conditions,condemnations,registration,fees for excessive consumption of municipal services,tenant evictions,seizures,revocations of rental registrations,actions,and if necessary,court actions.dnhpi coordinated its efforts with the paul police and an assistant city attorney.
in addition,the city used a procedure known as code compliance certification to require rental properties to meet current housing and building standards.the contours of this procedure are unclear,but it appears that the city required rental property owners to acquire code compliance certification if a property was remodeled or deemed a dangerous structure,a nuisance building,or vacant.code compliance inspections were conducted by the city office of license,inspections,and environmental protection,which would evaluate the building structure,plumbing,electrical condition,and mechanical condition.code compliance certification allegedly forced property owners to undertake expensive renovations,especially with regard to older properties that were exempt from current building codes under minnesota law.
appellants own or formerly owned rental properties in the city.appellants individual rental portfolios ranged from one property to over forty properties.they rented primarily to households,and a majority of their tenants received federal rent assistance.the parties agree that generally made up a disproportionate percentage of tenants in private housing in paul,and specifically,appellants claim that they rented to a percentage of.
appellants properties were subject to the city housing code enforcement from to.they received code enforcement orders that,in many cases,cited between ten and violations per property for conditions including rodent infestation,missing locks,inadequate sanitation facilities,inadequate heat,inoperable smoke detectors,broken or missing doors and screens,and broken or missing guardrails or handrails.several of appellants properties were designated as problem properties,subject to code compliance certification,or,in a few cases,both.as a result of the city housing code enforcement,appellants suffered increased maintenance costs,fees,condemnations,and were forced to sell properties in some instances.
in and,appellants filed these actions against the city,the city mayor randy kelly,the city fire inspector michael urmann,a police officer who worked with dnhpi dean kohnen,and several dnhpi employees,including dawkins,a supervisor steve magner,and several code enforcement officers we refer to appellees collectively as the city unless specification is warranted.appellants legal claims and the relevant facts are described in greater detail below.
the district court consolidated appellants actions and resolved them together.the court referred several discovery matters to a magistrate judge,including appellants motion and renewed motion for sanctions due to the city alleged discovery abuses and appellants motion to compel discovery of steve magner personal records.the magistrate judge denied both of those motions,and the district court affirmed.then,the city moved for summary judgment.after a hearing,the district court granted the city motion for summary judgment in its entirety.appellants challenge the summary judgment order,the denial of sanctions,and the denial of discovery regarding magner personal records.

fair housing act 
the fair housing act fha prohibits property owners and municipalities from blocking or impeding the provision of housing on the basis of race,color,religion,sex,familial status,or national origin.a b.appellants argue that summary judgment was inappropriate because there is sufficient evidence to support their claims under the following theories disparate treatment,disparate impact,retaliation,and failure to affirmatively further fair housing.we address each theory in turn 
disparate treatment 
claims under the fha are tested under the same framework as title vii claims.ring first interstate mortgage,cir applying the title vii analysis to a fha disparate treatment claim.the standard is the defendant s treat the plaintiff s less favorably than others based on their race,color,religion,sex or national origin appellants contend that the manner in which the city enforced its housing code was discriminatory.specifically,appellants allege that the city enforced the housing code more aggressively with regard to their properties because they rented to a disproportionately high amount of racial minorities,particularly.
proof of discriminatory purpose is crucial for a disparate treatment claim.int l of teamsters united states.summary judgment is warranted if the plaintiff can not produce either a direct evidence of discriminatory intent or b indirect evidence creating an inference of discriminatory intent under the mcdonnell framework.griffith city of des moines,f d,cir see also lake county highway dep t,cir applying the direct evidence and mcdonnell douglas frameworks in the fha context.the district court concluded that appellants did not assert a claim under the mcdonnell douglas framework,and we agree.presentation of the mcdonnell douglas framework on appeal raises new issues and is therefore not appropriate for our consideration.see cronquist city of minneapolis,cir refusing to consider a discrimination theory because it was not presented to the district court universal title ins.united states,cir new issues are generally not considered on appeal.as such,we turn to whether there is direct evidence that discriminatory animus motivated the city code enforcement actions.
direct evidence is evidence showing a specific link between the alleged discriminatory animus and the challenged decision,sufficient to support a finding by a reasonable fact finder that an illegitimate criterion actually motivated the adverse employment action.griffith.at quotation omitted.direct evidence does not include stray remarks in the workplace,statements by nondecisionmakers,or statements by decisionmakers unrelated to the decisional process itself.twymon fargo,cir alteration,quotation marks,and citations omitted.
appellants cite many statements that purportedly show the discriminatory attitude of housing code enforcement in the city.nearly all of these statements are not direct evidence of racial discrimination because they have little or no connection to a dnhpi policy or action.see id.we limit our discussion to statements from people within dnhpi or connected to a dnhpi policy or action.
appellant steven johnson alleges that code enforcement officer lisa martin and police officer dean koehnen made racially derogatory remarks about johnson tenants,the black plague come like roaches when johnson asked why the city was coming after his properties.the district court did not address johnson allegations,however,as appellants failed to bring them to the court attention.indeed,the district court noted its frustration with voluminous file boxes by plaintiffs in opposition to defendants motions for summary judgment.steinhauser city of paul,d.the court explained that appellants failed to winnow out the relevant documents,and therefore the burden of doing so fell to the court.id.johnson allegations about martin and koehnen were contained in a single paragraph of a affidavit,among nearly pages of record evidence.appellants do not contest the district court portrayal of how the evidence was presented to the district court.given these circumstances,we decline to reverse on the basis of johnson allegations.see midwest oilseeds,limagrain genetics,cir tactual assertions that defeat a summary judgment,however,can not be presented for the first time to an appellate court,and only those matters properly before the district court for summary judgment consideration are subject to appellate review.citation omitted see also crossley,cir per curiam affirming summary judgment because the plaintiff failed to designate specific facts as per rule he attached full transcripts from six depositions and argued that his claim could be understood only upon a full reading of the depositions white mcdonnell douglas,cir per curiam a district court is not required to speculate on which portion of the record the nonmoving party relies,nor is it obligated to wade through and search the entire record for some specific facts that might support the nonmoving party claim.quotation omitted.
on several occasions,viewing the record most favorably to appellants,dawkins made statements that demonstrate his desire and intent to reduce the amount of tenants in the city.these statements merit our attention because of dawkins role within dnhpi.however,all of dawkins statements are facially raceneutral,and we have stated,facially statements,without more,do not demonstrate racial animus on the part of the speaker.twymon,at.appellants have failed to connect dawkins allegedly hostile attitude toward tenants with discriminatory intent merely calling these statements evidence of racial animus is not enough to create a genuine dispute of fact.see thomas corwin,cir mere allegations,unsupported by specific facts or evidence beyond the nonmoving party own conclusions,are insufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment.
appellants also argue that discriminatory intent should be inferred from the city knowledge that its actions would likely have a disproportionate impact on racial minorities.the supreme court discussed a similar theory in village of arlington heights metropolitan development.there,the court of appeals held that a city zoning decision violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment,which required a finding of discriminatory intent,solely because the ultimate effect of the decision was racially discriminatory.id.at.the supreme court explained that in some cases,an important starting point for determining discriminatory intent is whether an official action bears more heavily on one race than another.id.at quotation omitted.sometimes a clear pattern,unexplainable on grounds other than race,emerges from the effect of the state action even when the governing legislation appears neutral on its face.id.the court explained that discriminatory impact alone is not determinative outside of rare cases where the pattern of discriminatory effect is stark.id.ultimately,the court held that an arguable disparate impact on racial minorities was insufficient to prove a discriminatory purpose.id.at.
applying the arlington heights analysis here,the evidence of a disparate impact on,which we discus in greater detail in the next section,is not so stark and unexplainable on other grounds to justify,on its own,an inference of discriminatory purpose.see ricketts city of columbia,cir i n only a few cases,where a facially neutral policy impacted exclusively against one suspect class and that impact was unexplainable on neutral grounds,has the impact alone signaled a discriminatory purpose.the city explanation,which has greater support in the record,is that dnhpi targeted properties occupied mostly by tenants.although racial minorities were disproportionately represented,those tenants included people of all races.such conduct may be actionable,but not under the rubric of disparate treatment.see id.when there is a rational,neutral explanation for the adverse impact and the law or custom disadvantages both men and women,then an inference of discriminatory purpose is not permitted.
in sum,there is insufficient evidence to reasonably infer discriminatory intent.accordingly,the district court properly granted summary judgment with regard to appellants disparate treatment claim under the fha.
disparate impact 
as alluded to in the previous section,appellants allege that the city violated the fha because aggressive enforcement of the housing code had a disparate impact on racial minorities.we apply a analysis to appellants disparate impact claim.first,appellants must establish a prima facie case,which requires showing that the action s result ed in a disparate impact upon protected classes compared to a relevant population.tenant ass bd.louis,cir.stated differently,appellants must show a facially neutral policy ha d a significant adverse impact on members of a protected minority group.oti kaga,hous.dev,cir.appellants are not required to show that the policy or practice was formulated with discriminatory intent.huntington branch.naacp town of huntington,cir,aff,per curiam smith anchor,cir.if appellants establish a prima facie case,the burden shifts to the city to demonstrate that its policy or practice had manifest relationship to a legitimate,non discriminatory policy objective and was necessary to the attainment of that objective,at quoting oti kaga,at.if the city shows that its actions were justified,then the burden shifts back to appellants to show a viable alternative means was available to achieve the legitimate policy objective without discriminatory effects.id.at.
the first component of appellants prima facie case is an identifiable,policy or practice.see mems city of paul,cir.the district court interpreted appellants disparate impact claim as a challenge to the city policy of enforcing the housing code instead of the federal housing quality standard hqs,which applies to all rental properties that receive federal rent assistance.this interpretation was too narrow.appellants have consistently challenged the city aggressive housing code enforcement practices.the common denominator in appellants affidavits,allegations,and briefs is that the city issued false housing code violations and punished property owners without prior notification,invitations to cooperate with dnhpi,or adequate time to remedy housing code violations.punishments included fines,evictions,condemnations,revocation of rental registrations,and the financial burden of code compliance certification.therefore,turning to the next step in the prima facie case,we evaluate whether the city aggressive code enforcement resulted in a disparate impact on a protected class.
to demonstrate a disparate impact,appellants have offered evidence supporting the following conclusions 
a the city experienced a shortage of affordable housing.the city represented in its report to the department of housing and urban development hud that the lack of affordable housing opportunities remains a major issue facing many saint paul lower income households,who are also protected class members,and that of saint paul lower income residents can not find adequate affordable housing in the city.then,in,the city estimated that of the households in paul had unmet housing needs cost burdens,overcrowding.
b racial minorities,especially,made up a disproportionate percentage of households in the city that rely on housing.the district court noted that the parties agree that make up a disproportionate percentage of tenants in the city.the city census data showed that of the city population was,whereas data from october showed that and of those on waiting lists for public housing and section assistance,respectively,were.further,the city report to hud showed that of renter households were in the bottom bracket for household adjusted median family income,compared to of all renter households.
c the city aggressive housing code enforcement practices increased costs for property owners that rent to tenants.appellants produced at least six affidavits describing the toll that the city aggressive housing code enforcement took on their rental business.they reported a substantial increase in costs,resulting in evictions for tenants and forced sales of their properties in some cases.these allegations are corroborated by an internal memorandum from the city fire marshal in,comparing the housing code and the hqs and concluding that the housing code was more strict in regard to of the examined categories.
d the increased burden on owners from aggressive code enforcement resulted in less affordable housing in the city.documents from the city and the public housing authority acknowledged that any decrease in federally assisted rental housing would reduce the amount of affordable housing in the city.those predictions were supported by the city vacant buildings report,which showed that the number of vacant homes listed in the city rose from to between march and november,which was a nearly increase.further,appellants submitted affidavits from three tenants who alleged that they endured hardship when their homes were condemned for minimal or false housing code violations.
these premises,together,reasonably demonstrate that the city aggressive enforcement of the housing code resulted in a disproportionate adverse effect on racial minorities,particularly.viewed in the light most favorable to appellants,the evidence shows that the city housing code enforcement temporarily,if not permanently,burdened appellants rental businesses,which indirectly burdened their tenants.given the existing shortage of affordable housing in the city,it is reasonable to infer that the overall amount of affordable housing decreased as a result.and taking into account the demographic evidence in the record,it is reasonable to infer racial minorities,particularly,were disproportionately affected by these events.see alliance cuomo,d,m inority,elderly,and disabled tenants face significant hurdles in locating housing above and beyond the mere shortage of housing any policy which results in the displacement of tenants will disproportionately affect these particular citizens whose housing options are especially constrained.though there is not a single document that connects the dots of appellants disparate impact claim,it is enough that each analytic step is reasonable and supported by evidence.
we note that a common method of showing a disproportionate adverse effect is to compare levels of dependence on affordable housing.where a plaintiff demonstrates that a protected group depends on housing to a greater extent than the population,other courts have found it reasonable to infer that the protected group will experience a disproportionate adverse effect from a policy or decision that reduces housing.see,tsombanidis haven fire dep t.cir plaintiffs can establish disparate impact by showing statistics that x of all of a protected class in an area depend on a type of housing affected by the challenged policy or practice,y of all of the population depends on that type of housing,and,crucially,x is significantly greater than y huntington branch,at disparate impact was established by evidence showing the number of families that need subsidized housing,currently occupied subsidized rental projects,hold section certificates,and are on the waiting list for such certificates is disproportionate to the percentage of families in the general population smith town of clarkton,cir the undisputed statistical picture leaves no doubt that the black population of bladen county was adversely affected by the termination of the housing project,as it is that population most in need of new construction to replace substandard housing,and it is the one with the highest percentage of presumptively eligible applicants.owens charleston hous,d,aff in part,charleston hous.auth.u.dep t of,cir inferring a disparate impact based on evidence that represent a disproportionate number of residents in need of housing.city of alvin,cir plaintiff claim failed due to absence of the types of evidence typically used to show a disparate impact a waiting list for affordable housing,a demonstrated shortage of affordable housing,or identifiable tenants affected by the challenged action.
reiving on reinhart lincoln county,cir,the city argues that appellants must do more than show that the housing code increases the cost of housing and that tend to have lower incomes.the city argument is misplaced,because appellants have shown more in this case.viewed most favorably to appellants,the evidence demonstrates that there is a shortage of affordable housing and that the city aggressive code enforcement exacerbated that shortage.see united states city of black jack,cir fha disparate impact claim supported in part by the fact that forty percent of residents were living in substandard or overcrowded units to the extent the city argues that a fha violation can not arise from a statistical link between income and race,we disagree.while the city ultimately may not be held liable under the fha for economic discrimination,the existence of a significant statistical disparity,even one resulting from economic inequality,is sufficient to create a prima facie case and shift the burden to come forward with a legitimate business justification for the challenged practice.williams v.the columbia pike,see also metro.hous.dev.vill.of arlington heights,cir,cert.denied,exclusion of housing units from defendant village had a discriminatory effect because a greater number of black people than white people in the chicago metropolitan area satisfy the income requirements for federally subsidized housing black jack,at reversing dismissal of plaintiff fha challenge to an exclusionary zoning ordinance,holding that disparate impact was established in part because a larger proportion of than white households have low incomes bronson crestwood lake section holding,defendant apartment complex violated the fha by refusing to consider prospective tenants based on their income levels.
the district court concluded that appellants must show the different costs of rent for under the city housing code and the federal hqs and the percentages of and who could not afford rent because the city enforced the housing code instead of the hqs.we agree that such a comparison is one way to show that experience a disproportionate adverse effect.however,it is not the only way appellants are not required provide a particular statistical comparison.see teamsters,at statistics to prove discrimination come in infinite variety and their usefulness depends on all of the surrounding facts and circumstances.we conclude that appellants offered enough evidence to withstand summary judgment on their prima facie case,thereby shifting the burden to the city to show a legitimate,objective.
turning to the second step of our analysis,appellants concede that enforcement of the housing code has a manifest relationship to legitimate,objectives.specifically,the city has shown that enforcement of the housing code promotes the objectives of providing minimum property maintenance standards,keeping the city clean and housing habitable,and making the city neighborhoods safe and livable.as such,the burden falls back on appellants to offer a viable alternative that satisfies the city legitimate policy objectives while reducing the discriminatory impact of the city code enforcement practices,at emphasis removed.
the district court held in the alternative that appellants disparate impact claim fails as a matter of law under the third step of the analysis.on appeal,appellants identify as a viable alternative the city former program for housing code enforcement called problem properties a progress report prepared by city employees in charge of lists the goals and tactics of identification of properties with a history of unresolved or repeat housing code violations,meeting with the owners individually,encouraging the owners to take a more approach to managing their properties,keeping closer tabs on changes of ownership,and using consistent inspectors at each property.appellants contend that embodied a flexible and cooperative approach to code enforcement,which achieved the goals of code enforcement while maintaining a consistent supply of affordable housing.in support,they point to the progress report,which describes meetings with property owners as very productive in gaining the cooperation of owners to step up their efforts towards improving their properties and the neighborhoods they are in.the report described a good working relationships and lines of communication with these owners,which resulted in owners working hard to be pro active in maintaining their properties.the report concluded,t he program has been effective in eliminating complaints against the participating owners.these conclusions are corroborated by statements from a member of the inspector group jeff hawkins a code enforcement officer appellee dick lippert and appellant frank steinhauser.
thus far,the city has not argued that would be more costly or would fail to accomplish the objectives of housing code enforcement.rather,the city asserts that would not reduce the alleged impact on protected class tenants.the district court agreed with the city,explaining,because participating landlords were not excused from compliance with the housing code,they would still incur the same costs of compliance with the housing code,leaving any alleged discriminatory effect on unchanged.steinhauser,d at.this reasoning,however,fails to appreciate that appellants complain about how the city enforced the housing just the code standards and requirements.appellants offer evidence that the challenged enforcement practices burdened owners and thereby reduced affordable housing options.there is also evidence that generated a cooperative relationship with property owners,achieved greater code compliance,and resulted in less financial burdens on rental property owners.it is reasonable to infer from these facts,viewed most favorably to appellants,that would significantly reduce the impact on protected class members.thus,there is a genuine dispute of fact regarding whether was a viable alternative to the city aggressive housing code enforcement practices.
appellees do not advance any other basis for dismissing the fha disparate impact claim.accordingly,summary judgment was improper as to appellants disparate impact claim.
other fha claims 
the fha also prohibits retaliation against any person on account of his having exercised or enjoyed a right granted or protected by the fha.see generally reg l econ.cmty.action program.city of middletown,cir elements of fha retaliation claim.appellants vaguely assert that the city code enforcement actions were retaliatory,but they have not identified how they exercised or encouraged others to exercise rights under the fha or how the city retaliated.appellants unsupported and conclusory allegations can not defeat summary judgment.e nonmoving party may not rely merely on allegations or denials in its own pleading rather its response must set out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial emphasis added weger city of ladue,cir same.further,to the extent that appellants allege that the city retaliated against them for leasing to tenants in protected classes,their claim fails as a matter of law.appellants were not exercising a right under the fha by leasing to racial minorities.were we to adopt appellants expansive view of,every disparate treatment claim would automatically become a retaliation claim.
appellants also contend that the city failed to affirmatively further fair housing,contrary to its certifications to hud included in this duty,according to appellants,was an obligation to analyze impediments to fair housing.this claim is not properly before the court because appellants failed to pursue it as anything more than background information before the district court.see universal title.at.were we to consider this claim,we would nonetheless conclude that the city duty to affirmatively further fair housing has no independent significance.see langlois abington hous,d,duty to affirmatively further fair housing mirrors the obligations imposed by the fha see also charleston hous,at assuming that the affirmatively further fair housing claim is subsumed by the fha claim.
accordingly,the district court properly granted summary judgment on appellants claims that the city unlawfully retaliated against them,failed to affirmatively further fair housing,and failed to analyze impediments to fair housing.
claims pursuant to,and 
appellants claims pursuant to,and are duplicative with their fha disparate treatment claim,as the underlying constitutional violations for these claims require a showing of discriminatory intent.see dirden dep t of hous.urban,cir per curiam sections and larson miller,cir section.appellants acknowledge this overlap and argue that the district court did not consider the evidence from the fha analysis when it evaluated their constitutional claims.however,the evidence from the fha analysis is insufficient to establish discriminatory intent,and therefore it is irrelevant that the district court did not repeat its analysis.because there is insufficient evidence to show a discriminatory intent,see supra sec,summary judgment was proper as to appellants claims under,and.
equal protection 
appellants contend that the district court improperly dismissed their claim under.appellants do not argue that they are members of a suspect class or that their claims involve a fundamental right.instead,they assert a class of one claim based on the city preferential treatment of the public housing authority pha,a distinct government entity funded by hud that provided units of public housing in paul.to prevail on this claim,appellants must prove that the city intentionally treated them differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment.vill.of willowbrook olech,per curiam.
even assuming arguendo that the city intentionally treated pha differently than private property owners,summary judgment was warranted because appellants have not refuted the rational basis for treating pha differently from private rental properties.as the district court explained,pha is an organization with a comprehensive inspection schedule,staff dedicated to maintenance,and a demonstrated record for maintaining its properties.steinhauser,d at.the evidence presented by appellees shows that pha responds quickly and appropriately to dnhpi correction orders.the district court concluded,given the city limited resources and pha record of maintaining its properties,defendants have a rational basis for permitting pha to manage its own repairs.id.at.appellants fail to explain why this justification was inadequate.we conclude,therefore,that summary judgment was appropriate on their claim.
substantive due process 
appellants in case the gallagher appellants appeal the dismissal of their substantive due process claim pursuant to.we interpret their claim as challenging the city housing code enforcement as applied to them,not as a facial challenge to any policy or practice.t he theory of substantive due process is properly reserved for truly egregious and extraordinary cases.myers scott county,cir.to prevail on this claim,the gallagher appellants must show a constitutionally protected property interest and that city officials used their power in such an arbitrary and oppressive way that it shocks the conscience.entergy,nebraska,cir quoting county of sacramento lewis.in light of the uncontested legitimate goals of enforcing the housing code,there is insufficient evidence to reasonably conclude that this is a truly egregious and extraordinary example of government regulation.
in addition,the gallagher appellants contend that code compliance certification violated their substantive due process rights because that procedure conflicts with the minnesota state building code.the supposed conflict with minnesota state law is not actionable under,myers,at,and will be discussed further in section.
for these reasons,summary judgment was proper on the gallagher appellants substantive due process claim.
void for vagueness 
the gallagher appellants allege that the paul legislative code is void for vagueness in violation of the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments.they appear to assert both an as applied challenge and a facial challenge.
first,the gallag her appellants challenge the term vacant building in e as applied to the property at carroll the carroll property was allegedly declared vacant days after the property was sold to appellant troy allison.the gallagher appellants complain that the dnhpi inspector ignored the obvious occupancy of the home and based his vacancy determination merely on an observation that the window lacked any blinds or window coverings.however,as the district court noted,allison admitted in his deposition testimony that the downstairs unit at the carroll property was unoccupied and had multiple housing code violations when the city declared it a vacant building.the gallagher appellants do not challenge that finding on appeal.as such,the carroll property was clearly within the definition of a vacant building.see paul,e defining a vacant building as a building or portion of a building which is unoccupied and has multiple housing or building code violations.therefore,allison can not complain of the vagueness of e.see parker levy,one to whose conduct a statute clearly applies may not successfully challenge it for vagueness.
the gallagher appellants also assert a facial challenge to several chapters of the paul code under the doctrine.facial challenges to legislative enactments are,to say the least,discouraged.see united states stephens,cir.appellants basic complaint is that the paul code does not provide sufficient notice of rental property owners obligations under the law,placing unwarranted discretion in the hands of dnhpi.the gallagher appellants point to several city employees inability to explain the categorization of vacant buildings and the meaning of the terms problem property and code compliance certification.however,the gallagher appellants must do more than allege general confusion regarding a legislative enactment.to start with,they must identify a particular section of the paul code that is impermissibly vague,as we will not declare entire chapters of the paul code facially unconstitutional.appellants fail to reference a particular section of the paul code,let alone analyze why that section is vague.without more,the gallagher appellants facial claim fails as a matter of law.
appellants allege causes of action under c and d.a plaintiff who brings suit under c must prove that the defendant engaged in conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.handeen lemaire,cir.under d,conspiracy to violate c is also prohibited.racketeering activity is defined in as a list of predicate acts,including certain state law crimes,conduct that is indictable under various federal provisions,and numerous other offenses.on appeal,appellants have narrowed the alleged rico predicate acts to several patterns of conduct,which we address in turn.
appellants allege that magner,a dnhpi supervisor,engaged in a scheme of extortion and attempted extortion.specifically,they allege that magner approached property owners after he wrote up housing code violations and offered to arrange a sale of their property for a price market value.it is undisputed that none of those property owners actually accepted magner offer.appellants assert that magner transferred inside knowledge to a close friend,wally nelson,who subsequently purchased many distressed single family and duplex homes under magner control.they further allege that nelson,in return,has provided construction services to magner father at a discounted rate.
even if we assume there is sufficient evidence of a rico predicate act,appellants lack standing to challenge magner conduct.importantly,the only evidence offered to support appellants allegations are three affidavits from owners who are not plaintiffs in these consolidated lawsuits.appellants have not shown that they themselves suffered any injury from the alleged extortion scheme,and therefore their extortion claims fail for lack of standing.see sedima,imrex,t he plaintiff only has standing if,and can only recover to the extent that,he has been injured in his business or property by the conduct constituting the violation.bowman auto supply,cir section c confers standing on any individual who has experienced injury to his or her business or property that occurred by reason of a rico violation see also terminate control horowitz,cir.
next,the appellants in cases and argue on appeal that the city went so far as to fix the state district court in their favor.collectively,the allegations amount to a pattern of cooperation between dawkins,the city attorney,the mayor,a housing referee,and a minnesota state judge,resulting in a crackdown on landlords in the city.though these are serious allegations,summary judgment was nonetheless appropriate.the sole evidentiary basis for this claim is appellant meysembourg affidavit,which essentially mirrors the argument in appellants brief.notably,meysembourg affidavit merely states that he learned this troublesome story without any explanation of how he learned it.appellants may not rest on mere allegations,but instead must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.postscript enters.city of bridgeton,cir quotation omitted.affidavits are one way to set forth such facts,but the affidavits must be made on personal knowledge,must set forth facts which would be admissible in evidence,and must show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated.id.under these standards,appellants proffered evidence is insufficient.alternatively,appellants claim fails because they have not explained what predicate act they are alleging.general allegations of cooperation and use of phrases like buy in are not enough to formulate a rico claim.
appellants allege other predicate acts,including falsification of housing code violations,intentional delay and misdirection of notices,concealment of the strict nature of the housing code,condemnation of properties without justification,and violation of the state building code.these claims,however,lack adequa
