this interlocutory appeal requires us to decide whether,as the district court held,defendants are immune from suit based on texas doctrine of sovereign immunity.resolution of this question requires us to first decide whether the plaintiffs have constitutional standing to sue.because we agree that plaintiffs have asserted a claim in this controversy sufficient to satisfy article iii minimum constitutional standing requirements and that state sovereign immunity from suit does not bar plaintiffs claims against defendants,we affirm the order of the district court to the extent that it denied defendants sovereign immunity from suit.
facts and procedural background 
a.the parties involved and legal instruments at issue 
this case involves a dispute regarding deed restrictions on property donated to the city of dallas.edward and annie tenison the tenisons had four children.their son,edward hugh tenison,predeceased his parents.edward hugh tenison was survived by two children,elizabeth ann tenison and edward hugh tenison.elizabeth ann tenison was the grandmother of ann tenison hereford webb and the of lizann tenison webb,byron james webb and camille elizabeth webb sewell together,the webbs.hence,the webbs are the and of the tenisons.
on december,edward tenison executed his will,in which he bequeathed to each of his three living children cruger smith,dan craddock and james tenison.the will also created separate trusts in the amount of for each of his three grandchildren,including elizabeth ann tenison.edward tenison left the rest,residue,and remainder of his estate to his wife,annie tenison.at the time he executed the will,the tenisons owned the land that is the subject of the current dispute.
on march,the tenisons deeded acres of real estate located between east grand avenue and east pike road to the city of dallas in memory of their son,edward hugh tenison.the deed included the following restriction,
but this conveyance is made for the purposes of a public park only,and upon the express condition that the property shall always be used by the city of dallas,for the purposes of a public park for the use and enjoyment of the people of the city of dallas,and for such purposes exclusively.said park shall be known and designated for all time as tenison park.and if said property,or any part thereof,shall not be used for the purposes of a public park,or if said property,or any part thereof,shall be used for any purpose other than public park purposes as above provided for,or should the name of said park be changed from the above designated,then and in each such event the right and title of the city of dallas to the property hereby granted shall cease,and said property and all right and title thereto shall at once revert to and vest in us or our heirs,and it shall be lawful for us or our heirs to upon,take,repossess and enjoy all and singular the property hereby granted as in our former estate.

annie tenison died in.
b.the current dispute 
as the grantee under the deeds,the city of dallas operated two municipal golf courses on the property known as tenison park.in,the dallas city council approved a plan to redesign the tenison park west course,and the renovated golf course was opened for business in october.the webbs allege that rising green fees effectively excluded certain citizens from the use and enjoyment of the property and that the name of the property was also changed from tenison park to tenison highlands.
on november,the webbs filed suit in federal court against the city of dallas,its parks and recreation department and parks and recreation board and park director paul dyer,in his official capacity together the city.in general,the webbs claimed that the city t ook said property and ha ve not used and expressed intention not to use the property for purposes of a public park.more specifically,in their first amended complaint,the webbs sought a reverter of the property to them as heirs of the tenisons,a declaration that they have the right to immediately reenter upon and take possession of the property,damages for breach of the dallas city charter and texas trust law and an accounting of all profits realized by the city activities from november through the date of final judgment in this case.the webbs further generally claimed,without particularizing the specific relief sought,relief under a state trespass to try title cause of action.
the webbs moved for partial summary judgment on their claims for declaratory relief,trespass to try title and right of reverter.the city moved for summary judgment on the basis that the webbs are not legally entitled to enforce restrictions in the deeds and moved for judgment on the pleadings on the basis that the doctrine of sovereign immunity precludes the webbs from bringing suit against the city.
c.the district court decision 
on october,the united states magistrate judge recommended that the district court deny all pending motions in this case.by order dated october,the district court adopted the findings and recommendation of the united states magistrate judge,effectively denying the city motion for summary judgment and for judgment on the pleadings.
the city appeals the district court order denying its motion.
ii.standard of review 
this court reviews de novo the denial of a summary judgment motion based on standing this court also reviews de novo the denial of a motion for judgment on the pleadings based on state sovereign immunity in adjudicating a motion for judgment on the pleadings,the court may look only to the pleadings and must accept all facts pleaded therein as true 
iii.article iii standing and state sovereign immunity 
the issues before the court on appeal are whether the webbs claim an interest in the property sufficient to satisfy the jurisdictional requirement of article iii,and whether,even if article iii standing is found,the city is nevertheless immune from suit under the doctrine of sovereign immunity.regarding the city argument that the webbs lack a legal interest to sue as heirs under the deeds,the district court specifically determined that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether the webbs are legal heirs of the tenisons,as that term is used in the relevant deeds.regarding the city argument that texas sovereign immunity doctrine immunizes it from the present suit,the district court concluded that the city waived immunity from both suit and liability.on appeal,the city contends that the webbs have not satisfied the requirement for this court to have article iii jurisdiction and that it has not waived immunity from suit such that subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the merits of the webbs claims is present.
standing under article iii 
initially,we must conclude that we have jurisdiction under article iii of the united states constitution before proceeding to the merits of the city claim of sovereign immunity from suit in response to the city motion for summary judgment that the webbs do not possess a right to enforce the deed restrictions as heirs when the residuary clause in annie tenison will left the rest,residue and remainder of her property to her three children,the district court found that genuine issues of material fact as to whether plaintiffs are the heirs of edward and annie tenison,as that term is used in the tenison deeds,precluded summary judgment.on appeal,we are not called upon to review the merits of the district court summary judgment determination regarding the webbs alleged ownership rights.rather,in order to review the discrete sovereign immunity question on appeal,we must only determine that the minimum constitutional requirements for standing are satisfied 
the webbs are not direct descendants of the named beneficiaries of the residuary clause of annie tenison will.moreover,neither of the tenison wills specifically references the future interest created by the tenison park conveyances to the city.nevertheless,in their first amended complaint,the webbs have undoubtedly asserted an interest in this property dispute sufficient to satisfy the jurisdictional requirement of the article iii standing doctrine.
standing to sue is the core of article iii requirement,and the party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing its existence.to invoke federal jurisdiction,the webbs are required to allege facts demonstrating that they have suffered an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical this requirement is part of the irreducible constitutional minimum required to establish article iii standing 
here,the webbs have asserted a personal stake in the dispute that is concrete and particularized as alleged,the conduct of the city in violating the deed restrictions has affected the webbs in a personal,individual and particularized way because as heirs under the deeds,they have a personal stake in seeing that the city adheres to the restrictions on the use of the tenison property 
the webbs may ultimately fail to prove ownership or any property interest entitlement to the tenison property.facially,however,the first amended complaint including its reference to the express language of the relevant deeds avers that the webbs suffered a concrete constitutional by the city failure to operate the tenison property in accordance with the deed restrictions and that through the express conveyance of a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent,the webbs can now redress this injury by exercising their right of reentry as heirs.these allegations assert an interest in the property dispute sufficient to meet the minimum constitutional requirements of article iii.
sovereign immunity 
having dispensed with the question whether the webbs have constitutional standing to pursue their claims,we now turn to the question whether the city has waived immunity from suit.
in answering a question where,as here,jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship,we have a duty to apply the forum state jurisprudence further,where,as here,we are asked to resolve a sovereign immunity question in a diversity of citizenship case,we must defer to the sovereign immunity law of the forum state 
under texas law,immunity from liability and immunity from suit are two distinct principles immunity from liability protects the state from a judgment against it even if the state legislature has expressly consented to suit in contrast,immunity from suit bars an action against the state unless the state expressly consents to suit the city concedes that it waived immunity from liability by accepting the conveyance of land from the tenisons.it thus only asserts immunity from suit,not liability.
we note at the outset that under texas law,a suit against a municipality or its agencies arising out of the performance of its governmental duties or to recover for alleged breach of a contract is deemed to be a suit against the state of texas for purposes of state sovereign immunity unless some special exception applies the webbs principally aver that immunity from suit has been expressly waived by statute and by express provisions of the dallas city charter and,alternatively,that immunity from suit has been waived by the city conduct in accepting the conveyances here.the city disagrees with both arguments.
before turning to the question of waiver of immunity from suit under texas law,however,we briefly address the webbs initial contention that the doctrine of sovereign immunity does not even apply to the instant lawsuit because this is an action in rem to recover title to and possession of land.
in rem proceeding 
the webbs essentially contend that sovereign immunity does not bar this proceeding because they are simply seeking a declaration of what already belongs to them.it is true that an entity or person whose rights have been violated by the unlawful action of a state official may bring suit against that state official,individually,to remedy the violation or prevent its occurrence and that such a suit is not a suit against the state requiring statutory authorization because the conduct of the agent or official is unauthorized and thus ultra vires.however,the claims raised by the webbs do not fall within this narrow class of claims excepted from the general rule requiring statutory authorization to maintain a suit against the state the webbs have not sued officials in their individual capacities,and the texas supreme court has clearly held that suits against the state or its agencies for title to land or suits against the state or its agencies seeking injunctive relief to enforce contractual rights are necessarily suits against the state requiring legislative authorization to sue further,we note that in addition to injunctive and declaratory relief,the webbs also seek legal relief in the form of an accounting and money damages for the city alleged breach of the covenants and of the dallas city charter.thus,their in rem distinction is misplaced 
express waiver of sovereign immunity 
the webbs persuaded the district court that the city had expressly waived its immunity from suit.the texas local government code states that municipalities,such as the city of dallas,may plead and be impleaded in any court.further,the dallas city charter states that the city of dallas shall have the power to sue and be sued.the dallas city charter provision does not restrict the forum for suits against the city to courts of the state the district court relied on these two provisions to find an express waiver of sovereign immunity from suit here.the city argues this conclusion is in error,contending that the code and charter provisions relied on by the district court are simply confirmations that the city of dallas has the corporate capacity to sue and be sued.alternatively,buttressing its argument with four state decisions from texas courts of appeals,it seeks to have this court certify the express waiver issue to the texas supreme court as an unsettled question of state law.
in missouri pacific railroad brownsville navigation district the texas supreme court held that a statute with language similar to that found in and the dallas city charter provision waived immunity from suit.the statute in that case states that,
all navigation districts may sue or be sued in all courts of this state in the name of such navigation district,and all courts of this state shall take judicial notice of the establishment of all districts 
the texas supreme court stated that this language quite plain ly gives general consent for district to be sued in the courts of texas such that immunity from suit is expressly waived 
more recently,in travis county pelzel the texas supreme court again addressed whether a statute clearly and unambiguously waives the state immunity from suit.section a,entitled presentation of claim,provides that a person may not sue on a claim against a county unless the person has presented the claim to the commissioners court and the commissioners court has neglected or refused to pay all or part of the claim.the court held that this language did not waive travis county immunity from suit because the statute did not state clearly and unambiguously that travis county could be sued.rather,the court found that the provision just as easily could simply create a condition precedent to suit important to this conclusion was the finding that the original statutory language providing that the county may sue and be sued was deleted in to leave text largely resembling the current statute in place as stated by the texas supreme court,well over a hundred years ago,the legislature deleted the only language arguably waiving sovereign immunity,suggesting that it intended to preserve counties immunity from suit.in so concluding,the court discussed missouri pacific in some d
