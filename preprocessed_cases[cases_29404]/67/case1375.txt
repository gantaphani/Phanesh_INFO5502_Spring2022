carol marmo appeals from the final judgment entered on a jury verdict awarding her on a nuisance claim against tyson fresh meats,ibp,ibp.she also appeals the subsequent award of costs.we affirm.
background 
marmo commenced this action in the district court of dakota county,nebraska,in september.ibp timely removed the case to the united states district court for the district of nebraska the case was consolidated for discovery and pretrial purposes with twelve similar cases,but each case is to be tried individually.this is the first,and thus far only,case to proceed to trial.
the complaint alleged three theories of recovery nuisance,negligence,and strict liability.in each claim,marmo asserted that she had been damaged by hydrogen sulfide gas emitted from the wastewater treatment lagoons at ibp beef processing plant.marmo later attempted to amend the complaint to add an unjust enrichment claim based on a pollution easement theory.specifically,marmo claimed that ibp inequitably saved million by not installing appropriate pollution control equipment.the district court rejected the proposed amendment as futile,concluding that the unjust enrichment claim based on the facts presented was a novel cause of action that the nebraska courts had not recognized.
the initial progression order established a staggered schedule for expert witness disclosures.the order required marmo to submit her expert disclosures first,followed by ibp expert disclosures.thereafter,either party could disclose additional expert witnesses if necessary to refute the disclosed opinions of any expert witness of an opponent.marmo app.in appeal at.the order was amended numerous times to provide both parties extensions to the disclosure deadlines.
in march,marmo submitted disclosures for seven expert witnesses,including kaye kilburn,a physician who examined marmo,and harriet ammann,a toxicologist.ibp disclosed its expert witnesses on various dates between august and november.marmo disclosed several rebuttal experts,including william meggs,in april.
in may,ibp moved to strike several of marmo rebuttal witnesses,including meggs,on the ground that their opinions offered replacement,and not rebuttal,testimony.in opposition to the motion,marmo asserted that the rebuttal reports disclose quintessential rebuttal testimony and that meggs reports were classic rebuttal testimony.ibp app.in appeal at.the magistrate judge denied the motion to strike without prejudice,deferring the issue until trial.
in november,ibp filed motions in limine to exclude the testimony of kilburn and to preclude ammann from offering an opinion on medical causation.in response,marmo withdrew kilburn as a witness for her and moved to meggs as a primary witness.the district court denied the motion to,finding that modification of the progression order was not supported by good cause and would have substantially prejudiced ibp.the district court also ruled that ammann was not qualified to testify on medical causation.
ibp moved for partial summary judgment on the strict liability and negligence claims,as well as on the issue of permanent physical injury.the district court granted summary judgment on the strict liability claim,finding that ibp did not engage in an ultrahazardous activity in the operation of its wastewater treatment facility.the district court also granted summary judgment on the physical injury issue,reasoning that marmo could not present necessary medical causation evidence,in light of the denial of and the in limine ruling relating to ammann.however,the district court denied summary judgment on the negligence claim,concluding that issues of fact remained concerning when the applicable limitations period commenced.
trial occurred in february.during opening statements,ibp counsel remarked that no physician would testify about marmo and her health.the next day,marmo objected to the statement,arguing that it created a false inference that no medical evidence existed to support her claims.to rebut the inference,marmo requested that meggs testify in her or that she elicit testimony from ibp experts.the district court denied the request.thereafter,marmo attempted to call meggs as a rebuttal expert.however,the district court refused to allow meggs to testify,reasoning that ibp had presented no evidence for meggs to rebut.
during trial,marmo admitted that she was aware in the early of her alleged difficulties with hydrogen sulfide and linked her symptoms to emissions from ibp.accordingly,the district court granted a directed verdict for ibp on marmo negligence claim,finding that the statute of limitations had run well before marmo filed suit in september.
marmo nuisance claim for the period preceeding september was submitted to the jury,which returned a verdict of for marmo.the district court then awarded marmo in costs.
discussion 
denial of leave to amend to add an unjust enrichment claim 
marmo sought leave to amend her complaint to add an unjust enrichment claim based on the theory that ibp unjustly profited from its failure to install adequate pollution control equipment.the district court denied leave,reasoning that the attempt was futile because nebraska law did not recognize an unjust enrichment claim based on the theory advanced by marmo.
a district court should grant leave to amend freely when justice so requires.a.however,denial of leave to amend may be justified when the amendment is futile.united states ex rel.joshi luke,cir citing united states ex rel.gaudineer comito,iowa,cir.although we review a denial of leave to amend for an abuse of discretion,we review de novo the underlying legal conclusion of whether the proposed amendment to the complaint would have been futile.id.at citations omitted.
an unjust enrichment claim embodies the equitable doctrine that one will not be allowed to profit or enrich oneself unjustly at the expense of another hoffman reinke,citing haggard drilling,greene.when the inequitable and unconscionable retention of a benefit occurs,nebraska law requires the recipient to pay for the reasonable value of the benefit received.bush kramer.unjust enrichment requires restitution,which measures the remedy by the gain obtained by the defendant,and seeks disgorgement of that gain.trieweiler sears,citations omitted.thus,a defendant will be liable for the unjust benefit it not the harm sustained by the plaintiff.id.at citation omitted.
marmo admits that neither the nebraska supreme court nor the nebraska legislature has recognized an unjust enrichment claim based on a pollution easement theory,but nonetheless argues that nebraska case law supports her claim.nebraska courts have recognized an unjust enrichment claim to allow a purchaser who made valuable improvements to a property to recover the reasonable value of the improvement.see mcintosh borchers.they have also recognized an unjust enrichment claim to require payment for land use when an individual disavowed an obligation to pay for the use.bush,at.
however,no nebraska state court has recognized a negative unjust enrichment claim based on the pollution easement theory,which seeks disgorgement of profits unjustly saved by a polluter rather,nebraska courts focus on how the pollution injures the plaintiff,and that claim is properly brought under the law of nuisance.see bargmann soll oil,karpisek cather sons.there is no indication that the nebraska supreme court would recognize an unjust enrichment claim on the facts of this case.thus,the proposed amendment would have been futile,and the district court did not err in denying marmo leave to amend the complaint.
dismissal of the negligence claim 
the district court found that marmo learned of the irritant effects of hydrogen sulfide and linked her symptoms with the emissions from ibp by november.because marmo did not commence her action until september,the district court directed a verdict on the negligence claim,finding it barred by the statute of limitations.
we review the grant of a motion for directed verdict de novo.randall federated retail holdings,cir citations omitted.a directed verdict is appropriate if during a trial by jury a party has been heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.id.quoting.a.
under nebraska law,a statute of limitations applies to negligence claims.see.the statute of limitations in a negligence action generally commences when the injurious act or omission occurs.carruth state.thus,the limitations period runs from the date that the injured individual has the right to commence an action,even if the individual is ignorant about whether a cause of action exists or is unaware of the nature or extent of the damage.cavanaugh city of omaha.
marmo maintains that ibp repeatedly breached its duty to exercise due care in operating its facility and that the district court erred by failing to apply the continuous tort doctrine to her negligence claim.nebraska recognizes the continuing treatment doctrine,which provides that the limitations period in medical malpractice claims runs from the date on which a continuing course of treatment ends,even if the injury was inflicted earlier in the course of treatment.carruth,at.however,nebraska courts refuse to extend the continuous tort doctrine beyond the medical malpractice context.see anonymous john lutheran church of seward,refusing to apply continuing tort doctrine to negligence cause of action see also grand island sch.dist.celotex,no continuous injury despite repeated failures to repair negligently installed roof.moreover,the policy considerations underlying the continuing treatment doctrine do not apply in this case.see casey levine,primary considerations underlying the continuing treatment doctrine are to allow a physician an opportunity to correct any malpractice and not disrupt the relationship citations omitted.accordingly,the district court properly refused to apply the continuous tort doctrine and appropriately directed a verdict on the negligence claim.
expert witnesses 
the district court granted ibp partial summary judgment because marmo failed to proffer admissible expert testimony to demonstrate causation with regard to permanent physical injury.initially,marmo identified kilburn as an expert to render an opinion on medical causation.however,after ibp filed a motion in limine challenging the reliability of kilburn opinion and a summary judgment motion on permanent physical injury,marmo withdrew kilburn as an expert.thereafter,marmo proffered the testimony of both ammann and meggs,but the district court ruled that neither expert could testify on causation.

the district court allowed ammann to testify that marmo alleged injuries were consistent with hydrogen sulfide exposure,but precluded ammann from opining on causation.marmo submits that the district court improperly limited ammann testimony.
district courts must ensure that all scientific testimony is both reliable and relevant.daubert merrell dow,d.the inquiry as to the reliability and relevance of the testimony is a flexible one designed to make certain that an expert,whether basing testimony upon professional studies or personal experience,employs in the courtroom the same level of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in the relevant field.kumho tire carmichael,d.expert testimony is inadmissible if it is speculative,unsupported by sufficient facts,or contrary to the facts of the case.concord boat brunswick,cir.
to satisfy the reliability requirement,the proponent of the expert testimony must show by a preponderance of the evidence both that the expert is qualified to render the opinion and that the methodology underlying his conclusions is scientifically valid.daubert,at.to show that the expert testimony is relevant,the proponent must show that the reasoning or methodology in question is applied properly to the facts in issue.id.at.courts should resolve doubts regarding the usefulness of an expert testimony in favor of admissibility.clark heidrick,cir see also arcoren united states,cir noting that rule is one of admissibility rather than exclusion.however,a court should not admit opinion evidence that is connected to existing data only by the ipse dixit of the expert.joiner,d.when the analytical gap between the data and proffered opinion is too great,the opinion must be excluded.id.
we have previously held that a toxicologist may testify that exposure to a chemical caused a person symptoms and injuries.bonner isp,cir loudermill dow chem,cir see also reference manual on scientific evidence ed recognizing that toxicologists may offer expert opinions on whether exposure to a chemical caused an individual injury.however,neither bonner nor loudermill provides a blanket rule that toxicologists are qualified to render an opinion on causation.rather,under the circumstances of each case,we found that the opinion of each toxicologist was reliable.in bonner,we emphasized that the causation opinion on the plaintiff immediate,acute symptoms was reliable because of the temporal connection between the exposure and the symptoms.at.in loudermill,we noted that the expert had considerable academic and practical knowledge,including clinical experience examining patients and conducting autopsies to determine toxicological related events in death.at.
in this case,ammann interviewed marmo but did not examine her and did not inquire about other toxic exposures.see reference manual on scientific evidence,supra,at one of the basic and most useful tools in diagnosis of disease is the patient medical history i t is widely recognized that a thorough medical history involves questioning and examination of the patient as well as appropriate medical testing.moreover,ammann did not exclude confounding factors,which leaves open the possibility of competing causes of the disease and raises questions about the competency of expert testimony.id.at.finally,ammann admitted that the causation standard she employed was not subject to expression in terms of a potential rate of error and was a much lower standard than medical causation.because of these analytical flaws,the district court acted within the bounds of discretion when precluding ammann from testifying on medical causation.
the district court refused to allow marmo to call meggs as a witness in her and later ruled that meggs could not testify as a rebuttal witness.marmo challenges these rulings on several grounds.
first,marmo argues that the progression order did not dictate the presentation of evidence at trial.to ensure that trial does not proceed,the district court has wide discretion to determine the order in which parties adduce proof.geders united states,d.under the terms of the progression order,marmo disclosed meggs as an expert witness necessary to refute the disclosed opinions of ibp expert witness.the district court properly construed meggs as a rebuttal witness.see black law dictionary ed.defining rebut as to refute,oppose,or counteract something by evidence,argument,or contrary proof.indeed,marmo described meggs as providing classic rebuttal testimony.
the function of rebuttal testimony is to explain,repel,counteract or disprove evidence of the adverse party.united states lamoreaux,cir citation omitted faigin kelly,cir the principal objective of rebuttal is to permit a litigant to counter new,unforeseen facts brought out in the other side case.citations omitted.as such,rebuttal evidence may be used to challenge the evidence or theory of an not to establish a.cates sears,roebuck,cir rebuttal must be kept in perspective it is not to be used as a continuation of the.see also john henry wigmore,evidence in trials at common law a district court should allow rebuttal evidence only if it is necessary to refute the opponent case.
the district court reasonably construed the progression order as dictating both the timing and substantive nature of expert witness testimony,and it was well within its discretion to rule that witnesses disclosed as rebuttal witnesses under the progression order would testify as rebuttal witnesses at trial.to construe the order otherwise would eviscerate the distinction between primary and rebuttal witnesses.
second,marmo argues that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to meggs as a witness in her.marmo identified meggs as an expert witness in april,two years after the deadline to disclose primary witnesses and after ibp had filed its motion in limine challenging the admissibility of kilburn and its summary judgment motion based on lack of admissible evidence on causation.the district court refused to meggs because marmo failed to show good cause to modify the progression order.
adherence to progression order deadlines is critical to achieving the primary goal of the judiciary to serve the just,speedy,and inexpensive determination of every action.see also bradford dana,cir as a vehicle designed to streamline the flow of litigation through our crowded dockets,we do not take case management orders lightly,and will enforce them.citation omitted.accordingly,the district court has broad discretion in establishing and enforcing the deadlines.to modify a progression order,a party must show good cause for the modification.bradford,at.to establish good cause,a party must show its diligence in attempting to meet the progression order.id.citation omitted.a district court may also consider the existence or degree of prejudice to the party opposing the modification.id.
marmo had ample opportunity to develop her expert testimony on the causation issue.she chose to keep kilburn as the primary witness on that issue for over two years while litigation proceeded,attempting to meggs only after withdrawing kilburn.the tactical decision to withdraw kilburn in response to a motion challenging his opinion did not provide good cause to substitute meggs.see nelson.gas pipeline,cir fairness does not require that a plaintiff,whose expert witness testimony has been found inadmissible under daubert,be afforded a second chance to marshal other expert opinions and shore up his case.similarly,that new scientific evidence relating to hydrogen sulfide exposure was published after the deadline for primary expert disclosure does not provide good cause to meggs as a primary witness instead,marmo should have sought leave to present supplemental opinions by her existing primary experts.see.e.
furthermore,ibp would have suffered significant prejudice if the district court allowed meggs to testify as a primary expert witness.ibp based its litigation strategy on the initial disclosure of primary experts,including the designation of kilburn to opine on causation.it selected its own expert witnesses and developed motion and trial strategies based on that expert witness evidence.see trost trek bicycle,cir because defendant had already prepared its summary judgment motion at least partially based on the lack of expert opinion to support plaintiff claim,the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding plaintiff untimely disclosed expert.to cure the prejudice in allowing meggs to testify as a primary witness,the district court would have had to the case and practically start anew.within two months of trial,the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow the.
third,marmo argues that the district court erroneously refused to allow meggs to testify as a rebuttal witness.during opening statements,ibp counsel remarked that no doctor would testify about marmo and her health.marmo claims that the statement created a false inference that no medical evidence supported her claims.she contends that the district court should have allowed meggs to testify to rebut the allegedly false inference.
we disagree.allowance of a party to present additional evidence on rebuttal depends upon the circumstances of the case and rests within the discretion of the individual most able to weigh the competing circumstances,the trial judge.gossett weyerhaeuser,cir citations omitted.the district court instructed the jury that the arguments of counsel are not evidence.this instruction cured any prejudice that might have been caused by the remark.id.at billingsley city of omaha,cir an admonishment to the jury that statements made by an attorney are not evidence remedies any prejudice.moreover,ibp presented no evidence on medical causation,and therefore,there was no evidence for meggs to rebut.accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow meggs to testify in rebuttal see life plus int l,at a party may not get admitted through the back door of rebuttal evidence that which the district court correctly barred at the front door.
jury instructions 
marmo advances several arguments relating to jury instructions.in this diversity case,nebraska law governs the substance of jury instructions.smith tenet healthsystem sl,cir.district courts have wide discretion in drafting jury instructions.id.at quoting omega healthcare investors,lantis,cir.our review is limited to whether the instructions,viewed on the whole,fairly and adequately represent the evidence and applicable law in light of the issues presented to the jury.id.
instruction on damages 
the district court instructed the jury if you return a verdict for carol marmo,then you must decide how much money will compensate carol marmo for the discomfort,annoyance,and inconvenience that she experienced in the use and enjoyment of her residential property.marmo argues that this instruction was insufficient for two reasons.first,she contends that the district court should have instructed the jury that she was not required to prove a specified dollar amount of damages.second,she argues that the instruction was too narrow because it did not expressly explain that the jury could award damages for physical and mental injury.in particular,marmo contends that the district court should have instructed the jury that she was entitled to damages for the nature and extent of the injury,including whether the injury is temporary or permanent and whether any resulting disability is partial or total.
the district court instruction was based on nebraska law.see thomsen greve.moreover,the instruction proposed by marmo includes consideration of factors that were no longer part of the case,such as permanent injury.even if there were an instructional error,marmo has not made any showing that it affected her substantial rights.to the contrary,the instruction left marmo counsel free to argue that marmo experienced a multitude of damages within the general he did so.the instruction adequately represented the evidence and applicable law in light of the issues presented to the jury.
instruction on conditions 
marmo argues that the district court erred in failing to include a condition instruction.we disagree.a condition instruction should be given rarely and only when supported by the evidence.see civ.cmt.ii.the instruction proposed by marmo related to respiratory and neurological symptoms,yet there was no evidence at trial that marmo suffered from either respiratory or neurological problems.thus,there is no factual basis for the proposed instruction.
instruction on concurrent cause 
marmo submits that the district court erred in refusing to give a concurring cause instruction in light of ibp arguments and evidence of other sources of hydrogen sulfide in her neighborhood she contends that the small verdict suggests that the jury reduced the award to reflect the existence of twelve other potential sources of hydrogen sulfide.however,the district court instructed the jury to award marmo for all the discomfort,annoyance,and inconvenience she experienced the court did not instruct the jury to apportion damages.moreover,marmo counsel informed the jury that other sources were inconsequential.the exclusion of a concurrent cause instruction was not erroneous.
instruction on loss of the sense of smell 
in the partial summary judgment order,the district court ruled that the lack of expert testimony precluded marmo from recovering for permanent medical injury.ibp asked for a specific instruction informing the jury that it could not award damages for marmo permanent loss of the ability to smell.the district court refused the request,reasoning that a reasonable
