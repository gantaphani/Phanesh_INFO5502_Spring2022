at issue in this lawsuit are bayfield county the county ongoing efforts to convert unused railway lines in the county into snowmobile trails.as the legal basis for its plans,the county alleges that the united states retains a reversionary interest in these railroad and that congress has established that,pursuant to this reversionary interest,if the railway lines are formally abandoned,local governments are then provided with a window with which to establish a public highway if they so choose.c.local landowners landowners,who have been using these old railway lines as their own,took preemptive measures and filed a quiet title action seeking declaratory relief against the county and the united states,claiming that the united states had not retained a reversionary interest over these particular railway lines,and,in the alternative,that the land had vested in the landowners because the period from the date of abandonment had already lapsed.the district court never made a determination on these claims.instead,the united states filed a disclaimer of interest in the property.see e.the district court then determined that,even assuming that the united states retained a reversionary interest and the railway lines had not been abandoned,the disclaimer of interest had the same effect as eliminating the united states reversionary interest,which the court classified as a necessary predicate for the county to have any interest in the railway lines.accordingly,the district court found for the landowners.for the following reasons,however,we vacate the grant of summary judgment for the landowners,vacate the quiet title finding in the landowners favor,and remand for further proceedings.
background 
grants to the railroads 
in the and,congress passed a series of laws granting tracts of land and for purposes of constructing railway lines.particularly relevant to this case are acts enacted on august,june,and may.see ch,stat,ch,stat,and ch,stat.the parties agree that the railroad property interest in the railway line traversing the property owned by samuel johnson trust and imogene johnson sc johnsons was originally acquired by the railroad via the and acts.this is because those acts governed odd numbered sections of property,which would include the sc johnsons land,located at section,township north,range west in bayport county.the parties are in disagreement,however,as to whether the united states maintained a reversionary interest in this land.according to the landowners,the and acts vested the title of fee simple absolute with the state of wisconsin,which then in turn transferred this full property interest to the railroad companies.see.sess.laws ch.the county,however,argues that the western district of wisconsin and this court have already found that the united states retained a reversionary interest in sections of county granted to the state of wisconsin for the purpose of constructing railroads under the and acts.mauler bayfield county,d,mauler bayfield county,cir.
also in dispute is the united states reversionary interest in the parcels of land owned by john and kay hawksford hawksfords and dean and kathryn johnson dk johnsons,which lie in an even,government lot of section,township north,range west,in bayfield county.according to the landowners,railroads seeking rights of way in sections generally obtained this interest through private conveyance or condemnation on a basis.with respect to the property in section,the landowners maintain that a private homesteader initially acquired title to the property in by patent from the united states,without the united states retaining any reversionary interest.approximately seven months later,the state condemned a portion of this property,completely outside any federal land grant program.
the county disagrees with the landowners characterization of the property interest over the railway line in section.the act of granted a to railways charted within ten years hereafter on the united states public lands,with construction then needing to be completed within the next fifteen years.ch,stat.the county maintains that the railway line in section is covered by this act because,even though construction on the line did not begin until the,the railroad filed a map with the land office in that showed the intended railway line.the county argues that court decisions have not required railroads to have strictly complied with statutorily imposed time limits,and that thus,with the act of applying here,the united states retained a reversionary interest in the property.according to the county,the land grant to the homesteader and subsequent state condemnation proceeding did not affect the united states reversionary interest in the railway line.
congress scheme for the united states reversionary interests 
the basis for finding that the united states holds a reversionary interest in the railway lines can be traced back to a supreme court decision,where the court characterized railroad grants as a limited fee,made on an implied condition of reverter in the event that the company ceased to use or retain the land for the purpose for which it was granted.mauler,at quoting northern pacific ry.townsend.subsequently,in,congress passed the abandoned railroad right of way act,which addressed how congress wished to dispose of its reversionary interest,at.section provided that when a railway line was declared abandoned by a proper court or by congress,the united states reversionary interest would vest in the adjacent landowner,unless the abandoned line was converted into a public highway within one year of the declaration of abandonment.at approximately the same time,congress also passed another law permitting the railroads to sell their right of way to state or local governments to establish public highways,stat.enacted in,codified at.in an effort to preserve these abandoned railway lines for use as trails,congress amended in.c.under this amendment,abandoned railway lines would no longer pass to the adjacent landowner,but instead the united states would retain title to the property,provided again that the line was not converted to a public highway within one year of a determination of abandonment id.
dissolution of the railway line 
in addition to disputing whether the united states maintained a reversionary interest in these railway lines,the county and the landowners also dispute whether the railway lines have already been abandoned in accord with and c.in,the chicago north western transportation company filed a notice of proposed abandonment with the interstate commerce commission icc with respect to the portion of railway line running through bayfield county that is relevant to this case.then,in,the icc issued a certificate and order permitting the abandonment of the railway line.one month later,in april,the railroad cancelled its tariffs on the line,and in,the railroad pulled up the tracks.in november,soon before the tracks were pulled up,the county had declined an opportunity to purchase this.
according to the landowners,the railway line was abandoned in accord with the terms of in either or while the county contends that a proper declaration of abandonment has not yet been issued.regardless,while the county disputes the validity of the following actions,on march,the railroad executed a quitclaim deed purporting to convey its interests over all the property at issue to the sc johnsons.the sc johnsons then donated the majority of these lands to the forest service,while retaining some of the land for themselves,and issuing quitclaim deeds to other parties,including the hawksfords and dk johnsons,whose properties abutted the right of way.
procedural history 
this lawsuit arose out of the county ongoing efforts to convert and integrate abandoned railway lines into the miles of snowmobile trails that already exist in the county.see travel info ashland and bayfield county,snowmobile report information.com files rsnowmobilefr.html last visited march.in the hopes of preventing the county from moving forward with its plan,the landowners filed an action in federal court against the county and the united states seeking declaratory relief,see,under the quiet title act.on november,the landowners filed a motion for summary judgment,contending that,and c were inapplicable because the united states had not retained any reversionary interests over the former railway lines,and alternatively,that the railway lines had been abandoned for purposes of in,and thus the county could no longer lay claim to the property.the county filed its brief opposing the landowners motion for summary judgment on november,disputing both of the landowners claims.on that same date,the united states filed a disclaimer of interest in the property.this disclaimer,submitted by the united states attorney office,stated that the united states had determined that the lands in question had been deeded without the united states retaining any reversionary interest in the property,and that accordingly,the united states,under e,disclaimed all interest in the property at issue in this suit.the following day,the district court issued an order confirming the disclaimer of interest.subsequently,the landowners filed a motion to dismiss,claiming that the disclaimer resolved the issues in their favor in the case.
on january,the district court dismissed the united states from the case and issued its memorandum and order on the landowners motions.after establishing that despite the disclaimer,an independent basis for federal jurisdiction still existed,see e,the district court proceeded to analyze the impact the disclaimer had on the county asserted property rights over the railway lines.the court determined that the county did not acquire any interest in the railway lines until after they were abandoned,and that prior to that date,the united states could treat its reversionary interests as it wished.accordingly,assuming abandonment had not yet occurred,the united states disclaimer of interest destroyed any property interest the county had in the railway lines.based on these findings,the district court granted the landowners motion for summary judgment and provided declaratory relief to the landowners by quieting title in their favor with respect to any claim to the property made by the county under or c.
ii.analysis 
federal jurisdiction 
before proceeding to examine the disclaimer of interest effect on the merits of this suit,we must first determine whether this court has jurisdiction over this case.the landowners brought suit under the declaratory judgment act,to quiet title in the disputed property.when the suit was originally filed,federal jurisdiction existed by virtue of the fact that the united states was named as a defendant.see a see also f.this basis for jurisdiction,however,was eliminated when the district court confirmed the disclaimer of interest.e.thus,in order for the suit to have remained in federal court,an independent basis for federal jurisdiction was required.id.the district court properly found that such an independent basis exists.

we note at the outset that we are provided with little guidance in addressing the effect of the united states disclaimer of interest.the statute itself,under which the united states disclaimed its interest,fails to define disclaimer,does not address under what circumstances a district court should confirm such a disclaimer,and fails to address what effect,if any,such a disclaimer has on a suit other than to divest the federal court of jurisdiction under f.see e.similarly,little help can be found on this matter by turning to our sister circuits or the lower federal courts.fortunately,our task here is a narrow one.despite the lack of clarity as to what effect the disclaimer has on the county interest,the parties in this suit do not dispute that the united states properly issued its disclaimer of interest,and the county does not directly challenge the district court confirmation of this disclaimer,nor raise any charge that the united states acted in bad faith.accordingly,we also find no issue with the united states filing,and the district court confirmation,of the disclaimer furthermore,it is unnecessary for us to determine what effect the united states disclaimer had on parties aside from the county,since the only issue to determine in this suit is whether the county has superior title to the landowners by virtue of and c.see united states oregon.a bill to quiet title may not be defeated by showing that the plaintiff interest,otherwise sufficient to support the bill,is subject to possibly superior rights in third persons not parties to the suit.it is enough that the interest asserted by the plaintiff in possession of land is superior to that of those who are parties defendant.internal citations omitted.thus,our focus is truly limited to ascertaining the disclaimer effect on the county property interest in the railway lines.
in trying to determine whether the disclaimer served to destroy the county property interest,it is first necessary to define disclaimer.given that the statute does not define the term,we turn to the common understanding of the word,which is that the disclaimer operates as a renunciation of the united states legal right or claim over the railway lines.black law dictionary ed see bel united states,cir,cert.denied,d quoting city bank trust united states,defining disclaimer as the repudiation or renunciation of a claim or power invested in a person for which he formally alleged to be his.the refusal,or rejection of an estate or right offered to a person.the disavowal,denial,or renunciation of an interest,right,or property imputed to a person or alleged to be his.see black law dictionary ed defining disclaimer in the context of estates as t he act by which a party refuses to accept an estate which has been conveyed to him.if the disclaimer is deemed a renunciation,the issue then becomes what it is that is being the united states ever held a reversionary interest in the land,or merely the united states current reversionary interest in the property.if it is the former,it would mean that and c were never applicable to the railway lines at issue in the suit.if instead it is the latter,then the question is whether such a disclaimer still renders and c wholly inapplicable to the railway lines,or whether,under the statutory scheme in and c,the county interest is destroyed by the disclaimer.
we turn first to the question of whether the united states disclaimer has the effect of renouncing that the united states ever held a reversionary interest in the land at issue.as the district court observed below,as a general matter,under common law principles for trusts and estates,a disclaimer or renunciation is treated as making an interest ineffective from its inception.see jewett comm r,d blackmun,dissenting in a trust case,stating,a disclaimer is a refusal to accept property ab initio see also restatement first of property cmt.d in the estates context,describing how,normally renunciation is not manifested until a date subsequent to the time when the creating instrument becomes operative.when,however,such renunciation is manifested,the resulting ineffectiveness operates as an ineffectiveness in the inception.however,this legal fiction does not alter whether the united states in fact retained a reversionary interest in the railway lines at issue in this suit.
even if,as a general matter,the mere filing of a disclaimer of interest can not alter the underlying history of conveyances and property interests surrounding a given piece of land,the landowners argue that this court should defer to the specific legal assertions made by the united states in the disclaimer filed in this suit.here,the disclaimer filed by the united states attorney office on behalf of the united states did not merely disclaim the united states interest in the property,but also included the legal predicate for doing,that the united states had not retained any reversionary interest or right of reentry to the land ultimately deeded to the landowners.the landowners argue that the district court,upon confirming the disclaimer,should have accepted these assertions at face value,and thus found that because the united states lacked any reversionary interest in the railway lines,was inapplicable to the property at issue and accordingly the county lacked any interest in the.this,however,is not the case.the department of justice mission t o enforce the law and defend the interests of the united states,united states department of justice,mission statement,last visited on march,and the united states attorney duty to represent the united states in all civil matters,does not bestow that office with the power to authoritatively determine mixed questions of law and fact,such as whether the united states originally maintained a reversionary interest over the railway lines at issue in this suit.thus,the district court confirmation of the disclaimer only confirmed the united states renunciation of its interest in the property as of the date of the disclaimer the united states ever in fact held a reversionary interest in the railway lines is a matter left to the courts,assuming jurisdiction over the suit still exists see marbury madison,cranch.it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.alaska united states,affirmed by alaska ahtna,cir district court confirmation of united states disclaimer of interest did not strip the court of jurisdiction to review the secretary of interior determination of a waterway navigability,the sole issue in determining whether property interest originally lay with the united states or with alaska.
assuming,then,that the united states did in fact retain a reversionary interest in the railway lines at issue in this suit,the remaining question is what legal effect,if any,the disclaimer now has on the county property interest.here too,separation of powers concerns exist,which in this case prevent the disclaimer from effectively repealing and c applicability to this land.as has already been discussed,and c were passed by congress pursuant to the united states reversionary interest in the railway.this interest can best be characterized as a possibility of reverter,which only vests upon abandonment of the railway line,at which point the interest is still subject to divestment if a public highway is established within one year time.see vieux bay reg l park,cir.tracking the district court reasoning,the landowners assert that similarly,the county interest in the property can not vest unless three contingencies occur the united states retains its reversionary interest the railway line is abandoned and a public highway is established.accordingly,assuming abandonment has not yet occurred,the landowners claim that the united states was free to alter,amend,or release the property interests it held,as well as those of the county.
the landowners are partially correct in their argument.as the cases cited by the landowners to support their position reflect,when a legislature disposes of a possibility of reverter in a statute,until that interest vests into an enforceable right,the legislature is free to repeal that reversionary interest or amend the contingencies upon which the interest will vest.independent school dist.smith,iowa,iowa commonwealth transp.comm r windsor,thus,we are of opinion that until the possibility of having an estate in the property vested into an enforceable right,the contingencies upon which it depended and the procedures for exercising the right accrued remained subject to modification by future amendment.thus,as reflected by congress amendment to with c,congress was free to modify the disposal of the united states reversionary interest for railway lines that had not yet been abandoned according to the terms set forth in.the landowners fail to recognize,however,that there is a distinction between congress modifying the disposal of the united states reversionary interest and the united states attorney office trying to do the same.while it is uncontested by the county that the united states attorney office has been granted the authority to disclaim the united states own interest in the property at issue,that does not give the united states attorney office the authority to also effectively disclaim the county statutorily created interest.see royal indemnity united states.subordinate officers of the united states are without the power to release or otherwise dispose of the rights and property of the united states,save only as it has been conferred upon them by act of congress or is to be implied from other powers so granted.if the united states attorney office,by filing a disclaimer of interest,is free to foreclose bayfield county future contingent rights in the as the district court maintained,this effectively amounts to the executive branch usurpation of congress decision to bestow the county with a future,contingent property interest in the,creating separation of powers concerns.
the landowners further argue,however,that common law principles must be applied to the property interests in and c,in which case the landowners claim that by the very terms of and c,the disclaimer serves to extinguish the county property interest.according to the landowners,the disclaimer should be treated the same as a release of the united states possibility of reverter,which,as the landowners maintain,at common law served to convert what was previously a determinable or qualified fee into a fee simple absolute.d estates herbert tiffany basil jones,tiffany real prop.while this court acknowledges that at common law,a release of a possibility of reverter generally has this effect,see restatement first of property,it is still not altogether clear whether the county interest would invariably be extinguished under common law principles.first,the authorities cited by the landowners do not clearly state whether such
