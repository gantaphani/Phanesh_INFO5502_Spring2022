hazel wilson,a resident of little rock,is the owner of two vacant lots in malvern,arkansas.wilson filed this action asserting that defendants violated her constitutional rights by constructing a drainage ditch along the street side of her property that causes storm waters to pool on her property,greatly reducing its value,and by retaliating against her for complaining.named as defendants in the second amended complaint are malvern mayor steve northcutt,former and current street department superintendents ronnie lytle and boyd johnson,chief inspector len dawson,and the city of malvern.the individual defendants appeal the district court denial of their motions for summary judgment on grounds of qualified immunity we reverse in part.
in early,responding to complaints of periodic flooding from residents of a predominantly residential area,the city of malvern street department began constructing a drainage ditch along the south side of veneer street eastward from babcock street toward what the parties refer to as the veneer street creek.superintendent lytle testified that,when construction reached the city right of way on the north side of wilson vacant lots at veneer street,the crew stopped work to do another project and routed the ditch onto wilson lots,letting the water go somewhere at the time.lytle said he did not notify wilson because he did not know who owned the vacant lots.
when drainage water started pooling on her property,wilson attorney wrote mayor northcutt on may,complaining that the city had entered her property and dug a ditch that reduced the value of the land to zero because it is.the letter demanded that the city remove the ditch or pay the prior full value of the property.city attorney mark roberts replied,stating that construction of the ditch was incomplete and the plan included culverts to prevent harm to wilson property.in july,the street department completed the project,extending the drainage ditch along veneer street from wilson lots to the veneer street creek.
on july,wilson attorney wrote city attorney roberts,stating he had observed the property after several rains and concluded that the corrective work done in the summer of has exacerbated the problem.because the land in front of wilson lots was the lowest point of the ditch,he explained,water was entering the lots from three directions instead of draining into the veneer street creek.again,wilson attorney demanded that the city correct the work or buy the lots.the record on appeal contains no response on behalf of the city.
in addition to ditch construction,the street department was responsible for maintaining drainage ditches,which included mowing weeds and bushes that grow naturally,and removing debris.since its completion in july,wilson contends,the city has mowed the veneer street ditch only once,in june.the overgrowth of weeds and bushes has impeded proper drainage,exacerbating the problem of water pooling on her property.wilson cites the fact that the city mowed and cleaned a ditch along the north side of veneer street in april as evidence that the neglect of the ditch along her property has been intentional.
wilson initially filed suit in march.three months later,the city chief inspector,len dawson,ordered the towing of the café fish,a mobile home functioning as a restaurant owned by wilson sister.the city later released the vehicle.some months later,wilson voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit.
wilson filed this lawsuit in november and her second amended complaint in november.her principal federal claim was that construction of the faulty drainage ditch constituted an unlawful taking of property and a denial of due process in violation of the fifth and fourteenth amendments.the district court dismissed those claims as premature because wilson did not exhaust adequate state remedies for obtaining compensation.that ruling is not before us.
wilson further claimed that defendants i violated the equal protection clause by constructing the ditch because she is ii violated the first amendment by extending the ditch in july in retaliation for her first complaint iii violated the equal protection clause and her first amendment rights by allowing weeds and bushes to grow in the ditch in retaliation for her complaints and iv violated the equal protection clause and her first amendment rights by towing the café fish in retaliation for wilson exercising her right to sue.the district court dismissed the equal protection claim regarding the café fish towing because wilson sister is the person injured by the alleged selective enforcement.the court denied summary judgment on the remaining claims on the ground that genuine fact disputes exist regarding defendants alleged discriminatory and retaliatory motives.
qualified immunity protects government officials from the costs of trial and the burdens of broad discovery unless their discretionary acts violated clearly established statutory or constitutional rights.harlow fitzgerald,d.a defendant claim of qualified immunity is determined by an objective standard under harlow.this prompts the difficult question of whether an official is entitled to qualified immunity if improper as purposeful race discrimination or an element of the plaintiff federal claim.in britton,d,the court declined to place a higher burden of proof on plaintiffs in these situations,observing that the improper intent element of various causes of action should not ordinarily preclude summary disposition of insubstantial claims.justice stevens majority opinion then gave substance to this observation by instructing 
i f the has made a properly supported motion for summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity,the plaintiff may not respond simply with general attacks upon the defendant credibility,but rather must identify affirmative evidence from which a jury could find that the plaintiff has carried his or her burden of proving the pertinent motive.

in support of their motion for summary judgment,defendants submitted unrefuted evidence that the ditch was constructed in response to complaints by neighboring malvern residents,including at least one,that their properties to the west of wilson vacant lots were experiencing periodic flooding.the ditch was intended to divert water from these properties past wilson property to the veneer street creek.in response,wilson submitted no evidence of purposeful race discrimination other than her own unsupported opinion.therefore,each individual defendant is entitled to qualified immunity from this claim because the record is devoid of affirmative evidence from which a jury could find the pertinent motive,at.
b.the failures to correct and properly maintain the ditch.wilson second amended complaint next alleged that the defendants failures to correct flow problems with the ditch and to mow large weeds and bushes growing in the ditch were the product of racial animus toward wilson and retaliation for her initial complaint.wilson presented evidence that she complained in a july letter that water was continuing to pool on her lots even though the ditch had been extended to the veneer street creek in july,but the city took no corrective action.she submitted an affidavit by a registered professional engineer who studied the ditch and concluded that its low point is alongside wilson lots and therefore storm water was draining from the west and the east onto wilson property.wilson further submitted
