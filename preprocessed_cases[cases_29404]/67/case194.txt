d balance.any balance remaining shall be distributed among all partners as follows according to their percentage holding 
except as herein modified,the said partnership is hereby affirmed,dated this day of march.
the modification thus specified three ways for the partners,while alive,either to terminate and liquidate the partnership or else to transfer individual interests to others.termination leading to liquidation could be accomplished by a percent interest vote.a partner could,as of right,assign or sell any section of his interest to specified family members but could not assign or sell to any others except with the consent of the other partners after first offering them refusal rights.several partners thereafter transferred their interests to family members,as permitted,including many of the current parties.since the modification,there have been no further revisions to the partnership agreement,and through the bringing of the present lawsuit in november,the partnership has continued to operate even though the term specified in the partnership agreement came to an end on january.as the district court found,not only did the partnership continue to manage its rental property without interruption after the term expired,but many of the plaintiffs and defendants acceded to their interest in the partnership through assignments made after the expiration date pursuant to of the modification.
on august,philip,peter and carolyn tropeano,holding collectively a interest in the partnership,served written notice on the defendants that they intended to retire,effective october,according to the provisions of.laws ch.the notice stated that p ursuant to the provisions of ch,the change in our relationship effected by our retirement from the partnership is to be treated as dissolution of the partnership.pursuant to the provisions of chapter,section,as retiring partners we wish to have the value of our interests ascertained as of the date of dissolution that is,october.the notice stated that the retiring partners understood that a complete termination of the partnership required a vote of the partners but that after the leaving partners retired,the remaining members could also continue on as the sole partners.the letter stated 
we recognize that in order to terminate the partnership,a vote of of the partners is required if you wish to terminate the partnership,we would participate in that vote in the affirmative.
the plaintiffs sought to be paid their respective interests of the value of the partnership assets.they valued their collective interest in the partnership assets totaling million at an appraised value of.
the defendants responded that the plaintiffs were not entitled to withdraw and receive from the partnership the liquidation value of their respective interests in the partnership.the defendants,however,offered to purchase the plaintiffs minority interest for under paragraph of the modification.in a letter to plaintiffs from counsel for defendant charlene dorman,the defendants explained their offer,saying 
on your client management watch,the partner distributions to your clients have averaged over the last four years per kennedy kennedy financial statements.if a yield of on dorman offer of was achieved a very reasonable figure your clients would be in an identical position having converted their illiquid minority interest to cash.
after efforts to compromise failed,plaintiffs brought this action in the district court in november of.
in their initial complaint,the plaintiffs asserted a right to retire from the partnership pursuant to.laws ch,and to secure the partnership accounting outlined in that provision.defendants moved to dismiss,and plaintiffs filed an opposition,to which defendants replied.the defendants also successfully moved to disqualify the plaintiffs counsel,who had previously represented the partnership.
after obtaining new counsel,the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint.besides the relief originally sought,the amended complaint requested,inter alia,declaratory judgments that the partnership was a partnership at will and therefore terminable by any partner,at any time,for any reason the plaintiffs had lawfully terminated the partnership and the plaintiffs termination of the partnership required the winding up of the partnership business,the liquidation of the partnership assets,and the distribution of the liquidation proceeds to the partners according to their respective partnership interests.
the defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs amended complaint or,in the alternative,for summary judgment.the plaintiffs filed a consolidated pleading opposing the motion to dismiss and for summary judgment and for declaratory judgments on the three points on which they sought declarations.defendants opposed the plaintiffs,and the plaintiffs filed a reply brief.the district court heard oral argument on december.
the plaintiffs argued to the district court that the express partnership had terminated on january,when the term of the agreement had expired.thereafter,they said,the partnership became a partnership at will by operation of law under.laws ch,which states 
when a partnership for a fixed term or particular undertaking is continued after the termination of such term or particular undertaking without any express agreement,the rights and duties of the partners remain the same as they were at such termination,so far as is consistent with a partnership at will.
under the plaintiffs theory,any restrictions expressed in the modification to the partnership agreement could not affect their ability to retire from,and in effect dissolve,the partnership,since once the partnership became one at will,any partner could terminate the partnership at any time for any reason.see,meehan shaughnessy.plaintiffs argued that when a partner in a partnership at will retires,his or her withdrawal triggers an accounting pursuant to the terms of the uniform partnership act upa as codified in.laws ch.
the defendants disagreed.in their view,the modification supplanted the term with an agreement to continue the partnership,unless or until a liquidation vote was achieved.the defendants asserted that the modification substituted a new structure for that under the old agreement rather than being subject to a fixed term of thirty years,the property would be maintained indefinitely under the agreement until a dissolution occurred by a vote.alternatively,the defendants argued that even if the partnership had become a partnership at will,no accounting was called for under as the accounting provision did not come into effect if the parties had otherwise agreed to a different course of action.thus,provides that 
w hen any partner retires or dies,and the business is continued without any settlement of accounts unless otherwise agreed,he or his legal representative as against such persons or partnership may have the value of his interest at the date of dissolution ascertained,and shall receive as an ordinary creditor an amount equal to the value of his interest in the dissolved partnership with interest emphasis supplied.
here,defendants argued,the partners had,in the modification,agreed otherwise by limiting a partner withdrawal or retirement to the three options described therein,termination by vote assignment to a family member or sale subject to the partners consent.any other interpretation,the defendants said,would render meaningless the restrictions agreed to in the modification,including the termination requirement.
in response,plaintiffs insisted that defendants were wrong to assert that the partners rights upon retirement,as conferred in,were lessened or eliminated by something said in the modification.they argued that there is no provision that otherwise agrees as to how a retiring partner share is to be valued.no formula is set forth in the modification for valuing a retiring partner interest.accordingly,the accounting described in must be utilized.
the district court ruled against defendants contention that the modification had substituted for the term an agreement to continue the partnership until terminated by a vote.it agreed with plaintiffs that nothing in the modification eliminated the original term,hence,after january,the partnership became one at will by operation of of.laws ch.nonetheless,the court found for defendants on the ultimate issue,finding the partners had otherwise agreed to a method of valuation such as defendants proposed.because the parties had agreed upon an alternative means,the method of valuation called for in of the upa did not apply,the plaintiffs being restricted,in these circumstances,to terminating and valuing their interest pursuant to paragraph of the modification.
while thus holding for the defendants,the court observed as an aside that the easy thing for the court to do would be to pronounce an ambiguity in the intent of the original partners in crafting the modification and proceed to a trial.nevertheless,the court found no such ambiguity,hence made no such pronouncement.as a further reason for avoiding a trial,the court noted there was no disinterested person alive who could testify as to the partners intent in modifying the agreement.the court granted the motion to dismiss and denied the plaintiffs for summary judgment.

we review de novo the district court denial of the for partial summary judgment and the granting of the motion to dismiss.centro medico del turabo,feliciano de melecio,cir.
the question of whether a contract is ambiguous is one for the courts.itt ltx,cir.all of the contract terms should be construed together to find a coherent whole.as such,a court may look to related provisions of a contract to cast light on the meaning of disputed language.nadherny roseland property,cir.
the intent of contracting parties is generally deemed a material issue of fact precluding summary dismissal.blanchard peerless ins,cir.
the question now on appeal is whether,under.laws ch,each of the plaintiffs is entitled to receive the full value of his or her shares in the partnership as determined upon liquidation,or rather must accept the value offered by the remaining partners purportedly under their powers to approve sales to third parties under paragraph,supra,of the modification.the make two arguments.first,they argue that the partnership became a partnership at will after the expiration of the term that as partners at will they enjoyed an absolute right to dissolve the partnership and that nothing in the modification constitutes an agreement otherwise for the valuing of their partnership shares upon retirement.second,and alternatively,they argue that at the very least,the modification is ambiguous and thus its meaning leaves a question of fact open to be decided by a jury.we agree with the first argument and therefore reverse the judgment of the district court.
nature of the partnership 
laws ch,which the partners expressly referenced in the partnership agreement and which enacts the upa,governs the formation,conduct,and liquidation of partnerships in massachusetts.under ch,a change in the relation of the partners caused by any partner ceasing to be associated in the carrying on of the business results in the dissolution of the partnership.dissolution may occur by the express will of any partner at any time,even in contravention of the agreement between the partners,where the circumstances do not otherwise permit dissolution.laws.ch,b.where,however,a partnership agreement provides that the partnership is to continue indefinitely or without the specification of a particular undertaking,and the partnership is therefore at will,a partner has the right to dissolve the partnership,and the dissolution opted for by the partner occurs w ithout violation of the agreement between the partners.id.at.the statute further provides that 
when a dissolution is caused in any way,except in contravention of the partnership agreement,each partner,as against his and all persons claiming through them in respect of their interests in the partnership,unless otherwise agreed,may have the partnership property applied to discharge its liabilities,and the surplus applied to pay in cash the net amount owing to the respective partners.
id.at emphasis supplied.
from the foregoing we glean the following if a partner withdraws from a partnership at will,thus causing its dissolution,the dissolution is not regarded in law as contravening the agreement between the partners,even if the terms of that agreement provide otherwise.thereupon,the partner is entitled under to his full share of the partnership net assets unless otherwise agreed.this contrasts with the situation in which a partner withdraws from a term or other partnership not at will,where the partnership agreement similarly disallows or restricts withdrawal.in the latter case unless there are other factors,the restrictive terms of the partnership agreement may be dispositive.
clearly,therefore,it is of considerable importance whether the partnership here was or was not at will when plaintiffs withdrew if it was at will,withdrawal was lawful,and the withdrawing partners were entitled to their net shares unless some other method of distribution could be found to have been otherwise agreed to.but if the partnership was not at will,plaintiffs right to withdraw from the enterprise was arguably barred altogether although we need not finally decide by paragraph of the modification,which required a vote for termination,resulting in a significantly stronger argument for limiting plaintiffs to the distribution being proposed by defendants under paragraph.
it is,therefore,of importance to determine initially whether the partnership was at will when the plaintiffs sought to withdraw.we turn first to that issue,answering in the affirmative.
ii.whether when plaintiffs retired,the partnership was at will.
the plaintiffs argue,and the district court so found,that when the partners continued to operate the partnership after the expiration of the original term on january,it ceased to be a partnership for a fixed term and became a partnership at will.they base this assertion on the language in.laws ch,that,
w hen a partnership for a fixed term or particular undertaking is continued after the termination of such term or particular undertaking without any express agreement,the rights and duties of the partners remain the same as they were at such termination,so far as is consistent with a partnership at will.
the district court adopted plaintiffs analysis,and we agree.the term was expressly provided for in the original agreement and was not mentioned,much less stricken or modified,in the modification.the modification states at the end that,e xcept as herein modified,the said partnership is hereby affirmed.the modification further states that its purpose is to continue the original agreement in full force with exception of joseph tropeano interest.defendants would nonetheless have us hold that the modification sub silentio struck out the term.they argue that paragraph of the modification,stating in part that,t he partnership can be terminated by a interest vote implicitly eliminated the term provision contained in the original agreement,and substituted an agreement to continue the partnership indefinitely unless or until a liquidation vote was achieved.
like the district court,however,we believe defendants contention exceeds any reasonable reading of the relevant instruments.to adopt it would necessitate revising the plain language of both the partnership agreement and the modification itself.when the modification was executed,seven years yet remained of the term.seven years was not such a brief remaining period as to make it unreasonable for the parties to have left intact the original term.it would have been easy enough for them to have executed an extension any time prior to january,in order to continue the term partnership and avoid the consequences of.had the parties intended,when they executed the modification,to eliminate the term provision,leaving the partnership to continue until terminated by a vote,as defendants suggest,one would expect them to have so stated in the modification,given the express affirmance therein of the original partnership,e xcept as herein modified.we thus affirm the district court conclusion that the term provision forming part of the original partnership agreement was not deleted by the modification.
defendants argue in the alternative that,even if the term provision remained and the years expired,the provision made the partnership venture a particular undertaking,so as to keep the partnership from becoming one at will under when the years was up.we disagree.the defendants rely on girard bank haley,to support their argument that the termination provision turned the partnership into a particular undertaking,noting that the pennsylvania supreme court had ruled that a particular undertaking under the statute must be capable of accomplishment at some time,although the exact time may be unknown and unascertainable at the date of the agreement.id.the girard court,however,immediately went on to undermine defendants argument,writing of the partnership agreement at issue in that case that 
t he agreement contains no provision fixing a definite term,and the sole undertaking to which it refers is that of maintaining and leasing real property.leasing property,like many other trades or businesses,involves entering into a business relationship which may continue indefinitely there is nothing particular about it.
id.at.business activities which may continue indefinitely are not particular in nature and do not constitute particular undertakings.miami subs murray family trust.the defendants rely also on osborne workman,for the principle that a partnership agreement which provided that it could only be dissolved mutually or by law was not terminable at will by an individual partner though the plaintiff was permitted to withdraw from the partnership and receive the value of his partnership interest as specified in the agreement.id.at.the analogy is tenuous at best.the osborne court focused on the specific nature of the partnership,a coalition of medical doctors which had provided expressly for the valuation of a withdrawing partner share,and emphasized the idea that partnerships among professionals often require agreements that promote continuity and longevity.here,the partnership is not one of professionals,and there is no provision expressly for the valuation of a withdrawing partner interest.
defendants emphasize that the agreement as modified defines not just the particular undertaking of the management of a real estate property but also the particular undertaking that the partnership would terminate when of the partnership voted to do so.as already noted above,however,the modification explicitly stated both that the partnership was affirmed by the modification and that the original agreement was to be continued in full force and effect,indicating that the term was very much alive and well through the modification.the states merely that the partnership can be terminated by a interest vote,not that this alone will allow its not replace that term either as a time limitation or a particular undertaking under the terms of.laws.
hence,the partnership was an at will partnership when plaintiffs announced their decision to retire.as such,it was subject to the provisions of massachusetts law relative to such partnerships,including the absolute right of one or more of the partners
