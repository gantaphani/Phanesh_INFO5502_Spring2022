robert matthews appeals a district court decision that the state of north carolina the state is the legal owner of a historic document seized by federal agents in connection with an in rem forfeiture action that the united states voluntarily dismissed.because the district court lacked authority to adjudicate ownership of the document after dismissal of the forfeiture action,we vacate and remand with instructions.
in september,congress approved twelve proposed amendments to the united states constitution,including the ten amendments that became known as the bill of rights.soon thereafter,president washington sent handwritten copies of these proposed amendments to thirteen states,including north carolina.the state maintained possession of its copy of the amendments the north carolina copy until the civil war during that war,or soon thereafter,the north carolina copy left the state possession 
in february,wayne pratt,a corporation owned by antiques dealer wayne pratt purchased a document believed to be one of the original copies of the bill of rights the document.matthews claims that he contributed half of the purchase price as a passive investor in a venture by pratt to buy and resell the document for profit.
after pratt contacted several individuals in an effort to resell the document,north carolina officials learned that the document was being offered for sale.believing that the document was the north carolina copy,state officials asked the united states attorney office for assistance in recovering the document.in march,federal agents applied for and received a warrant to seize the document on the ground that there was probable cause to believe it had been stolen,transported,and possessed in violation of federal law and thus was subject to forfeiture.later that month,fbi agents,working with individuals from the national constitution center in philadelphia,conducted a staged purchase of the document from pratt in pennsylvania.during this operation,agents seized the document from john richardson,pratt attorney whom he had authorized to conduct the transaction.
the united states subsequently brought a civil forfeiture action against the document in the eastern district of north carolina.see b a west providing that a forfeiture action may be brought in the district court for the district in which any of the acts or omissions giving rise to the forfeiture occurred.the district court issued a warrant of arrest for the document,which was delivered into the custody of the united states marshal.pratt,matthews,and the state filed verified statements of interest claiming they were entitled to ownership and possession of the document the united states formally agreed that the state was the legal owner of the document.on september,pratt withdrew his claim and conveyed all his rights in the document to the state.that same day,the united states voluntarily dismissed the forfeiture action.one day later,matthews moved the district court to return the document to him,asserting that he was its and thus was entitled to possess it upon dismissal of the forfeiture action.
on november,the district court entered an order stating that due to the united states dismissal of the forfeiture action,the court would have to return the document to person from whom it was seized i n order to restore the parties to the status quo ante.noting,however,that matthews might assert claims regarding the document upon its return to richardson,the district court ordered matthews to declare and show cause what claim he makes against pratt upon the dismissal of this action and the return of the property.id.at.matthews responded that upon releasing the document to richardson,the district court would lose jurisdiction over matthews claim,and he would then take appropriate action in a competent court in order to adjudicate the issue of ownership.id.at.
before the district court entered a final order disposing of the document,matthews commenced actions in other courts seeking,inter alia,to enjoin richardson from transferring the document upon its return to him.the state also brought an action in north carolina state court seeking injunctive and declaratory relief.in response to these filings,the district court entered an order on december,stating that it retained exclusive in rem jurisdiction over the document and that its earlier order was intended to provide a forum within which to conclude all of the claims and disputes having to do with the document in question prior to a final order in this case.id.at.following a hearing on january,the court ruled that the state was the legal owner of the document because it was a north carolina public record over which the state had never voluntarily relinquished control.the district court ordered that the document be delivered to the state but stayed its judgment pending appeal.
matthews primary claim on appeal is that because the united states voluntarily dismissed its forfeiture action,the district court lacked authority to adjudicate ownership rights in the document.matthews contends that the district court should have restored the parties to the status quo ante that existed before the united states seized the document.see black law dictionary ed defining status quo ante as t he situation that existed before something else being discussed occurred.we review this issue concerning the jurisdiction of the district court de novo.see united states jones,cir.
in its opinion setting forth its reasons for awarding ownership of the document to the state,the district court determined that it possessed authority to resolve the competing ownership claims despite the dismissal of the underlying action 
throughout these legal proceedings,this court has retained in rem jurisdiction over the disposition of the document,because the document is and has been in the possession of the united states marshal for the eastern district of north carolina since the march seizure.therefore,despite the government voluntary dismissal of its action against the document,this court still was required to determine the final disposition of the document.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that this determination was erroneous.
the united states dismissed its forfeiture action without prejudice by filing a notice of voluntary dismissal before matthews,the only remaining adverse party,answered the forfeiture complaint.see.a i.a voluntary dismissal under rule a i is available as a matter of unconditional right and is,it is effective at the moment the notice is filed with the clerk and no judicial approval is required.marex titanic,v.the wrecked abandoned vessel,cir citations omitted.moreover,a dismissal without prejudice operates to leave the parties as if no action had been brought at all.dove codesco,cir.a voluntary dismissal thus carries down with it previous proceedings and orders in the action,and all pleadings,both of plaintiff and defendant,and all issues,with respect to plaintiff claim.piper aircraft in re piper aircraft distrib.antitrust litig,cir internal quotation marks omitted hereinafter piper aircraft.in addition,after an action is voluntarily dismissed,the court lacks authority to conduct further proceedings on the merits.see duke energy trading,davis,cir foss fed.intermediate credit bank of paul,cir.
here,the forfeiture action was terminated when the united states filed its notice of dismissal.see marex titanic,at.at that time,the various statements of ownership interest became a nullity.see id.at piper aircraft,at.the question that remains is what authority the district court had concerning the disposition of the property,which remained in the possession of the united states marshal,once the forfeiture action ended.this question is not answered by the federal forfeiture statutes.also,the parties have not cited,nor have we found,any reported decision specifically addressing whether,after the voluntary dismissal of a civil forfeiture action under rule a i,the district court may adjudicate competing ownership claims to the seized property.but united states in united states currency,cir in forfeiture action dismissed on limitations grounds and involving separate c
