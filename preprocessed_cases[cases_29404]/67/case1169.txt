this is the second time we visit the fairness of a proposed class settlement stemming from fleet mortgage corporation fleet alleged violations of various state consumer protection laws,as well as various other federal and state laws.we rejected the first proposed settlement because,among other reasons,the district court failed to consider adequately the value of the claims of the class a class of consumers whose privacy interests were purportedly intruded upon,but who did not suffer any damages.see generally mirfasihi fleet mortgage,cir.following remand,the district court did not adequately consider the potential value of the class claims.we therefore reverse and remand the case for further consideration of this limited issue.
background 
this lawsuit was brought on behalf of approximately million people whose home mortgages were owned by fleet.plaintiff core allegations are that fleet sold mortgage information including loan amounts,the type of loan,and repayment histories to telemarketing companies for the purpose of selling certain financial products to the class which they purportedly did not want.the complaint alleges and fleet does not deny that fleet was an active collaborator in drafting the script that the telemarketers used and allowed direct billing of the fees for the telemarketers products onto the mortgage bill of its customers,without obtaining from customers.plaintiff alleges,among other things,that fleet violated the act and the fair credit reporting act,along with various state consumer protection laws.
in,the parties entered into the initial settlement agreement the first settlement,which provided for two plaintiff classes a telemarketing class and an class,comprised of approximately and million members,respectively.the telemarketing class consisted of fleet customers outside of certain customers in minnesota and california,who were the subject of other pending lawsuits,since settled who purchased,and were later billed on their mortgage account statements,for some of the financial products pitched to them by telemarketing firms.the class consisted of all fleet customers whose mortgage information was transmitted to telemarketers in the prior six years,but who did not purchase any services from the telemarketers.
as detailed more fully in our prior opinion,see mirfasihi,at,the first settlement provided that fleet would set aside million to pay the telemarketing class claims,in addition to in disgorgement of profits to this class,which would have resulted in payments ranging from to to each of the telemarketing class claimants.the first settlement provided in fees for the class lawyers.the class,however,was left out in the cold and received nothing.
after the district court approved the settlement,intervenors michael green and angela perry appealed,arguing that the settlement was unfair and unreasonable on a number of grounds.see mirfasihi,at.and we agreed.id.the first settlement contained a number of troubling warning signs,including the payment of disgorged profits to the telemarketing class despite the fact that the profits appeared to come from members of the class the reversion of unclaimed funds to fleet a handsome fee for class lawyers,despite the meagerness of the relief provided in the settlement agreement to class members and the fact that the class did not have separate counsel from the telemarketing class.see id.the reversion feature was particularly favorable to fleet because,based upon the number of telemarketing claimants who filed claims,fleet stood to recoup approximately half of the total million payout.furthermore,the lack of separate counsel for the two classes or,more accurately,the class and the telemarketing subclass,coupled with the lack of any recovery for the class members,created the impression that class counsel had not properly considered the interests of these million claimants.id.at.but our core one that,as will be apparent below,continues to trouble that the district court failed to consider with adequate specificity the reasonableness of an entire class receiving a big fat zero in the settlement.id.at.specifically,the district court did not canvass all potential avenues of recovery to determine whether the class claims were indeed essentially hopeless and thus worthless under the pertinent controlling law.
following this court disapproval of the first settlement,the parties engaged in additional settlement talks,as well as mediation,and ultimately reached a new settlement agreement the second settlement.under the terms of the second settlement,the class will not receive any direct payments.fleet agrees to send the in disgorged funds,as well as any excess funds not claimed by the telemarketing class claimants,to unaffiliated public interest groups charitable institutions devoted to consumer privacy concerns.fleet maximum payment under the various provisions is million.the class lawyers continue to receive in fees.
after the case was reassigned to another district court judge,the parties presented the second settlement for approval.the district court approved the settlement,holding that valuing the class claims at zero was fair and reasonable because,among other reasons,they suffered no actual damages,and,as a result,probably have no recovery under various states consumer protection statutes and common law causes of action,and moreover,the claimants faced significant hurdles in obtaining class certification.the district court also approved of the valuation of the telemarketing claims and the attorneys fees,and generally found that the second settlement properly addressed the warning signs that we had discussed in our prior opinion.
ii.analysis 
it is that district judges presiding over proposed class settlements are expected to give careful scrutiny to the terms of proposed settlements in order to make sure that class counsel are behaving as honest fiduciaries for the class as a whole because class actions are rife with potential conflicts of interest between class counsel and class members.mirfasihi,at collecting and citing cases.district judges must therefore exercise the highest degree of vigilance in scrutinizing proposed settlements of class actions to consider whether the settlement is fair,adequate,and reasonable,and not a product of collusion.reynolds beneficial bank,cir.indeed,the district court judge functions as a fiduciary of the class,who is subject therefore to the high duty of care that the law requires of fiduciaries.id.at.as a general principle,a district court should evaluate,among other things,the probability of plaintiff prevailing on its various claims,the expected costs of future litigation,and hints of collusion.see,mars steel cont l illinois bank trust,cir reynolds,at.our review of the district court scrutiny of a proposed class settlement is more limited we review the district court decision for abuse of discretion.isby bayh,cir.
as an initial observation,there is not much that is substantially new in the second settlement.for instance,fleet total expenses remain capped at million,the telemarketing class members remain eligible for the same range of payments,plaintiff counsel retains its fee,and the class continues to receive nothing.there are,however,some minimal improvements in the second settlement.for example,in negotiating the second settlement,the class received separate counsel from the telemarketing class.but the reconfiguration of the representation was it was the telemarketing the received brand new counsel,clifford cantor,while the attorneys who had negotiated the unimpressive first settlement slid over to the class.this is an odd result,given our concerns over the possibility that the attorneys who negotiated the first settlement had sold the class down the river.mirfasihi,at.it seems clear to us that it was the,not the telemarketing,class that needed a fresh look at the settlement value of their claims.would the proposition that their claims were worthless be bolstered if independent counsel,unclouded by prior positions and assumptions,concurred with the assessment reached in the first settlement whatever the reason for this particular reconfiguration
