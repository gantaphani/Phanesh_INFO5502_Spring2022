this case arises out of several shooting incidents in the city of high point,north carolina the city or high point.in each incident,a high point animal control officer shot and killed one or more dogs that were running at large in the city.plaintiffs,the owners of the animals,brought suit under,alleging that the officers actions violated their fourth amendment rights.the district court denied the officers qualified immunity defense,and the officers have appealed that ruling.their appeal presents a question of first impression in this circuit,namely,whether a privately owned dog falls within one of the classes of property protected by the fourth amendment against unreasonable search and seizure.this issue,while ostensibly peripheral as a constitutional matter,is nevertheless of significant importance,and we consider it in depth.as we explain more fully below,we conclude that the dogs at issue in this case do qualify as property protected by the fourth amendment and that the officers seized that property.however,because in each instance the seizure involved was reasonable,we conclude that the officers did not violate the plaintiffs fourth amendment rights.accordingly,we reverse the district court decision denying summary judgment to the officers and the city of high point.
because this case comes before us on appeal from the denial of summary judgment,except where otherwise noted,the following facts are recounted in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,as they are the nonmovants in this action.defendants nelson moxley and bobby ray perdue are and were at all times relevant to this opinion employed by high point as animal control officers.as animal control officers,moxley and perdue were charged with enforcing the various high point ordinances governing dogs.high point ordinance a makes it unlawful for the owner of a dog to allow the animal to run at large in the city.the ordinance defines at large to mean a dog that is not in an enclosure or otherwise confined,or is not under the control of the owner or other person by means of a leash,cord or chain.ordinance b.animal control officers are tasked with impounding any animal found at large.id.it shall be the duty of the animal control specialist to capture and impound in the county animal shelter each and every unlicensed dog or any dog found unlawfully at large in the city as provided in this chapter.finally,city ordinance provides that i t shall be lawful for the animal control specialist or police officers of the city to tranquilize or kill any dog at large within the city which can not safely be taken up and impounded.id.b emphasis added 
it was moxley and perdue efforts to enforce these ordinances that generated the four separate incidents which form the basis of this case.each incident involves the shooting of one or more of the plaintiffs dogs by either moxley or perdue.it is undisputed that in each incident,the dog or dogs were running at large within the meaning of high point ordinance b.we describe the incidents in chronological order.
the larsen incident.plaintiff kimberly larsen was the owner of heidi,a purebred rottweiler.larsen testified that heidi always wore a collar and tags.on january,larsen left heidi in her fenced yard while she and a family member left to run some errands.that same day,officer perdue responded to a call about a large,vicious rottweiler that was loose and had chased and attacked,or attempted to attack,a citizen.when officer perdue arrived on the scene,he spoke with willie sturdivant,the citizen who had reported the incident.sturdivant told perdue that he had been chased by the dog and had only been able to escape the attack by beating the dog off with a stick.sturdivant was scared to walk back down the street,so officer perdue gave him a ride.
after dropping off sturdivant,officer perdue began searching for the loose dog.a local woman told perdue to be careful of the dog because it was dangerous and aggressive and had been in the streets chasing cars and people.she also told him where the owners of the dog lived,although she noted that they were not home.perdue next came upon charles elkins,a neighbor of the larsens,walking on the street,and he stopped to warn elkins about the loose dog.elkins reported that the dog lived at the larsens and directed perdue to the house.officer perdue pulled into the larsens driveway,exited his vehicle with his shotgun,and began to walk toward the home.
elkins observed what happened next from a distance of about feet.he said that as perdue walked toward the home,heidi came walking around the corner of the house.heidi slowly approached perdue and jumped or lunged from the driveway up into the yard.at this point,heidi was ten to twelve feet from perdue.heidi then stopped,turned around,and began walking away from perdue toward the street.perdue then fired,striking heidi in the hindquarters.he fired again to end the animal suffering.perdue dragged heidi remains to the end of the driveway and called sanitation to dispose of the body.he then left the scene 
the frye incident.wendy frye owned four dogs,bandit,boo boo,and sadie that were approximately seven months old and weighed pounds each.the dogs mother was a siberian husky dog it is unclear what breed their father was.the dogs wore collars but did not wear tags.they were kept in a pen in frye backyard but had a tendency to dig under the pen and escape.
on the morning of february,officer berman of the high point police department responded to a call about a pack of dogs chasing people.according to him,when he arrived on the scene,the dogs charged his car,growling and showing their teeth.in the pack were three of frye dogs and two larger strays.officer berman remained in his car and called for officer perdue.while berman waited for perdue to arrive,the dogs ran across the street and began harassing a woman who was trying to exit her vehicle.berman drove over and blew an air horn to disperse the dogs.the dogs ran,and the woman was able to leave her car and get to her residence.a man then came out of the residence.one of the dogs tried to bite him,but berman again dispersed the dogs with his horn.
shortly thereafter,perdue arrived on the scene.the dogs aggressively rushed his truck as soon as he pulled up.one of the dogs jumped into the window of his truck and perdue had to beat if off with his nightstick.when he exited the vehicle,the pack attacked him and perdue fired into it with his shotgun,killing two of the dogs bandit and.the rest of the pack disbursed.
the wallace incident.plaintiff gilbert wallace owned a golden dog named sundance.wallace asserts that sundance was a,passive dog,but that he had a habit of escaping from his yard by digging under the fence.wallace had several other dogs,which he also kept in a fenced area.wallace had been cited on six previous occasions for allowing his dogs to run loose,and he had been warned about the poor condition of his fence.in addition,officer moxley had previously told wallace that his dogs were becoming more aggressive.
on january,high point police officer blue responded to a call that a dog had bitten someone.when he arrived at the scene,a dog that officer blue described as a black mix,sundance,charged him.blue racked his shotgun,and the animal stopped,but continued to growl.blue radioed for animal control to respond.
blue then interviewed the bite victim,lonnie baldwin.baldwin told blue that the dog had chased his child to the bus stop.baldwin chased the dog to protect his child,and the dog bit him on the hand.as baldwin and blue were talking,officer moxley arrived on the scene along with officer perdue.at this point,sundance had retreated to wallace yard and was sitting outside the fence.moxley informed baldwin and blue that this dog had given him problems in the past.he then got back in his truck and drove the short distance to the wallace house.
moxley exited his vehicle with his shotgun and proceeded toward the rear of the truck.at this point,sundance charged at full speed,growling and showing his teeth.moxley raised his shotgun and fired when sundance was about five yards away,killing the dog.he then loaded the remains into his truck so the dog could be tested for rabies.sundance was wearing no collar or tags.
the altman incident.the most recent of the four incidents involves plaintiffs robert and ann altman,and their dog hot rod,whose actual lineage was unknown but who the altmans thought was at least part pit bull.according to the altmans,hot rod was a,obedient dog,who always wore his collar and tags as required by law.
on the morning of march,hot rod was wandering the streets alone.terry evans,who owned a local business,saw hot rod following a meter reader,roger hendricks.evans was familiar with hot rod,having seen him on the street before and having seen him behave aggressively.fearing for hendricks safety,evans called.when officer moxley arrived,hot rod took off toward the residential houses located further down the street.moxley exited his vehicle with his shotgun and gave chase.moxley fired between two of the houses in the direction of hot rod,who was about yards away.hot rod was running behind the houses,and moxley was running in front of the houses.he fired again between two houses in the direction of hot rod,who was approximately to yards away.moxley fired a third shot,and evans heard hot rod hollar.hot rod emerged from behind the houses bleeding and dragging his hind leg,but was still running.moxley had hendricks retrieve more shells from his truck,and then pursued the dog.a short time later,a fourth shot was heard and moxley emerged dragging the remains of hot rod 
the plaintiffs brought suit under section against high point,and officers moxley and perdue,alleging that the officers actions in shooting the plaintiffs dogs constituted unreasonable seizures in violation of the fourth amendment the plaintiffs also asserted state law tort claims.all defendants moved for summary judgment,and the officers asserted qualified immunity.the district court rejected the officers qualified immunity defense,and the defendants,both the officers and the city,timely appealed.
because this appeal involves the denial of qualified immunity,we consider first whether the facts,viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,state a violation of the fourth amendment.see saucier katz,d if so,we proceed to consider whether the right was clearly established that is,whether it would have been apparent to a reasonable officer in the respective defendants positions that his actions violated the fourth amendment.id.at.we review the district court denial of qualified immunity de novo.see rogers pendleton,cir.
the first issue then is whether the plaintiffs fourth amendment rights have been violated.to resolve this issue,we must determine whether their dogs fell within the ambit of the fourth amendment.the fourth amendment,made applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment,provides that 
t he right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses,papers,and effects,against unreasonable searches and seizures,shall not be violated 
const.amend.iv.plainly,a dog is not a person,house,or paper.thus,in order for a dog to be protected by the fourth amendment,it must fall within the category of effects.
neither the supreme court nor the fourth circuit has ever addressed the issue whether dogs are effects.three other circuits,the third,eighth,and ninth,have considered whether dogs are protected by the fourth amendment.those circuits have uniformly concluded,although based only on conclusory assertions,that dogs are indeed so protected.see brown muhlenberg township,cir holding that dogs are effects fuller vines,cir same lesher reed,cir dogs are property subject to fourth amendment seizure requirements the complete absence of reasoning employed by those circuits,however,renders their dispositions of only the most minimal persuasive value.
proceeding to analyze this issue that has been assumed away by the other circuits that have considered it,our inquiry begins with the text of the constitution.james madison drafted what would ultimately become the fourth amendment.in his final draft,which he submitted to the committee of eleven of the house of representatives,madison proposed an amendment which would read the rights of the people to be secured in their persons,their houses,their papers,and their other property,from all unreasonable searches and seizures,shall not be violated annals of,emphasis added see also nelson lasson,the history and development of the fourth amendment to the united states constitution.the committee of eleven altered madison draft by replacing other property with effects,and it was that revised language that ultimately became part of the constitution.because there are no records of the committee deliberations,it is unclear precisely why that change was made.
the effect of that change is clear however it narrowed the scope of the amendment.other property would potentially have applied to all privately owned property,both personal and real.by contrast,effects referred only to personal property,and particularly to goods or moveables.see dictionarium britannicum nathan baily,defining effects as the goods of a merchant,tradesman,c samuel johnson,a dictionary of the english language defining the plural of effect as goods moveables noah webster,first edition of an american dictionary of the english language defining effect as i n the plural,effects are goods moveables personal estate.the supreme court has since confirmed that t he framers would have understood the term effects to be limited to personal,rather than real,property.oliver united states,d see also id.at.noting that the term effects is less inclusive than property.thus,it appears reasonably clear that,in when the fourth amendment was ratified,the term effects meant goods and moveables.
under the common law as it existed in,see wyoming houghton,d in determining whether a particular governmental action violates the fourth amendment,we inquire first whether the action was regarded as an unlawful search or seizure under the common law when the amendment was framed,dogs were not treated as property for most purposes.see,citizens dew,it is true that at common law a dog was not considered as property harold hannah,animals as property changing concepts,noting that at common law dogs were not regarded as property.for example,there was no commonlaw crime of larceny for taking and carrying away a dog.see mullaly new york.this treatment of dogs under the common law at the time appears to have been a reflection of the sentiment that dogs were base in their nature and kept merely for whims and pleasures and thus possessed no intrinsic value.dew,at see mullaly,at.at the same time that dogs enjoyed only a limited property status,however,an owner of a dog could bring an action of trover for conversion of a dog,and dogs would pass as assets to the executor or administrator of a deceased owner.see mullaly,at see also william blackstone,commentaries stating that a dog owner possessed a base property in his dogs that was sufficient to maintain a civil action for the loss of them.
thus,at least at the federal level,the prevailing understanding through much of the nineteenth century was that dogs were property,even if only qualifiedly so.see nicchia people of state of new york.property in dogs is of an imperfect or qualified nature and they may be subjected to peculiar and drastic police regulations by the state without depriving their owners of any federal right.sentell new orleans.p roperty in dogs is of an imperfect or qualified nature,and they stand,as it were,between animals ferae naturae,in which until killed or subdued,there is no property,and domestic animals,in which the right of property is perfect and complete.as a result,at the time of the founding,and for a period thereafter,it is unclear whether a dog would have been considered to be an effect,a good or moveable.for,although the dog was treated as property for some purposes,it was generally valueless in the eyes of the law.
however,while dogs may not have been considered goods or moveables in every respect,their qualified status as property did render unto their owners interests similar to those asserted by the plaintiffs today.as discussed,at common law a dog owner could bring an action of trover for conversion of a dog.see jones craddock,even in the days of blackstone,while it was declared that property in a dog was base property,it was nevertheless asserted that such property was sufficient to maintain a civil action for its loss.the present action by the plaintiffs,though brought under a federal statute pursuant to a constitutional amendment,is not in nature unlike a action for trover based on the officers conversion of their dogs.in this way,the plaintiffs clearly assert a right with an analog at common law,a fact which strongly suggests that,at least to this extent,dogs would have been protected as effects within the meaning of the fourth amendment at common law.
this presumptive conclusion that dogs would have been protected as effects as that term was used at the time of the framing,and therefore should be considered effects within the meaning of the fourth amendment,is reinforced by the supreme court precedent by which we are bound.reviewing the cases in which the court has addressed the meaning of effects,it becomes apparent that the court has treated the term effects as being synonymous with personal property.in united states place,d,the supreme court concluded that personal luggage was an effect within the meaning of the fourth amendment.see also bond united states,d.while place obviously does not hold that the term effects is coterminous with the universe of personal property,the court discussion does suggest that all seizures of personal property are subject to the fourth amendment requirements.see place,at.stating that the court has viewed a seizure of personal property as per se unreasonable within the meaning of the fourth amendment unless it is accomplished pursuant to a judicial warrant issued upon probable cause and particularly describing the items to be seized.in united states jacobsen,d,the court considered whether a wrapped parcel containing cocaine,which was intercepted during shipment,was an effect.the court held that w hen the wrapped parcel was delivered to the private freight carrier,it was unquestionably an effect within the meaning of the fourth amendment.letters and other sealed packages are in the general class of effects in which the public at large has a legitimate expectation of privacy id.at.as in place,the court discussion in jacobsen implies that it considers the term property to be coextensive with the term effects.see id.at.explaining that a seizure of property occurs when there is some meaningful interference with an individual possessory interests in that property.
jacobsen,and the cases which preceded it,could be read to protect certain personal property only insofar as the possessor had a legitimate privacy expectation in that property,but in soldal cook county,d,the court clarified that the fourth amendment protections extend to property in which there is no particular privacy or liberty interest.we thus are unconvinced that any of the court prior cases supports the view that the fourth amendment protects against unreasonable seizures of property only where privacy or liberty is also implicated.id.at.see also id.at.noting that our cases unmistakably hold that the fourth amendment protects property as well as privacy soldal thereby removed a potentially significant restriction on the types of property which the fourth amendment protects.the court did state that the fourth amendment does not protect possessory interests in all kinds of property,id.at,but the only example the court gave of a case involving an unprotected possessory interest was its decision in oliver united states.in oliver,the court held only that open fields are not effects within the meaning of the fourth amendment,reaffirming justice holmes opinion in hester united states.see oliver,at.as discussed above,the court also stated that the framers would have understood the term effects to reference personal,as opposed to real,property.id.at.thus,the supreme court cases appear to treat the scope of effects as congruent with the scope of personal property,and,after soldal,it is clear that there need be no nexus between a privacy or liberty interest and the possessory interest for fourth amendment protection to attach.
these cases confirm,we believe,the conclusion that dogs merit protection under the fourth amendment.the common law personal property rights that attached to dogs were at least as strong as those that have been held sufficient by the court to qualify other objects as effects entitled to fourth amendment protection.for example,the common law property interest in dogs was certainly as great as the possessory interest a person has been held by the court to enjoy today in illegal narcotics.see jacobsen,at.concluding that destruction by officer of trace amount of cocaine for testing purposes affect ed respondents possessory interest protected by the fourth amendment and thereby constituted a seizure.and,of course,that there may be no privacy interest in dogs is no bar to their treatment as effects,since soldal explains that such an interest is not an eligibility requirement for fourth amendment protection 
accordingly,on the strength of the constitution text,of history,and of precedent,we hold that the plaintiffs privately owned dogs were effects subject to the protections of the fourth amendment.
that dogs are,for fourth amendment purposes,effects under the analysis employed in the supreme court cases surveyed above is consistent with the fact that,as the common and statutory law in the states has developed,dogs have come to be recognized as property even under state law.while not recognized at the federal level for some time,early in the nineteenth century dogs began to gain status under state property laws,often by virtue of statutory enactment but also through the evolution of the common law.so it was that in new york,the court of appeals held in the case of mullaly new york that the old rule that there could be no larceny of a dog had been changed by legislation.see mullaly,at.the court of appeals reasoned that t he artificial reasoning upon which these old rules were based are wholly inapplicable to modern society large amounts of money are now invested in dogs and they are largely the subject of trade and traffic.in many ways they are put to useful service,and so far as pertains to their ownership as personal property,they possess all the attributes of other personal property.id.at.of particular note,the court of appeals in mullaly concluded that dogs were personal property,which was defined in new york as goods,chattels,effects,evidences of rights of action,and certain written instruments.id.at emphasis added.by,the supreme court of tennessee could confidently state that the old rules denying treatment as property to dogs had been abandoned and that dogs have now a distinct and status in the eyes of the law.dew,at.
north carolina is no stray when it comes to the trend in favor of treating dogs as personal property indeed,north carolina appears to have been at the forefront of that trend.in the case of dodson mock,the supreme court of north carolina considered a civil action by a plaintiff to recover damages for the killing of his dog.the defendant contended that the dog was not property because it had no value,and therefore no action would lie for an injury to it.the supreme court of north carolina rejected that argument and held that d ogs belong to that class of domiciled animals which the law recognises as objects of property,and whatever it recognises as property,it will protect from invasion by a civil action on the part of the owners.see also,state smith,referring to dogs as personal property jones,at while from the earliest times dogs have been the companions of man,for a long period their legal status was of low degree,and it was formerly held they were not property,and hence not the subjects of larceny.but in more recent times this ancient doctrine has given place to the modern view that ordinarily dogs constitute species of property,subject to all the incidents of chattels and valuable domestic animals.today,dogs are also treated as personal property by the statutes of north carolina.see.treating larceny of dogs as a property offense id.a defining owner as any person or legal entity that has a possessory property right in a dog.
given our holding that the dogs at issue in this case were effects within the meaning of the fourth amendment,we must next consider whether the officers actions in the case at bar constituted seizures of the dogs and,if so,whether those seizures were constitutionally permissible.turning to the former question,we think it clear that the officers actions constituted a seizure of the dogs.a fourth amendment seizure of personal property occurs when there is some meaningful interference with an individual possessory interests in that property.jacobsen,at.destroying property meaningfully interferes with an individual possessory interest in that property by changing a temporary deprivation into a permanent deprivation.see id.at.thus,when the officers destroyed the dogs,they seized the plaintiffs effects.see brown,at fuller,at.
in order for the officers warrantless seizures of the plaintiffs dogs to be constitutional,the seizures must have been reasonable.a seizure of personal property conducted without a warrant is presumptively unreasonable.see place,at.under the basic reasonableness calculus,a court must balance the nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual fourth amendment interest against the importance of the governmental interests alleged to justify the intrusion.id.at.the reasonableness calculus is objective in nature it does not turn upon the subjective intent of the officer.graham connor,d stating,in the context of a fourth amendment excessive force claim,that the question is whether the officers actions are objectively reasonable in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them,without regard to their underlying intent or motivation.the supreme court has admonished that t he calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make circumstances that are tense,uncertain,and rapidly the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.id.at.finally,in judging the reasonableness of the officers actions,we assess only the reasonableness of their actions the dogs we do not consider potential harm to third parties.howerton fletcher,cir holding that the risk posed to third parties by the official use of force is not to be considered in determining whether an official used excessive force as against a particular plaintiff.the task of this court is to put itself into the shoes of the officers at the time the actions took place and to ask whether the actions taken by the officers were objectively unreasonable.
engaging in that exercise in the instant case can render only the conclusion that,in every incident,the actions of officers moxley and perdue were objectively reasonable.before delving into the peculiar facts of each incident,we note the overarching interests involved.on the one hand,the public interests in this case are significant.the state of north carolina and the city of high point have a substantial interest in protecting their citizens from all the dangers and nuisances associated with dogs.dogs may harass or attack people,livestock,or other pets.dogs can maim or even kill.dogs may also spread disease or cause property damage.on the other hand,the private fourth amendment interests involved are appreciable.dogs have aptly been labeled man best friend,and certainly the bond between a dog owner and his pet can be strong and enduring.many consider dogs to be their most prized personal possessions,and still others think of dogs solely in terms of an emotional relationship,rather than a property relationship.
the case before us does not present both interests at their zenith,however.when a dog leaves the control of his owner and runs at large in a public space,the government interest in controlling the animal and preventing the evils mentioned above waxes dramatically,while the private interest correspondingly wanes.put simply,while we do not denigrate the possessory interest a dog owner has in his pet,we do conclude that dog owners forfeit many of these possessory interests when they allow their dogs to run at large,unleashed,uncontrolled,and unsupervised,for at that point the dog ceases to become simply a personal effect and takes on the nature of a public nuisance.this understanding is reflected in high point ordinance,which provides that when a dog is running at large it may be tranquilized or even killed if it can not be safely taken up and impounded.
with that understanding,we turn to the particular facts before us.again,it is undisputed that in each incident,the dog or dogs involved were running at large.in the larsen incident,officer perdue was confronted with a rottweiler,a large and dangerous breed of dog,that was loose and had been roaming the neighborhood.the dog had already attacked one person in the neighborhood,and perdue would have understood from his conversations with people in the neighborhood that the dog was aggressive and dangerous.while the dog did not actually attack officer perdue,it did move back toward the road where it would once again pose a danger to the neighborhood.perdue acted to stop the dog from escaping by the one means available to him at that shotgun.while,in hindsight,it may appear that perdue had other options available,we are not prepared to dispute his judgment at the moment,confronted as he was by a large,dangerous rottweiler that had already attacked one person in the neighborhood.
officer perdue actions in the frye incident were likewise reasonable.he was confronted not simply by a single dog,but by a pack of five dogs that had attacked persons in the neighborhood and another officer.indeed,one of the dogs had attacked perdue himself,attempting to jump into his truck window.when he exited his vehicle,the pack charged him.perdue was entitled to shoot the dogs in.the only fact that weighs against the reasonableness of perdue actions is that three of the dogs were young and not particularly large.while that fact may be significant when an officer confronts a smaller dog,it is of less moment when the officer is attacked by a pack of dogs.obviously,the danger presented by a dog increases significantly when that dog joins others in a pack.
officer moxley actions in the wallace incident were also clearly reasonable.there,the officer was confronted with a dog that had already attacked and wounded one person in the neighborhood.moments after moxley exited his truck,the animal attacked him.moxley acted reasonably in defending himself using the shotgun he was carrying at the time.
the altman incident presents a somewhat closer case since hot rod had not actually attacked a person.we nevertheless conclude that officer moxley actions were reasonable.hot rod was part pit bull,and pit bulls,like rottweilers,are a dangerous breed of dog.while hot rod had not attacked anyone,his behavior toward the meter reader was sufficiently aggressive to cause evans to call the police.responding to that call,officer moxley was immediately confronted with a fleeing dog.it was not unreasonable for him to conclude,in that split second as hot rod sped away,that he could not safely capture the animal.thus,as high point ordinance b instructs him to do,officer moxley attempted to and succeeded in killing the animal,thereby removing,for all moxley knew,a potentially dangerous pit bull from the public streets.
because none of the incidents involved objectively unreasonable action by the officers,we therefore hold that the officers committed no unreasonable seizure in violation of the fourth amendment.it is important to note that we are not saying the officers responses in these cases were the best possible responses.we are only saying that,under the circumstances existing at the time the officers took the actions and in light of the facts known by the officers,their actions were objectively reasonable.in retrospect,it may have been preferable if the officers attempted first to use nonlethal force in every instance.such nonlethal force may have been successful,but,tellingly,it may not have been.even dog owners can find their pets to be unpredictable at times.how much more so a person who is not intimately familiar with the behavior of the particular animal as neither officers perdue nor moxley were in any of these cases and who is forced to confront the dog for the first time in an unsupervised,unenclosed environment 
we are also not passing on the results reached by the other circuits that concluded,on the facts before them,that the destruction of pet dogs was unreasonable.the fact that all the dogs in the instant case were running at large,uncontrolled and with no owner looking on,renders this case distinguishable from the third circuit decision in brown and the ninth circuit decision in fuller.in brown,the owner of the dog was looking on and willing to assert control over the animal.see brown,at concluding that a state may not consistent with the fourth amendment,destroy a pet when it poses no immediate danger and the owner is looking on,obviously desirous of retaining custody.in fuller,the owners of the dog were standing in their front yard with the dog when it was shot.see fuller,at.the private fourth amendment possessory interests are obviously stronger when,although the dog is unleashed,the owner is nearby and attempting to assert control over the dog.and the public interest in control of the dog is correspondingly lessened when a private owner is available to assert control 
given our conclusion that the officers actions did not violate the plaintiffs fourth amendment rights,we need not reach the second step of the qualified immunity analysis and determine whether the right was clearly established.
our colleague,judge gregory,concurs with our conclusions that dogs are effects for purposes of the fourth amendment and that the dogs at issue in this case were the objects of warrantless seizures.post at.he dissents from our resolution of the question of whether a constitutional violation occurred.judge gregory criticizes us for improper ly focus ing on the particular facts of each,specific incident.id.at.instead,he prefers to view the case as a general matter and concludes that viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,it is apparent that the facts alleged show the officer s conduct violated a constitutional right.id.at.the dissent then proceeds to consider whether officers moxley and perdue are entitled to qualified immunity.such immunity would be inappropriate here,reasons the dissent,because an officer violates clearly established federal law when he shoots and kills an individual family pet when that pet presented no danger and when nonlethal methods of capture would have been successful.id.at.
it is the dissent analysis that is contrary to clearly established precedent,though.for fear that that flawed analysis will further erode the clarity of qualified immunity law,we feel that we must address some of the dissent errors.
first,the dissent only apparent authority for its conclusion that the seizures at issue in this case were unreasonable is its own assertion that officers moxley and perdue failed to comply with some high point city ordinances and with certain high point police department regulations.the dissent is replete with citations to these sources,see post at,to the near complete exclusion of all other forms of authority.in short,the dissent appears to reason that the officers were acting unconstitutionally because they violated the standards set by city ordinance and police department regulation.
this court,and the supreme court,have both rejected such reasoning categorically.recently,in robles prince george county,maryland,cir,the fourth circuit considered whether police officers who bound a defenseless man to a pole with flex cuffs at three in the morning in a deserted parking lot and then abandoned him,all with admittedly no legitimate law enforcement purpose,were entitled to qualified immunity.this court found that the officers had committed a constitutional violation under bell wolfish,d,but,despite the officers utterly indefensible behavior,we nevertheless awarded them qualified immunity.said the court,
t he constitution is not a font of tort law to be superimposed upon whatever systems may already be administered by the states.the officers conduct violated police regulations as well as state law and was dealt with under those provisions.but not every instance of inappropriate behavior on the part of police rises to the level of a federal constitutional violation.
id.at internal citation omitted former emphasis added see also,screws united states.violation of local law does not necessarily mean that federal rights have been invaded.to conclude,as apparently would the dissent,from the mere occurrence of a state law violation,much less a violation of city ordinance or police regulation,that a federal constitutional violation must also have transpired,is to engage in non sequitur.the dissent argues that such is not the case because f lagrant disregard of these local laws is relevant from an evidentiary perspective to show that a reasonable officer confronting the same situations as the defendants would have acted differently.post at.the logical flaw of that argument lies in its unspoken premise,namely that the standards set by local law in fact coincide with the reasonableness standards set by the fourth amendment.that these two independent authorities would happen to be in perfect alignment is not impossible,but it seems unlikely,and the dissent has proffered no reasons to bolster its premise that such is the case.
second,in keeping with what appears to be an emerging interpretive trend in this circuit prompted obviously by discomfort with the court decision in robles prince george county,see jones buchanan,cir robles prince george county,maryland,cir opinion concurring in the denial of rehearing en banc,the dissent adopts a revisionist reading of that decision.the dissent describes robles as holding that a reasonable officer could not have been expected to anticipate that ten to fifteen minutes of unauthorized detention would amount to a greater than de minimis injury.post at similarly,the dissent opines that i n robles,the court constitutional calculation of what would be a de minimis injury was an unusually close call.id.at.to support its interpretation of robles,the dissent relies heavily,not on robles itself,as one might expect,but rather on two other opinions,this court decision in jones buchanan and the opinion concurring in the denial of rehearing en banc in robles.the former opinion,which mentioned robles only in the penultimate footnote,certainly did not contain a holding as to the holding of robles,contrary to the dissent suggestion.the latter opinion,as i have elsewhere explained,see jones,at luttig,dissenting,also sheds no light on the holding of robles and,indeed,the dissent reliance on the concurrence in the denial of rehearing is merely another example of the tendency of such opinions to sow confusion as to the law.
turning to the actual language used in the robles opinion,it is clear that the court did not rest its qualified immunity analysis on the closeness of the question of whether there had been more than de minimis injury.there is no mention of the closeness of the injury in the portion of the court opinion devoted to determining whether there had been a violation of clearly established federal law.that portion of the opinion simply explains that 
t he cases cited by plaintiff as putting the defendants on notice are inapposite.they involve instances where detainees were subject to physical abuse or prolonged and inhumane conditions of detention.although the officers actions in this instance were foolish and unorthodox,it is also not clear that at the time they acted they should have reasonably known that their conduct violated robles constitutional rights.
robles,at internal citations omitted.the robles court clearly relied only on the absence of factually similar legal authority.the dissent chides us for failing to recognize that the legal authority was factually dissimilar only because robles case presented the court with a closer call on the de minimis inquiry.post at.but a statement that the injuries were different could be read to connote either difference in kind,physical abuse as opposed to mental anguish,or difference in quantity,that robles injuries were of a lesser magnitude.the former reading provides no support to the dissent and even if robles can be read to state the latter,such would establish merely that robles case was closer than those other cases,not that it was itself a close case with respect to de minimis injury.
the court does discuss the quantitative degree of injury in its analysis of whether the plaintiff had established a constitutional violation at all.that discussion,however,does not even hint that the question was close.if anything,it bespeaks the contrary.said the court,
any reasonable person would have been upset by what happened here.robles was tied up in a dark and deserted location in the middle of the night.he did not know when or if anyone would come to rescue him or who might discover him.the resulting injury was more than de minimis.
presumably reading this same language from robles,the dissent divines that the entire robles opinion turned on the closeness of the injury question.as the dissent would have it,the robles court statement that the resulting injury was more than de minimis clearly shows that in fact the de minimis injury issue was an unusually close call,over which the court was torn.then,exhausted from its struggle with this difficult,incidentally,resulted in only a single paragraph of panel decided that rather than explicitly mentioning how pivotal that issue was to its qualified immunity analysis,it would instead incorporate its implicit internal struggle into that analysis sub silentio.
we are chary of an interpretive methodology,such as the dissent,that would allow for hidden reasoning and implicit holdings.reading the opinion as it was written,one can not but conclude that the robles opinion turned only on what the robles opinion says it turned lack of factually similar legal precedent.this is not to say that the robles opinion would not make sense if it read as the dissent and others would have it read.it is merely to say that it is not susceptible to such a reading.
third,the dissent qualified immunity analysis is seemingly premised upon standards foreign to the precedent in this area.it is certainly true that an officer is not entitled to qualified immunity when he violates clearly established federal law.but to argue that the conditions that must obtain in order to establish a clear violation are present in this case is counterfactual.
to establish a clear violation of a federal right,t he contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.this is not to say that an official action is protected by qualified immunity unless the very action in question has previously been held unlawful but it is to say that in the light of law the unlawfulness must be apparent.anderson creighton,d internal citation omitted.a clear violation of federal law may occur when precedent,either from the supreme court,the circuit in which the case arises,or a consensus of cases from other circuits,puts the officer on notice that his conduct is unconstitutional.see wilson layne,d.
the dissent effort to adduce relevant legal authority is ineffective.at the time officers moxley and perdue acted,neither the supreme court nor the fourth circuit had held that dogs were effects within the meaning of the fourth amendment.nor had either court issued any opinion as to the fourth amendment reasonableness standards governing seizure of dogs.indeed,a review of the supreme court cases would have revealed that dogs may be subjected to peculiar and drastic police regulations by the state without depriving their owners of any federal right,nicchia,at,a statement that hardly would have put officers moxley and perdue on notice that their actions violated federal law.
perhaps sensing this weakness,the dissent seeks to marshal a consensus of cases from other circuits,but no such consensus existed at the time of the actions at issue here.the only circuit cases of any relevance were lesher reed,cir,and fuller vines,cir.the dissent asserts that these cases held that an officer commits an unreasonable,warrantless seizure of property when he shoots and kills an individual family pet when that pet presented no danger and when nonlethal methods of capture would have been successful.post at.according to the dissent,these cases also held that such a right was clearly established.see id.at.
the dissent ascription of such a holding to lesher is baffling.the claim at issue in lesher was whether officers violated the fourth amendment by taking a dog from the plaintiffs home.see lesher,at the leshers complain that the officers removed their dog from their home without their consent.the opinion says nothing about a shooting.while lesher did hold that such police action could constitute a fourth amendment seizure,it remanded to determine whether the seizure was unreasonable.id.at.moreover,no qualified immunity defense was mentioned in lesher,so naturally there was no holding as to whether the fourth amendment right asserted was clearly established.thus,every fact or holding the dissent attributes to lesher was either expressly disclaimed by the opinion itself or not mentioned because it did not exist.
the dissent is left with fuller vines,which,as explained above,is distinguishable and thus of little relevance.indeed,the iteration of that case on which the dissent relies to establish the proposition that the right was clearly established has,by its own terms,no precedential value.see post at citing fuller vines,wl cir.unpublished.
there is one remaining avenue open to the dissent.qualified immunity is also inappropriate when the action at issue was so obviously unconstitutional that,even though no precedent was factually similar,any reasonable officer would have known from the general contours of the law that his action was in violation thereof.see united states lanier,d but general statements of the law are not inherently incapable of giving fair and clear warning,and in other instances a general constitutional rule already identified in the decisional law may apply with obvious clarity to the specific conduct in question,even though the very action in question has not previously been held unlawful.quoting anderson creighton,at.this is a difficult standard to satisfy,see lanier,at.suggesting that a section case accusing welfare officials of selling foster children into slavery would satisfy the standard,and it has been rendered even more so in this circuit by the robles decision.for,if binding a man to a pole in the middle of a deserted parking lot at three in the morning and abandoning him all for no legitimate law enforcement purpose was not clearly unconstitutional,then few things will be.indeed,it follows a fortiori from the fact that it was far from obvious,even to a court of law,that dogs are effects protected by the fourth amendment,that the officer on the beat could not reasonably be expected to know that his seizure of a dog might violate the fourth amendment.
despite the difficulty of the issue of whether dogs are even protected by the fourth amendment,the dissent seemingly believes that,unlike lashing a defenseless man to a pole in the middle of the night and leaving him,shooting dogs that are running at large does present one of those rare instances of a clear constitutional violation,notwithstanding the absence of relevant precedent.says the dissent,
moxley and perdue insisted on disregarding local law by firing buckshot throughout the city neighborhoods,and as a result,they killed several nondangerous and nonthreatening dogs owned by the plaintiffs as family pets.viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,it is clear that the officers carried out these warrantless seizures without any concern for the public safety.as a result,moxley and perdue must be expected to know that their shooting spree was unconstitutionally unreasonable.
this observation is at least arguably accurate if the dissent intends to use the term unreasonable colloquially,although such would be irrelevant to the fourth amendment analysis at issue in this case.to supply the unconstitutionally modifier,however,gives rise to the expectation that the standards used to assess reasonableness are those supplied by the constitution itself.reasonableness alone is nothing but a standard after all.one can not assess the reasonableness of an action without taking into account certain factors.for legal purposes,those factors are provided by the substantive area of the law that governs the case and they form the parameters of the reasonableness judgment.so it is that fourth amendment excessive force reasonableness involves the assessment of different factors than,say,the question of whether an agency interpretation of an ambiguous statute that it administers is reasonable.see chevron,natural resources defense council,d.
when we speak of fourth amendment reasonableness,we are taking many factors into consideration,but not all.we are not,for example,considering the potential harm to third persons or animals.howerton fletcher,at.yet the dissent seems to be taking such harms into account in its analysis.see,post at if anything,it is clear that the decision to shoot was made in spite of the fact that it would dramatically increase the danger to the public.emphasis added id.at.nor do we treat as dispositive possible violations of state or local law,or police regulation.yet the dissent analysis relies almost exclusively on purported violations of city law and police practice to establish a constitutional violation and to deny immunity.see,post at.we think it clear that the dissent has not actually engaged in fourth amendment reasonableness analysis at all,but rather has simply given its personal opinion as to the appropriateness of the officers actions.so understood,we reiterate that we do not necessarily disagree with the dissent opinion,but only with its conclusion that the constitution imposes or permits imposition of such personal standards upon the officers in this case.since,under the factors provided for consideration by the fourth amendment,the officers conduct was not violative of the constitution and a fortiori not so clearly so as to deprive them of qualified immunity,the dissent willingness to allow this case to proceed finds no basis in the law of qualified immunity.
what really seems to be driving the dissent is a concern that officers moxley and perdue are out to get the animals of high point.the dissent describes the unfortunate encounters these officers have had with various animals on occasions predating the incidents at issue here,and concludes that moxley and perdue adopted a cavalier and reckless attitude towards animal control.id.at.time and again,the dissent implies that officers moxley and perdue were unreasonable because of their history of animal shootings and because of the officers personal views regarding the most efficacious methods of animal control.see,id.at quoting officer moxley on the use of deadly force id.at.
such subjective considerations,however,are irrelevant as a matter of law.both the analysis regarding the merits of the constitutional violation and the qualified immunity analysis focus on whether the officer acted in an objectively reasonable manner in this particular case,without regard to the officer actual subjective intent or malice and without regard to possibly inappropriate actions the officer took on other occasions.see graham,at.an officer evil intentions will not make a fourth amendment violation out of an objectively reasonable use of force.britton,d a defense of qualified immunity may not be rebutted by evidence that the defendant conduct was malicious or otherwise improperly motivated.evidence concerning the defendant subjective intent is simply irrelevant to that defense.thus,the dissent proffer of what amounts to little more than character evidence with respect to officers moxley and perdue is simply not germane.certainly if officers moxley and perdue have engaged in a practice of malicious and unnecessary killing of animals,such conduct is worthy of censure.yet we would incur greater censure,and deservedly so,were we to allow our own personal views of the appropriateness of particular actions to color our interpretation of what the constitution requires.
conclusion 
the judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded with instructions to enter judgment for the moxley and perdue,and the city of high point.
i concur with the majority conclusion that an individual dog is an effect for purposes of the fourth amendment,and with the court finding that the dogs at issue in this case were the objects of warrantless seizures.i respectfully dissent,however,from the majority consideration of the qualified immunity issue in part.in particular,i am disturbed by the majority finding that the officers actions in each instance were reasonable,based as it is on the majority dogged refusal to consider the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovants.additionally,i am troubled by the majority confusion of the qualified immunity test announced by the supreme court in saucier katz,d.rather than recognizing the two,distinct steps outlined by the saucier court,the majority errs by effectively conflating the two prongs and creating a test.
as explained below,i conclude that the plaintiffs,as a general matter,have demonstrated a violation of their constitutional rights to be free from unreasonable seizures.see saucier,at.additionally,i find that in the specific context of each incident,viewing the incidents in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,the plaintiffs constitutional rights were clearly established.accordingly,i would affirm the district court ruling that officers moxley and perdue are not entitled to qualified immunity,and that the city of high point is not entitled to summary judgment.
officers performing discretionary duties are entitled to qualified immunity if their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.officers moxley and perdue are entitled to qualified immunity unless t aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,the facts alleged show the officer s conduct violated a constitutional right and the right was clearly established in the specific context of the case.saucier,at.see also mansoor trank,cir.
the majority finding that the plaintiffs have failed at the first step of the qualified immunity test is rooted primarily in the court improper focus on the particular facts of each,specific incident.ante,at.at the first stage of our analysis,we are merely to consider the threshold question of whether any constitutional right would have been violated were the plaintiffs allegations established.saucier,at.i f,taking the allegations or evidence depending on the procedural posture of the case in the best light for the plaintiff,the plaintiff has stated a violation of a constitutional right,we proceed to the second step.jones buchanan,cir.in conducting this initial inquiry,the supreme court has assume d a constitutional violation could have occurred under the facts alleged based simply on the general rule prohibiting excessive force,and then proceed ed to the question whether this general prohibition against excessive force was the source for clearly established law that was contravened in the circumstances this officer faced.saucier,at.
similarly,this court in robles prince george county,cir,found that a pretrial detainee satisfied the first prong of the qualified immunity inquiry with his allegation that he suffered a deprivation of a due process right when prince george county police officers tied him to a metal pole in a deserted shopping center and abandoned him there at,only reporting the incident to the neighboring montgomery county police department.id.at.ten to fifteen minutes later,montgomery county officers arrived to untie robles and take him into custody.id.at.to make his constitutional showing,robles had to show,in part,that the injury resulting from the officers actions was more than de minimis.id.at.even though robles suffered no physical injury,and even though his detention lasted as little as ten minutes,we found that the resulting mental and emotional distress suffered by robles was more than de minimis.id.at.as such,he successfully alleged a violation of a constitutional right.in robles,the court constitutional calculation of what would be a de minimis injury was an unusually close call,and for this reason,it could not be said,at the second stage of the qualified immunity analysis,that the constitutional violation was clearly established at the time of robles unlawful detention.
peculiarly,the majority expresses concern with this straightforward reading of robles,and is instead bent on adopting an interpretation of the decision that has already been rejected by this circuit.in jones buchanan,we noted,rather than simply proving that the police acted unreasonably in violation of the fourth amendment,robles had to prove that the police had violated the due process clause,which required the application of a far more rigorous standard than at issue in a fourth amendment consideration.at.we further explained that the due process burden is a difficult burden for any plaintiff,but particularly so for robles since he conceded that no one bothered him during the ordeal,admitted that he suffered no physical injury,and offered no objective evidence,lost wages or medical testimony to support his claim of psychological injury.id.at.the jones court found these distinctions to be dispositive,and accordingly held,notwithstanding our decision in robles,that officers are not entitled to qualified immunity when they knock an intoxicated individual to the floor,jump on him,crushing his nose and lips,and bruising his ribs,when that individual is unarmed,locked in a room by himself,and handcuffed with his wrists behind his back.id.at.
judge luttig authored a dissent in jones,which the majority of that panel found to be as puzzling as it is unpersuasive.id.at.in the face of what is now circuit precedent,judge luttig continues to press this same,discarded understanding of robles,positing,the robles court clearly relied only on the absence of factually similar legal authority in ruling that the due process violation at issue in that case was not clearly established.ante,at.essentially,the majority reads robles as standing for the proposition that,unless a plaintiff can point to a case directly on point,the officers in question will be entitled to qualified immunity.the majority interpretation of robles,however,was rejected not only by the jones court,but also by the robles court itself.while an officer must be given notice that his unlawful actions may also be unconstitutional,notice does not require that the very action in question has previously been held unlawful robles,at quoting wilson layne,d.
even more,the supreme court has clarified that officials can still be on notice that their conduct violates established law even in novel factual circumstances.indeed,in united states lanier,d,the supreme court expressly rejected a requirement that previous cases be fundamentally similar.hope pelzer,d.see also anderson creighton,d holding,for a constitutional right to be clearly established,its contours must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.this is not to say that an official action is protected by qualified immunity unless the very action in question has previously been held unlawful internal citations omitted.
as the majority would have it,because the officers in robles were found to be entitled to qualified immunity after binding a man to a pole in the middle of a deserted parking lot at three in the morning and abandoning him all for no legitimate law enforcement purpose,ante,at,then every officer in this circuit will always be entitled to qualified immunity,regardless of the factual circumstances of his or her individual case,and regardless of differing constitutional standards fourth amendment seizure versus fourteenth amendment due process violation.this unduly harsh and untempered standard is contradicted by the actual text of the robles opinion.much to the majority apparent dissatisfaction,the robles court emphasized the importance of the de minimis calculation to its holding,noting that for robles due process rights to have been violated by this arbitrary and purposeless act,he needs to have suffered more than a de minimis injury.robles,at.although robles met this burden in proving that the injury he suffered was more than de minimis,he failed to convince the court that the resulting constitutional violation was clearly established.
the majority insistence that the robles court clearly relied only on the absence of factually similar legal authority misses the point,ante,at,as that authority is factually dissimilar only because the substantial injuries suffered by the complainants in those cases were clearly more than de minimis.to establish a constitutional violation,robles had to show that the officers actions amounted to punishment and were not merely an incident of some other legitimate governmental purpose,and that the injury resulting from their actions was more than de minimis.robles,at internal citations omitted.in concluding that the constitutional violation was not clearly established,the court observed that the cases cited by robles were inapposite because t hey involve d instances where detainees were subject to physical abuse or prolonged and inhumane conditions of detention.id.at emphasis added.these distinguishing features relate solely to the second prong of the pretrial process test whether the injury suffered was more than de minimis.thus,it necessarily follows that these cases were distinguishable because robles case presented the court with a closer call on the de minimis inquiry.how else could the court conclude that cases involving physical abuse were inapposite as judge wilkinson,who authored the initial robles opinion,later explained in a thoughtful and concurrence to the denial of rehearing en banc,the panel concluded that robles had offered sufficient evidence that he suffered more than de minimis injury,but that issue was close.after all,robles was left alone for only minutes,during which time no one bothered him.he concedes that he suffered no physical injury and that the officers told him that someone would pick him up there later.robles prince george county,cir internal citations omitted.
like the majority,i sympathize with robles plight.yet regardless of how i might have decided the case,i can not deny that the robles court placed strong emphasis on the lack of severe abuse.had robles been left handcuffed for twelve hours as opposed to ten minutes,there is no doubt that the case would have been resolved differently.see robles,at citing putman gerloff,cir.frustrated by this fact,the majority ignores it.in so doing,the majority,not this dissent,adopts an interpretation of robles that is revisionist.see ante,at.
returning to the present case and the first step of the qualified immunity analysis,the plaintiffs have alleged that officers moxley and perdue violated their fourth amendment rights to be free from unreasonable seizures by shooting and killing their family pets,when those pets presented no immediate danger and when nonlethal methods of capture would have been successful.the majority gives the plaintiffs allegations and the facts supporting them little,if any,weight,and inexplicably concludes that in every incident,the actions of officers moxley and perdue were objectively reasonable.ante,at.it is,of course,well established that we must take the facts in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury.see saucier,at.in jones,for example,the defendant officer disputed jones assertion that his wrists were handcuffed behind his back,and instead suggested that jones may not be able to prove he was handcuffed.jones,at.this court acknowledged that jones might fail at trial to convince a jury of this fact,but held that,in determining whether the officer is entitled to summary judgment,we must accept the facts in the light most favorable to jones,and if jones was handcuffed behind his back in a locked room,we find it hard to see how he would pose an immediate threat to anyone.id.
contrary to jones and the relevant constitutional standard,the majority insists on viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the officers.for example,in the wallace incident,the majority bases its finding of reasonableness on its assumption that moments after moxley exited his truck,the animal attacked him.ante,at.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,however,there is absolutely no way to conclude that wallace dog ever attacked moxley.moxley admitted that,upon arriving at the scene,he immediately drew his shotgun instead of considering less drastic options,such as using a catch pole.moxley then walked toward the back of his truck,at which point he claims,before i reached the back of the truck,the dog comes around growling and showing teeth and charges right at me.i raised my shotgun up,and i shot him at the back of the truck.at.
while moxley was the only eyewitness to this account,this court is not required to accept,much less embellish upon,his version of events.as explained below,the physical evidence included a trail of blood running from a hole in the fence around wallace yard to the road where moxley truck was parked.if moxley account were accurate,the only possible explanation for the trail of blood would be that moxley decided to parade the dog body around the neighborhood by first dragging the carcass from the point at the back of his truck where the dog was shot over to the hole in wallace fence,and then back from the fence to the road and into the truck.the more logical and likely conclusion,of course,is that the dog was cowering in the hole in the fence,presenting no immediate threat to moxley or anyone else for that matter at the time the dog was shot.taking the factual evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,we must view moxley account with great suspicion,particularly when,as discussed below,moxley has a documented history of fabricating reports to justify his actions.
similarly,as regards the altman incident,the majority finds moxley actions to be reasonable because moxley made a split second decision to remove a potential danger from the public streets.ante,at.again,this conclusion is contradicted by the evidence before this court.according to terry evans,a witness on the scene,officer moxley fired at the dog while the dog was probably fifty to yards from him,at least,running away from moxley down a narrow alley way,in between two houses.at.moxley fired three times,wounding the dog with the third shot.at this point,moxley called to a bystander on the street to go into moxley truck to grab a few extra shotgun shells.approximately six minutes transpired from the time that moxley asked for the shells to the time that the bystander retrieved the ammunition and delivered it to moxley.moxley then reloaded and killed the dog.by asking unknown civilians to go into his truck and search for ammunition,and by discharging his shotgun in an urban area while standing more than feet from his target,moxley made it clear that removing a potential danger from the public streets was the last thing on his mind.if anything,it is clear that the decision to shoot was made in spite of the fact that it would dramatically increase the danger to the public.thus,for these reasons,as well as for the reasons stated below,i respectfully dissent from the majority finding of reasonableness.
according to the city of high point police department rules,personnel shall not carry firearms in the performance of their duties.police department,general order emphasis in the original.animal control officers acos were not sworn police officers at the time of these shootings,and thus were not generally permitted to carry firearms for officers who are permitted to carry firearms,the regulations state,officers are not to discharge a firearm when acting negligently or with wanton disregard for public safety or through carelessness or recklessness.id.
despite the fact that acos are not sworn officers,the police department regulations do anticipate the potential use of deadly force by acos.the regulations outline the following procedures for the capture of a dangerous animal by an aco 
a owner to be contacted and assume responsibility for the control of the animal 
b traps may be set,or 
c use of catch poles,or 
d stun baton,or 
e tranquilizer gun.
f firearm only as a last resort in the event of immediate danger to the officer,another person,or animal.
police department,general order.when firearm use is necessary,the regulations state that an aco should first e nsure the safety of all citizens,property,and other animals and out of public view if possible.id.furthermore,the aco should only s hoot the animal from close range to feet,if possible.id.lastly,dangerous dog is defined in of the high point city code as 
a dog that.without provocation has killed or inflicted severe injury on a person or.is determined pursuant to this section to be potentially dangerous because the dog has engaged in one or more of the listed behaviors in subdivision of this subsection.
subdivision states,in part,that a potentially dangerous dog is a dog that has been determined to have i nflicted a bite on a person that resulted in broken bones or disfiguring lacerations or required cosmetic surgery or hospitalization or a dog that has approached a person when not on the owner property in a vicious or terrorizing manner in an apparent attitude of attack ordinance.
as the majority recognizes,mere violation of these ordinances and regulations is not necessarily sufficient to prove the existence of a constitutional injury.see ante,at.as we stated in robles,not every instance of inappropriate behavior on the part of police rises to the level of a federal constitutional violation.at emphasis in original.flagrant disregard of these laws,however,is relevant from an evidentiary perspective to show that a reasonable officer confronting the same situations as the defendants would have acted differently.that is,in light of the regulations,one might expect the use of deadly force by an aco to be an unusually rare occurrence.
scott allen,an experienced aco,testified that after fifteen years in animal control,he was only aware of two instances in which deadly force was used.officer allen further explained that deadly force should not be used in animal control activities unless absolutely necessary to save the life of the animal control officer or a bystander.there are many nonlethal tools at the disposal of the modern animal control officer including chemical capture devices such as tranquilizer guns,animal traps,as well as the to name a few.at.even more,officer marc larue cutrell,who served as moxley and perdue supervisor,testified that both moxley and perdue should have been aware that the destruction of someone dog could create a potential fourth amendment problem.see at.
in contrast to the reasonable approach outlined by officer allen,moxley and perdue adopted a more cavalier and reckless attitude towards animal control.police department statistics document,from to officers moxley and perdue discharged their departmentally issued tranquilizer guns or shotguns times during the course of their duties.at emphasis added.that is,moxley and perdue were responsible for the discharge of a firearm approximately once every two weeks.of course,dogs were not the only animals at which the defendants took aim.as the district court noted,their victims include d a racoon in a tree,a vicious rooster,and a vicious cat.at.
based on these statistics,one might begin to doubt the credibility of moxley and perdue when they assert that,in each of the specific incidents before this court,deadly force was warranted.our reluctance to accept the defendants version of events would be augmented by the fact that not one of the dogs destroyed by the defendants in the present case would have been defined as a dangerous dog under the city of high point ordinances.ordinance a.moreover,none of the dogs would have been classified as a potentially dangerous dog.ordinance b.as such,it is hard to say how a reasonable officer would find it necessary to use deadly force to capture these dogs.
the officers actions appear even more unreasonable when one remembers that,in each instance,they failed to contemplate the multitude of nonlethal methods available to them,despite the fact that the police department regulations require an aco to first consider five nonlethal measures for the capture of a dangerous animal.police department,general order.the regulations further provided that if these five options are untenable,a firearm should be used only as a last resort in event of immediate danger to the officer,another person,or animal.id.emphasis added.
in sum,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,it is apparent that the facts alleged show the officer s conduct violated a constitutional right to wit,the fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures.saucier,at.accordingly,i would join the third,eighth,and ninth circuits in holding that an officer commits an unreasonable,warrantless seizure of property,in violation of the constitution,when he shoots and kills an individual family pet when that pet presented no danger and when nonlethal methods of capture would have been successful.see brown muhlenberg township,cir lesher reed,cir fuller vines,cir.
having resolved this threshold issue,the question becomes whether the right was clearly established.saucier,at.to answer this question,a court must engage in a more particularized,and hence more relevant inquiry.id.at.quoting anderson creighton,d.the relevant,dispositive inquiry is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.saucier,at.this is not to say that an official action is protected by qualified immunity unless the very action in question has previously been held unlawful but it is to say that in the light of law the unlawfulness must be apparent.anderson creighton,d internal citations omitted.see also robles,at holding that a reasonable officer could not have been expected to anticipate that ten to fifteen minutes of unauthorized detention would amount to a greater than de minimis injury.lastly,the qualified immunity analysis is not dependent on the subjective beliefs of the particular officers at the scene,but instead on what a hypothetical,reasonable officer would have understood under those circumstances.figg schroeder,cir.
although the majority does not reach the second step of the qualified immunity test,its review of the facts suggests it would not find any constitutional violation to be clearly established.the court,however,fails to view those facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.in particular,the majority relies on the accounts proffered by moxley and perdue,who were less than credible to say the least.indeed,officer moxley often modified his official reports so as to ensure a finding of compliance by the city of high point police department.according to an internal department report on an unrelated incident,i nconsistencies indicate a reasonable probability of untruthfulness regarding aco moxley oral interview.br.of appellee,at.similar problems characterize some of aco perdue accounts skepticism of moxley and perdue accounts is particularly warranted in the specific incidents before this court,because,as explained below,it seems unlikely that the officers were motivated out of an earnest desire to safeguard the public.the majority correctly notes that the qualified immunity test is an objective one,and that a n officer evil intentions will not make a fourth amendment violation out of an objectively reasonable use of force.ante,at quoting graham connor,d.in this case,however,the officers evil intents are relevant,not from a constitutional perspective,but for a credibility determination.knowing the officers history of deceit and,we should be less willing to blindly accept their assertions that,in each of the cases,the dogs were dangerous and that the threats were imminent.rather,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,we might conclude that,the officers assertions notwithstanding,the dogs were nonthreatening.see,jones,at noting that although the officer maintains that he did perceive such a threat jones can point to evidence which suggests either that the officer is not credible on this point or that the deputy perception of a threat was not objectively reasonable.therefore,upon engaging in the second stage of the qualified immunity analysis,it will be necessary to review some of the factual details overlooked by the majority.
the larsen incident.the first event involved the shooting of heidi,a purebred rottweiler owned by kimberly larsen.the plaintiffs allege that heidi had been professionally trained by visha specialists,who opined that heidi sought anyone affection,showed no signs of aggressive or behavior,and was very humble and somewhat shy.at.the plaintiffs support this allegation by noting that heidi was certified as both a therapy dog and as a canine good citizen by the american kennel club.
in responding to the call on january,officer perdue did not make any attempt to contact heidi owners.instead,he pulled into the larsens driveway and exited the vehicle with his shotgun.according to an eyewitness,charles elkins,heidi jumped up from the driveway to a slightly elevated yard,but was not behaving aggressively.at.elkins explained that t he dog was standing nearly still at the moment that it was shot.the dog appeared to be just undecided about what was happening and what to do about it.at.as the dog was walking away from him,perdue fired,striking heidi in her hindquarters.
perdue explained his decision to shoot by stating,i would get out the shotgun.i have done this numerous times.if the dog shows me he not aggressive and he not going to attack me,that fine.i can always put the shotgun up and go get the catch pole.at.perdue standard operating procedure,however,directly contradicts the city regulations,which require an officer to first contact an owner set a trap use a catch pole use a stun baton or use a tranquilizer gun.police department,general order.these options must be considered before an aco shoulders a shotgun.id.in sum,considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,i would conclude that perdue did not shoot heidi because of any real or perceived danger.
the frye incident.the second incident occurred on february,and involved four,old siberian husky puppies owned by wendy frye sadie,bandit,and.upon arriving at the scene,officer perdue immediately reached for his shotgun,as was his custom.when asked why he needed to use deadly force against frye dogs,perdue responded,if you hit one of the dogs with a tranquilizer dart you just wasting your time.he going to run off,and he going to come back,and you going to have the same scenario all over again.and you dealing with five dogs,so it would have been a waste of time.at.similarly,frye fiance,joe scroggs,was told by police department officials that the puppies were shot,not because they posed any danger to anyone,but because we were going to spend all day chasing them.at.needless to say,effecting a warrantless seizure is not defensible on the grounds that it was faster and easier than following established,less intrusive procedures.
the majority concludes,in retrospect,it may have been preferable if the officers attempted first to use nonlethal force in every instance.such nonlethal force may have been successful,but,tellingly,it may not have been.ante,at.as to the frye shooting,however,we know conclusively that nonlethal force would have been successful.as mentioned above,the dogs were so small that frye was able to grab up and pick him up,just as perdue was preparing to fire at him.at.furthermore,even if perdue perceived the dogs to be a threat,no reasonable officer,and certainly no reasonable animal control officer who handles loose and dogs on a daily basis,could view frye fifteen pound puppies as dangerous.
