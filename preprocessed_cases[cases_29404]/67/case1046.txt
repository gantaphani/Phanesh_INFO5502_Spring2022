the main street baptist church,through its pastor and trustees,brought suit in federal district court against the city of burnside,kentucky,as well as against the city mayor and several council members,asserting claims pursuant to and the religious freedom restoration act rfra.these claims arose from the city decision to develop a previously dedicated roadway located between two lots owned by the church.both parties moved for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the city on the church claim and dismissed sua sponte the church rfra cause of action for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
summit avenue is a dedicated public roadway that runs in a direction within the city.this roadway has long been developed north of its intersection with central avenue.but the portion of summit avenue that runs south of central avenue was not developed until.the development of this portion of summit avenue,referred to by the parties as summit avenue extended,gives rise to the present controversy.
summit avenue extended and route run parallel to each other south of central avenue,with route lying to the east of summit avenue extended.the church owns a lot that lies between the two streets lot.central avenue marks the northern boundary of lot.the church also owns a second lot that abuts the western side of summit avenue extended lot.central avenue marks the northern boundary of lot as well.the burnside masonic lodge owns a large lot that abuts both the western edge of route and the southern boundary of lots and,on which the lodge operates the burnside cemetery.summit avenue extended terminates at the northern boundary of the cemetery.
a plat of the city shows that lots and had once been planned as a residential development,with each lot subdivided into nine individual parcels.summit avenue extended would have provided the only street access to the lot parcels.the church,however,abandoned the planned residential development when it acquired lots and in.it intended to locate its building and parking area on lot,with lot reserved for future expansion.
the church design plan located its building near the western boundary of lot,less than feet from summit avenue extended.a city ordinance,however,requires that structures be located at least feet from a public roadway.to avoid violating this ordinance,the church requested that the city close the dedicated roadway for summit avenue extended and thus allow the church to consolidate lots and.
the city refused the request,and subsequently brought suit in state court to enforce the ordinance.this suit was resolved after the church dedicated the land necessary to move the roadway for summit avenue extended several feet to the west,which gave the church building the necessary clearance from the planned roadway.the city approved the rededication of summit avenue extended in.its suit against the church was then dismissed for failure to prosecute in.
in june of,the city adopted a resolution to proceed with the development of summit avenue extended.the purpose of the development was to provide direct public access to a shelter being constructed within the cemetery.this shelter,located near the point where summit avenue extended terminates at the cemetery northern boundary,is designed to facilitate funeral services.
the city informed the church of the resolution in late june of.this led the church to once again request that the city permanently close summit avenue extended.the city then put the development of summit avenue extended on hold and invited the church to submit an alternative proposal.by november of,however,the church had not yet responded.instead,the church sought a temporary restraining order in state court.
the church complaint alleged that the proposed development of summit avenue extended would violate various provisions of the united states and kentucky constitutions,as well as rfra.in november of,the state court issued a temporary restraining order that prohibited the city from developing summit avenue extended.one month later,however,the court granted the city motion to dissolve the restraining order.the court then granted the city motion to dismiss the church complaint in february of,which,over the city objection,was dismissed without prejudice.
in march of,the church finally submitted a formal proposal for an alternative route of access to the cemetery shelter.this proposal was rejected by the city the following month.the city began the development of summit avenue extended shortly thereafter.
in may of,the church,through its pastor and trustees,brought the present lawsuit against the city,as well as against the city mayor and several council members,in the united states district court for the eastern district of kentucky.the church asserted claims pursuant to,rfra,and various provisions of the kentucky constitution.in suing under,the church alleged that the city had violated the free exercise,free speech,freedom of assembly,and establishment clauses of the first amendment,the takings clause of the fifth amendment,and the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment.
both the city and the church filed for summary judgment.in august of,the district court granted partial summary judgment to the city on the basis that the church had failed to establish any violation of the first amendment.recognizing that the united states supreme court had declared rfra unconstitutional,the court also dismissed the church rfra claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.after receiving additional briefing from the parties,the court granted summary judgment to the city on the remainder of the church claim in september of.having dismissed all of the church federal claims,the court declined to exercise pendent jurisdiction over the church claims.
the church now appeals.first,the church maintains that it offered sufficient evidence to sustain its claim under,relying specifically on the city alleged violations of the takings clause,free exercise clause,establishment clause,and due process clause.second,the church argues that it has established a violation of rfra,as amended by the religious land use and institutionalized persons act of rluipa.

the church maintains that the district court erred in granting the city summary judgment on the church claim under,a statute that provides recovery for constitutional deprivations incurred under the color of state law.according to the church,the city violated several constitutional provisions when it chose to develop rather than permanently close summit avenue extended.each of these alleged violations is analyzed below.
takings clause 
the takings clause of the fifth amendment provides that private property shall not be taken for public use,without just compensation.const.amend.v.this restraint on the power of the government to take private property,made applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment,phillips washington legal,d,is designed to bar the government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which,in all fairness and justice,should be borne by the public as a whole.penn central transp.city of new york,d internal quotations marks and citation omitted.
in the present case,the church alleges that the city engaged in an unconstitutional taking when it developed summit avenue extended.the church must establish two elements to prove its case.specifically,the church must show that the city took the church property and failed to compensate it justly or failed to put the property to public use.murray united states.
the church,therefore,can not recover under the takings clause without first proving that the city took property that belonged to the church when the city began to develop summit avenue extended.determining whether the city took the church property requires us to look beyond the takings clause,which protects rather than creates property rights.washlefske winston,cir.we must instead assess the church purported property interest in summit avenue extended in light of existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.calvert,louisville jefferson county metro.sewer,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
under kentucky law,the dedication of a public roadway is governed by kentucky revised statutes.this statute provides that a party may dedicate a public roadway by submitting a plat that depicts the proposed dedication to a city legislative body.if that body approves the dedication,the plat is recorded in the county clerk office and the dedication is complete.id.
the church followed the procedure outlined above when it rededicated summit avenue extended in.in particular,the church submitted a plat that depicted the movement of summit avenue extended several feet to the west,a relocation that allowed the church to construct its building in compliance with the city ordinance requiring structures to have at least feet of clearance from a public roadway.the city approved the dedication of summit avenue extended as depicted in the plat,which was later recorded in the county clerk office.
section does not indicate whether the dedication of a public roadway vests the public entity with title to the roadway,nor have we found any kentucky caselaw that interprets this aspect of the statute.see d dedication the effect of a statutory dedication,or the extent of the estate conveyed thereby,is generally indicated by the statute itself,according to which the fee may pass to the public or may remain in the dedicator.under some dedication statutes,a dedication confers only an easement to use the dedicated land for a public purpose.id.a valid statutory dedication,however,generally vests the fee in the dedicatee in trust for the public id.but even if we assume that the city acquired only an easement to use the dedicated land for a public purpose,the church still fails to establish an unlawful taking on the part of the city.
to prove its full ownership of summit avenue extended,the church first contends that the city easement terminated when the church acquired lot in.the church points out that summit avenue extended would have provided the only street access to the residential parcels that were originally planned to be subdivided from lot.once those residential parcels were consolidated by the church,the public need for summit avenue extended allegedly dissipated.this meant,according to the church,that the easement was gone as well.relying on city of louisville louisville scrap material company,the church maintains that it reacquired full ownership of summit avenue extended upon the termination of the alleged easement.id.at holding that when property condemned for public use is no longer used for a public purpose,the real property revert s to the owner in fee simple.
the critical flaw in the church argument is that the realignment of summit avenue extended took place in,three years after the church acquired lot.in other words,the church gave the city the right to use summit avenue extended for a public purpose after the church consolidated the nine residential parcels for which the roadway would have provided the only street access.consolidation of those residential parcels in,therefore,did not terminate the city interest in the realigned roadway dedicated by the church three years later.
the fact that summit avenue extended was rededicated in is also fatal to the church abandonment argument.citing sarver county of allen,the church contends that a public road in kentucky is abandoned if not used by the public for a period of or more years.the church maintains that,since it first appeared on a plat of the city in,summit avenue extended was never used by the public.thus,the church argues,ownership of summit avenue extended passed to the owners of the property abutting that roadway many years ago,and now belongs to the church.but even assuming that summit avenue extended had been abandoned in its former location,the church can not plausibly argue that summit avenue extended has been abandoned since its rededication in,because years had not elapsed prior to the roadway development in.
the church nevertheless contends that even if the city did not surrender its interest in the roadway prior to,its rights terminated when the city decided to develop summit avenue extended for the alleged private benefit of the burnside masonic lodge.according to the church,the city developed summit avenue extended solely to provide additional street access to the privately owned cemetery.the church maintains that the development of a roadway with such a limited use does not serve any public purpose,and therefore goes beyond the scope of the city interest in summit avenue extended.as support for its argument,the church relies upon the following language from prestonia area neighborhood association abramson,
if public use were construed to mean that the public would be benefitted in the sense that the enterprise or improvement for the use of which the property was taken might contribute to the comfort or convenience of the public,or a portion thereof,or be esteemed necessary for their enjoyment,there would be absolutely no limit on the right to take private property.it would not be difficult for any person to show that a factory or hotel or like improvement he contemplated erecting or establishing would result in benefit to the public,and under this rule the property of the citizen would never be safe from invasion.
id.at quoting chesapeake stone moreland.
the language explains the rule in kentucky that prohibits the taking of private property for the purpose of transfer to another private enterprise.id.in the present case,however,the city has not transferred title to the summit avenue extended roadway to the cemetery.summit avenue extended is not a private driveway for the cemetery,but is instead a public roadway that any member of the public is free to use.indeed,the church itself may use the roadway for a rear entrance to lot or for a front entrance to lot.furthermore,the fact that summit avenue extended currently runs only to the cemetery does not deprive the roadway of its public character,because use of the roadway is not limited to members of the lodge,but is in fact open to all members of the general public.the kentucky court of appeals recognized this principle in sturgill,department of highways,when it explained that 
a ny public way naturally confers a special benefit on those persons whose property adjoins it.all roads terminate somewhere.dead end streets or highways inevitably and particularly subserve the private interests of the last property owner on the line.yet the public has an interest in reaching other members thereof.
summit avenue extended,therefore,has been developed for a public purpose.this conclusion leaves the church without any viable claim that the city took the church property when it developed the dedicated roadway.accordingly,the church can not establish a violation of the takings clause.
free exercise clause 
the free exercise clause of the first amendment,made applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment,cantwell connecticut,forbids all laws prohibiting the free exercise of religion.mcdaniel paty,d quoting const.amend.i.this clause protects not only the right to hold a particular religious belief,but also the right to engage in conduct motivated by that belief.employment div.smith,d recognizing that the exercise of religion often involves not only belief and profession but the performance of or abstention from physical acts internal quotation marks omitted.
the church maintains that the city violated its rights under the free exercise clause by choosing to develop instead of permanently closing summit avenue extended.it argues that the city prevented the church from following the will or calling of god.the church interprets this calling to require the expansion of the church facilities onto the summit avenue extended dedicated roadway.
whether the free exercise clause protects a religious institution desire to fulfill what it perceives as its spiritual duty to construct facilities on a dedicated public roadway is a question of first impression.we,of course,will not question the plausibility of a religious claim.smith,at.nevertheless,the free exercise clause is written in terms of what the government can not do to the individual,not in terms of what the individual can exact from the government.lyng northwest indian cemetery protective ass n,d quoting sherbert verner,d douglas,concurring strout albanese,cir relying upon this principle in rejecting a free exercise challenge to a state statute that,under certain circumstances,authorized the payment of public funds to private educational institutions so long as the institution was nonreligious.
the free exercise clause,therefore,does not entitle a religious organization to special benefits.swanson guthrie indep.sch,cir concluding that the free exercise clause did not entitle children who were for religious reasons to attend public school on a basis when other children were precluded from doing so.accordingly,the city refusal to abandon the dedicated public roadway in favor of the church did not,in and of itself,burden the church rights under the free exercise clause.
the church,however,claims that the city engaged in religious discrimination when it developed rather than closed summit avenue extended.a government act that discriminates against a particular religion triggers the protections of the free exercise clause.church of the lukumi babalu aye,city of hialeah,d at a minimum,the protections of the free exercise clause pertain if the law at issue discriminates against some or all religious beliefs.the question,then,is whether the city in fact engaged in religious discrimination.
according to the city,resolving this issue is simply a matter of determining whether the city decision with regard to summit avenue extended was neutral on its face.but f acial neutrality is not determinative,because t he free exercise clause protects against governmental hostility which is masked,as well as overt.id.at.we must therefore consider whether the city,in developing rather than closing summit avenue extended,intentionally sought to burden the church religious activities.
in the church view,the city chose to develop summit avenue extended in order to favor the interests of the burnside masonic lodge,the owner of the cemetery,over the interests of the church.the church contends that this alleged favoritism is significant for purposes of the free exercise clause because,unlike the church,the burnside masonic lodge is a religious organization.it argues that,by allegedly giving preferential treatment to the burnside masonic lodge,the city demonstrated its discriminatory animus toward the religious beliefs and practices of the church.
the development of summit avenue extended did in fact provide a benefit to the burnside masonic lodge to the extent that the roadway now allows the lodge to better serve those who visit its cemetery.but the ultimate beneficiary of this development is the general public,which now has increased access to the cemetery and,in particular,to the shelter erected on the cemetery property for funeral services.in contrast,closing summit avenue extended would have benefitted only the church without providing any comparable benefit to the general public.
the church,therefore,is asking us to infer a discriminatory intent on the part of the city based upon the fact that,in the course of furthering the public interest,the development of summit avenue extended happened to conflict with what the church sincerely believes is its spiritual duty.discrimination may not be inferred,however,simply because a public program is incompatible with a religious organization spiritual priorities.the free exercise clause does not offer to reconcile the various competing demands on government,many of them rooted in sincere religious belief,that inevitably arise in so diverse a society as ours.lyng,at.as the supreme court has explained,government acts often inadvertently frustrate certain citizens search for spiritual fulfillment,yet the government simply could not operate if it were required to satisfy every citizen religious needs and desires.id.
the church,therefore,must show more than disparate impact in order to prove discriminatory animus on the part of the city.it attempts to meet this burden by relying upon evidence that,in the church view,shows that the city closed roadways on behalf of the burnside masonic lodge and violated kentucky law in the manner in which the city rejected the church alternative to the development of summit avenue extended.this evidence is examined below.
the church first claims that the city has favored the burnside masonic lodge in deciding whether to accept or reject requests for roadway closures.to support this allegation,the church relies upon a comparison between two ancient plats affecting the cemetery.the first plat,dated in,shows three dedicated public roadways running through the cemetery.these roadways do not appear on a plat of the city,the most recent one available.the church maintains that the city decision to close roadways for the burnside masonic lodge while refusing to extend the same benefit to the church manifests its discriminatory animus toward the church.
even assuming that,at some point in the distant past,the city closed roadways at the request of the burnside masonic lodge,this would not necessarily give rise to an inference of present discrimination.an inference of religious discrimination based upon disparate treatment requires evidence that a party was treated differently from a similarly situated party with a different religious affiliation.vandiver hardin county bd.of,cir holding that the plaintiff could not sustain a free exercise challenge to a policy requiring students transferring to public school to pass a test before receiving credit for courses studied at home a bsent evidence that similarly situated transferees from nonreligious home schools were provided an exemption which the plaintiff was not.yet the church offers no evidence showing that,in terms of the parties requests for roadway closures,it was similarly situated in either time or circumstances with the burnside masonic lodge.
specifically,the church sought the closure of summit avenue extended after the burnside masonic lodge had requested that the roadway be developed to provide better public access to the cemetery shelter.closing summit avenue extended,therefore,would have required the city to forgo the public benefit associated with the roadway development in order to allow the church to pursue its expansion plans.the record contains no evidence as to whether the burnside masonic lodge had asked the city to surrender any similar public benefit when it allegedly sought the closure of the roadways that had run through the cemetery many decades ago.absent additional evidence regarding the circu
