opinion of the court 
we consider whether a real estate developer with an option to buy a parcel of land has standing to challenge zoning restrictions that prevent its planned development from going forward.we hold that it does.
appellant toll brothers,describes itself as the nation leading builder of luxury homes see toll brothers,last visited january,toll brothers prides itself on developing communities in prime locations it carefully chooses the most scenic areas that offer a blend of rural charm and suburban convenience.id.in early,toll brothers found just such a setting on a tract of land in the township of readington,new jersey the township.toll brothers entered into an option contract with the tract owner,readington properties,llc.
pursuant to the contract,readington properties granted toll brothers an exclusive option to buy the tract at a fixed price.in exchange,toll brothers promised to make periodic payments to readington properties.the original contract stated a option with an expiration date of january.subsequent amendments have extended the option period,and toll brothers exclusive option remains in force.during the life of the option,readington properties can not enter into any lease,agreement of sale,or any other agreement affecting the property.appendix app.in addition,toll brothers has the right to come onto the property to perform engineering,environmental and such other feasibility studies as it deems necessary.app.
at the time of the contract formation,the township zoning laws classified part of the tract as,and part as.the classification allowed for development of detached dwelling units,farm and agricultural uses,and open space and parks.app.residential development in this zone could not exceed one unit per three acres.in the zone,general office development was permitted.id.
toll brothers quickly began to formulate plans for both the and portions of the property.for the zone,the company engaged in preliminary planning to develop housing for families with children.app.as to the zone,toll brothers drafted plans for an office park.for whatever reason,the office plans advanced more rapidly than the residential plans.in may,toll brothers submitted a formal application to the township planning board requesting approval for construction of an office development.toll brothers claims that this proposal was consistent with the township zoning ordinance and with the general character of the area.app.
the township did not approve toll brothers application.instead,it passed an ordinance rezoning the entire tract.the zone allowed for just three uses by right farms open space and parks and residential uses at one residential dwelling per six acres.app.as a result,office parks were prohibited.the requirement of six acres per dwelling,according to toll brothers,made any residential development economically unfeasible.toll brothers development plans thus have been thwarted.
toll brothers contends that this change in law was no ordinary zoning decision.it was instead part of a nefarious plot hatched by township officials to reduce the fair market value of properties held by disfavored landowners.app.by frustrating the lawful plans of toll brothers and other developers,township officials sought to drive down the value of the targeted propert ies and acquire them cheaply at price s below their fair market values.app.they also intended to discriminate against families with children in an effort to reduce their residential opportunities within the township.app.
toll brothers claims the township actions have caused it considerable injury.the company is in the real estate development business,but the township has prevented all profitable development of the readington properties parcel.toll brothers is maintaining its option by rendering periodic payments to readington properties.if and when the township approves toll brothers plans,the company still intends to exercise its option.in the meantime,toll brothers has spent considerable amounts of money on planning,including fees for architects and other professionals.app.in addition to these sunk costs,toll brothers has also lost out on the potential profits.
in august,toll brothers filed a lawsuit against the township in new jersey superior court.the complaint alleged violations of the new jersey municipal land use law,stat.ann.to the equal protection clause the due process clause the takings clause equivalent provisions of the new jersey constitution and the public policy and law of new jersey as expressed in the state supreme court mount laurel decisions that action remains pending.
in december,toll brothers brought this suit against the township,the township committee,the township planning board,and various township officials collectively,defendants.the allegations in this case are quite similar to the claims pending in state court,but they do not overlap completely.in this case,toll brothers brings claims under the equal protection clause the due process clause the takings clause the fair housing act of,as amended,the new jersey law against discrimination,stat.ann.to the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations rico act,and new jersey rico act,stat.ann.to.toll brothers seeks an order i nvalidating and setting aside the township zoning ordinance,an order enjoining defendants from enforcing the ordinance,and money damages sustained as a result of defendants illegal actions.app.
the defendants moved to dismiss toll brothers complaint for,inter alia,lack of standing toll brothers opposed the motion and,in the alternative,sought leave to file an amended complaint.in an unreported decision,the district court granted the motion to dismiss.see toll twp.of readington,dist.lexis.the court found it significant that toll brothers was the owner of an unexercised option.id.at.it noted that a favorable decision would still leave toll brothers free to elect not to exercise the option.id.thus,the court concluded,toll brothers claimed injury was not concrete and particularized,nor was it likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.id.at quotation marks omitted.independent of that analysis,the court also pointed out that toll brothers complaint alleged discrimination against families with children.these families,however,were not parties.id.at.as a result,the court concluded that toll brothers lacked standing to assert the families rights.id.the court did not specifically consider toll brothers request for leave to amend the complaint in its decision,but the court squarely rejected the request in its opinion denying toll brothers motion for reconsideration.this appeal followed.
toll brothers alleged that the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and and supplemental jurisdiction over its state law claims pursuant to.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to.
we exercise plenary review over the district court dismissal of the complaint for lack of standing.see goode city of philadelphia,cir twp.of wall,cir.we review the district court denial of toll brothers request for leave to file an amended complaint for abuse of discretion.winer family trust queen,cir.
article iii of the constitution limits federal judicial power to the adjudication of cases or controversies.const.art.iii.this limitation is essential to our system of separated powers.see valley forge christian coll.ams.united for separation of church state,d see also hein freedom from religion,d plurality opinion.in cases involving state or local government,it also serves to protect and preserve the principle of dual sovereignty embedded in our founding charter.storino borough of point pleasant beach,cir.without a requirement,the judicial power would extend to every question under the constitution,and the other departments would be swallowed up by the judiciary.daimlerchrysler cuno,d quoting papers of john marshall cullen ed emphasis removed.with the requirement,on the other hand,courts stay confined to their properly,warth seldin,d,of decid ing on the rights of individuals,marbury madison,cranch.there is,therefore,n o principle more fundamental to the judiciary proper role in our system of government than the constitutional limitation of jurisdiction to actual cases or controversies.raines byrd,d quoting simon.welfare rights,d.
courts enforce the requirement through the several justiciability doctrines that cluster about article iii.allen wright,d quoting vander jagt,bork,concurring.they include standing,ripeness,mootness,the doctrine,and the prohibition on advisory opinions.see daimlerchrysler,at.erwin chemerinsky,federal jurisdiction ed.p erhaps the most important of these doctrines is standing.allen,at.
the irreducible constitutional minimum of article iii standing consists of three elements.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.first,the plaintiff must have suffered a concrete,particularized,which must be actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.id.quotation marks omitted.second,that injury must be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant,and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.id.quotation marks and alterations omitted.third,the plaintiff must establish that a favorable decision likely would redress the injury.see at t commc ns of,verizon,cir.
while all three of these elements are constitutionally mandated,the element is often determinative under it,the plaintiff must suffer a palpable and distinct harm.see allen,at.that harm must affect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way.lujan,at.the injury can be widely shared,fec akins,d,but it must nonetheless be concrete enough to distinguish the interest of the plaintiff from the generalized and undifferentiated interest every citizen has in good government.see lujan,at.schlesinger reservists comm.to stop the war,d.in this way,keeps the judicial branch from encroaching on legislative prerogatives,thereby preserving the separation of powers.danvers motor,ford motor,cir see also john roberts,article iii limits on statutory standing,duke,the need to insist upon meaningful limitations on what constitutes injury for standing purposes flows from an appreciation of the key role that injury plays in a limited and separated government.
the critical issue for us is whether the township rezoning of the readington properties parcel has cognizably injured toll brothers,an optionee with a plan to develop the property no binding authority directly addresses an optionee standing to challenge zoning restrictions.three decisions of our sister courts of appeals,however,indicate that an optionee with a plan to develop the underlying property suffers the requisite injury from zoning restrictions that block the planned development.see scott greenville county,cir holding that a real estate developer who acquired a purchase option for the land put together a partnership to pursue the project and obtained earmarking of federal subsidy funds had standing to challenge zoning restrictions that prevented construction of housing chipanno champion int l,cir concluding that the holder of an option to purchase certain timber lands in oregon had standing to challenge defendants conspiracy to eliminate competition,fix prices,and allocate timber from oregon lands huntington branch,naacp town of huntington,cir holding that a housing assistance corporation with an option to purchase a acre tract and a plan to develop the property had standing to challenge a local zoning ordinance as racially discriminatory.in addition,two supreme court decisions,while not directly on point,provide useful guideposts.
the first is warth seldin,d.warth involved a challenge to an exclusionary zoning ordinance in pennfield,new york.one of the many plaintiffs was an association of firms engaged in the development and construction of residential housing in the area.id.at.the association claimed the ordinance had deprived some of its members of substantial business opportunities and profits.id.at.quotation marks omitted.the supreme court,however,found these allegations insufficient to establish.the association refer red to no specific project of any of its members that was precluded by the ordinance,and there was no averment that any member ha d applied for a building permit or a variance with respect to any current project.id.at.as a result,the association failed to show the existence of any injury to its members of sufficient immediacy to warrant judicial intervention.id.
the second supreme court decision is village of arlington heights metropolitan housing development,d.the plaintiff there was a nonprofit corporation seeking to develop housing in the village of arlington heights,illinois.id.at.the developer entered into a lease on a parcel within the village,and it also contracted to purchase the parcel.id.the sale was contingent on the developer securing zoning clearances from the village and housing assistance from the federal government.id.when the village denied the developer request for rezoning,the developer brought an equal protection challenge.id.at.the supreme court first noted that injunctive relief would not guarantee that the project would be built.id.at.after all,the developer would still have to secure financing,qualify for federal subsidies,and carry through with construction.id.the developer,though,had a detailed and specific plan,and,as such,the court was not required to engage in undue speculation as a predicate for finding that the plaintiff ha d the requisite personal stake in the controversy.id.at.the village claimed the developer had suffered no economic injury because it was not the owner of the property in question,and it owe d the owners nothing if rezoning was denied.id.at.the court disagreed,noting that the developer had expended thousands of dollars on the plans for the project and on the studies submitted to the village in support of the petition for rezoning.id.if rezoning was not granted,many of these plans and studies would be worthless.id.the developer thus established cognizable economic injury.id.
both cases are instructive here.first,toll brothers alleged injuries are far more particularized and concrete than those of the warth homebuilders.for example,where the pennfield ordinance prevented none of the warth homebuilders from developing any particular project,at,the township zone has thwarted toll brothers specific development plans.where none of the warth homebuilders ha d applied for a building permit or a variance with respect to any current project,toll brothers has submitted a formal application to construct an office development on the readington properties parcel.and,perhaps most significant of all,where the warth homebuilders alleged only unspecified losses of business opportunities and profits,id.at,toll brothers points to a lost opportunity to develop a specific tract of land for which it holds an exclusive option to buy accordingly,toll brothers injuries are more distinct and immediate than those of the warth plaintiffs.
toll brothers alleged injuries also bear a strong resemblance to the injuries of the developer in arlington heights.both plaintiffs had detailed and specific plans for the restricted properties.see arlington heights,at.the arlington heights developer expended thousands of dollars on plans and studies to support its rezoning petition.see id.at.so too has toll brothers paid substantial sums in planning its proposed developments,seeking approval for its office development,and maintaining its option.just as in arlington heights,these expenditures remain worthless so long as a restrictive zoning ordinance remains in force.see id.i t is inaccurate to say that the plaintiff suffers no economic injury from a refusal to rezone where it has expended thousands of dollars on the plans for the property and on the studies submitted in support of the petition for rezoning.in addition,both the village ordinance in arlington heights and the township ordinance stand as absolute barrier s to moving forward with construction and recouping costs.see id.at.these parallels strongly indicate that toll brothers has satisfied the injury requirement.
yet,as the defendants point out,there are differences between the harm alleged in arlington heights and the harm alleged in this case.the arlington heights developer had a lease on the restricted property and a condit
