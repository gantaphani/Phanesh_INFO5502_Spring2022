some might think that tazewell county,illinois,is an unlikely spot for a nasty dispute like the one in this case.the county,which is just south of peoria,describes itself on its website as a central illinois community which combines city assets with the serene beauty and quiet countryside of rural living.but looks can be deceiving as heyde decision to go to war in federal court with eight of his fellow county residents is anything but serene and quiet.

in august,heyde received a notice which increased the assessment for to.heyde again filed a complaint with the bor.this time,the bor declined to reduce the assessment 
in january,heyde hired an independent appraiser,who appraised his property at a fair market value of,which would result in an assessment of.in september,heyde received his notice of assessment.this time the assessment was set at.yet again,heyde filed a challenge with the bor,submitting the independent appraiser estimate as well as measurements of the house.in its june,decision,however,the bor declined to reduce the assessment.instead,the assessment was increased,very significantly,to.the huge jump in assessed value was apparently based on the belief that the house was much bigger than it was originally thought to be.the house on the property,which sits behind a locked gate and can not be seen from any public way,was thought to include over square feet of living space.
following the bor june decision,richard brehmer,the tazewell county assessor,reported the property assessment at.jim unsicker,the acting supervisor of assessment for the county,mailed the notice of assessment to heyde.in may,heyde again filed a complaint with the bor.but the bor affirmed the assessment.
for the subsequent tax years until,the bor refused to lower the assessment on heyde property.heyde continued to file complaints with the bor.the roadblock to resolving the dispute seems to be that heyde,for several years,declined to allow anyone from the county onto his property to do an inspection.the bor continued to affirm the assessment.
on july,before filing this action with the district court,heyde appealed the bor june,decision to the ptab.a ptab hearing officer heard the case on may.by this time,heyde had allowed the bor onto his property and both heyde and the bor stipulated that the residence contained square feet of living area.
on november,the ptab ordered a reduction in the assessment of heyde property for the tax year.the ptab,however,did not reduce the assessment to heyde liking,and on december,he filed a complaint with the tenth judicial circuit court for tazewell county,illinois,seeking administrative review of the ptab decision pursuant to ilcs et.heyde currently has additional appeals pending before the ptab for other tax years up to.apparently,none have been scheduled for a hearing.
in july,heyde filed a complaint in federal court against bor chairman pittenger and former bor members orrick and varda.on december,he amended his complaint to include current bor members paulin and kieser,as well as tazewell county assessors deininger,unsicker,and brehmer.he sought in excess of plus punitive damages.
the district judge granted the bor members rule b motion,finding that they were entitled to absolute immunity.the remaining defendants the assessors later filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that heyde case was premature because he has appeals pending before the ptab and thus he has not exhausted his state remedies.in the alternative,they argued that they were protected by qualified immunity.the district judge found heyde claims to be premature under principles of comity.the judge accordingly dismissed heyde case without prejudice and did not reach the question of qualified immunity.the judge also denied heyde motion for reconsideration.
as a preliminary matter,the bor and the assessors argue that we do not have jurisdiction to hear this appeal because the district judge dismissed the case without prejudice.the assessors argue that because heyde can return to federal court after he has exhausted his state remedies the district judge ruling was not a final order.
in office of the cook county public guardian,however,we noted that a dismissal without prejudice is an appealable final order if it ends the suit so far as the district court is concerned,cir.heyde correctly points out that the district judge order effectively ends this suit because after heyde has exhausted his state remedies the only federal court that can review the state court judgment is the supreme court.see fair assessment in real estate ass n,mcnary.therefore,the district judge order effectively ended the suit so far as the federal district court was concerned.accordingly,we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal.
next,we review the district judge grant of the bor rule b motion to dismiss finding that the bor is entitled to absolute immunity.orders granting motions to dismiss are reviewed de novo.justice town of cicero,cir.in assessing whether the plaintiff has stated a valid claim for relief,we construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,accepting as true all facts alleged,and drawing all possible inferences in her favor.golden helen sigman associates,cir internal quotations omitted.to state a claim under,a plaintiff must allege that a government official,acting under color of state law,deprived him of a right secured by the constitution or laws of the united states.estate of sims ex rel.sims county of bureau,cir.dismissal is proper if the complaint fails to set forth enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.john united church of christ city of chicago,cir quoting bell atlantic twombly.
here,the members of the bor argue,and the district judge agreed,that heyde claims should be dismissed because they are entitled to absolute immunity.our approach to determining whether an official is entitled to absolute immunity is well established we apply a functional approach.buckly fitzsimmons.that is,we look to the nature of the function performed,not the identity of the actor who performed it absolute immunity is not limited to government officials with the title of prosecutor or judge.wilson kelkhoff,cir internal citation omitted.absolute immunity protects members of adjudicatory bodies when their duties are functionally equivalent to those of a judge or prosecutor.butz economou.t he nature of the adjudicative function requires a judge frequently to disappoint some of the most intense and ungovernable desires that people can have.forrester white.therefore,we have found that,
t he cloak of immunity is designed to prevent a situation in which act with an excess of caution or otherwise skew their decisions in ways that result in less than full fidelity to the objective and independent criteria that ought to guide their conduct,out of a fear of litigation or personal monetary liability.

moreover,in butz,the supreme court identified several characteristics of functions that courts should consider when determining whether a public official is entitled to absolute immunity the need to assure that the individual can perform his functions without harassment or intimidation the presence of safeguards that reduce the need for damages actions as a means for controlling unconstitutional conduct the insulation from political influence the importance of precedent the adversarial nature of the process and the correctability of error on appeal.at.
absolute immunity,however,applies only to judicial acts and does not protect the official from acts that are ministerial or administrative in nature.dawson newman,cir.moreover,the official seeking absolute immunity bears the burden of showing that such immunity is justified for the function in question.burns reed.here,the district judge found that the bor members are entitled to absolute immunity because,under the butz criteria and illinois statutes governing the bor,their actions while reviewing heyde property assessment claim were in nature.we agree.
heyde argues that when the bor relied on evidence it gathered,and did not confine its process to materials submitted by the parties and thus increased his property assessment on its own accord,it was acting in an investigatory capacity,and therefore the members should not be granted absolute immunity.in support of his argument,heyde cites several supreme court cases in which an officer was denied absolute immunity because he was acting in an investigative capacity at the time in question.see hartman moore,no absolute immunity for a prosecutor for conduct taken in an investigatory capacity buckley,at no absolute immunity for a prosecutor acting in an administrative capacity burns,at no absolute immunity when a prosecutor offers legal advice to the police regarding interrogation practices.these cases,however,are easily distinguishable.the bor was not acting in an investigatory capacity.rather,the actions of the bor here were in nature and in accordance with illinois law.
under illinois law,the bor has the authority to resolve complaints challenging property tax assessments set by county officials and on its own motion revise the entire assessment of any taxpayer or any part of the assessment as appears to be just.see ilcs.the bor is the and for disputed property assessments in its county.therefore,heyde argument that the bor was acting in an investigatory capacity fails.illinois statutes are bor is within its bounds as a judicial body to revise heyde property assessment.how it assembled the evidence upon which it relied does not change the nature of the action it takes.
in addition to the illinois statutes,our conclusion that the bor members are entitled to absolute immunity is supported by our previous decisions.in reed village of shorewood,we found that the commissioner is acting in a judicial capacity when he revokes a liquor license.he may not revoke without finding that the licensee has violated the law he may make that finding only after notice and hearing and he shall reduce all evidence to writing and shall maintain an official record of the proceedings,cir internal citations omitted.as the district judge noted here,although the bor can quite properly increase assessments on its own,like in reed,it can do so only if it provides notice and hearing.ilcs.indeed,the bor engaged in a judicial proceeding,giving heyde the opportunity to present evidence before it increased his assessment.
in crenshaw baynerd,we affirmed a finding of absolute immunity granted to the indiana civil rights commission,determining that the commission decision that it lacked jurisdiction to investigate an allegation of discrimination was an action taken in an adjudicatory capacity,cir.we have also found that members of a prison review board that held a hearing to evaluate whether revocation of a plaintiff supervised release was proper before revoking the release were entitled to absolute immunity.wilson,at.and we have affirmed a grant of summary judgment to members of the illinois board of elections concluding that they were entitled to absolute immunity when ruling on objections to nominations for state offices.tobin for governor,at.we have also observed that administering oaths,examining witnesses,and the power to issue subpoenas are hallmarks of the sort of duties that entitle government or administrative actors to the protection afforded by the doctrine of absolute immunity.id.
here,the bor had similar duties.it was empowered to summon any assessor,deputy,or any other person to appear before it to be examined under oath concerning the method by which any evaluation has been ascertained.ilcs.more importantly,the bor can only increase an assessment if it gives the property owner notice and an opportunity to be heard.ilcs.
additionally,in tobin for governor,we found that,in accordance with the butz factors,absolute immunity was necessary to protect the board members from harassment and intimidation so that they can exercise their independent judgment.at.likewise,the bor statutory function of affirming,denying,and revising property assessments is inherently controversial and likely to result in disappointed parties and,unless checked,a multitude of lawsuits.
finally,in reed we found that the ability of the individual to appeal the decision of the administrative official weighs toward granting absolute immunity.at.the basis of the absolute immunity of judges is less that they are unlikely to commit wrongs than that their wrongs are largely remediable through the appellate process.id.at.this justification applies equally to actions taken by the bor.
illinois law provides safeguards to review and correct,if necessary bor decisions on appeal.ilcs.the statute guarantees an appeal as of right with the ptab.and the ptab reviews bor decisions de novo.ilcs.see tobin for governor,at finding it important to the determination of whether the official was entitled to absolute immunity that illinois statute afforded judicial review against board decisions.moreover,ptab decisions are appealable to the illinois courts pursuant to illinois administrative review law.ilcs see also beverly bank board of review of will county,d.
therefore,we agree with the district court.heyde argument that the bor members were acting in an investigatory capacity,and thus are not entitled to absolute immunity,is unpersuasive.the bor has the characteristics that counsel towards granting absolute immunity.the bor members actions while performing their
