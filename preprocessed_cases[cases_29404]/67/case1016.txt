kalamazoo owns a commercial building in kalamazoo,michigan,which it began to renovate during late.in order to accomplish the renovations,kalamazoo hired continental construction continental to raise the ceiling of the building top floor.to facilitate construction of a new roof,continental drilled holes in the existing roof,situating a steel beam in each hole ultimately,a total of such beams would support the beginnings of the new roof.
around february,the city suffered a heavy rainstorm,which caused water to enter the building by way of the space in between the beams and the edges of the holes in the existing roof.in an effort to divert the streaming water into the building drainage system,continental covered the holes with visqueen a dense plastic material.the visqueen did not succeed in its mission and the interior of the top three floors of the building sustained serious water damage as a consequence.kalamazoo alleges that the total cost of repairing the damage,or the replacement cost value rcv of the loss,was

ii.procedural history 
in response to the denial of its claim for,kalamazoo brought suit against westfield for breach of contract in kalamazoo county circuit court on july.invoking diversity jurisdiction,westfield timely removed the case to the district court for the western district of michigan.at the close of discovery,both parties moved for summary judgment.on june,the court granted summary judgment in favor of kalamazoo,and entered a judgment in its favor the court decision was in part based on its conclusion that westfield had conceded,or waived,its defense that kalamazoo release of claims against continental constituted breach of contract.westfield timely filed a motion for reconsideration of the judgment,asserting that the district court improperly deemed its breach of contract defense waived and,moreover,that kalamazoo destruction of its subrogation rights warranted a reversal and entry of summary judgment in its favor.the court denied the motion to reconsider on august.
on appeal to this court,westfield raises two main arguments.initially,westfield asserts that it did not concede its breach of contract defense,as the district judge concluded.westfield further maintains that kalamazoo is not entitled to the amount it seeks because it breached its insurance contract with westfield by settling with continental and thus extinguishing westfield contractual subrogation rights.westfield second argument is that,in any event,the water damages to kalamazoo building are not a covered loss within the meaning of the policy.finally,in connection with the second argument,westfield asserts that assuming summary judgment for kalamazoo was proper,the amount of damages awarded is not supported by evidence.because we resolve the subrogation issue in westfield favor,we need not consider westfield alternative arguments.
