this litigation arose after thoroughbred technology telecommunications,announced that it had the right to install conduits for fiber optic cables along railroad corridors.timothy elzinga,a property owner along a owned by the norfolk southern railway,disagreed.in his view,such a use by without the permission of the adjacent landowners would amount to a slander of their title and a trespass.discussions took place between elzinga and,which eventually bore fruit in the form of a proposed settlement.this proposed settlement presumed that elzinga would be certified as the representative of the putative class.with this much accomplished,elzinga then filed suit and simultaneously sought certification of a settlement class,consisting of all the persons who owned real estate on either side of the railroad tracks along the route proposed to use for its cable.
one particular complication figures significantly in this appeal.at any given point,will lay fiber optic cable on only one side of the tracks.ex ante,it is impossible to know which side that will be detailed engineering surveys and technical criteria will govern the company final choice.the settlement agreement attempts to deal with this uncertainty by dividing the class members into two categories the cable side and the side.it does not address separately the possibility that one landowner might own land on both sides of the track presumably such a person falls within both subgroups.under the terms of the agreement,the two groups will receive different forms of compensation.all class members,however,will become shareholders in class corridor,llc class corridor,a newly created limited liability company.
the appellant in this case,cathy mason,is an unnamed class member who claims that the settlement is unfair,and more formally,that it fails to satisfy the requirements of fed.civ.a and b.while a dispute remains as to whether mason will be entitled to any benefits under the settlement agreement,the fact that she is claiming that she should receive something is enough to ensure that she has standing to intervene.the district court granted mason motion to intervene,but it then overruled her objections and approved both the certification of the settlement class and the settlement agreement itself.we affirm.
the class elzinga represents has approximately members.they all own property along several thousand miles of railroad track although some class members own their property in fee simple absolute,in most instances,the property immediately adjacent to the track is subject to an easement or owned by norfolk southern corporation norfolk southern.regardless,all parties admit that in many cases,title to the properties will be difficult to prove.
norfolk southern granted to,its subsidiary,the right to lay fiber optic cable in the corridors along the railway easements.then announced its intention to install its cables in those corridors so that it could then market network services to communications providers.elzinga complaint alleged slander of title arising from claim that it has a property interest along the railroad and actual or threatened trespass arising from surveying of the property and its planned installment of conduits.on behalf of himself and the proposed class,he requested declaratory relief proclaiming the owners interest in the land and injunctive relief prohibiting from taking further unlawful action.
before we proceed to the details of the settlement agreement,we must first address the composition of the class the district court agreed to certify.the two groups within the class,the cable side and the side,are determined by the eventual use of the side of the track on which the class members property resides which is a significant issue for those who do not own the property on both sides of a given section of track.as we noted above,this distinction is important because will lay its cables on only one side of the railroad track.furthermore,has refused to identify which properties would be cable side and which would be side,because it claimed that there was no way it could know until after it had entered the land and surveyed it and thus committed the trespass the complaint was in part trying to prevent.as a result,class representative elzinga had to agree to the settlement before knowing on which side of the tracks his own property fell.this veil of uncertainty exists as well for mason although she objects that the settlement agreement is not fair,she does not know whether she will be in the cable side or side group.
under the settlement approved by the district court,all class members,cable side and side,will abandon any claims against and transfer an easement to for the specific purpose of laying cable.in exchange for the easement,depending upon whether they turn out to be cable side or side,the class members will receive varying compensation.
in keeping with the fact that the cable side class members will have given up the most,they will receive the most generous compensation.will pay each one per linear mile and a percentage of its revenue from the sale,lease,and license of the conduits it installs along the corridors.they will also receive ownership interests in the new company,class corridor,described below.the side owners will not receive direct cash payments.they too,however,will receive the same kind of ownership interests in class corridor,and will benefit financially in their capacity as shareholders.
the settlement agreement places class corridor at the heart of the overall process.all class members cable side and side,will transfer easements to the new company,for its part,must give class corridor assets including dark optical fiber and an option for class corridor to purchase a conduit from.in addition,if leases or sells four or more conduit systems to a telecommunications company,will pay either per fiber mile or up to dark fibers to class corridor.will also transfer telecommunication assets to class corridor,permitting it either to own and manage a telecommunications company or to take a specified sum of money.finally,class corridor will convey all cable side easements to once determines which side of the corridor it will use for its cables.if fails to install a telecommunication system along the railway,the easements will terminate four years after the effective date of the approval of the settlement.
as noted above,class members will be entitled to share in any revenues that class corridor may earn from the telecommunication assets.they will own of the company at a rate of one membership share for each ten linear feet of real estate owned by that class member,along with apportioned voting rights.shareholder distributions are within the discretion of the class corridor board of directors and will be made as reasonably determined.
finally,class counsel will receive per linear mile for the first three conduits installed in the settlement corridors,a percentage of gross receipts with respect to the fourth and successive conduits,and of certain revenues generated by class corridor or the cash payment to which side class members are entitled from class corridor.this means that class counsel will receive compensation of the same type and at the same time as class members as one expert testified,class counsel can never receive compensation that is more advantageous than that which goes to the class members.
mason acknowledges that class corridor has an upside,in that it permits class members to participate in any successes in the telecommunications market and to have greater control over future uses of their property.she points out,however,that there is also a downside.most importantly in her view,any future benefit the class members may receive from class corridor is speculative.class corridor may never be able to commence its intended business,it might not be able to raise sufficient financing to fund its operations,and it may experience difficulties achieving profitability.as readers of the business pages of the newspapers know all too well at this point,the telecommunications market has been volatile.this means that,insofar as their compensation is tied to class corridor,the class members might do very well or they might wind up.
the district court was aware of these gloomier possibilities.despite that,the court approved the settlement agreement.overall,the court found it to be fair to all parties,particularly in light of the potential weakness of the plaintiffs individual cases and the risks for all parties that accompanied delay.it also found that elzinga could adequately represent all the class members,future cable side and side,and certified the class over mason objections.
jurisdictional amount 
before proceeding to the merits we must first satisfy ourselves that the amount in controversy requirement of a has been met.this amount is determined by an evaluation of the controversy described in the plaintiff complaint and the record as a whole,as of the time the case was filed.shaw dow brands,cir.it is obvious that in conducting the required inquiry the court may consider the value of any benefit the named representatives may receive.in a case that seeks only money damages,the amount the defendant will lose is more or less the same.but in a case like this one,for injunctive relief,there may be an asymmetry.the question has thus arisen whether it is proper in determining amount in controversy to look in the alternative to the cost the defendant will incur in complying with the injunction the plaintiff seeks.in this circuit,the answer to the latter question has been yes it is established that the jurisdictional amount should be assessed looking at either the benefit to the plaintiff or the cost to the defendant of the requested either viewpoint rule.see,in re brand name prescription drugs antitrust litigation,cir mccarty amoco pipeline,cir.those cases specifically establish that the cost to a defendant of complying with an injunction sought by the plaintiff may properly be considered in determining the amount in controversy.as the ninth circuit recognized in in re ford motor citibank south dakota,cir,cert.granted under the name ford motor mccauley,d,it may be more difficult to make this assessment in the class action context.we too have recognized that there are difficulties in that situation,but we have chosen to resolve them by looking separately at each named plaintiff claim and the cost to the defendant of complying with an injunction directed to that plaintiff.brand name drugs,at.in our view,that ensures that we are not undermining the nonaggregation rule that still applies to class actions where the named plaintiff claim does not satisfy the jurisdictional amount.the ninth circuit apparently rejected our approach in its ford motor opinion.the supreme court now has the case under advisement,and we recognize that its decision may affect the rule we have followed.nonetheless,we see no reason to hold this case for the decision in ford motor instead,we respectfully choose to adhere to the brand name drugs approach.we are confident that the parties will be able to preserve their rights to have any contrary supreme court ruling applied,should the court find the ninth circuit approach persuasive.
the reason it is necessary to consider this wrinkle of jurisdictional doctrine stems from the fact that elzinga was unsure whether he was on cable side or side.this means that there is a serious question whether his injury satisfied the jurisdictional amount.standing alone,the value of an easement on his property is probably insufficient the relief he requested in his complaint was primarily declaratory,and if he ends up being on the side,the trespass will be solely for the purpose of surveying the land.elzinga argues,however,that under the either viewpoint rule,there is more than at stake with his individual claim which is necessary even under this court view of the scope of and zahn international paper,d,see stromberg metal works,press mechanical,cir.he asserts that it is unquestioned that would have to spend more than to avoid the costs of injunction and condemnation even if only his land was involved.see mccarty,at.mason has offered nothing to refute that factual assertion.we are satisfied,looking at this case from viewpoint,that the jurisdictional amount requirement of is satisfied,gottlieb westin hotel,cir,and we therefore proceed to mason next challenge.
justiciability 
this one,which mason raised at oral argument,also goes to the court jurisdiction she claims that the claims of the class members are at this stage of the proceedings.to resolve this justiciability argument,we must look at how the class is defined.if,as mason argues,the class claims are future claims,largely hypothetical at this stage,then the claims may not be ripe.if that were true,we would have to vacate the order below and our analysis would end here.see generally.mortgage bonner mall,d vacatur proper where mootness arises from external circumstances or from unilateral action of prevailing party or case was always moot.
the class in this case has some similarities to certain toxic tort cases,insofar as the eventual harm to the class members was uncertain at the time the complaint was filed and at the time of the settlement.but the similarity is not complete,and in the end it tends more to support the plaintiffs than to undermine them.in many toxic tort cases,uncertainties abound which class members were exposed to the substance who has suffered compensable injuries already who may never suffer injuries but if the risk itself is immediate,contingent claims based on that risk are justiciable and are routinely addressed both in toxic tort settlements and in bankruptcy proceedings.in this case,parts of the controversy are already unquestionably ripe the class members titles have already been slandered,and will need to enter the property at least for purposes of its surveys.the only thing important though it is that is not known is whether any particular owner will be cable side or side or both.furthermore,at the time of settlement,the slander claim was justiciable because some harm had already occurred.this is enough to permit the court to address the entire suit,including the claims for trespass and the injunction.on these facts,those claims are in no way hypothetical their immediacy and their relation to the slander claim is enough to permit the court to address the entire controversy.
this is particularly true in light of the fact that we are addressing a settlement.williams general capital auto lease,cir it is not at all uncommon for settlements to include a global release of all claims past,present,and future,that the parties might have brought against each other.the fact that each individual class member did not know the full extent of the burden she would suffer is unimportant.claimed rights to all of the property,and the settlement required all class members to provide with an easement.
satisfied that we may proceed to the merits,we turn next to the issue of class certification.we review the district court certification of a class for an abuse of discretion.this is true even in the settlement context.amchem products,windsor,d retired chicago police city of chicago,cir.for a district court to certify a class under rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure,the class must satisfy the requirements of numerosity commonality typicality and representativeness.
class representative 
much of mason argument centers around what she deems conflicting subgroups that were only assigned one representative.in amchem,at,and ortiz fibreboard,d,the supreme court emphasized that although settlement is relevant to class certification,the requirements of rule must still be satisfied.thus,a district court may not abandon the federal rules merely because a settlement seems fair,or even if the settlement is a good deal.in some ways,the rule requirements may be even more important for settlement classes,for which as this court has put it,the district court must act almost as a fiduciary of the class when approving settlements.reynolds beneficial bank,cir.
a class may not satisfy the requirements of rule a if the class representative does not possess the same interest and suffer the same injury as the class members.east.motor freight system,rodriguez,d citi
