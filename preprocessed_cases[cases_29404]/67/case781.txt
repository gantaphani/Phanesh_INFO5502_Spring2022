stroman realty,stroman,a company,sought relief in a texas federal court from attempts by the commissioner of the arizona department of real estate to exercise regulatory authority over stroman timeshare sales business.the district court dismissed its action,which alleged violations of the commerce clause under.because the federal district court in texas lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
stroman is one of the nation largest advertisers and resale brokers of timeshare intervals in the secondary resale market.it advertises properties to individuals interested in either selling their timeshare interests or purchasing timeshares from a previous owner other than the vacation resorts or condominium developers.stroman sole place of business is located in conroe,texas.its brokers are licensed by the texas real estate commission,and the advertising and marketing agreements they negotiate with stroman clients are governed by texas law.
because most timeshare buyers do not live in the state in which their desired property is located,stroman advertises in national newspapers,trade magazines,through publications,and over the internet.prospective purchasers can search stroman website for availabilities at condominiums,resorts,or spas,and read about the occupancy conditions of the various timeshare intervals being offered.interested parties then submit bids through the website or call a stroman broker.stroman uses its computer database to match prospective buyers with such variables as location,price range,amenities,and use interval.prospective sellers are required to pay a advance advertising fee to register their timeshares with stroman internet database,and,upon sale,the seller pays stroman an additional or of the total sale is commission.often,the seller,prospective buyer,and timeshare property involved in a single deal are all located in different states.it would thus not be unusual for stroman to broker a transaction involving a texas buyer and an arizona seller of a timeshare interval at a hawaii resort.
in january,elaine richardson,commissioner of the arizona department of real estate commissioner sent stroman by certified mail a order order stating that stroman agents were not licensed as real estate brokers or salespeople in arizona.under arizona law,nonresident brokers and other real estate service providers who transact business involving either arizona citizens or real property located in arizona must be licensed by the commissioner whether or not the timeshare property the arizona citizen wishes to buy or sell is located in arizona.see.b j.nonresident brokers like stroman are subject to various administrative and requirements,such as maintaining escrow accounts,hard copies of receipts,closing statements,and other business records.see,id.unlicensed brokering of transactions involving arizona real property or timeshares is a class felony,punishable by fine or up to two years imprisonment.see id.a.
the commissioner order maintained that stroman and its agents were engaging in unlicensed timeshare resale brokering and ordered stroman to cease all contact with arizona resident and owners of real estate located in arizona by mail,telephone,telefax,computer modem or any other means until it complied with arizona licensing laws additionally,stroman was instructed to refund all monies solicited from arizona resident and owners of real estate received in the course of stroman allegedly illicit brokerage transactions.the order stated that stroman had the right to invoke an administrative review procedure and that failure to file a notice of appeal within thirty days of service of process would constitute waiver of any future right to administrative or judicial appeal.see id.stroman did not respond.pursuant to arizona law,the order thus became a final,nonappealable,administrative decision.see id.b.
for five years,the commissioner took no action,and by the to broker transactions involving arizona timeshares and residents.in march,however,the commissioner contacted stroman by mail,ordering anew that it cease its brokerage activities.this time around,the commissioner added a charge that arizona law forbade advertisement of arizona properties on stroman internet website.see id.d.in response,on april,stroman filed a complaint in the southern district of texas seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the commissioner under,alleging that arizona attempted exercise of regulatory jurisdiction to license timeshare resales violated the commerce clause by discriminatorily and unduly burdening nonresident participation in the interstate secondary timeshare market.
the commissioner then moved to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,arguing that the arizona administrative proceeding rendered stroman claim res judicata the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over her and venue was improper.the commissioner also moved for summary judgment on the statute of limitations.the district court granted the commissioner motion to dismiss based on claim preclusion the issue sua under burford sun oil.the district court did not address the other issues.stroman has appealed.
discussion 
personal jurisdiction 
why the district court failed to consider personal jurisdiction over the commissioner in a texas federal court is unclear.this court must do so because the district court dismissed without the benefit of an evidentiary hearing,stroman need make only a prima facie showing that jurisdiction is proper.adams unione mediterranea di sicurta,cir citation omitted.we accept as true stroman uncontroverted allegations and construe all record evidence in its favor.id.
because lacks a provision for service of process federal courts adopt state jurisdictional statutes to reach defendants.see.e,k point landing,omni capital int l,cir,aff sub nom.omni capital int l,rudolf wolff,d.the texas statute is coextensive with the federal constitutional limits of due process and normally generates an inquiry limited to the scope of the fourteenth amendment due process clause.see religious tech.ctr.liebreich,cir.but where,as here,the case involves a challenge to an regulator enforcement of her state statute,rather than a conventional contract or tort claim,it is useful to consider first whether the texas statute reaches the commissioner.
texas statute 
pertinent here,the texas statute states 
in addition to other acts that may constitute doing business,a nonresident does business in this state if the nonresident 
contracts by mail or otherwise with a texas resident and either party is to perform the contract in whole or in part in this state or 
commits a tort in whole or in part in this state 
civ.prac.ann.n onresident includes an individual who is not a resident of this state and a foreign corporation,company,association,or partnership.civ.prac.ann.
one question arising from this language is whether the commissioner,sued under the fiction created by ex parte young,is an individual defendant within the terms of the statute.ex parte young subjects a state employee acting in her official capacity to suits for prospective relief that avoid the eleventh amendment bar,but the employee conduct remains state action under the fourteenth amendment.charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure ed see also home.los angeles.although the commissioner is an individual,she is acting in and was sued in her official capacity for enforcing arizona statutes.whatever may be the case for suits against officials who are sued in their individual capacity,the texas statute offers no obvious rationale for including nonresident individuals sued solely in their official capacity under ex parte young.moreover,the only other class of nonresident defined by the statute includes business entities but not fellow states.whether the statute definition of nonresidents ignores or subsumes the ex parte young fiction is uncertain.
a second statutory question is whether the commissioner enforcement of arizona regulations constitutes doing business,making a contract,or committing a activities reached by the statute.the parties,pursuing a commonly used broad analogy between suits and torts,characterize this suit as a tort claim.it is one thing to appropriate statutes of limitation and damage measures from tort causes of action into these are practical,utilitarian decisions.it also seems normally accurate to describe as torts,even under the statute,suits against public officials for individual misconduct.but the claim here is against the commissioner in her official capacity,the essence of ex parte young the parties may casually describe this case as a tort,even though it challenges not the commissioner abuse of power but her faithful enforcement of allegedly unconstitutional arizona statutes,and it seeks not damages but an injunction against the statute operation.this court,however,interpreted similar official conduct as the business of state regulation.see great united kidwell,cir,rev on other grounds sub nom.leroy great united,d these two competing approaches suggest that only by twisting the ordinary meaning of the terms covered by the statute is arizona regulatory activity intended to be encompassed and adjudicated in texas courts.
by conceding the application of the tort provision of the statute,the commissioner relieves this court of an obligation to pursue these interpretive questions.we preserve them for posterity,noting that while there may be no constitutional impediment against texas decision to allow its courts to construe and perhaps overturn state officials enforcement of sister state statutes and while the statute is coextensive with the limits of procedural due process for those people and entities and activities that it describes,the legislature may not have opened the courthouse doors to include this case.
due process 
whether or not the texas statute encompasses extraterritorial regulation by a nonresident state official,we hold that exercising personal jurisdiction over the commissioner in the southern district of texas would violate due process the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment prohibits the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant unless the defendant has meaningful contacts,ties,or relations with the forum state.int l shoe.jurisdiction may be general or specific.where a defendant has continuous and systematic general business contacts with the forum state,helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,d,the court may exercise general jurisdiction over any action brought against that defendant.id.at.where contacts are less pervasive,the court may still exercise specific jurisdiction in a suit arising out of or related to the defendant contacts with the forum.id.at.this case presents only the question of specific jurisdiction.
the constitutional requirement for specific jurisdiction is that the defendant has minimum contacts with the forum state such that imposing a judgment would not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.int l shoe,at.in nuovo pignone,spa storman asia,cir,this court explained that the personal jurisdiction inquiry involves a analysis 
whether the defendant purposely directed its activities toward the forum state or purposely availed itself of the privileges of conducting activities there whether the plaintiff cause of action arises out of or results from the defendant contacts and whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction is fair and reasonable.
id.at citing burger king rudzewicz,d.
minimum contacts 
to determine whether the commissioner has minimum contacts with texas,we must identify some act whereby she purposefully avail ed her self of the privilege of conducting activities there,thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.hanson denckla,d.the commissioner conduct must show that she reasonably anticipate ed being haled into court in texas.volkswagen woodson,d.
here,the totality of the commissioner contacts with texas involves a cease and desist order and correspondence with stroman attorneys.although the commissioner has reached out to assert her authority over stroman business activities,she has not purposefully availed herself of the benefits of texas law like someone actually doing business in texas.hanson,at.stroman does not allege the commissioner has made any contacts with texas apart from hypothetical contacts she may make with other prospective timeshare vendors while attempting to assert nationwide authority.based on such minimal known contacts,the commissioner,a nonresident state official,could not have reasonably anticipated being haled into federal court in texas to defend her enforcement of the arizona statute.volkswagen,at.
courts generally exercise specific jurisdiction over nonresident defendants that are engaged in commercial,enterprise.in kulko superior court,d the supreme court recognized that the absence of commercial transactions in interstate commerce in which a defendant sought a commercial benefit precluded an analogy to commercial activity cases as a basis for assertion of personal jurisdiction.id.at.the kulko court further concluded that a court reliance on a defendant having caused an effect in the forum state was misplaced because the defendant derived no benefit from any activities relating to the forum.id.at.see also city of.beach roanoke river basin ass n,cir holding that the governor of north carolina participation in hearings conducted in virginia by the army corps of engineers related to a dispute with a virginia city was not an invocation of benefits and protections of virginia law sufficient to subject governor to service under virginia statute.
kulko is applicable here.in the first instance,the commissioner was not engaged in commercial transactions to obtain a commercial benefit by acting in a governmental capacity to enforce arizona law.because no such benefit accrues to the commissioner from her activities relating to texas,any jurisdiction based upon her having caused an effect in texas is likewise misplaced.even if the state of arizona a sovereign state,subject to eleventh amendment a benefit from any effects in texas generated by the action of the commissioner,the benefit does not run to those officials in their individual capacity,stripped of their sovereign immunity cloak.stroman can not have it both ways under the ex parte young doctrine.
stroman argues that because this is a case involving an defendant conduct targeted to affect an plaintiff,this circuit jurisdictional analysis is controlled by calder effects test.see calder jones,d see also southmark life investors,cir.calder involved a california actress who brought suit in california state court against two florida employees of a tabloid magazine and alleged she had been libeled by a story featured in their publication.upholding the california court jurisdiction over the florida defendants,the supreme court stated that the effects of their tortious conduct were expressly aimed at california and that the plaintiff would feel the brunt of the harm in that state.calder,at.
stroman argues that texas is a similar locus for jurisdiction because the effects of the commissioner regulatory actions are felt there.we do not agree.although it may be true that the commissioner action against stroman is based upon conduct which occurred entirely in texas,we can not find,as stroman urges,that the commissioner has purposefully directed her conduct at texas.stroman more accurately recognizes that the commissioner,by proceeding with the cease and desist order,is essentially asserting nationwide authority over any real estate transactions involving arizona residents or property.
effects jurisdiction is premised on the idea that an act done outside a state that has consequences or effects within the forum state can suffice as a basis for personal jurisdiction if the effects are seriously harmful and were intended or highly likely to follow from the nonresident defendant conduct.moncrief oil int l oao gazprom,cir.such jurisdiction is rare.id.moreover,as this court has noted,t he key to calder is that the effects of an alleged intentional tort are to be assessed as part of the analysis of the defendant relevant contacts with the forum.allred moore peterson,cir,cert.denied,d emphasis added quoting wallace herron,cir,cert.denied,d.we have declined to allow jurisdiction for even an intentional tort where the only jurisdictional basis is the alleged harm to a texas resident.moncrief,supra see also panda brandywine potomac power,cir.by seeking to regulate stroman activities involving arizona residents or property,the commissioner is not expressly aim ing her actions at texas.calder,at.rather,her intent is to uphold and enforce the laws of arizona.
to illustrate,this case closely resembles united states ferrara.in ferrara,the federal government sued the chief counsel of the disciplinary board of the new mexico supreme court in federal court in the district of columbia for injunctive relief after she charged an assistant united states attorney ausa with violating new mexico rules of professional conduct based on his activities in.the government,relying on calder,argued that the federal court in had jurisdiction because the new mexico official actions would have a direct effect on prosecutions in,and the official created continuing obligations between herself and due to ongoing licensing obligations.id.at.the appellate court rejected this argument,concluding that a preexisting relationship between new mexico and the ausa forbade jurisdiction because the official was simply fulfilling her duty to uphold the new mexico bar ethical standards,rather than reaching out to affect ethical standards in id.at.
likewise,the arizona licensing regulations in force when stroman chose to deal in arizona timeshares and with arizona residents preclude a finding of personal jurisdiction in texas.like the new mexico official in ferrara,the commissioner is upholding professional standards for brokers in arizona.moreover,the connection stroman seeks to establish between the commissioner and texas is based entirely on the unilateral actions and decisions of stroman,not the commissioner.in general,t he unilateral activity of those who claim some relationship with a nonresident defendant can not satisfy the requirement of contact with the forum state.hanson,at.here,it was stroman who chose to market arizona properties and transact business with arizona residents.arizona is simply attempting to uniformly apply its laws.if the court adopted the approach urged by stroman,we would endorse an interpretation of personal jurisdiction under which the,for that matter,any state official seeking to enforce her state potentially be subjected to suit in any state where the validity of her state laws were in question.we are unwilling to establish such a broad principle.
cause of action arises from contacts 
the second criterion for constitutionally sufficient contacts is that the underlying cause of action must arise out of the defendant contacts with the forum state.the proper focus of the analysis is on the relationship among the defendant,the forum,and the litigation.calder,at.quoting shaffer heitner,d.there is no question that the underlying cause of action arises out of the commissioner cease and desist order to stroman in texas.but keeping in mind the proper focus on the relationship among the defendant,the forum,and the litigation,we observe that the commissioner connection to texas is based on stroman conduct,whose effects were targeted at arizona and its citizens.it could be said that the commissioner was forced to come to texas.on balance,however,this factor weighs in favor of stroman.
reasonableness of personal jurisdiction 
the third element of the due process inquiry,assessing the reasonableness of a court exercise of personal jurisdiction,includes five factors the burden upon the nonresident defendant to litigate in that forum the forum state interests in the matter the plaintiff interest in securing relief the interstate judicial system interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies and the several states shared interest in furthering substantive social policies.see asahi metal industry superior court,d felch transportes sa de cv,cir.
allowing the southern district of texas to assert jurisdiction over the commissioner creates the possibility that the commissioner will have to defend her attempt to enforce arizona laws in courts throughout the nation.when a state defends its laws in a faraway forum,it loses the benefit of having the laws examined by local state or federal that have special expertise interpreting its laws.see,leroy great united,d f ederal judges sitting in idaho are better qualified to construe idaho law,and to assess the character of idaho probable enforcement of that law,than are judges sitting elsewhere.conversely,although a texas court certainly has an interest in determining the legitimacy of texas statutes,states have little interest in adjudicating disputes over other states statutes.pti,philip morris,d.at the same time,arizona,as a sovereign,has a strong interest in not having an court evaluate the validity of its laws 
although stroman has an interest in a convenient forum to pursue litigation,especially when it alleges harm from a constitutional violation,and texas has an interest in providing a forum to redress the grievances of its citizens,subjecting the commissioner to suit in the southern district of texas could lead to a multiplicity of inconsistent verdicts on a significant constitutional issue.if,as is likely,these courts reside in different federal circuits,only the supreme court could sort out the confusion.but if the cause of action is litigated in arizona federal court,judicial efficiency and uniformity prevail.
important questions of federalism are present here,and thus,for this case,the shared interest of the several states is the most significant reasonableness consideration outlined by the supreme court.federalism and state sovereignty are an essential part of the constraints that due process imposes upon personal jurisdiction.those constraints do more than protect the defendant against the burdens of litigating in a distant or inconvenient forum they also ensure that the states through their courts,do not reach out beyond the limits imposed on them by their status as coequal sovereigns in a federal system.volkswagen,at.the sovereignty of each state implie s a limitation on the sovereignty of all of its sister limitation express or implicit in both the original scheme of the constitution and the fourteenth amendment.id.at.accordingly,the reasonableness of asserting jurisdiction over a defendant must be assessed in the context of our federal system of government.id.citation omitted.in that way,due process act s as an instrument of interstate federalism.id.at.the effect of holding that a federal district court in the southern district of texas had personal jurisdiction over a nonresident state official would create an avenue for challenging the validity of one state laws in courts located in another state.this practice would greatly diminish the independence of the states.
in volkswagen,the supreme court cited increasing interstate commerce to justify relaxed personal jurisdiction standards.in spite of this conclusion,however,the court emphasized that we have never accepted the proposition that state lines are irrelevant for jurisdictional purposes,nor could we,and remain faithful to the principles of interstate federalism embodied in the constitution.id.at.we agree,and hold that it would be unreasonable to subject the commissioner to suit in the southern district of texas.
this analysis would be incomplete without addressing this court decision in great united kidwell,supra,a fifth circuit opinion barely mentioned in the briefs.kidwell expressly found no due process violation in a texas court exercise of personal jurisdiction over an idaho official who sought to enforce an idaho corporate takeover statute against a texas company.this result,we conclude,has been overturned by later supreme court decisions.nevertheless,kidwell exposes the novelty of stroman maneuver in this case.kidwell itself was reversed by the supreme court on a finding of improper venue the court expressly declined,under its precedent to reach the due process issues surrounding personal jurisdiction.
