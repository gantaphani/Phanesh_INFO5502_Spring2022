as part of its efforts to revitalize the local economy,the city of detroit in the late built a new stadium,comerica park,for its professional baseball team the tigers and a new stadium,ford field,for its football team the lions.soon after completing the stadiums stadia if you like,detroit sought to feature them by putting in bids to host the super bowl for the national football league,the game for major league baseball and most recently the men basketball final four for the national collegiate athletic association.
when the first of these bids the nfl in agreed to hold the super bowl at ford field in city began to prepare for the event.in,it created a development program,empowered to reimburse up to of the costs of refurbishing the exteriors of downtown buildings and parking lots.the program was limited to property in a discrete section of downtown detroit but reached out to all property in that area,including property owned by religious organizations.three churches participated in the program a methodist church,a baptist church and an episcopal church.of the million allocated for completed and authorized projects,or about went to these churches.
the question at hand is whether the establishment clause of the united states constitution,or its counterpart in the michigan constitution,prohibits the city from including religious organizations in the program.the lead plaintiff,american atheists,maintains that they do,and it filed this lawsuit to enjoin the agency from making any grants to religious entities.the district court rejected these arguments in large part,and we reject them in full.
everyone agrees that the program allocates benefits to a broad spectrum of entities on a neutral basis,as the city awards grants without regard to the religious,or areligious nature of the entity.the facial neutrality of the program,everyone also agrees,does not mask an intent to advance religion detroit sought to fix up its downtown,not to establish a religion.and as will generally be the case when a governmental program allocates generally available benefits on a neutral basis and without a hidden agenda,this program does not have the impermissible effect of advancing religion in general or any one faith in particular.by endorsing all qualifying applicants,the program has endorsed none of them,and accordingly it has not run afoul of the federal or state religion clauses.
an agency of the city of detroit,the downtown development authority was created in to halt property value deterioration in the downtown business district,to eliminate the causes of such deterioration,and to promote economic growth in the downtown business district.ja.in pursuing these goals,the agency may draft,propose and implement development plans for the economic growth of downtown detroit.comp.laws c,e f,all of which must be approved by the detroit city council,and all of which must relate to a defined section of downtown detroit,id.
in,the agency proposed,and the city council approved,the lower woodward facade improvement program.one among many initiatives to revitalize downtown detroit,the program was designed to enhance the visual appearance of the downtown area by encourag ing improvements to building facades and upgrades to edges of surface parking lots.ja.in addition to preparing the city for the influx of visitors that would descend on detroit for the nfl super bowl,and eventually the major league baseball all star game and the ncaa men basketball final four,the agency believed that the program would increase the sense of security,community,and continuity for existing and future developments and increase revenue at existing downtown business locations.ja.
under the program,the agency allocated reimbursement grants,funded by local revenues,to property owners and tenants who owned or leased property within the program area and who made approved renovations to their buildings and parking lots.qualified applicants were reimbursed for of the costs of the renovations,subject to caps of per building and per parking lot.
anyone who owned or leased property within the program a area between campus martius park and grand circus apply for a grant,so long as the applicant was current on its state and local taxes and initially could fund the project on its own.although the program limited applicants to one grant per building or parking lot,applicants could receive multiple grants if they owned or leased multiple properties within the area.
the agency established guidelines for making the grants.as to buildings,applicants could receive grants for p ermanent physical improvements to building facades generally visible from a public,ja,such as renovations to storefront windows,fixtures,masonry,brickwork,awnings,shutters,exterior doors,windows and signs.as to parking lots,applicants could receive grants for installing fencing,brick piers,new curbs,new approaches,shrubbery,irrigation,lighting and other upgrades along the edges of parking lots.ja.
in reviewing grant applications,the agency ensured that proposed projects conformed to the p rogram design guidelines and objectives.ja.applicants had to describe the project in detail,estimate the project cost and prove that they initially could finance the project in full.after the program manager verified that information,the applicant selected a firm to prepare a conceptual design of the project.once the program manager,a committee and the agency board of directors approved the design,the applicant and the agency executed a reimbursement contract,in which the applicant agreed to complete the project and pay all of the costs of doing so,and the agency agreed to reimburse of the approved design and construction costs up to the and limits.applicants became eligible for reimbursement after they completed the construction and after the agency verified that the project was constructed in accordance with approved design documents,ja,and the applicant had paid the contractor in full.
all told,during the two and a half years of the program existence,the agency received grant applications,and of them met the program eligibility requirements.the agency approved projects,and the applicants completed of these projects,at a total cost to the agency of million.
of these projects,nine involved renovations to buildings and parking lots owned by three downtown detroit churches.central united methodist church received four grants one for repairs to the exterior of the church including renovation of the building facade,entry door,outdoor sign,steeple clock and light fixtures another for similar repairs to the church activities building and two more for improvements to the church parking lots.second baptist church received four grants one for repairs to the exterior of the church including renovation of the brick facade,the glass covering some stained glass windows,the exterior doors,the outdoor sign and the building trim two more for similar repairs to two other buildings and a fourth for improvements to the church parking lot.john episcopal church received one grant for repairs to the exterior of the church and to the parking lot,including funds for the renovation of a stone wall,metal fence and entranceway canopies,installation of a new church sign and replacement of a protective glazing over some stained glass windows.
the remaining projects covered a range of improvements to downtown detroit,including grants to a music hall,a bank,a hotel,an opera house,a theater and an apartment building.the three churches received about from the comes to of the million in reimbursements.
american atheists,a organization that denies the existence of a deity and that is dedicated to the separation of church and state,ja,along with one individual member of the organization,another individual and one professional corporation collectively,american atheists,filed this action against the detroit downtown development authority detroit or the city,challenging the program as applied to the three churches.seeking declaratory and injunctive relief as well as attorney fees,they claimed that the agency transfer of funds to the churches violates the establishment clause of the federal constitution and its counterpart in the michigan constitution.the district court permitted john episcopal church to intervene as a defendant.after the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment,the district court upheld all of the city reimbursement grants to the churches,save for two of them the costs of improving outdoor signs at the three churches and the costs of replacing the storm windows covering two windows at john episcopal church.see am.atheists,city of detroit downtown dev,d.the district court granted attorney fees to american atheists.
american atheists appeals the district court decision to allow any of the grants.the city and john the district court decision to strike the portion of the grants attributable to restoring the signs and to replacing the covers of two windows.the city also the attorney fees award.
before addressing the parties competing positions about the constitutionality of this program,we must address two preliminary constitutional issues of a different sort does american atheists have standing to bring this claim and,even if the group properly filed this lawsuit in the first instance,is this dispute still a live case or controversy given that the agency paid the approved reimbursement grants to each of the churches after the district court decision 
the city argues that we need not,indeed can not,decide the merits of this dispute because american atheists premises standing on its members status as taxpayers and because taxpayer standing is a basis for enlisting the federal courts to resolve constitutional challenges to the validity of state or federal programs.see frothingham mellon.see also daimlerchrysler cuno,d valley forge christian coll.ams.united for separation of church state,d.as a general rule,a taxpayer concerned that government officials have misspent his tax dollars does not have a personal stake in the more than any other taxpayer thus lacks the concrete and particularized injury that article iii requires.cuno,at.internal quotation marks omitted.
yet that general rule gives way to an exception for municipal taxpayers.since the court first articulated the general prohibition against taxpayer standing in frothingham,it has maintained that the peculiar relation of the corporate taxpayer to the corporation sets municipal taxpayers apart from their federal and state counterparts like a shareholder of a private corporation,a municipal taxpayer has an immediate interest in how the municipality spends resources that reflect his contributions.frothingham,at.see also cuno,at.asarco,kadish,d plurality opinion.
in applying this distinction,we have held that,so long as the challenged government action involves the expenditure of municipal funds or the loss of municipal revenue,frothingham bar on taxpayer suits does not apply.see hawley city of cleveland,cir see also taub kentucky,cir.only if the challenged local governmental action involves neither an appropriation nor expenditure of city funds will the municipal taxpayer lack standing,for in that case he will have suffered no direct injury.doremus bd.of educ.of hawthorne.compare pelphrey cobb county,cir municipal taxpayers had standing because the challenged practice involved the expenditure of public funds,koenick felton,cir same,united states city of new york,cir same,cammack waihee,cir same,common cause district of columbia,same,and donnelly lynch,cir same,rev on other grounds,d,with twp.of wall,cir plaintiffs did not have standing because they did not show the city spent any funds on the challenged activity,doe duncanville indep.sch,cir same,foremaster city of george,cir same,pulido bennett,cir same,modified on other grounds,cir,and freedom from religion,zielke,cir same.
american atheists satisfies these modest requirements.the city funded its grants through local property taxes,including taxes paid by at least one member of american atheists.because american atheists challenges direct expenditures of tax dollars its members paid and because an association may premise standing on the interests of its individual members,see friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl,d,the group clears article iii hurdle.
not so,the city rejoins hein freedom from religion foundation,d,changes everything because it categorically barred taxpayer suits attacking spending decisions that violate the establishment clause.because the downtown development authority an entity,not the detroit city council a entity,awarded the grants to the churches,the city argues that hein eliminates standing to pursue this lawsuit.
yet this argument overreads hein.the decision did not erect a new barrier to taxpayer suits it marked the boundaries of an existing exception to the rule against federal and state taxpayer standing.flast cohen held that the general bar on taxpayer lawsuits did not apply to complaints that congressional appropriations violated the establishment clause,d.hein in turn explained that the flast exception does not extend to suits challenging expenditures of unearmarked funds.see.at plurality opinion see also id.at scalia,concurring in the judgment.while flast opened the door to suits attacking congress decisions to spend money in violation of the establishment clause,it never applied as hein makes clear to suits attacking decisions by the executive branch.
flast and hein have no application here.as frothingham itself explained,and as we have since held,the general rule against taxpayer standing does not extend to suits.see at.hawley,at.flast exception to thus hein exception to not affect american atheists standing to challenge the municipal agency grants.pelphrey,at.hein potential application to state taxpayers,hinrichs speaker of the house,cir,in the end makes no difference to a case filed by municipal taxpayers.nor need we decide whether the city council actions approving the program would satisfy hein requirement if flast applied in this setting.all that matters is that american atheists alleges that taxes its members have paid.
the city may or may not be right that the trajectory of hein places the standing rule in jeopardy.and it may or may not be right that drawing a line for standing purposes between a citizen status as a taxpayer and a city taxpayer makes less sense today than it did when the court decided frothingham in.why,the city suggests,should article iii bar a taxpayer from challenging spending decisions made by his state,yet allow him to challenge those of the same state political subdivisions city of new york,at.population statistics do not explain the distinction.cities,including detroit,have populations larger than at least one state.and the nation largest municipality,new york city,has a population larger than those of states.see population division,census bureau,annual estimates of the resident population for the united states,regions,states puerto rico,available at population division,census bureau,annual estimates of the population for incorporated places over,available at.gov popest cities sub est.html.why residents of new york city necessarily have a greater stake in the way city officials spend their share of the city budget than north dakotans have in the way state officials spend their share of the state budget may indeed be a.but the court has drawn a line between state action by states and state action by cities before,and the doctrine may simply be one more area reflecting this distinction.compare,healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d eleventh amendment bar on suits against one of the united states does not apply to counties and similar municipal corporations,with,avery midland county,d fourteenth amendment mandate that no state deny to any person the equal protection of the laws applies to local governments.either way,the distinction in the context of taxpayer standing is one that the supreme court has maintained for years and one we have no authority to second guess.
that one of american atheists members is a city of detroit taxpayer,then,allowed the group to satisfy article iii requirement at the outset of this case.but does the group satisfy these requirements at the tail end of the case after the district court issued its decision,the city paid most of the reimbursement grants to the three churches,and that,we are told,moots the case.
by preventing the federal courts from resolving moot disputes,article iii ensures that courts respect the requirement at all stages of federal judicial proceedings,trial and appellate.lewis cont l bank,d see cuno,at.a federal court must dismiss a case as moot if the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.powell mccormack,d.but so long as the parties maintain a personal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit,lewis,at.internal quotation marks omitted,and we can afford some kind of meaningful relief to a prevailing party,a case is not moot,church of scientology united states,d.the remedy need not satisfy a claimant every expectation t he availability of a partial remedy is sufficient to prevent a case from being moot.calderon moore,d per curiam internal quotation marks omitted.
the first answer to the mootness question is that the city and john parties in the unsatisfied with the district court judgment.although the district court upheld most of the reimbursement grants to john,it did not uphold all of them,including one to upgrade a building sign and one to replace storm windows covering two windows.because the district court enjoined these grants,because the city has not reimbursed the church for them and because american atheists maintains that the state and federal religion clauses bar the grants,john and the city retain a live dispute with american atheists over the permissibility of these payments.
that proves that one of the requests for relief in this case remains atheists efforts to enjoin additional payments to religious entities.but what about its other request for return the grants already made to the city fisc generally speaking,american atheists must show that each request for relief is not moot.see powell,at.friends of the earth,at.that may or may not make a difference here because there is a necessary overlap between the merits issues implicated by each requested form of relief in this case.
at any rate,did this second request for relief become moot when the city paid these other grants and when most of them went to entities that have never participated in this it difficult,if not judicially impossible,to get the money back should american atheists prevail on appeal laskowski spellings,cir,vacated on other grounds by of notre dame laskowski,d guidry sheet metal workers int l ass n,cir.here again john enters the picture as a party,it may be ordered to return the grants already made to it.life annuity ins.knudson,d united states lane,cir.if american atheists prevails on appeal,it thus may obtain at least a partial remedy the return of john suffices to prevent this aspect of the case from being moot.church of scientology,at.see ams.united for separation of church state prison fellowship ministries,cir t he dispute as to restitution,premised on the unconstitutionality of the performed contracts,is a live controversy.in re zenith elecs,cir roemer bd.of pub.works of,d plurality opinion.
laskowski spellings,cir,we realize,held that federal taxpayers can not pursue similar relief once funds have been disbursed to intermediary party recipients of the grants after they released the funds to beneficiaries.allowing a plaintiff to proceed against a private grant recipient for restitution to the treasury as a remedy in an otherwise moot establishment clause case,the court reasoned,would extend the flast exception beyond the limits of the result in flast.id.at.and because hein strictly confined flast to the result in flast,the court concluded that hein prohibited any such extension.id.
laskowski does not affect this case for at least two reasons.american atheists,to repeat,premises standing on its members status as municipal,not federal,taxpayers,and accordingly any order requiring john to repay the funds it received would not extend not,indeed,even implicate flast.and because laskowski involved a party intermediary who had received federal funds,but not an end recipient of the funds who was a party to the case,the decision raised restitution questions and restitution complexities not presented here.no party to this case,notably,has questioned the federal district court authority to require john to return the funds it already has received for its qualifying and thus far reimbursement grants.the case is not moot.
the first amendment to the united states constitution,as applied to the states through the fourteenth amendment,see cantwell connecticut,provides that congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,const.amend.from the outset,the court has construed the language of the two clauses to forbid government from using its power either to favor or to handicap any one religion or religion in general.everson bd.of educ.of ewing.the religion clauses command the states to be a neutral in their relations with groups of religious believers and and not the adversary of either side.id.to these ends,the establishment clause requires government to enact laws that are neutral as to religion,do not have the purpose of advancing religion and do not have the primary effect of advancing religion.see mitchell helms,d,concurring in the judgment agostini felton,d see also lemon kurtzman,d church of the lukumi babalu aye,city of hialeah,d.detroit downtown refurbishment program satisfies all three requirements.
the most essential hurdle that a program must clear is the program allocates benefits in an evenhanded manner to a broad and diverse spectrum of beneficiaries.see good news club milford cent,d mitchell,at.plurality opinion id.at,concurring in the judgment.phrased as an interrogatory does the program determine a recipient eligibility for benefits in spite of,rather than because of,its religious character see mitchell,at.plurality opinion rosenberger rector visitors of of,d.
since its earliest explorations of the establishment clause,the court has underscored neutrality as a central,though not dispositive,consideration in sizing up programs.see mitchell,at.plurality opinion id.at,concurring in the judgment rosenberger,at.id.at,concurring everson,at.what the court has said matches what it has done.programs that allocate benefits based on distinctions among religious,and areligious recipients are generally doomed from the start.see,texas monthly,bullock,d plurality opinion invalidating state exemption for periodicals published or distributed by a religious faith and consisting wholly of writings promulgating the teaching of the faith larson valente,d striking down state law exempting only certain churches from various registration and reporting requirements internal quotation marks omitted sch.dist.of abington twp.schempp,d invalidating programs mandating daily bible reading in public school.yet programs that evenhandedly allocate benefits to a broad class of groups,without regard to their religious beliefs,generally will withstand scrutiny.see good news club,at.mitchell,at.plurality opinion agostini,at.rosenberger,at.zobrest catalina foothills sch,d lamb chapel ctr.moriches union free sch,d witters.dep t of svcs.for the blind,d mueller allen,d widmar vincent,d bd.of educ.allen,d everson,at.see also walz tax comm n,d.
detroit program satisfies this neutrality requirement.it makes grants available to a wide spectrum of religious,nonreligious and areligious groups alike and employs neutral,secular criteria to determine an applicant eligibility,what projects may be reimbursed and how much each grantee receives.that the program includes,rather than excludes,several churches among its many other recipients helps ensure neutrality,not threaten it.good news club,at.see also rosenberger,at.steele indus.dev t,cir.
although the facial neutrality of a program frequently will provide refuge from attack in this area,it is not a safe haven.a government program,even an ostensibly neutral program,adopted with the aim of advancing one religion or all religions generally will not survive an establishment clause challenge.see wallace jaffree,d.not just an overt objective of furthering religion will undermine a program,so too will other proof of an impermissible objective,including evidence gleaned from the language of the program,its context and its history.see edwards aguillard,d see also mccreary county,aclu of,d caleb nelson,judicial review of legislative purpose.
the implementation of a program also may reveal that what purports to be evenhanded is not.an aid program on its face may offer benefits to all comers but may in reality favor only religious,a program providing roof repairs only for buildings with steeples,or a program refurbishing large auditoriums in a neighborhood where the only buildings that fit the bill are houses of worship.in committee for public education religious liberty nyquist,for example,the court struck down a program that provided aid to private schools where all or practically all of those schools eligible to receive grants were related to the roman catholic church and taught religious doctrine to some degree,internal quotation marks omitted lukumi,at.considering law adverse impact,which affected one religious group practices almost exclusively,as evidence of purpose to target the religion for detrimental treatment in violation of the free exercise clause.
none of these problems exists here.american atheists has never alleged,much less demonstrated,that detroit program has any such or masked.nor does anything in the record suggest that the agency proposed,or the city council approved,the program with the aim of advancing the fortunes of the city houses of worship.what the record shows instead is that the program was designed to revitalize the downtown area across the board by giving all of its buildings and parking lots a facelift.fostering that kind of improvement,the agency thought,not only would improve the sense of security,community,and continuity for existing and future developments but also would brighten the economic prospects of downtown businesses.ja joseph price,an american apotheosis sports as popular religion,in religion and popular culture in america bruce david forbes jeffrey mahan,ed.fans,in fact,spend more money on the super a pilgrimage to the game attending parties bedecked with official super bowl paraphernalia placing bets in office pools and americans spend on traditional religious practices and institutions throughout the entire month.the evenhanded language of the program,the purposes behind the program and the wide array of entities that obtained grants under and religious,public and private,and any claim that the program was implemented with the purpose of advancing religion.
that leaves the possibility that detroit program,though written in evenhanded terms,though not masking a hidden agenda,nonetheless oversteps the establishment clause because in application it has the primary effect of advancing religion.see agostini,at.bowen kendrick,d.the court has identified several hallmarks of laws with this forbidden effect,but this program suffers from none of them.
first,a program may have the primary effect of advancing religion if it employs skewed selection criteria that stack the deck in favor of groups that engage in religious indoctrination,encouraging potential recipients to take part in religious activity by rewarding them for doing so.agostini,at.but because detroit program makes aid available to both religious and secular beneficiaries on a nondiscriminatory basis and employs neutral,secular criteria that neither favor nor disfavor religion,it presents no such problem and creates no such incentive.see also mitchell,at.plurality opinion.nor does american atheists argue that the program grants administrative discretion to the agency that could be has been skew benefits in favor of religious entities.
second,a program may have the primary effect of advancing religion if it leads to religious indoctrination that could reasonably be attributed to governmental action.mitchell,at.plurality opinion id.at,concurring in the judgment see also agostini,at.although three churches received reimbursement grants under the program and although the churches engage in what could be called uncharitably religious indoctrination,there is no cognizable basis for attribut ing that activity to the city.by providing these benefits to religious and secular entities alike and by allocating the benefits based on criteria that have nothing to do with religion,the city demonstrated that it neither endorsed nor approved of the churches religious teachings.
a comparison to other permitted benefits proves the point.a city may extend sewers and sidewalks to churches,synagogues and mosques.see everson,at.it may provide police and services to them.see id.and it may extend exemptions for charitable organizations to them.see walz,at.all of these generally available benefits facilitate the operation of the religious institution,either by saving them money directly or by sparing them the expense of providing the services on their own,and in the process they make it more likely that newcomers will attend their religious services.yet the court has long approved the extension of these general government benefits to religious entities.the same is true of services,books and school technology offered to religious schools,even though the assistance facilitates the religious and secular missions of the recipients.see everson,at.allen,at.mitchell,at.plurality opinion id.at,concurring in the judgment.if a city may save the exterior of a church from a fire,it is hard to understand why it can not help that same church with peeling paint or least when it provides the same benefit to all downtown buildings on the same terms.
no reasonable,reasonably informed observer,see good news club,at.see also zelman,d,moreover,would infer from the churches participation in this program,alongside and on equal terms with dozens of secular entities,that the agency endorsed or approved of the churches religious views.the program breadth,evenhandedness and eminently secular objectives help to break the link between the government and religious indoctrination.see mitchell,at.plurality opinion id.at,concurring in the judgment.excluding the churches from taking part in the program,by contrast,would send a far stronger message not of endorsement but of disapproval.it may be that the first amendment did not compel detroit to include religious groups in this project,locke davey,d,but neither did it prohibit detroit from including these groups in the to enhance the success of the program by revitalizing all of downtown or to avoid sending a message of hostility to people of faith,van orden perry,d breyer,concurring in the judgment.
third,a program may have the primary effect of advancing religion if the benefit itself has an inherently religious content.see mitchell,at.plurality opinion.governments may not dole out crosses or torahs to their citizens,even if they give them to all citizens,without running into an establishment clause problem.id.at.allen,at.yet no such aid was distributed here.in the first place,the government gave monetary grants,not religious symbols,to participating entities.in the second place,the district court determined,and american atheists does not challenge on appeal,that the vast majority of the reimbursed renovation of exterior lights,pieces of masonry and brickwork,outdoor planters,exterior doors,concrete ramps,entrance ways,overhangs,building trims,gutters,fencing,curbs,shrubbery and irrigation any content at all,much less a religious content.the thrust of the program goes to facade,not to substance,to giving the exterior of the buildings a clean,appearance.there is no such thing as a potemkin church,synagogue or mosque.
that leaves the two types of grants that the district court invalidated the church signs and the storm windows covering john windows.the church signs contain no religious content in and of themselves.the point of the signs for churches and alike is to allow the entities to say what they are.the churches,no surprise,identified themselves as churches,but that fact has no more religious content than the,markers that adorn the front exterior of each church sanctuary and that identify them as churches.see ja.nor is the sign at john,as the district court mistakenly concluded,decorated with crosses.am.atheists,d at.the record shows that john sign is ornamented with eight.as john points out,and as american atheists does not dispute,a is an architectural flourish that has no inherently religious content and a secular significance.webster third new international dictionary defining a as the iris chosen for the royal emblem of france by charles v and a device common in artistic design and heraldry.
nor is there a constitutional impediment to the reimbursement for work done on the storm windows covering the two stained glass windows at john.the storm windows by themselves do not have religious content.and although replacing the old,yellowing storm windows made the stained glass and the religious iconography on it easier to see,that did not transform the storm windows into religious artifacts any more than removing plywood covering the windows would have made the wood a religious symbol.
fourth,a program may have the primary effect of advancing religion if the recipient divert s secular aid to further its religious mission.mitchell,at,concurring in the judgment compare id.with id.at nn.plurality opinion.but the record reveals no diversion that would prompt a reasonable observer to impute to detroit the religious mission that the churches undertake.for the most part,there was no possibility of diversion most of the aid the churches repairs to walls,doors,awnings and parking lots,as well as limited not have dual uses capable of diversion from a secular to a religious purpose.unlike a teacher,a interpreter or even an overhead of which conceivably can be used to communicate secular and religious brick,gutter or bush unless burning can not be coopted to convey a religious message.
one form of aid under the program,we recognize,raises a more serious diversion question.two of the outdoor signs at issue allow the churches to display customized messages central united methodist sign includes a panel on which it may place letters to create a message,and john sign includes a digital display that the church may program to display a variety of messages.
even if we assume that central united and john will use their signs to display religious if we assume that the signs are divertible and will be diverted,see id.at,concurring in the judgment that does not justify enjoining the grants.if a city subsidizes a medium of communication on terms to a wide spectrum of speakers,the establishment clause does not bar a private group from using a medium to espouse its own message,even a religious message.see rosenberger,at.see also good news club,at.lamb chapel,at.widmar,at.so long as detroit provides the same support to every other speaker,no reasonable observer could attribute a religious message to the city any more than he could attribute messages conveyed by other downtown signs to the city.see good news club,at.rosenberger,at.lamb chapel,at.widmar,at.when the government endorses everything,it endorses nothing.
in this instance,detroit offered to reimburse any eligible applicants for the repair or replacement of their signs.the broad sweep of the program alleviates any mistaken impression that the city endorsed any one message and respects the critical difference between government speech endorsing religion,which the establishment clause forbids,and private speech endorsing religion,which the free speech and free exercise clauses protect.rosenberger,at.internal quotation marks omitted.by repairing and replacing central united and john signs,the city of detroit no more endorsed their messages than it did the message of any other grant recipient,be it the michigan opera theatre,the first independence bank or the detroit athletic club foundation.just as a reasonable observer would not view the state as endorsing the message of a religious publication when the state provides the paper on which the message is printed,see id.at,so too a reasonable observer would not view the city as endorsing the churches religious the bank promotion of certificates of it partially reimburses them for the medium on which the messages appear.see good news club,at.rosenberger,at.
any such diversion,moreover,makes up at most a de minimis part of the reimbursement grants distributed under the program.see mitchell,at,concurring in the judgment.the reimbursement grants distributed for john and central united signs make up less than one percent of the total allocation of aid under the program.id.at,concurring in the judgment.such evidence is too insignificant to affect the constitutional inquiry.id.at,concurring in the judgment.
fifth,a program may have the primary effect of advancing religion if it excessively entangles the government in religious affairs.see agostini,at.yet all agree that the agency monitoring extended only to ensuring that each applicant conceptual design conformed to the program guidelines and that the construction conformed to that design.the program did not require city officials to make judgments about the religious content of particular projects,nor did it impose a scheme of comprehensive,discriminating,and continuing state surveillance that required the city to stay enmeshed in the churches affairs on an ongoing basis.see lemon,at.
insisting that the program nonetheless has the primary effect of advancing religion,american atheists raises a series of questions about its operation.yet the answers to none of these questions show that the program crosses this forbidden line.
does it matter,first of all,that the churches received reimbursement from the city as a result of decisions by the agency rather than as a result of independent choices of private individuals zelman,at.no doubt,channeling aid through independent private choice as opposed to apportioning aid based on government one way to break the circuit between government and religion.id.at.see also rosenberger,at.souter,dissenting teen ranch,udow,cir.when aid reaches a religious organization through the independent decisions of private recipients,even if those recipients redirect it to religious activities,n o reasonable observer is likely to infer that the state itself is endorsing a religious practice or belief.witters,at,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment see zelman,at.
although private choice is one way to break the link between government and religion,it is not the only way.the court has sustained a number of neutral aid programs that distributed aid directly to religious filtering the aid through private the aid itself had no religious content and any actual diversion was de minimis.see,mitchell,at,concurring in the judgment comm.for pub.educ.religious liberty regan,d roemer,at.id.at.white,concurring in the judgment hunt mcnair,d bradfield roberts.see also good news club,at.rosenberger,at.here,the aid lacked religious content,was not actually diverted in a way that would lead a reasonable observer to impute religious endorsement to the city and was distributed on a neutral basis to a broad spectrum of recipients.the absence of private choice by itself does not undermine the program.
does it matter that the city directly provide the aid to pervasively sectarian institutions or that the aid took the form of cash reimbursements no on both fronts.
in some settings,the court has presumed that direct aid to a pervasively sectarian institution will inevitably result in government sponsored indoctrination because the institution is so subsumed in the religious mission that it is impossible to separate the religious from the secular and to channel aid only to the latter.hunt,at.see also meek pittenger,d,overruled by mitchell,at.plurality opinion id.at,concurring in the judgment.in other settings,the court has not indulged that presumption that an aid recipient is a church or other distinctly religious institution has not been controlling or even perceived as relevant in these other cases because other aspects of the program rebutted the presumption that any aid flowing to the institution invariably would result in proselytization.see mitchell,at,concurring in the judgment agostini,at.rosenberger,at.regan,at.
in recent years,six members of the court have questioned whether the religious nature of an aid recipient is helpful,or even appropriate,in evaluating neutral government aid programs under the establishment clause.four justices in mitchell rejected the notion that the establishment clause requires the exclusion of pervasively sectarian schools from otherwise permissible aid programs.at.plurality opinion.and although justice,joined by justice breyer,did not join the plurality opinion in mitchell,they concluded that proof of actual diversion of government aid for religious indoctrination,not the possibility that aid will be diverted,was needed to invalidate a program.id.at,concurring in the judgment.that was because presumptions of religious indoctrination,which at most point to probabilities,are typically unhelpful and normally inappropriate in evaluating neutral government aid programs.id.at.christian weaver,cir columbia union coll.oliver,cir.
yet no majority opinion of the court has overruled the pervasively sectarian doctrine,and that means we must follow it.see agostini,at.steele,at.in considering whether the three religious entities at issue must be excluded from the program because they are pervasively are churches after must ask whether the record rebuts the presumption they will use the aid to engage in proselytization.
in this case,as in mitchell,rosenberger,agostini and regan,there is ample reason to think that the distributed aid did not and will not result in activities.in addition to the neutrality of the program,the breadth of beneficiaries and the secular nature of the aid relevant factors under these four mechanics of the program ensured that the aid would go just to the approved uses.regan,at.not only did eligible recipients have to satisfy three levels of review verifying that the project conformed to the program guidelines and criteria,but they also had to finance of the project on their own at the outset and of the program by the end.whatever special dangers exist when a city makes money grants to religious recipients,which may spend the funds on whatever they wish,mitchell,at,concurring in the judgment,those dangers do not exist when a city releases funds for completed work on approved projects that the recipient initially finances on its own.
nor does it matter that,by providing funds for facade improvements,the agency may have freed up the recipients resources for other activities.the supreme court has repeatedly rejected the recurrent argument that all aid is forbidden because aid to one aspect of an institution frees it to spend its other resources on religious ends.hunt,at.see roemer,at.plurality opinion.on this record,indeed,the program may well have encouraged eligible participants,the churches included,to divert monetary resources away from their core missions,holding worship services,performing operas,selling certificates of deposit because they could reasonably conclude that the city offer was just offer that enticed them to commit resources to their buildings today that they might otherwise not have committed at all.either way,these carefully regulated reimbursements did not have the primary effect of advancing religion.
the form of the reimbursements rather than painting and does not invalidate the program.see regan,at.when a city reimburses a religious entity for specific items,what matters is not the form the reimbursement takes but the benefit it represents.see id.at.just as a state may reimburse a religious school for the costs incurred in providing state tests in cash payments,so a city may do the same in covering half of the costs of a program.
a downtown church,like a theater or a bank,reaps the same reward from repairs whether the city performs the work itself,using its own employees and equipment,whether it sends an independent contractor to do the work or whether it reimburses the church after the fact.id.at.d rawing a constitutional distinction,between services and services also might create puzzling,if not perverse,incentives.would we be better off if the city had sent government workers to each church,wearing uniforms identifying them as agents of the government and how would the city implement such a program if it wished,as in this case,to perform just half of the work would one group do half of the work before the other or would they work together this solution would not only be mightily inefficient,but it also would seem to create more perception risks than partially reimbursing each church after the fact for approved work performed by private contractors.rosenberger,at.
nor,contrary to the suggestion of some of the amici,does madison memorial and remonstrance against religious assessments support a rule banning any public assistance for religious buildings.see writings of james madison gaillard hunt ed everson,at.rutledge,dissenting see,am.jewish comm.br.at.the memorial responded to patrick henry proposal to tax all property owners and channel the proceeds to the christian denomination of each taxpayer choosing,and it required each recipient sect with a few exceptions to spend the money either to support a minister or teacher of the gospel or to provid e places of divine worship,everson,at.the very purpose of the proposal was to promote religion,and to use the coercive power of the state in doing so.see douglas laycock,the underlying unity of separation and neutrality,emory.henry proposal thus was the antithesis of neutrality,and by any measure of constitutionality it would have failed it was not neutral as between religion and irreligion its express purpose was to advance religion and its primary only to advance religion.reliance on the memorial here gives historical analogy a bad name.
the historical question posed today is not whether madison would have remonstrated against detroit is highly unlikely given that the memorial underscored,rather than undermined,the importance of government neutrality toward religion.see madison,supra,at.the better historical question is to imagine what madison and the ratifiers would have thought of the claimants position in this case that the bill of rights prevents detroit from extending its program to all owned by a bank,a theater,an opera,a group devoted to worshiping a deity,a group that denies the existence of a deity or a group agnostic about the existence of a deity.the establishment clause requires neutrality toward religion,not hostility.w e must be careful,in protecting the citizens of detroit against churches,to be sure that we do not inadvertently prohibit detroit from extending its general state law benefits to all its citizens without regard to their religious belief.everson,at.
do nyquist and tilton require us to invalidate this program no.although these decisions invalidated portions of government programs providing aid to construct,repair or maintain the buildings of religious schools,see nyquist,at.tilton richardson,d plurality opinion,they are at least two steps removed from this program.
in nyquist,the court struck down a grant program for secondary and primary schools in new york city.but all or practically all of the schools eligible for the grants were not merely religious they also were from the same denomination,at,which itself suggested a forbidden purpose.an essential point of that program,the court has since explained,was to provide support for religious schools.see zelman,at.see also mitchell,at.plurality opinion explaining that the narrow group of recipients in nyquist gave rise to serious concerns about whether the payments were truly neutral.the same can not be said of detroit program only of the aid distributed by the city went to reimbursement grants for religious organizations,and even that went to three distinct denominations.
nor was the nyquist program a grant limited to exterior,cosmetic repairs.it provided an array of ongoing basic services designed to sustain the schools operation the program paid up to of the cost of providing heat,light,water,ventilation and sanitary facilities cleaning,janitorial and custodial services snow removal necessary upkeep and renovation of buil
