ripplin shoals land company,llc rslc brought suit against the united states army corps of engineers the corps,requesting declaratory and injunctive relief.the district court dismissed rslc complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,stating that its prior orders in the separate but somewhat related case of arkansas nature alliance,united states army corps of engineers,wl filed,had preclusive effect and barred the instant action.we reverse and remand for further proceedings 
we accept as true all facts alleged in the complaint.rslc,the developer of landers island on the white river,desired improved access to enable development of the island for recreation and vacation homes.rslc applied to the corps for a permit to add to an already existing bridge.the corps issued a letter of permission lop to allow the proposed changes.after receiving the lop,rslc constructed the improved bridge and began developing a subdivision on landers island.thereafter,an environmental group,the arkansas nature alliance,sued the corps,challenging the lop issued to rslc,claiming a violation of the national environmental policy act nepa.arkansas nature alliance,united states army corps of engineers,wl filed.rslc moved to intervene.the district court allowed rslc to intervene,as the developers,for remedial issues and to participate in all further proceedings in which they had an interest.
in arkansas nature alliance,the district court found that the corps issuance of the lop to modify the existing bridge was not reasonable and ordered the corps to revoke it.the district court ordered the corps to address the original application under the full permit process regulation and nepa regulation,which requires the preparation of the proper environmental documents the district court also directed that the bridge be returned to its original dimensions.as intervenors,rslc filed a motion for clarification,asking whether an environmental impact statement eis was necessary in the permitting process.the district court entered an order specifically stating that the permitting process used by the corps was to include an eis.
rather than continue with its plans,rslc decided to withdraw its application to improve the already existing bridge,which was the subject of the arkansas nature alliance litigation.instead,rslc submitted a new application that described an entirely new span bridge design.rslc asked the corps to authorize the span bridge under the nationwide permit process nwp thereafter,rslc removed the improvements to the existing bridge and returned the structure to its original dimensions.
rslc submitted a new permit application to the corps,requesting approval for construction of a span bridge pursuant to nationwide permit for linear transportation crossings.before processing rslc new span bridge application,the corps sought relief under.b from the order in the arkansas nature alliance case,which required an eis for the prior bridge modifications.the district court denied the corps motion.
relying on the district court order regarding the corps rule b motion,the corps advised rslc that a nationwide permit could not be issued and that the project would require a full public interest review,including an eis to be prepared by a third party contractor selected by the corps at rslc expense.specifically,the corps stated a s directed by the court order,your request for a span bridge to lander island can not be issued through the corps of engineer nationwide permit program.the corps instructed rslc that it had days to respond to these requirements or its application would be withdrawn.
rslc objected to the corps approach,arguing that the corps regulations require a review of the span bridge application for eligibility under nwp apart from any prior consideration of the bridge application.further,rslc stated that because the corps had not made a final decision on the span bridge and,thus,had no administrative record,the arkansas nature alliance court had no jurisdiction to make decisions regarding the span bridge application.the corps then notified rslc of its final agency action on the pending span bridge application,stating your application has been officially withdrawn and the permitting evaluation process has been closed.rslc filed the instant action to compel the corps to proceed on its application for a span bridge under the nwp.the corps filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b.the district court granted the corps motion,stating that its prior orders in the arkansas nature alliance case barred the instant action under the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel.
ii.discussion 
rslc contends that the district court erred in dismissing its complaint pursuant to rule b,arguing that the district court prior decisions in arkansas nature alliance have no preclusive effect on rslc right to have its new permit application for a different project reviewed for verification under the nwp.rslc maintains that the arkansas nature alliance court had no jurisdiction to rule on future permit decisions by the corps based upon new applications.
moving to the merits of the case,rslc argues that,as a matter of law,the corps must review each incoming application for nwp verification,and in refusing to do so in this case,the corps violated its own regulations.rslc avers that the corps argument that it has discretion to deny any nationwide permit application is disingenuous.the district court relied on the corps discretionary argument,claiming that even if it were to reach the merits of rslc claims,the conclusion would be the same.however,the corps admitted that it was coerced by the district court to adopt its advisory opinion rather than rely on the information in the administrative record.in fact,in the corps letter to rslc regarding its decision on the span bridge,the corps stated that a s directed by the court order,your request for a span bridge can not be issued through the corps of engineer nationwide permit program.this statement illustrates that the corps never deferred to the discretion of the district engineer.for these reasons,rslc urges this court to reverse the judgment of the district court and remand this case for further proceedings.
the corps responds by stating that res judicata and collateral estoppel preclude rslc from the requirements necessary for approval of a corps permit regarding a bridge to landers island.moreover,the corps claims that the issuance of a nationwide permit is at the discretion of the district engineer,and he is authorized to set the same requirements as imposed by the district court.in the alternative,the corps maintains that even if res judicata and collateral estoppel did not apply,this lawsuit is unfounded.
the corps states that permit applicants are not entitled to a nationwide permit as a matter of right.as long as there is reason to believe that there is public dissent to the proposed project,the district engineer has the discretion to require the applicant to go through the individual permit application process further,the corps argues that it can rely on the prior order of the district court in exercising its discretion on whether a nationwide permit is appropriate.the corps claims that in this case,as was shown from the earlier lawsuit,there was public dissent against the project,not only because of the form of the bridge,but also because of the cumulative impacts of constructing a subdivision on a island in the middle of the white river.these concerns did not change between the end of the original lawsuit and the time rslc filed its application for a span bridge.the corps posits that regardless of what the district court said in its rule b ruling,the district engineer would have been negligent to ignore the possible cumulative impacts and public opinion against the bridge.in sum,the corps urges this court to affirm the district court dismissal of rslc action based on res judicata and collateral estoppel.
we review de novo the district court dismissal for failure to state a claim pursuant to rule b,taking all facts as alleged in the complaint as true.alpharma,pennfield oil,cir ferris,baker watts,ernst young,llp,cir.both res judicata and collateral estoppel have the impact of foreclosing future litigation based upon factors found to exist in past but related litigation.upon review,we find that neither the doctrines of res judicata nor collateral estoppel preclude rslc from pursuing its complaint against the corps.
res judicata 
rslc contends that res judicata does not bar its claim because its claim did not exist when the first suit was litigated.rslc submits that the corps could not have denied an application that did not exist thus,res judicata,or claim preclusion,can not apply.further,there were no claims presented in the previous litigation between rslc and the corps,and no claims between rslc and the corps were resolved in arkansas nature alliance.lastly,because rslc span bridge application was neither submitted to nor denied by the corps at the time of the first case,rslc had no opportunity to litigate the issue.in response,the corps states that res judicata applies to those in privity with the parties in the litigation.in the district court february,arkansas nature alliance decision,it allowed rslc predecessors in interest to intervene in the litigation and become subject to that decision and any future orders.when considering whether to proceed under the nwp for the span bridge,the corps sought clarification from the district court in its rule b motion,and the district court held,in effect,that an eis was required.the corps argues that it was representing the interests of rslc in filing its rule b motion.moreover,rslc filed a brief in support of the corps argument.thus,the corps posits that rslc had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the previous case.
res judicata applies to prevent repetitive suits involving the same cause of action.lundquist rice mem l,cir.final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the same parties from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action.id.there are three elements this court must consider to determine whether res judicata will bar a party from asserting a claim whether the prior judgment was entered by a court of competent jurisdiction whether the prior decision was a final judgment on the merits and whether the same cause of action and the same parties or their privies were involved in both cases.id.if the three elements are met,the parties are thereafter bound not only as to every matter which was offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand,but as to any other admissible matter which might have been offered for that purpose.id.quoting sunnen.however,res judicata does not apply to claims that did not exist when the first suit was filed.id.
we agree with rslc that res judicata does not act to bar its claims against the corps in the instant lawsuit.first,while the prior judgment in arkansas nature alliance was entered by a court of competent jurisdiction,the district court did not have the authority to issue what was,in essence,an advisory opinion on any separate future applications filed by rslc,rslc span bridge application.one kind of advisory opinion is an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.pub.water supply dist.city of kearney,cir internal quotations and citations omitted.article iii limits the federal courts to deciding cases and controversies and,thus,prohibits the district court from issuing advisory opinions.id.moreover,the controversy must be live when the court decides the issues.south dakota hazen,cir.here,when the corps sought what was essentially an advisory opinion when it filed its rule b motion,it sought clarification on an issue that was never before the district court in the arkansas nature alliance case,an entirely new span bridge.therefore,any opinion given by the district court was no more than advisory.
second,the prior decision in arkansas nature alliance was not a final decision on the merits of rslc span bridge application.in fact,rslc span bridge application did not exist at the time of the district court final decision on the merits.it is well settled that claim preclusion res judicata does not apply to claims that did not arise until after the first suit was filed.lundquist,at quoting baker group,burlington northern santa fe ry,cir emphasis in original.lastly,the same cause of action is not involved in both cases.the arkansas nature alliance case involved a cause of action by an environmental group against the corps for issuing the lop to rslc for improvements to an existing bridge.the district court held that those improvements were not reasonable and ordered rslc to return the existing bridge back to its original dimensions.the district court specifically stated,i order the corps and the individual defendant to address the original application under the full permit process regulations and nepa regulations,which require the preparation of the proper environmental documents,public notice,and hearing.emphasis added.rslc complied with that order.the instant case was brought by rslc to compel the corps to consider its new span bridge application under nwp.this span bridge application was submitted after,and as an alternative to,the bridge modifications addressed in the arkansas nature alliance case.consequently,the causes of action are different.because the same cause of action is not at issue in these two cases,we find that res judicata does not bar rslc from pursuing the instant cause of action against the corps.
collateral estoppel 
rslc asserts that collateral estoppel should not bar the instant action because the issues here are not identical to those in arkansas nature alliance.in fact,the district court did not specify the issue s it believed were being relitigated for purposes of applying collateral estoppel.further,the issues raised by the corps rule b motion in arkansas nature alliance are not identical to those issues in this case.at the time of the rule b motion,the corps had not determined the rslc span bridge permit issue,and no administrative record had been compiled.rslc argues that the corps was asking the arkansas nature alliance court to give an advisory opinion about a hypothetical future action.rslc states that the corps can not abdicate its substantive duty by asking a court for advice.in that same vein,rslc posits that district courts can not advise federal agencies,they can only review final agency actions.rslc also claims that it was not allowed a full and fair opportunity to be heard on the issues presented by this case no such review was possible at the time because there was no final agency action.
the corps responds by claiming that collateral estoppel prevents of issues actually litigated in a prior lawsuit.the corps states that even though rslc was not a named party in the arkansas nature alliance litigation,its interests were represented by the corps,and rslc was granted intervenor status.the arguments being made now by rslc are the same that were made in the corps rule b motion,that the plans have substantially changed and an individual permit,including an eis,should not be required.the requirement of an eis before the corps can authorize rslc to provide access to the island has been litigated and decided.
we apply the doctrine of collateral estoppel when the issue sought to be precluded is identical to the issue previously decided the prior action resulted in a final adjudication on the merits the party sought to be estopped was either a party or in privity with a party to the prior action and the party sought to be estopped was given a full and fair opportunity to be heard on the issue in the prior action.wellons,ibberson,cir citing arkla exploration texas oil gas,cir,cert.denied,d.in assessing this issue de novo,we address the analysis seriatim.
first,the issue sought to be precluded is not identical to the issue previously decided.the previous issue concerned rslc lop to improve the existing bridge.the current issue of rslc new span bridge application submitted to the corps was not before the district court in the arkansas nature alliance case.second,as stated above,the prior action did not result in a final adjudication on the merits of the instant action.the prior action resulted in a final adjudication on the merits of rslc lop to improve the already existing bridge but not as to the construction of a new span bridge.concerning the third factor,there is no dispute that rslc was a party in the arkansas nature alliance case because of its intervention.
lastly,rslc was not given a full and fair opportunity to be heard on the issue of its span bridge application in the prior action.the corps had neither approved nor rejected rslc span bridge application when it filed the rule b motion before the district court.and after the district court ruling on the rule b motion,the corps cited the district court as its reason for refusing to allow the span bridge application to proceed under the nwp.we decline to rely on the fact that the district engineer could have exercised his discretion and denied rslc permit,as argued by the corps and the district court,because the district engineer did not exercise his discretion in this case the permit was denied as a direct result of the district court advisory opinion.thus,rslc was not given a full and fair opportunity to litigate this issue before the district court.this case is unique and our holding does not establish any general right to litigate the corps decision to deny nwp authorization.the corps may yet deny rslc span bridge application for treatment under nwp,but,on this record,rslc is nonetheless entitled to having the corps decide the application on its own merits.
based on the foregoing de novo analysis,we conclude that the district court erred in granting the corps motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b.accordingly,we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
while i agree with the majority as to the corps interpretation of its regulations requiring it to evaluate all incoming applications for nwp eligibility,i respectfully dissent as this case is not ripe for judicial review at this juncture.i also dissent because the corps was within its authority to deny the nwp authorization and require an environmental impact statement eis,irrespective of the district court earlier decision in arkansas nature alliance,united states army corps of engineers,d,modified,d.
before reaching a decision as to the merits of rslc challenges to the district court opinion on res judicata and collateral estoppel grounds,we should determine whether we have jurisdiction.indeed,we have an obligation to raise jurisdictional issues sua sponte when there is an indication that jurisdiction is lacking.thomas basham,cir see also james neff kramper family farm partnership ibp,cir.rslc is essentially challenging the corps determination it must produce an eis.ripeness concerns inhere in challenges raised prior to a final determination of an applicant individual permit application.upon review,i conclude this case is not ripe for judicial review and we lack jurisdiction.see pub.water supply dist.city of kearney,cir concluding ripeness is a jurisdictional challenge.
where there is no final agency action,a claim in federal court challenging the agency action is not ripe for review.see lane united states dep t of,cir.the corps,in its motion to dismiss,claims t here is a reviewable agency action as evidenced by exhibits q,r,and s to the amended complaint.the documents to which the corps refers are letters informing rslc its application for nwp authorization is denied and how to proceed for an individual permit application.the documents also establish rslc failed to produce timely the information requested by the corps and,as a result,the corps considered rslc individual permit application withdrawn.the documents inform rslc if it wishes to submit the requested information,it can do so at a later date.these documents therefore constitute a denial without prejudice of rslc span bridge individual permit application 
a denial of an authorization under the nwp program is not the end of a permit application.rather,once a proposed project is denied under the nwp program,it is reviewed for authorization under the individual permit program.see c,f c.accordingly,a denial of an authorization under the nwp program does not conclusively determine the disputed issue and therefore can not constitute a final agency action ripe for judicial review.see lotz realty united states,inn of daphne united states,no,wl,at,unpublished see also indus.hwy.danielson,avella united states army corps of eng rs,wl,aff,cir both unpublished donnell united states,noting that no administrative appeal is authorized for use of discretionary authority to modify,suspend,or revoke an nwp.
the letter informing rslc its application for an individual permit had been withdrawn does not constitute a final agency action.district engineers will decide on all applications not later than days after receipt of a complete application,unless iv a timely submittal of information or comments is not received from the applicant.d iv.if timely submittal of requested information is not received,
t he applicant will be given a reasonable time,not to exceed days,to respond to requests of the district engineer.the district engineer may make such requests by certified letter and clearly inform the applicant that if he does not respond with the requested information or a justification why additional time is necessary,then his application will be considered withdrawn or a final decision will be made,whichever is appropriate.
id.d.in the instant case,the corps decided to consider rslc application withdrawn as opposed to making a final decision on the application.accordingly,no final decision was made on rslc application.this is made clear by the corps letter which states,t he period to respond to our request for additional information has expired,therefore,your application has been officially withdrawn and the permitting evaluation process has been closed.should you decide to submit the additional information required for a full public interest review please contact our office.
indeed,the denial of a permit application resulting from an applicant procedural default at the agency level is not properly reviewed by a federal court.see lotz realty.at.in a substantially similar case,a project authorized under the nwp program was cancelled due to a procedural defect for failure to provide the corps with requested cancellation deemed by the reviewing court to be a agency action.see inn of daphne,wl,at the cancellation was not a denial,but a termination because of plaintiff i t is clearly not a final agency decision in the first instance.
the public policy purposes underlying the ripeness doctrine should require us to conclude a denial of an authorization under the nwp program is not ripe for judicial review until the corps has made a final determination regarding the applicants individual permit.any other approach would allow applicants to adjudicate the merits of an application twice,once under the nwp program,and again under the individual permit program.the ripeness doctrine as it relates to agency actions was designed to avoid such a situation.see ass of home builders united states army corps of eng rs,t he notion that dischargers like the appellants nevertheless remain free to pursue an individual or general permit suggests a ripeness problem.i can not say rslc span bridge application would not be authorized under the individual permit program.indeed,the corps,although having significant discretion to require an eis even where no eis is otherwise required,has no discretion to deny an individual permit application unless the district engineer finds the project would be contrary to the public interest.a,b.neither the corps withdrawal of the application due to rslc failure to follow administrative procedures nor the denial of an nwp application constitute a final agency action.i must therefore conclude this case is not yet ripe for judicial review.
ii.corps authority 
in addition to the ripeness issue,i dissent from the majority as i believe the corps was within its authority to deny approval under the nwp program and to require an eis.i believe before we are called upon to address the res judicata and collateral estoppe
