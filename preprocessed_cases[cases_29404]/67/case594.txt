on june,dreamstreet contacted midcountry,challenging the propriety of the seller holdback agreement and threatening to sue.over four years later,dreamstreet made good on its threat.in a complaint filed on june,dreamstreet alleged that midcountry fraudulently induced it to enter into the seller holdback agreement,in violation of north carolina unfair and deceptive trade practices act udtpa.a subsequent amendment added a claim under the doctrine of constructive fraud.
the district court granted summary judgment to midcountry.dreamstreet udtpa claim,the court held,was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.and on the undisputed record facts,the court concluded,dreamstreet could not establish the necessary elements of a constructive fraud claim.we agree,and for the reasons given below,we affirm the district court decision.
at issue in this case is an agreement between two commercial entities dreamstreet,a real estate investment corporation and midcountry,a bank.the terms of that agreement are not contested.what is disputed is how the agreement came to be,and whether midcountry has lived up to its obligations to dreamstreet 
the case began when jason pittman,through his company dreamstreet investments,entered into a purchasing agreement to sell an unimproved lot to carl ingraham for.ingraham hoped to build a home on the property,and to fund his purchase,he applied for an loan from midcountry.an loan would allow ingraham to borrow the purchase price of the lot,and then,acting as his own general contractor,to make additional draws on the remaining loan amount to fund the construction of his home.
under midcountry underwriting standards,ingraham was required to make a of approximately to qualify for the loan.but ingraham was unable to meet this requirement,and so dreamstreet and midcountry entered into the seller holdback agreement the agreement at issue here.under the agreement,dreamstreet would forgo immediate receipt of of the purchase price of the lot.that money instead would be retained by midcountry,ensuring according to midcountry that there would be sufficient funds to complete construction of ingraham home.upon completion of the home,the money would be released to dreamstreet.
additional conditions of the agreement were memorialized in an email sent and signed by pittman on june,which the parties agree establishes the terms of their agreement.under those terms,the would not be disbursed to dreamstreet if ingraham defaulted on his midcountry loan or failed to complete construction on his home.specifically,the email stated i dreamstreet understand that the only reason the holdback would not be available was if ingraham was in default or unable to complete construction on the home and at that point midcountry would use those remaining funds to complete construction on the home.
after sending the june email,pittman contacted his attorney,his banker,and a real estate appraiser to discuss the seller holdback agreement because it did not sound right to him.pittman concluded that he would complete the transaction and sell the dreamstreet lot to ingraham only if ingraham provided him with a promissory note to cover the holdback,secured by a deed of trust on the property.on june,ingraham and dreamstreet executed a promissory note for,secured by a deed of trust,and closed on the sale of the lot.
a year later,shortly before the promissory note was due and after several unsuccessful attempts to contact midcountry,dreamstreet sent a lengthy email to midcountry demanding immediate return of what it now viewed as the improper holdback.according to the june,email,pittman had consulted with his attorney,and it was their view that the holdback actually had nothing to d o with ensuring the availability of funds for ingraham construction project,and never should have been held back in the first place.pittman promised to report midcountry to the north carolina banking commission and also to file a lawsuit against midcountry i have already paid my attorney to initiate this process,and w e will be sending out complaints via certified mail on the.id.
for over four years,dreamstreet failed to follow through on its threat.during that time,ingraham defaulted on his loan with midcountry.on february,midcountry notified ingraham that his mortgage loan had come due on september,that his failure to make payments on the loan in december and january and february had put him in default and that midcountry intended to commence foreclosure proceedings.at around the same time,on december,the county inspection department certified the construction on ingraham land as compliant with building and zoning regulations and on march,midcountry foreclosed on ingraham home.although dreamstreet promissory note against ingraham was secured by a deed of trust on the property,it appears that dreamstreet did not assert any security interest in connection with the foreclosure.
dreamstreet finally filed the promised suit against midcountry on june,alleging that midcountry fraudulently induced it to enter into the agreement and never intended to release the holdback,dreamstreet raised claims under north carolina unfair and deceptive trade practices act and for constructive fraud.midcountry moved for summary judgment.dreamstreet udtpa claim,it asserted,was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.and the constructive fraud claim failed,midcountry argued,because as a matter of law,dreamstreet could not show the required element of a fiduciary relationship between the parties.
the district court granted midcountry motion for summary judgment in an oral ruling.it agreed with midcountry that the statute of limitations barred the udtpa claim.on the constructive fraud claim,the district court assumed without deciding that there was a fiduciary relationship between midcountry and dreamstreet.but because ingraham defaulted on his loan,the court concluded,the agreement conditions on release of the holdback were not satisfied,and thus midcountry did not breach any fiduciary duty it may have owed to dreamstreet.dreamstreet timely appealed.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.durham horner,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if no material facts are disputed and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.henry purnell,cir.en banc.
dreamstreet first contention on appeal is that the district court erred in holding that its udtpa claim is.under north carolina law,udtpa claims are governed by a statute of limitations,and that limitations period begins to run when an alleged violation occurs.see stat.setting out limitations period hinson united fin.app.applying udtpa limitations period.and when,as in this case,a udtpa claim is based on alleged fraudulent conduct,then the violation occurs and the limitations clock starts running at the time that the fraud is discovered or should have been discovered with the exercise of reasonable diligence.rothmans tobacco,liggett,cir.citing wilson crab orchard dev.
the parties do not dispute this governing framework instead,they disagree as to whether dreamstreet discovered or should have discovered the fraud of which it complains more than four years before it filed suit on june.according to dreamstreet,the earliest date on which it could have discovered or been expected to discover midcountry alleged fraud was december,within the limitations period when ingraham received the certificate of compliance on his home.it was not until then,dreamstreet argues,that midcountry was required to make good on the agreement by releasing the holdback to dreamstreet,and thus not until then that dreamstreet could have known that midcountry did not intend to honor the agreement.
what that position fails to account for is the undisputed fact that on jun
