this suit,filed in federal district court by petra,a presbyterian church that caters to,charges the village of northbrook,a suburb of chicago,with violating the religious land use and institutionalized persons act of,et.so far as relates to this case,the act rluipa forbids a local government to impose or implement a land use regulation in a manner that either imposes a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person,including a religious assembly or institution,unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden is pursuant to a compelling governmental interest,or treats a religious assembly or institution on less than equal terms with a nonreligious assembly or institution,a,b.r eligious exercise is defined to include the use,building,or conversion of real property for the purpose of religious exercise.b.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the village.d.
in the spring of,petra discovered a property in northbrook containing a warehouse that it wanted to convert to a church and an office building that it wanted to use for classrooms.but the property was located in a part of northbrook that under the village then zoning ordinance adopted in was zoned industrial.membership organizations,such as community centers,youth centers,fraternal associations,and political clubs,were permitted in the zone,but not churches unless the village board of trustees was persuaded first to rezone the property to institutional buildings the only zone in which churches are permitted and then to issue a special permit allowing a church in the rezoned property.of the eleven applications for rezoning and permits under the ordinance made by churches,petra was the only one not granted.
in september of,when petra had not yet bought the property that it had its eye on,it submitted an informal request for rezoning and for a permit to the village board of trustees.the board conducted a preliminary review on the basis of which it made comments favorable to the proposal,but without ruling on it.petra then signed a contract to purchase the property for million but made the purchase contingent on its being permitted to use the warehouse as a church.petra also filed a formal application with the board for the necessary rezoning and permit.at a hearing on the application conducted by the village planning commission,which advises the board of trustees on matters,landowners in the industrial zone expressed opposition,and the commission recommended that petra application be denied.without taking a formal vote,the board of trustees directed its staff to prepare documents that would be consistent with denial of petra application.fearing the preclusive effect of a formal denial,petra withdrew its application.but then,remarkably,it went ahead and bought the warehouse,albeit at a reduced price of million,and began using it as a church.
rluipa had been enacted in,and it caused the village fathers to become concerned that the village zoning ordinance,by treating religious organizations less favorably than other membership organizations,might violate the less than equal terms provision of the new statute.the following year the board began a legislative process that resulted in the adoption of a revised ordinance in that banned all membership organizations not just churches from the industrial zone.existing organizations were grandfathered,but of course not petra,which had never received permission to operate a church in the zone.
shortly after the enactment of the new ordinance,the village sought an injunction in state court against petra.but it based its claim not on petra violating the zoning code but on petra violating the village building code.maybe the board of trustees was skittish about relying on an ordinance that might be challenged successfully under had already filed the present suit,which initially challenged just the ordinance.
the state court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting petra from using the indoor premises of the property for assembly purposes or occupying the indoor premises of the property in numbers exceeding persons total at one time limited to general business purposes for meetings,classes,choir practice,office and business use,and washroom use.the district judge interpreted the injunction as prevent ing petra from conducting worship services and limiting occupancy to persons at all other times.the preliminary injunction was issued in,and the following year the state court issued a permanent injunction to the same effect.
petra main argument is that it acquired a vested right to operate its warehouse as a church.a doctrine of illinois law allows in some circumstances a land use to continue after a zoning change that would ban it,lake shore associates healey,but only if the use was authorized by the zoning ordinance as it stood before the change,city of elgin all nations worship center,d,national advertising village of downers grove,d.and that is not the case here.anyway,no claim under state law is before us.the district court relinquished supplemental jurisdiction over petra illinois vested rights claim.petra argues that that was error,that though a state law claim it arises under federal law.the argument makes no sense.and anyway the judge did petra a favor by relinquishing jurisdiction over the state law claim,because if it were before us we would reject it on the merits,as a misreading of illinois law.
petra argues in the alternative for a federal vested rights doctrine on the basis of various provisions of the constitution,and on rluipa.the argument,peppered with mysterious references to a federal zoning law,is difficult to follow.as near as we can understand it,petra is claiming that when it bought the property it was reasonably relying on the invalidity of the ordinance,which arbitrarily treated religious membership organizations worse than other membership organizations,thus violating not only rluipa but also the clause of the first amendment,church of the lukumi babalu aye,city of hialeah,d.the less than equal terms provision of rluipa codifies that constitutional prohibition.midrash sephardi,town of surfside,cir.as a result of that reliance,petra contends that it obtained an indefeasible right to use the warehouse for a church even if the ordinance,which would forbid such use,is valid.
we can not find any basis,whether in cases or other conventional sources of law,or in good sense,for the proposition that the federal constitution forbids a state that has prevented a use of property by means of an invalid even an unconstitutional enactment to continue to prevent that use by means of a valid one.from the proposition that the village should not have discriminated in the industrial zone in favor of secular membership organizations it does not follow that when it eliminated the discrimination by banning all membership organizations from the zone,this entitled the victim of the discrimination to claim,by way of remedy,discrimination in its favor.so strange a rule of estoppel could hardly be thought an imperative of due process,especially since,although property rights are protected to a degree by the due process clauses of the constitution,the scope of those rights is determined by state law within broad limits that include the conditions under which a governmental act can render a property right indefeasible.crown media,gwinnett county,and cir coral springs street systems,city of sunrise,cir lakeview development city of south lake tahoe,cir.
and if there were such a rule of constitutional law vesting by estoppel,it would be inapplicable to this case.if the ordinance violated rluipa,as northbrook comes close to conceding,petra did have to comply with it.but that does mean that it acquired an immunity from all zoning regulation.it knew or should have known that northbrook could redo its ordinance to comply with the less than equal terms provision of rluipa in one of two ways by permitting religious organizations in the industrial zone,or by forbidding all membership organizations in the zone.petra could not reasonably assume that the village would choose the first option.and since it therefore did not reasona
