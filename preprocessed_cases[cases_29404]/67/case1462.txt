breanne bennett was injured while skiing at hidden valley,a downhill ski area owned by hidden valley golf and ski.she brought this negligence action against the corporation,and the jury decided in favor of the defendant.the district court ordered that judgment be entered accordingly,and bennett appeals.her appeal raises issues concerning some of the jury instructions and evidentiary rulings,as well as the denial of her motion for judgment as a matter of law and her claim that there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict.we affirm.
in the early morning of february,bennett went with two older male friends to hidden valley for a midnight ski session.at the time bennett was years old and a high school student.she had limited experience as a skier,all of which had been at hidden valley where she had skied once before and had snowboarded twice.
while bennett was skiing down a slope marked for intermediate difficulty,she fell at a spot which the parties have variously referred to as a bump,a ridge,a jump,a ramp,or a mogul.she was thrown about five feet forward and hit the ground limp.there was conflicting evidence as to whether she had hit a tree.both sides agree that the bump on the slope had not been intentionally created by hidden valley,but had formed as skiers and snow boarders cut across the slope and moved the snow.bennett claims injuries as a result of the accident,including brain damage and a diminished future earning capacity.
bennett sued hidden valley for compensatory and punitive damages under several theories of negligence,but the punitive damages claim was dismissed before trial.bennett alleged that hidden valley had been negligent in the design,maintenance,and staffing of its skiing facilities in the supervision of its customers so as to prevent or cure dangers created by such business invitees in providing its customers with unrestricted access to advanced and intermediate ski areas without assessing their ski aptitude,ability,or experience in permitting obstructions,including trees and jumps,to exist in the path of skiers at a time when it should have known that such obstructions posed a hazard or risk of injury in failing to warn of dangers and obstructions which it knew or reasonably should have known were present at its facilities and ski slopes and in failing to guard against,barricade,protect,or cushion known or reasonably knowable obstructions in the path of skiers upon its ski slopes.
hidden valley denied negligence and raised assumption of risk as a defense.it waived a defense of comparative fault,however,and agreed that there was no issue as to whether bennett had contractually released hidden valley from liability because she was a minor at the time of the accident.
the case proceeded to trial before a jury.bennett objected to a comment in hidden valley opening statement about her age and experience and moved for a mistrial.the court overruled the objection and denied the motion.bennett then presented witnesses who described the accident,as well as expert evidence,to prove hidden valley negligence and the extent of her injuries,including her diminished future earning capacity.after she rested,hidden valley put on evidence that it had exercised reasonable care and that the bump and trees on the slope were risks inherent in the sport of skiing,in support of its assumption of risk defense.hidden valley also introduced over objections a videotape,depicting a daytime view of the ski area at a time well after the accident,and bennett deposition testimony about her use of drugs.at the close of all evidence,bennett moved for a judgment as a matter of law,claiming that hidden valley had not established its affirmative defense of assumption of the risk.the district court denied the motion.in his closing argument,defense counsel asked the jury to draw an adverse inference from plaintiff failure to call two witnesses who her attorney in his opening had told the jury would be testifying about the extent of her brain injuries.the court overruled bennett objection,and the jury returned a verdict in favor of hidden valley.
bennett appeals on multiple grounds.she contends that instructions and misstated missouri law.the first was a verdict director which differed slightly from the missouri pattern instruction for premises liability,and the second dealt with hidden valley assumption of risk defense and directed the jury to find for it if the conditions bennett encountered were a risk inherent in the sport of skiing.bennett further argues that the district court should have granted her motion for judgment as a matter of law because hidden valley did not make out an assumption of risk defense.bennett also challenges many of the district court evidentiary rulings and its handling of prejudicial remarks in defense counsel opening statement and closing argument.finally,she argues that the verdict for hidden valley was against the weight of the evidence.
bennett argues that instructions and were erroneous.we review a court jury instructions for an abuse of discretion.united fire cas.historic preservation trust,cir.although our task is to determine whether the instructions fairly and adequately submitted the issues to the jury,we afford the district court broad discretion in choosing the form and language of the jury instructions.id.citation omitted quoting fed,greyhound leasing fin,cir.in this diversity case,missouri law applies to the substance of the instructions,while federal law governs our review of the discretion exercised in refusing or admitting such instructions.horstmyer black decker,cir.
instruction was the verdict director for hidden valley defense of implied primary assumption of risk.under missouri law,this defense relates to the initial issue of whether the defendant had a duty to protect the plaintiff from the risk of harm.sheppard ex rel.wilson midway sch.the defense applies where the parties have voluntarily entered a relationship in which the plaintiff assumes incidental risks.id.a plaintiff consent to assume the risk is implied from the act of electing to participate in the activity and a s to those risks,the defendant has no duty to protect the plaintiff.id.
instruction stated,your verdict must be for the defendant if you believe that the conditions that plaintiff encountered on defendant ski slope on the day of the occurrence were a risk inherent in the sport of skiing.bennett contends that the instruction misstated missouri law because it did not require the jury to find that she had knowledge of,and appreciated,the specific dangers causing her injury hidden valley argues on the other hand that under missouri law,a plaintiff assumes any risk inherent in a sport regardless of her actual knowledge of the risk.
in a diversity case such as this we must follow state law as announced by the highest court in the state.see erie tompkins.the supreme court of missouri has explained that a participant in sport accept s those hazards that reasonably inhere in the sport so far as they are obvious and usually incident to the game.perkins byrnes,it has thus prevented a spectator injured by a foul ball at a baseball game from proceeding beyond the summary judgment stage,for 
t his risk of being struck by a foul ball is a necessary and inherent part of the game it is assumed by the spectators because it remains after due care has been exercised and is not the result of negligence on the part of the baseball club.
anderson kansas city baseball club.whether the plaintiff had subjective knowledge of the risk of being injured by a foul ball was immaterial.see id.at.the risk assumed by a spectator was described in this way in a case preceding perkins 
the patron subjects himself to the dangers necessarily and usually incident to and inherent in the game.this does not mean that he assumes the risk of being injured by the proprietor negligence but that by voluntarily entering into the sport as a spectator he knowingly accepts the reasonable risks and hazards inherent in and incident to the game.
hudson kansas city baseball club.these cases show that the missouri supreme court has analyzed implied primary assumption of risk by focusing on whether the risk was incident to or inherent in the activity undertaken by the plaintiff,rather than on the plaintiff subjective knowledge of the risk.
the lower courts in missouri have generally taken the same approach.for example,injury to a professional hockey player was held not actionable because it was part of the game of professional hockey.mckichan louis hockey club,similarly,a golf spectator injured by a rock hidden in the grass assumed the risks ordinarily incident to watching such a match and to walking over the course.thompson sunset country club.falling and colliding with other skaters is not an extraordinary occurrence for those indulging in that form of exercise.one who skates assumes those risks chaney ex rel.chaney creten,quoting reay reorganization inv,see also martin buzan,p ersons participating in sports may be held to have consented,by their participation,to those injuries which are reasonably foreseeable consequences of participating in the competition.
hidden valley position is also supported by the law of california which has relevance because there,as in missouri,the rights and duties of skiers and proprietors of ski areas are still governed by the common law.by contrast,many states with a large ski industry have statutes codifying those rights and duties.see.ann.idaho code.in california a defendant has no legal duty to eliminate or protect a plaintiff against risks inherent in the sport itself.knight jewett,cal th,d.this rule does not depend on the particular plaintiff subjective knowledge or appreciation of the potential risk.even where the plaintiff,who falls while skiing over a mogul,is a total novice and lacks any knowledge of skiing whatsoever,the ski resort would not be liable for his or her injuries.id.at see also bear mountain ski resort,th,d,t here is no duty of care to protect a sports participant against risks of injury that are inherent in the sport itself.
bennett points to language in several missouri cases to support her position that hidden valley had to show she knew that she might encounter conditions like those existing on the night she was injured.she cites ross clouser,a case in which a third basemen was injured by a sliding baserunner,en banc reversing a judgment notwithstanding the verdict which had been granted on the basis that the plaintiff had assumed the risk.although the missouri supreme court said in ross that assumption of risk bars recovery when plaintiff comprehended the actual danger and intelligently acquiesced in it,id.at,the court appeared to be speaking about implied secondary assumption of risk ross also differs from the case before us in that it involved a question of liability between fellow participants in a church league softball game.id.at.far from adopting a theory like the one bennett advocates,the ross court quoted with approval the statement that a relevant factor in determining whether a player conduct gives rise to liability to a fellow player is whether the risk was one which inhere d in the game or was one outside the realm of reasonable anticipation.id.at quoting niemczyk burleson,overruled on other grounds,ross,at.
the cases cited by bennett from other missouri courts are similarly unpersuasive for the theory she advances.first,they are not internally consistent.compare,lewis snow creek,defendant needed only show that plaintiff injuries were the result of falling on ice,and that ice was a risk inherent in the sport of skiing,with id.plaintiff must be aware of the facts that create the danger and they must appreciate the danger itself sheppard,at d efendant is relieved from liability on the grounds that by participating in the sport,the plaintiff assumed the risk and the defendant never owed the plaintiff a duty to protect him from that risk,with id.at instruction must require a finding that plaintiff comprehended the actual danger and intelligently acquiesced in it second,the inherent risk rule is not incompatible with a knowledge requirement since the rule can be viewed as charging a plaintiff with knowledge of risks which inhere in an activity.see hudson,at t here is no other reasonable conclusion but that plaintiff was familiar with the ordinary risks and hazards inherent in and incident to the activity.page keeton et,prosser keeton on the law of torts,at page keeton,lawyer,ed.there are some things which are so far a matter of common knowledge that a denial of such knowledge simply is not to be believed.moreover,to the extent these lower court decisions might be inconsistent with the decisions of the missouri supreme court,the latter control.see erie,at.see also charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure,at ed in diversity action federal court must follow law announced by forum state highest court,unless there are very persuasive grounds for believing that the state highest court no longer would adhere to it.
we conclude that under missouri law,a voluntary skier assumes the risks inherent in or incidental to skiing,regardless of her subjective knowledge of those risks.this principle can also be put in terms of duty the proprietor of a ski area has no duty to protect a skier from those risks inherent in or incidental to skiing.implied primary assumption of risk does not of course relieve a defendant of liability for negligence,because inherent risks are not those created by a defendant negligence but rather by the nature of the activity itself.martin,at see also knight,at r isk posed by a ski resort negligence clearly is not a risk inherent in the sport.by directing the jury to find for hidden valley if it determined that the conditions on the ski slope at the time bennett was injured were inherent risks of skiing,instruction fairly and adequately submitted the issue to the jury.the district court therefore did not abuse its discretion by giving this charge.
resolution of this issue also affects bennett argument that the district court erred in denying her motion for a judgment as a matter of law at the close of the evidence.she had contended that because there was no evidence that she had knowledge of the risks which she encountered on the ski slope,hidden valley implied primary assumption of risk defense must fail.since such a showing was not required under missouri law and there was evidence sufficient to support an implied primary assumption of risk defense it was not error for the district court to deny bennett motion.see fletcher price chopper foods of trumann,cir denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law must be upheld if evidence is sufficient to support a jury verdict.
instruction was a verdict director adapted from the pattern missouri instruction on premises liability which added the words highlighted below 
your verdict must be for the plaintiff if you believe 
first,there was either 
a jump or ramp on defendant ski slope,or 
trees in the fall line of defendant ski slope,and as a result of either or both of those conditions,the ski slope was not reasonably safe for its intended purpose of skiing,and 
second,defendant knew or by using ordinary care could have known of this condition,and 
third,defendant failed to use ordinary care to remove the jump or to remove,barricade or cushion the trees,and 
fourth,as a direct result of such failure,plaintiff sustained damage.
unless you believe plaintiff is not entitled to recover by reason of instruction.
bennett argues that addition of this phrase to the pattern instruction erroneously suggested that proprietors of ski areas owe a different duty to customers than other businesses.
