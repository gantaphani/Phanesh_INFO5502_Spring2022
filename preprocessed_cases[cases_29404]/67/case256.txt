this case raises several questions of first impression for this circuit regarding the scope of the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia.the fsia provides the exclusive basis for acquiring subject matter jurisdiction over foreign states and their agencies and instrumentalities.id.under the statute,a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states,id,unless the case falls within one of the exceptions to immunity set out in.at issue here are the exceptions for actions arising out of a foreign state commercial or tortious activity,id.a,or involving rights in immovable property,id.a.the district court concluded that none of the exceptions applied.we affirm.
the relevant facts are not disputed.appellants,gabriel fagot rodriguez and angeles diaz rivera the fagots,own a house and surrounding property in san juan,puerto rico.in september,the fagots agreed to lease the property to hilda fournier and angelo greco fournier the fourniers for two years,at a rate of per month.although the fourniers were then the consul and of the republic of costa rica,they signed the lease in their individual capacities.the lease agreement provided that the fourniers were to use the property for residential purposes only and prohibited them from subleasing to third parties without the fagots prior written consent.
notwithstanding the restrictions in the lease agreement,the fourniers began to operate the costa rican consulate the consulate from the property.the fagots were unaware of their actions,however,and the fourniers remained on the property without conflict for most of the lease term.the trouble began in june of,a dispute over an air fourniers failed to pay the monthly rent.on june,the fagots notified the fourniers by letter that the lease was terminated effective immediately,and that the fourniers had to vacate the premises by july.the fagots also demanded that the fourniers pay them total rent due for the balance of the lease term 
two months passed,and the fourniers neither vacated the property,nor paid the requested amount.on august,the fagots sent another letter informing the fourniers that since a lease contract no longer exists that stipulates the rent to be paid for the use and enjoyment of the property,you will pay monthly,retroactively to july,the sum of,that is from the date you should have vacated the property.the letter specified that the new rental charge was to be paid for the months of july,august and september.
some time after mailing the august demand letter,the fagots learned that the fourniers had been operating the consulate from the property on september,last day of the original lease filed suit against the fourniers,the consulate,and the republic of costa rica costa rica,alleging breach of contract,personal injury,and damage to or loss of property.the complaint sought eviction as well as monetary damages.
the parties quickly filed a flurry of motions.the fagots sought immediate eviction.costa rica and the consulate rejoined with claims of sovereign immunity and inadequate service.in the meantime,the fourniers and the consulate remained on the property,still without paying rent.they finally vacated the property in october of,months after the fagots terminated the lease.
in december of,costa rica and the consulate moved for summary judgment on the ground that they were immune from suit under the fsia.the fagots responded that the case fell into the exceptions to immunity for actions involving rights in immovable property,or arising out of commercial or tortious activity by a foreign state.the district court initially concluded that none of those exceptions applied and entered summary judgment for costa rica.fagot rodriguez republic of costa rica.fagot rodriguez i the fagots moved for reconsideration and for additional discovery.the court granted their requests and vacated its judgment.eventually,the fagots filed their own motion for summary judgment on the question of jurisdiction under the fsia.this time,the court determined that the case could proceed under the commercial activity and tortious activity exceptions.fagot rodriguez republic of costa rica,d fagot rodriguez ii.after holding a hearing on the question of damages,it entered an order holding costa rica and the consulate jointly liable with the fourniers for of rent between august,and october.the court concluded that the not costa rica and the were liable for rent due prior to august,and for property damage and mental distress.fagot rodriguez republic of costa rica,d fagot rodriguez iii.the fagots again moved for reconsideration,arguing that costa rica and the consulate were jointly liable for all damages.again,the district court agreed to reconsider its judgment.however,instead of holding costa rica and the consulate liable for more damages,it reverted to its earlier view that none of the exceptions provided a basis for jurisdiction under the fsia,and dismissed the claims against costa rica and the consulate.fagot rodriguez republic of costa rica,d fagot rodriguez iv.this appeal followed.
we review de novo the district court conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction under the fsia.see honduras aircraft registry,gov t of honduras,cir conducting de novo review of fsia jurisdictional question export group reef,cir t he existence of subject matter jurisdiction under the fsia is a question of law subject to de novo review.irving united states,cir en banc applying plenary review to the question of jurisdiction over the united states government under the federal tort claims act.as noted,the fagots assert several bases for jurisdiction.first,they argue that costa rica can be held liable for of rent under the commercial activity exception,a,based on an implied lease contract created by the august,demand letter.second,they maintain that costa rica use of the property amounted to a trespass,thus supporting jurisdiction under the tortious activity exception,id.a.finally,the fagots argue that they can recover for nonpayment of rent or,in the alternative,damages for trespass under the exception for actions involving rights in immovable property,a.we address those claims in turn.
commercial activity 
under a,a foreign state is subject to jurisdiction in any case in which the action is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the united states by the foreign state.the term commercial activity encompasses both a regular course of commercial conduct and a particular commercial transaction or act.id.d.in assessing whether a certain transaction or course of conduct is commercial in character,courts must look to the nature of the activity rather than its purpose.id.thus,
the question is not whether the foreign government was acting with a profit motive or instead with the aim of fulfilling uniquely sovereign objectives.rather,the issue is whether the particular actions that the foreign state perform ed whatever the motive behind them were the type of actions by which a private party engages in trade and traffic or commerce.
of argentina weltover,d.
in order to qualify for the commercial activity exception,an action must be based upon commercial activity by the defendant foreign state.a.the supreme court has explained that a claim is based on those elements that,if proven,would entitle the plaintiff to relief under his theory of the case.saudi arabia nelson,d.here,the fagots seek damages for,inter alia,breach of contract.there is no dispute that contract formation is an essential element of that claim,and that entering into a contract for lease of property constitutes commercial activity.see,joseph office of the consulate general of nigeria,cir see also walter fuller aircraft sales,of the philippines,cir noting the commercial nature of the making or breaching of a contract.luke med.ctr.hellenic,cir noting that contracts for the purchase or sale of goods or services are presumptively commercial activities.the important question is whether costa rica in fact contracted with the fagots for use of the property.
in the district court,the parties argued extensively over whether costa rica was bound by the original lease agreement between the fourniers and the fagots.the fagots insisted that,although the fourniers signed the lease in their individual capacities,costa rica could be held liable under agency principles.they do not press that claim on appeal instead,the fagots argue that the events in the summer of gave rise to an implied lease contract between themselves and costa rica.
the fagots offer two versions of an implied contract theory.on the first theory,the august,demand that,in the absence of a lease agreement,the fourniers would be charged for each month they remained on the an offer for a lease,at a rate of.by remaining on the property,the argument goes,costa rica accepted the offer and created a contract implied in fact.
the fagots recognize that an contract requires a mutual intent to contract.nevertheless,they have not even attempted to show such mutual intent here.to begin with,the fagots have not less they intended to enter into a lease agreement with costa rica.the august demand letter was addressed to the fourniers,not costa rica.in the course of the proceedings before the district court,the fagots explained that at that particular point in time august,the fagots were unaware that costa rica and the consulate occupied the property.they argued that s uch lack of knowledge should not operate against them.that generalization is not helpful.on the issue of an contract,the fagots lack of knowledge about the involvement of costa rica undermines their claim that the demand letter was an offer to costa rica.
moreover,whatever the fagots intent,there is no suggestion in the record that costa rica agreed to pay the fagots per month for its use of the property.thus,even if we treat the fagots demand letter as an offer to costa rica,there is no evidence that costa rica accepted it.given the absence of any evidence showing a mutual intent to contract,we conclude that costa rica did not enter into an lease for the property.
the fagots second theory posits a contract implied in law,or quasi contract.they point out correctly that a quasi contract does not depend on the consent of the parties but is implied in law to prevent unjust enrichment of one party at the expense of another.however,the fagots have made no effort to apply the general principles of quasi contract to the facts of this case.their sole authority is international general electric concrete builders of puerto rico,in which the puerto rico supreme court found a contract implied in law where the plaintiff reasonably relied on the defendant assurance that it would pay for certain services.the court noted that it was immaterial that the defendant did not actually intend to pay for the services it was enough that the terms of the defendant correspondence were worthy of the trust of the plaintiff which had no reason to doubt of the good faith of the representation it was given.id.at.thus,the court concluded,because the defendant caused a legal situation upon which plaintiff relied,it can not assume now a conduct contradictory to the one which gained plaintiff trust.id.at citations omitted.
notwithstanding their reliance on concrete builders,the fagots did not attempt to show before the district court that costa rica conduct reasonably led them to believe that in rent per month would be forthcoming,such that costa rica should be estopped from resisting such payment.see id.at explaining that the defendant behavior must be the basis of the trust of the plaintiff who has acted in good faith and in a manner which would cause him prejudice if his trust was defrauded.the fagots only interaction with costa rica was through its agents,the fourniers,who refused to pay any rent after the dispute over the air conditioner in june of,and who stubbornly ignored the fagots repeated requests that they vacate the property.such actions would not reasonably inspire trust.
moreover,the fagots own conduct in the summer of belies any suggestion of detrimental reliance.the fagots instructed the fourniers to vacate the property by july.when the fourniers did not comply,the fagots mailed them a letter demanding for every month they remained on the property without a lease agreement.the fagots then learned that the fourniers had been operating the consulate from the property.roughly one month later,they filed suit against costa rica,the consulate,and the fourniers,alleging that the lease agreement was terminated in june of,and that the defendants had since been in adverse possession.their complaint sought,among other things,to evict the defendants from the property.
given the fagots repeated attempts to terminate their relationship with costa rica and the fourniers,they can not now be heard to argue that they were lulled into inaction by costa rica purported willingness to compensate them fully for its use of the property.accordingly,we conclude that there was no contract between costa rica and the fagots under the principles described in concrete builders.
tortious activity 
we turn,then,to the tortious activity exception to foreign sovereign immunity.section a removes sovereign immunity for actions in which 
money damages are sought against a foreign state for damage to or loss of property,occurring in the united states and caused by the tortious act or omission of that foreign state or of any official or employee of that foreign state while acting within the scope of his office or employment.
that exception extends only to torts it does not apply to any claim based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function regardless of whether the discretion be abused.a a.
here,the fagots seek damages for tortious trespass.they argue,first,that both costa rica and the fourniers were trespassing at least from july of date by which they had been instructed to they vacated the property in october of.second,they maintain that costa rica was trespassing on the property from the beginning of the lease period in september.in support of that more expansive claim,the fagots argue that the lease agreement prohibited the fourniers from subletting the property or using it for purposes that the consulate is a separate legal entity from the fourniers and,therefore,that costa rica through the consulate was trespassing on the property even when the fourniers were not.
we assume,without deciding,that the fagots have stated a claim for tortious trespass for the entire period of is,from september of until october of.we further assume that the fourniers were acting within the scope of their employment when they committed the alleged trespass.see a.we need not dwell on such questions because we conclude that the fagots trespass claims are based upon the exercise or performance of a discretionary function,id.a a,and therefore are outside the scope of a.
the discretionary function limitation set out in a a of the fsia is modeled on a similar exception to jurisdiction under the federal tort claims act ftca,a.see,at,reprinted in,hereafter house report.the latter statute has received extensive judicial treatment,and decisions construing its discretionary function exception are useful in applying the parallel provision in the fsia.the supreme court has crafted a test for determining whether a challenged government action is protected as discretionary under the ftca.the first question is whether the conduct in question is a matter of choice for the acting employee.berkovitz united states,d.if a federal statute,regulation or policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an employee to follow,then there is no room for choice and the discretionary function exception does not apply.id.
second,assuming that the challenged conduct involves an element of judgment,that judgment must be of the kind that the discretionary function exception was designed to shield.id.the purpose of the exception is to prevent judicial second guessing of legislative and administrative decisions grounded in social,economic and political policy through the medium of an action in tort.united states empresa de viacao aerea rio grandense varig airlines,d.thus,it protects only governmental actions and decisions based on considerations of public policy.berkovitz,at.citing dalehite united states.where there is room for policy judgment and decision there is discretion.
with respect to the first prong of the test,the fagots do not dispute that the fourniers had authority to set up a consulate in puerto rico,and that,generally speaking,that task involved an element of choice or judgment.however,they maintain that the particular choices the fourniers,to install the consulate on the property in violation of the terms of the lease agreement,and to remain on the property without paying rent after the lease was impermissible ones.in other words,although the fourniers authority was essentially discretionary,they acted outside that authority when they set up the consulate in violation of puerto rico and trespass law.
the fagots primary support for that argument is a treaty between the united states and costa rica,which provides that either country may establish consulates in the other,and may buy or lease land for that purpose in accordance with such conditions as may be prescribed by the laws of the receiving state.consular convention,rica,art.v,para.the fagots argue that it is axiomatic that the laws of puerto rico and the united states,as the receiving state,require the landowners consent for the use of property.under the treaty,therefore,the fourniers had no discretion to use the property in a manner proscribed by the lease agreement.
we note that it is unclear whether the phrase the laws of the receiving state is meant to refer to local puerto rican law as well as federal law.moreover,it is unlikely that the drafters of the treaty intended that every violation of local or federal law would translate into a breach of the treaty itself.we need not resolve those questions,however,because even if we adopt the fagots reading of the treaty,it does not follow that the fourniers actions were.
treaty or no treaty,the fourniers were bound to comply with united states law,both local and federal.the treaty does not impose any special obligations on foreign officials nor does it specifically prescribe a course of action for such officials to follow when setting up a consulate in the united states.berkovitz,at.a general obligation to avoid unlawful to everyone in the united hardly sufficient to remove all room for choice.see shansky united states,cir concluding that statements at a high level of generality do not satisfy berkovitz specific prescription requirement.a more specific directive is required before we can conclude that the fourniers conduct was in the sense that it was not the product of judgment or choice.berkovitz,at.
the fagots argument suffers from a still more basic flaw.although they acknowledge that the fourniers had discretionary authority in general,they maintain that the fourniers had no discretion to violate puerto rican or trespass law.the crux of their claim,therefore,is that the fourniers actions were because they were wrongful.
that argument conflates an abuse of discretion with an absence of discretion.the discretionary function exception explicitly extends to abuses of discretionary authority.see a a excepting claims based on the exercise of discretion regardless of whether the discretion be abused.the exercise of discretion could not be abused without negligence or a wrongful act.dalehite,at.accordingly,the fact that the fourniers actions may have been wrongful under puerto rican law governing landlord and tenant relationships can not,by itself,render those actions.
indeed,the fagots interpretation reads the discretionary function exception out of the statute entirely.as explained above,the exception functions as a limitation on the general rule that a foreign sovereign is susceptible to suit for the tortious acts of its employees.the only cases in which the exception can possibly apply are those in which a foreign sovereign or one of its agents or employees is accused of a wrongful,tortious act.thus,if a tortious act were,by definition,the discretionary functions exception would be a dead letter.see fagot rodriguez iv,d at noting that the fagots argument effectively means that costa rica,as a result of that innocuous clause in the treaty,may never enjoy sovereign immunity in any claim dealing with embassy property and real estate since any claim for money damages under the fsia would obviously be founded on a violation of the law.we reject such a reading of the statute,and conclude that the fourniers conduct was discretionary in the sense that it involved an element of judgment or choice.
we turn,therefore,to the second prong of the test,and ask whether the fourniers choices were the type that the discretionary function exception was designed to protect.as we have explained in the context of the ftca,the critical question here is whether the acts or omissions that form the basis of the suit are susceptible to a analysis or,put differently,whether some plausible policy justification could have undergirded the challenged conduct.shansky,at accord united states gaubert,d explaining that t he focus of the inquiry is not on the agent subjective intent in exercising the discretion,but on the nature of the actions taken and on whether they are susceptible to policy analysis.the fourniers decisions regarding the consulate satisfy that standard.the initial choices as to whether,where,and how to set up the consulate clearly implicated policy issues.see macarthur area citizens ass of peru,it is beyond serious question that establishing a chancery in the district of columbia to conduct foreign relations is a discretionary public policy decision and that this decision undergirds the specific acts which the association bewails.joseph,at,concluding that the acquisition and operation of a consular residence was a discretionary policy decision,but finding that tenants purely destructive acts including extensive damage to the property and the removal of fully grown trees,appliances,furniture,light fixtures,shutters and drapes can hardly be considered part of that policy decision.the same is true of the fourniers actions in the summer of,when they were confronted with early termination of the lease agreement and the fagots demand for monthly rent.as the district court explained 
a n evaluation of the range of alternatives available to the fourniers at the time of the june termination notice reveals that there were countervailing political and economic costs and benefits attendant to each course of action.perhaps costa rica and the consuls could have moved the consulate to a different building,increased their diplomatic relations budget,temporarily shut down the consulate or scrapped it altogether.however,the court can not sit in de novo review and select a lawful alternative that would have been superior.
fagot rodriguez iv,d at.
we agree,and hold that the fagots trespass claims are based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function.a a.as such,they are excluded from the exception to immunity for tortious activity.
immovable property 
the fagots contend that their claims fall within the exception to sovereign immunity for any case in which rights in immovable property situated in the united states are at issue.id.a.the district court disagreed,reasoning that the immovable property exception extends only to actions involving rights to actual possession or title.fagot rodriguez iv,d at.neither of those rights is at issue here none of the defendants has used or possessed the fagots property since october of,and they never challenged the fagots title.thus,the only right at stake is the fagots right to compensation for of rent or for trespass.like the district court,we conclude that purely compensatory rights,without more,are insufficient to sustain jurisdiction under the immovable property exception.
the legislative history to the fsia indicates that the immovable property exception was intended to codify existing international practice.see house report,supra,at.under that practice,a foreign sovereign generally was not immune from an action to obtain possession of or establish a property interest in immovable property located in the territory of the state exercising jurisd
