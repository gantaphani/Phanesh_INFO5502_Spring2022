the world agricultural forum waf planned a conference in louis in late may.the louis police department learned that prior waf conferences in boston,washington,and other cities had attracted violent protests instigated by small anarchist groups that infiltrated peaceful protesters,and that internet sites were exhorting activists to travel to louis to participate in a called biodevastation.the federal bureau of investigation briefed the police on the history of these violent demonstrations,the tactics violent protesters used in the past,and the likelihood that potentially violent protesters would stay illegally in unoccupied or condemned buildings.in response,the city adopted a building code violation enforcement plan to identify vacant and condemned buildings and to prevent their unlawful occupation.
on the morning of may,louis building inspector john macenulty and several louis police officers went to illinois avenue,a condemned building,and then to cherokee street,a building identified by macenulty as lacking an occupancy permit.at illinois,macenulty and the police forcibly entered,arrested five persons for occupying a condemned building,and searched the premises.the five were jailed for twenty hours,entered alford pleas to those charges,and were placed on probation.at cherokee,the police seized and allegedly damaged personal property of owner arthur friederichs but did not issue citations.these actions,and other police actions not at issue on this appeal,prompted protesters to sue the city and its mayor,the board of police commissioners,the building and zoning commission,inspector macenulty,the police chief,and several police officers.plaintiffs asserted a variety of federal claims under and pendent state law claims.the police chief and six officers appeal interlocutory orders denying them qualified immunity from the first amendment and fourth amendment damage claims of seven plaintiffs arising out of the entries,seizures,and arrests at illinois and the alleged damage to friederichs personal property at cherokee.other claims remain pending in the district court,and still other claims have been dismissed.

claims relating to the events at illinois 
the house at illinois was condemned as unsafe for occupancy in.owner daniel green appealed.the board of building appeals granted green sixty days to obtain permits and correct deficiencies,which he failed to do.in,green requested an additional hearing.the board again delayed demolition to give him time to obtain construction drawings and permits.in august,the city notified green that the building remained condemned and that any occupants were subject to arrest before inspector macenulty inspected illinois on may,he reviewed computer records that listed the property as condemned and had a condemned building order prepared and on hand.
on the morning of may,plaintiffs molly dupre and kelly meister were living at illinois with green permission,and trinity cross,joseph locey,and celeste verhelst were there as green overnight guests.green,who had moved next door,was not present but was keeping personal items at the house.inspector macenulty approached with several police officers and informed those inside that the building was illegally occupied and must be vacated.an occupant replied,with a vulgar epithet,we are not opening the door.the police forced open the door,removed and arrested the occupants,and searched the building,seizing a slingshot,a sign saying kill police,a bottle with a rag protruding,pvc pipes,a gasoline container,and two cans of flammable camper stove fuel.
entry,search,and arrest claims 
the five occupants asserted fourth amendment claims of unlawful arrest.the five and green asserted claims of unlawful entry,search,and seizure.inspector macenulty and the police officers filed separate motions for summary judgment,arguing they are entitled to qualified immunity from these damage claims.plaintiffs responded that they had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the premises,the warrantless entry and search violated their clearly established fourth amendment rights,and the arrests were unlawful.the district court dismissed all claims against inspector macenulty,concluding that his enforcement of a standing condemnation order based on probable cause is not violative of the fourth amendment,even if scheduled to benefit an ongoing police investigation.plaintiffs did not cross appeal this ruling indeed,they did not include the summary judgment memoranda relating to macenulty in the record on appeal.as this ruling is critical to our analysis of the fourth amendment claims against the police officers,it is now law of the case 
the district court granted the police officers qualified immunity from the claims of unlawful arrest because the officers had probable cause to believe that the five persons inside illinois were illegally occupying a condemned building.again,plaintiffs did not cross appeal that ruling,which was clearly correct however,the court denied the officers qualified immunity on the fourth amendment claims of unlawful entry,search,and seizure of property at illinois on the ground that,unlike inspector macenulty,their primary purpose was to search for evidence of crime,and no exigent circumstances such as severe disrepair justified entry without a search warrant.we disagree for two independent reasons.
first,the district court ruled that the condemnation order gave inspector macenulty authority to enter illinois without a warrant,a ruling plaintiffs do not challenge on appeal.if macenulty may enter without a warrant,he may also be accompanied by police officers,even officers who are also pursuing a criminal investigation,like the customs inspector in united states,d,citing scott united states,d.plaintiffs argue that the extraordinary manner of the officers warrantless entry requires a balancing analysis focused on the officers intent to arrest protesters and seize their property.but the unlawful arrest claims were dismissed because there was probable cause to believe plaintiffs were illegally occupying the building.subjective intentions play no role in ordinary,fourth amendment analysis.whren united states,d.
second,the district court took too narrow a view of the reasonableness,under the fourth amendment,of warrantless entries into condemned buildings.when a building has been condemned as unsafe for human occupation,it becomes,at least from the government perspective,an abandoned structure.public health and safety require that police officers,as well as building inspectors,have the right to access such structures at any time for a variety of evict illegal occupants,to seek out and seize contraband and hazardous substances that may be illegally hidden there,to eliminate dangerous conditions that might injure adventurous trespassers such as children,and to prepare the premises for safe demolition.though the parties failed to brief the issue,that this authority extends to police officers,as well as to code enforcement officials,is expressly confirmed by section of the building code of the city of louis,adopted in by city ordinance 
vacation of buildings duties of police penalty upon effecting condemnation of any building,structure or premises by the code official,it shall be unlawful for any person to enter or remain in or on such building,structure or premises it shall be the duty of the police to remove any person from such building,structure or premises so condemned and to prevent any person from entering same until such time as the police department shall have been notified in writing by the code official that such building is in compliance with this code.emphasis added 
plaintiffs argued,and the district court agreed,that it is at least a jury question whether plaintiffs had reasonable expectations of privacy giving them standing to assert these fourth amendment claims because they were green invited residents and guests and had no knowledge the building was condemned.but even if plaintiffs have standing to assert fourth amendment claims,their limited standing as illegal occupants did not outweigh the authority of the police to enter the premises,when consent to enter was refused,for the purpose of evicting occupants of a building condemned as unsafe for human occupancy whether warrantless entry in these circumstances is viewed as justified by exigent circumstances,see welsh wisconsin,d,or by the government interest in controlling condemned buildings in the interest of public health and safety,the actions of the officers in entering without a warrant to arrest the illegal occupants was not constitutionally unreasonable.
finally,plaintiffs cite no authority even suggesting,much less clearly establishing,that the police may not enter a condemned building to search for and seize contraband,evidence of crime,and items such as flammable liquids that should not be allowed to remain in an uninhabitable urban structure.new york burger,d.
for these reasons,the district court denial of qualified immunity from these fourth amendment claims is reversed.
first amendment claims 
these six plaintiffs allege that the police officers actions at illinois violated their first amendment right to protest because the building code violation enforcement plan was devised and executed as a prior restraint on protester activities.the district court denied the police officers qualified immunity on these claims,concluding that reasonable police officers should have known that selective and disproportionate use of police power to prevent the occurrence of a protest would violate clearly established first amendment rights,and that plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence that a person of ordinary firmness would be deterred by this state action.we disagree.
it is undisputed that protesting peaceably is protected speech.violent protest is not.see,naacp claiborne hardware,d violent conduct is beyond the pale of constitutional protection.plaintiffs were not engaged in protected protest activity on the morning of may.they were unlawfully occupying a condemned building in which they had improperly stored personal property,some of which could have been used in the future to engage in unprotected violent actions.plaintiffs claim,in general terms,that their protected right to protest was chilled by defendants prior restraint.but plaintiffs carefully avoid the question whether the police actions in question were aimed at deterring,and in fact chilled,only unprotected violent protest activity.this distinction,ignored by the district court,is obviously critical.
plaintiffs other than green were lawfully arrested for illegally occupying a condemned building,and their property was properly removed from that structure.in these circumstances,their first amendment claims fail for the same reason that the supreme court reversed a first amendment overbreadth decision in virginia hicks,d 
neither the basis for the trespass sanction nor its purpose has anything to do with the first amendment.punishing its violation by a person who wishes to engage in free speech no more implicates the first amendment than would the punishment of a person who has pursuant to lawful regulation been banned from a public park after vandalizing it,and who ignores the ban in order to take part in a political demonstration.here,as there,it is hicks nonexpressive conduct not his speech,for which he is punished as a trespasser.emphasis in original.
the district court itself,relying on williams city of carl junction,cir,concluded that because there was probable cause to enforce the housing ordinance,the plaintiffs could not succeed on a claim of selective enforcement under the first amendment with respect to proper code enforcement actions.this is a correct statement of the law of this circuit.see smithson aldrich,cir see also barnes wright,cir cited favorably in williams,at foster metro.airports comm n,cir.
the district court posited that a disproportionate police response was sufficient to raise a genuine first amendment issue of selective enforcement.neither the court nor plaintiffs on appeal cite any authority for the proposition that a policeman decision to enforce a traffic law or a provision of the housing code,for example,is unconstitutional if it can be shown that he has enforced that law in a selective manner,not to retaliate for the violator prior first amendment protected activity,but to chill future first amendment activity that the violator may be contemplating.we have found no federal appellate case granting or upholding first amendment relief on this ground.the theory was alluded to and rejected in reno committee,d,where the supreme court observed,the contention that a violation must be allowed to continue because it has been improperly selected is not powerfully appealing,but did not rule out the possibility of a rare case in which the alleged basis of discrimination is so outrageous that the foregoing considerations can be overcome.here,plaintiffs do not identify the disproportionate police response that rendered the police conduct at illinois so outrageous.the district court focused on the search of the premises and the seizure of plaintiffs property after they were arrested,but we conclude that this police conduct was objectively reasonable when dealing with the illegal occupants of a structure that has been condemned for occupancy.
at a minimum,it was not clearly established in that a police officer could be liable on a prior restraint theory for making arrests that were supported by probable cause and then conducting a reasonable search and seizure of a condemned building.for these reasons,the district court denial of qualified immunity from these first amendment claims is reversed.
trinity cross strip search claims 
paragraph of plaintiffs second amended complaint alleged that,when she was arrested,trinity cross was subject to an unlawful strip search,a violation of missouri statute,title xxxvii,section,pursuant to section t he individual defendants are liable for these state law violations.in her deposition,cross testified that an unidentified female police officer,while performing a search outside of illinois,lifted up cross shirt,exposing her bare breasts to those present,and pulled her pants down four inches below the top of her underwear.
in memoranda supporting their motion for summary judgment,defendants argued that i cross failed to show she was subjected to a strip search,and ii in any event,defendants are entitled to official immunity and protection under the public duty doctrine from these state law claims.plaintiffs memorandum in opposition likewise argued only the state law immunity issues.the district concluding that cross was arguably subjected to a strip the police officers qualified immunity from a fourth amendment claim that seemingly was not pleaded and clearly was not argued,and then denied defendants claims of immunity under state law without further discussion.
on appeal,defendants shift gears entirely,arguing that they are entitled to qualified immunity because cross presented no evidence that any of the defendants were directly involved in this strip search performed by an unnamed female officer.we decline to consider this issue because it is raised for the first time on appeal.we agree with defendants that,if the issue is properly raised,each defendant conduct must be independently assessed in considering a motion for summary judgment on grounds of qualified immunity because liability for damages for a federal constitutional tort is personal.wilson northcutt,cir see clark long,cir.here,cross testified that a female officer performed the search,and only one named defendant is a female officer who was present at illinois,so at least some of the officer defendants appear to be entitled to qualified immunity from this claim.but the issue must be considered in the first instance by the district court.
ii.claims relating to the events at cherokee 
after leaving illinois,inspector macenulty,accompanied by several police officers,went to nearby cherokee.acting on a project nuisance property form that cited major structural deficiencies and overcrowding,macenulty asked owner friederichs for consent to enter.friederichs asked if he could refuse.macenulty said that failure to consent would result in an immediate order to vacate.friederichs claims he consented only to macenulty entering and objected when police officers accompanied the inspector.inside,the police saw what they believed were instruments of crime associated with violent protests.they returned later with a search warrant and seized,among other items,lighter fluid,clay spikes,a box of nails,a fuel canister,computer equipment,a large doll resembling a police officer,gas masks,radios,a chain,a box of mirrors,climbing equipment,a pottery kiln,and clay.plaintiffs complaint alleged that the search of,seizing,and damaging this property violated friederichs first and fourth amendment rights.
in the district court,defendants moved for summary judgment on the grounds that consensual entry and inspection of property lacking a valid occupancy permit did not contravene the fourth amendment,and that the first amendment claim failed for lack of evidence of selective enforcement or chilling effect.plaintiffs responded that friederichs consent was involuntary,and that these enforcement actions were intended to chill and did in fact chill friederichs from exercising his first amendment right to protest by attending biodevastation.plaintiffs also challenged the validity of the project form and the search warrant.
the district court i granted inspector macenulty qualified immunity based upon friederichs consent to enter and inspect,ii denied the police officers qualified immunity from friederichs fourth amendment claims because consent to enter and the alleged property damage were disputed facts,and iii denied the police officers qualified immunity from friederichs first amendment claim because whether this police action constituted selective enforcement was also a genuine issue of disputed fact.
on appeal,defendants argue they are entitled to qualified immunity from friederichs fourth amendment claims because he presented no evidence that any named defendant damaged his property.this,too,is an issue we decline to consider because defendants did not raise it in the district court.our jurisdiction to review an interlocutory order denying immunity is limited to determining whether all of the conduct that the district court deemed sufficiently supported for purposes of summary judgment violated the plaintiff clearly established federal rights.walker city of pine bluff,cir emphasis added internal quotation omitted.defendants further argue they are entitled to qualified immunity from friederichs first amendment claim because no reasonable officer would have known that the entry and inspection of premises as part of enforcement of city ordinances would chill a person of ordinary firmness from engaging in constitutionally protected speech.however,the limited record on appeal supports the district court conclusion that there are genuine fact disputes regarding the validity of the project form,whether cherokee was beset with major structural deficiencies and overcrowding,and whether friederichs personal property was in fact ransacked and damaged and,if so,for what reason.accordingly,the interlocutory order denying qualified immunity on these first and fourth amendment claims must be affirmed.
iii.conclusion 
the order of the district court dated august,is affirmed in part and reversed in part,and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.in a separate order dated august,the court denied police chief joseph mokwa motion for qualified immunity from claims relating to the police actions at illinois and cherokee.that order was appealed,but the issue was not briefed and therefore we do not consider it.the district court may of course revisit this order on remand.
although i concur in the remainder of the opinion,i disagree with the majority holding in regard to the illinois property.
i.the district court correctly determined the police officers were not entitled to qualified immunity for their warrantless search of illinois.
under the doctrine,i am bound by the district court holding that inspector macenulty warrantless entry into illinois for purposes of an administrative search did not violate the fourth amendment.see first union bank pictet overseas trust,cir holding the doctrine applies to final decisions by the district court that have not been appealed.this holding is final because,at the plaintiffs request,the district court entered final judgment on their fourth amendment claim against inspector macenulty pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.and,although the plaintiffs initially sought to appeal this determination,the appeal was later voluntarily dismissed.therefore,i am bound by the district court holding.
the majority expresses little doubt it was correct.i disagree.except in industries,administrative searches are subject to the fourth amendment warrant requirement.michigan clifford,d michigan tyler,d marshall barlow,d camara municipal court of city and county of san francisco,d see city of seattle,d.thus,inspector macenulty was required to obtain an administrative warrant.
hroch city of omaha,cir,is inapposite.in hroch,the appellee had received a final notice of condemnation of his property and had sought to enjoin its demolition,which the state court denied.id.at.hroch argued his fourth amendment rights were violated when his buildings were demolished without a warrant.id.at.this court disagreed.id.at.in reaching its holding,the court expressly relied upon the completion of administrative proceedings and subsequent judicial review,as well as the diminished privacy interests in a commercial property.id.at see also freeman city of dallas,cir holding the warrantless demolition of vacant commercial property did not violate the fourth amendment where administrative condemnation proceedings were completed.
in contrast,green had not received a final notice of condemnation,and illinois was an occupied residence.indeed,in february,after the housing inspector found none of the structural problems that were the basis of the structural condemnation notice,green was granted a certificate of occupancy.although this certificate was revoked in august,and green was provided a list of minor repairs to be made,the notice merely stated a reinspection will be made in or about days to determine your progress in correcting these violations i f no progress is being made,the code official may condemn for occupancy.green then applied for,and received,a building permit in september,and commenced making the repairs.
thus,although the property might have remained technically condemned as of the date of the warrantless search,it is clear administrative proceedings were ongoing.inspector macenulty,therefore,needed an administrative warrant to enter the premises.see camara,at.holding administrative searches by a housing inspector require a warrant.
nonetheless,assuming,as i must,inspector macenulty could enter illinois without a warrant to conduct an administrative search,the majority relies upon united states,d,to conclude the police officers could accompany him to pursue a criminal investigation.
