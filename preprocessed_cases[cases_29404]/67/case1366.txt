the zoning board of adjustment of the city of des moines,iowa board,appeals from the order of the district court granting an injunction to uscoc of greater iowa,and directing the board to grant uscoc application for a conditional use permit to construct a monopole cellular tower at uscoc preferred location.we reverse and remand.
uscoc proposes to construct its tower on a leased square parcel at the back south end of a parking lot adjacent to a hardware store at university avenue in des moines.the tower as proposed implicates zoning ordinances in the municipal code of des moines in two respects.first,because the proposed tower would be feet tall,it exceeds the height limits for construction of communication towers and antennas in a residential district.see des moines,iowa,hereinafter it must therefore be situated on a lot of ten acres or more.because the property in question including the square parcel to be leased to uscoc is only about acres,the board must grant an exception before construction of the tower can be approved.see id.second,the proposed tower is required to be set back from the property line of any adjoining residentially zoned property a distance equal to the height of the tower and antenna,unless the tower is otherwise adequately screened from adjoining residential uses.id.the parcel abuts property to the south that is residentially zoned the waveland village condominium parking lot.because the tower,if constructed as proposed,in the center of the leased parcel,would be only twenty feet from the property line of the parking lot,and in the absence of proper screening,the board would have to grant a variance before construction could go forward see id.
after a hearing on september,and another on october,the board denied the requested conditional use permit for the proposed tower with a written decision and order.the board found that uscoc had not shown it was entitled to an exception from the requirement,that a variance from the setback requirement was needed because of inadequate screening,and that uscoc could not meet the requirements for a variance.uscoc brought an action in the district court challenging the board decision.the district court held a hearing and issued an order directing the board to grant uscoc a permit for the proposed tower.the board appeals.we review the district court decision de novo.
the telecommunications act of tca or act,under which the jurisdiction of the federal courts is invoked in this case,was intended by congress to foster competition among telecommunications providers,to improve the quality of their services,and to encourage the rollout of new technologies without delay.city of rancho palos verdes,cal.abrams,d.one of the means by which congress sought to accomplish these goals was reduction of the impediments imposed by local governments upon the installation of facilities for wireless communications,such as antenna towers.id.but in the act,congress specifically preserved the authority of local zoning boards over decisions regarding the placement,construction,and modification of personal wireless service facilities,subject to some limitations.c a among those limitations is a requirement that a decision like the one at issue here,denying permission to construct a cellular tower,be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.id.c b iii.the tca gives courts jurisdiction to review such orders.id.c b v.
the board first issue on appeal concerns the nature of our review.in its order rejecting the board decision,the district court wrote,this is not a general appeal of the board decision.rather,the question is whether the board decision was supported by substantial evidence.district court order of june,at.but the court then cited cases where district courts apparently determined that the burden was on the local zoning authorities to prove on review that their decisions were supported by substantial evidence.the board maintains that the district court erroneously shifts on appeal the burden of proof to the government.brief of appellant at.
notwithstanding the jargon found in the cases cited by the district court,it is not altogether clear to us that the court actually put any burden of proof on the board.rather,the court language suggests that,if anything,perhaps it placed a burden of production on the board.for example,the court found that the board failed to identify or point to substantial evidence justifying its decision.district court order of june,at.in any event,it seems to us that the burdens of production and persuasion are allocated and met or not well before either party sets foot in court.congress did not give the courts authority to hear a zoning case anew or to take new evidence,but only to review the written record for substantial evidence supporting the decision of the local authority.c b iii.the only burden on the parties by the time they get to court is to be correct on the law and to argue the facts and the law persuasively no additional proof is put on the record by either party.and to the extent that the true issue is whether the board has the burden on review to show that its decision is supported by substantial evidence or uscoc has the burden of showing the decision is not supported by substantial evidence,we think the latter,traditional standard is the proper one.
the procedural and judicial review scheme of c b resembles that governing many federal agency decisions and requires the exercise of deferential consideration by the reviewing courts.abrams,at.breyer,concurring.that is,we need only find substantial evidence supporting the decision in the record in order to affirm.the tca contains no language in the section providing for court review of local zoning decisions that would indicate that congress thought this traditional appellate standard for reviewing agency action would not apply indeed,the act invokes that very language.united states dep t of justice reporters comm.for freedom of the press,d unlike the review of other agency action that must be upheld if supported by substantial evidence and not arbitrary or capricious,the freedom of information act expressly places the burden on the agency to sustain its action and directs the district courts to determine the matter de novo.quoting the freedom of information act.uscoc has not persuaded us that court review of local zoning decisions regarding the construction of cellular towers compels anything other than the traditional burdens on appeal from federal agency action.we thus conclude that the burden is on the party seeking to overturn the board this case show that the decision is not supported by substantial evidence.in so holding,we find ourselves in agreement with a number of our sister circuits.see,united states cellular city of wichita falls,cir voicestream minneapolis,croix county,cir am.tower lp city of huntsville,cir see also southwestern bell mobile systems,todd,cir sprint spectrum willoth,cir united states cellular city of broken arrow,cir to the extent cellular suggests that it was the city burden to come forward with evidence concerning the feasibility of on this site,we disagree.citing local zoning ordinance as authority.but even if we are mistaken about the legal burdens,we conclude that the board decision is nevertheless supported by the requisite substantial evidence.
as we suggested above,substantial evidence is a term of art in review of agency action,and we see no reason to deviate from the conventional application of the phrase in this case.we agree with the seventh circuit that although it is unusual for a federal court to be reviewing the decision of a nonfederal agency,we are given no reason to suppose that the term substantial evidence in the telecommunications act bears a different meaning from the usual one.primeco pers.communications city of mequon,cir.noting that substantial evidence review was historically employed in appeals from jury verdicts,this court has recognized that significant deference to the is required.ashcroft,cir.u nder the substantial evidence standard we can not substitute our determination for that of the administrative just because we
