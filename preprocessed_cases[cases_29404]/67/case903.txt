the law of mineral rights in louisiana differs from that of common law states.in louisiana,these rights do not exist as a separate,perpetual estate in land,but can only be held separate from the surface land in the form of a mineral servitude the servitude gives its holder the right to enter the property and extract the minerals louisiana law has consistently recognized that a mineral servitude may expire,or prescribe,after years of while parties can not contract to extend the prescriptive period,they may shorten the term of the servitude 
louisiana act of created a special rule for prescription of mineral servitudes when the surface property is owned by the united states 
when land is acquired by conventional deed or contract,condemnation or expropriation proceedings by the united states of america,or any of its subdivisions or agencies from any person,firm,or corporation,and by the act of acquisition,order,or judgment,oil,gas or other minerals or royalties are reserved,or the land so acquired is by the act of acquisition conveyed subject to a prior sale or reservation of oil,gas,or other minerals or royalties,still in force and effect,the rights so reserved or previously sold shall be imprescriptible 
the current form of act extends this treatment of the united states to the state of louisiana and its subdivisions 
today we deal with the applicability of act to certain mineral servitudes on land now owned by the united states in vernon parish,louisiana.appellants sought declaratory relief and to quiet title in the servitudes when the united states began leasing mineral rights on this land the holders of the mineral servitudes appeal the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the united states,holding that act,as a matter of federal common law,can not be applied retroactively to prevent prescription of mineral servitudes when the united states obtained the surface estate before.the united states the district court grant of summary judgment applying act prospectively,rendering mineral servitudes imprescriptable if the united states obtained the surface estate after the adoption of act.we conclude that summary judgment was appropriately granted in both instances and affirm 
in gulf lumber company conveyed to fullerton mineral rights in a acre tract located in vernon parish,louisiana.this created a mineral servitude which was eventually transferred to burton industries burton.through a series of later mesne conveyances,appellants central pines land,tower minerals company,jack lawton,evelyn gay lawton duhon,linda lew lawton drost,d,s,t,and drost brame,acquired all of the rights of burton.
the parties have adopted the designations of three parcels of the land as groups a,b,and c.in four transactions between and,the forest service acquired the group a and b lands pursuant to the weeks forestry act the forest service,between and,granted to the army all of the group a and b lands for use as military training grounds.
burton acquired complete title to the group c lands in,thereby terminating the servitude with respect to these lands.burton sold those lands to the united states in a series of transactions between and.in each of these transactions,burton reserved mineral rights,creating a new mineral servitude.appellants are the successors in interest to these mineral rights in the group c lands.
between and,the united states,through condemnation,instituted a mineral moratorium which prevented the owners of the mineral servitude from entering portions of the group a and b lands and exercising their rights.this moratorium did not affect all of the lands burdened by the servitude,although exactly which lands were affected is disputed.in,in an attempt to clarify which lands were covered by the moratorium,the army and forest service divided the land into two areas of intensive use and limited use.all access was prohibited on intensive use land,which was used for artillery practice and as a bombing range.the limited use area was under the control of the forest service between and.
during the moratorium burton was paid a small fee in compensation on a per acre basis for the part of the servitude that was inaccessible for mineral operations.the moratorium was terminated on march.the last drilling on the servitude occurred in and was performed by pan american corporation pursuant to a lease with burton.burton last well was drilled in and was dry.
in,the bureau of land management began granting mineral leases allowing exploitation of minerals under group a and b lands.appellees texaco exploration production,sonat exploration,chesapeake operating,gerard,and union pacific resources are the current lessees of these mineral rights.appellants filed this suit seeking to quiet title to the mineral servitudes on the entirety of the group a,b,and c lands and a declaration that any leases granted by the united states were invalid.both parties moved for summary judgment.
the district court granted summary judgment to the government holding that act could not be applied retroactively to render the servitude,which still covered the group a and b lands,imprescriptible after determining that the louisiana law of prescription,with a prescriptive period,would apply,the district court held that there was no suspension of prescription by obstacle after the moratorium ended in.the district court also held that the moratorium,even when in effect,was not sufficient to suspend prescription because it did not cover all the land subject to the servitude.as a result,the prescriptive period had run,and the servitude on the group a and b lands,had prescribed for.the district court also granted summary judgment to appellants,holding that act could be applied prospectively to the group c servitude and that it was therefore imprescriptible.
we review the district court grant of summary judgement de novo 
we address first the issue of the applicability of act both retroactively and prospectively.we reach four distinct legal conclusions federal common law governs this decision act can not be borrowed as the rule of decision for application to transactions,because it is hostile to the interests of the united states in the operation of default legal rules in place at the time of contract,but it may be applied prospectively we will use residual louisiana law as the federal rule of decision for transfers and precisely because it is no longer hostile to a federal interest in application of default rules in place at the time of contract,act can be borrowed as the federal rule for the group c servitudes.we will explain each conclusion in turn.
the parties dispute whether the supreme court decisions in clearfield trust united and united states little lake misere land require application of federal common law to this case.we are persuaded that little lake controls and that federal common law must both govern the determination and supply the rule of decision.
when a federal court sits in diversity,erie requires the application of state substantive law absent a congressional grant of authority to fashion federal common law.this principle applies to other statutory grants of jurisdiction,such as f upon which the district court jurisdiction rested in this case,though in actual practice with less force.rejecting a narrow view of erie and the rules of decisions act the supreme court has held that even without an explicit statutory grant of authority,the fashioning of federal common law may still be appropriate when duties and rights of the united states are at issue after all the rules of decisions act itself ends with the qualifying phrase in cases where state laws apply.little lake recognized that federal common law governed when a transaction of the united states aris es from and bear s heavily upon a federal regulatory program.factual similarity between little lake and this case counsels us to pause and explore little lake in detail.
in little lake,the united states sued to quiet title in two adjacent parcels in cameron parish,louisiana that it acquired under the migratory bird conservation act both parcels were obtained by the united states before louisiana adopted act.while no mineral servitude existed before the government acquired these parcels,in both the act of sale and the judgment of condemnation,the seller,little lake misere,reserved mineral rights.
in the transactions at issue in little lake,the default prescriptive period of years was shortened by the terms of the reservation.the mineral servitudes were to continue 
as long after an initial period as oil,gas,sulphur,or other mineral is produced or so long thereafter as little lake shall conduct drilling or reworking operations thereon with no cessation of more than sixty days consecutively until production results and,if production results,so long as such mineral is produced 
furthermore,if the initial period ended and no production was occurring,or if operations subsequently ceased for more than days,it was provided that 
the right to mine,produce and market said oil,gas,sulphur or other mineral shall terminate and the complete fee title to said lands shall thereby become vested in the united states 
the result of this language was that after years had elapsed from the date of the transfer,any day period of would terminate the mineral servitude.
little lake misere argued that state law should apply and therefore that act rendered the mineral servitudes imprescriptible.this court agreed,basing our decision on a prior case involving act,united states nebo oil where we held that retroactive application of act did not violate,among other things,the contract clause of the constitution.the supreme court reversed,holding that federal law governed the decision and refusing to borrow act as the federal rule of decision because the court found it was hostile to the federal interests at stake 
the court held that application of federal common law was required under clearfield trust because the right of the united states to seek legal redress for duly authorized proprietary transactions is a federal right.the court explicitly noted that little lake involved the interpretation of a land acquisition agreement a explicitly authorized,though not precisely governed,by the migratory bird conservation act and b to which the united states is a party.
the parties in this case dispute whether or not there is such a federal right at issue.central pines argues that since the servitude in this case was not created by the land acquisition agreement,but rather by the deed between gulf lumber and fullerton,there is no federal right at issue.the government points out that central pines relies on the presence of the united states as a party to the acquisition in order to obtain the benefits of act but then denies that this participation by the united states as opposed to the united states being a party to the creation of the mineral servitude is relevant for the clearfield trust determination.
whether or not the united states bargained over the creation of the servitude,the acquisition subject to the existing servitude created a federal interest in the potential prescription of the mineral servitude conveyed by the deed via the rule of prescription in place at the time of contract this is evidenced by the bargaining over this mere expectancy,apparently invalid,whereby the vendor attempted to reserve it to himself rather than let it pass to the united states upon prescription for appellants misconceive the thrust of little lake.while the court stated that it was interpreting the land acquisition agreement the parties did not dispute the meaning of the terms of the agreement,but rather the application of act and its effect on the interests of the united states.the same is true parties do not dispute the meaning of the deed,but instead disagree over the application of act.
turning to the federal interest at stake in little lake,we find fundamental similarities.appellants insist that the federal right at issue in little lake was a contractual right of the united states.true,but a contractual right to what the term at issue in little lake in effect set the prescriptive period for the reserved mineral servitude.the government contract right was to obtain the mineral rights after the contractual prescriptive period had elapsed.similarly,in this case the government right is to obtain the mineral rights after the default prescriptive period has elapsed.this right,as in little lake,is arguably weaker because it arises from a default rule.
appellants urge us to find that little lake did not overrule our prior decision in nebo oil,and that nebo oil held that act may be retroactively applied to mineral servitudes such as these,where the united states was not a party to the creation of the servitude.however,nebo oil holds only that the mere hope or expectancy in the prescription of mineral rights is not protected by the contract clause of the constitution and that the retroactive application of act does not violate the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment or dispose of united states property in violation of article iv,section,clause nebo oil also does not hold that the rights protected by the contract clause are coextensive with those federal interests that a require application of federal common law under clearfield trust and b preclude the borrowing of state law as the rule of decision.the government does not claim that the contract clause prohibits act from being applied retroactively,presumably because our prior opinion in nebo oil would render such an argument meritless,but instead that clearfield trust and little lake foreclose application of act as a matter of federal common law.thus,we need not decide that nebo oil has been implicitly overruled by little lake en route to finding that act can not be applied retroactively to the servitudes at issue under little lake.
having determined that a federal rule of decision should be fashioned,we must decide whether to borrow state law.we have stated that 
b asic considerations of federalism,as embodied in the rules of decision s act,prompt us to begin with the premise that state law should supply the federal rule unless there is an expression of legislative intent to the contrary,or,failing that,a showing that state law conflicts significantly with any federal interests or policies present in this case.
refusing to apply state law is appropriate when national uniformity is required as well as when state law conflicts with federal interests the application of state law may in some instances so strongly conflict with federal interests that it can be rejected without further analysis however,if state law only arguably interferes with federal interests,then the state interests in application of its own rules must be weighed this allocation of what is national to the preemptive federal order and what is state to that domain is the implementing process for maintaining the symmetry of clearfield trust and erie.
again little lake bears most heavily on this analysis.in little lake,after determining that federal common law should govern the case,the court decided that louisiana law could not be borrowed as the rule of decision.noting that specific aberrant or hostile state rules do not provide appropriate standards for federal law,the court held that act a s applied to a consummated land transaction under a contract which specifically defined conditions for prolonging the vendor mineral reservation deprives the united states of contractual interests.
appellants focus upon the court repeated reliance on the contractual terms at issue in little lake to distinguish the facts of this case the deed in this case contains no specific mineral reservation and merely states that the united states takes subject to the servitude.the and transfers were subject to what appellants allege are invalid attempts by the vendor to reserve the interest in possible prescription of a mineral rights thus,none of the transfers contain specific contractual terms setting the duration of the servitude.in fact,they could not have such terms,because the united states was not contracting with the party that held the servitude.
the little lake court described the explicit contractual terms in that case in contradistinction to terms that are less detailed and specific.the court noted,in dicta,that without a contractual term setting out the conditions under which the united states would obtain the mineral rights,it might be said that the government acknowledged and intended to be bound by unforeseeable changes in state law.appellants claim that all three of the transactions are less detailed and specific than the terms in little lake.since the united states was not contracting with the party that held the mineral rights in these transactions,it could not explicitly bargain or contract for the termination of those rights 
nevertheless,there is a conflicting federal in obtaining the mineral rights via the default rule of prescription in place before act.appellants argue that there is no conflict because there is no independent federal interest in acquiring mineral rights by there were,then the laws of the remainder of the states,which allow for a separate perpetual mineral estate would be in conflict with this federal interest.this misconceives the problem,failing to address it at the proper level of abstraction the application of default legal rules in place at the time of contract.appellants putative parade of horribles about the invalidation of the property law of the states in which perpetual mineral estates are allowed is only a parade.
the federal interest here is arguably not as powerful as the federal right to enforce explicit contractual terms,which was present in little lake,and therefore this case invites balancing of state and federal interests to determine whether the state rule should apply an assessment,however,of the state interests in the retroactive application of act has already been performed by the supreme court in little lake.the main justification offered for act is that it was meant to facilitate federal land acquisitions by allowing vendors to retain their mineral rights indefinitely,as they could in other states the court noted that this justification has no bearing on retroactive application of act,because an acquisition can not be facilitated by a law not yet in existence the court also rejected the other justifications offered by the louisiana supreme court in its advisory opinion in leiter minerals,california subjecting federal mineral interests to louisiana mineral conservation laws and clarification of the taxability of the mineral interests held by private parties when the united states owned the surface land 
we believe that any state interest in the retroactive application of act does not outweigh the federal interest in this case.therefore the borrowing of state law as the federal rule of decision is here inappropriate.we now turn to the content of the federal rule of decision and conclude that,while we may not borrow current louisiana law in the form of act,residual louisiana law should provide the federal rule of decision for transactions.
the court in little lake concluded that although act could not provide the federal rule of decision,a decision of whether or not to choose louisiana law prescriptive period or to fashion a new rule of federal common law was unnecessary because the terms of the land acquisition contract controlled those express terms limited the length of the servitude.
in this case there are no express terms governing the prescription or termination of the servitude in the,or transfers.as a result,this court must decide whether to apply residual louisiana law or to fashion a different rule of federal common law.the nature of the federal interest we have identified requires the selection of residual louisiana law.just as the express terms of the contract determined the outcome of little lake,so should the default rule of prescription provided by louisiana law determine the outcome of this case.thus,a prescriptive period is the appropriate federal rule of decision.
the government the district court determination that act can be applied prospectively to transfers.the government position is that we should not borrow act as the federal rule of decision for the transfers under our clearfield trust analysis.both parties appear to accept that if the decision for application of act is federal,so is the decision for transfers.
an interest in the application of the legal rule can not be in conflict with the prospective application of act.after its adoption,act provides the background rule that the united states bargained under.without significant conflict between the application of state law and the federal interest asserted,state law should be borrowed as the rule of decision the only other federal interest on which the government could interest in adding funds to the been recognized by the court to be insufficient as a result,unless act is constitutionally infirm,it renders the servitudes on the group c lands,which were created after,imprescriptible.
the government argues that act unconstitutionally discriminates against the united states and therefore can not be applied retroactively or prospectively.the district court held that the doctrine of intergovernmental immunity posed no bar to the application of act.while we are sympathetic to the government argument,we are foreclosed from considering the constitutionality of act as discriminatory against the united states by our prior decision in united states little lake misere land this decision was reversed by the supreme court in little lake,but the court did not address our holding that act was not invalid as discriminatory against the united states 
it is in this circuit that one panel of this court may not overrule another while easily confused with traditional stare decisis,our rule that one panel can not overturn another serves a somewhat different purpose of institutional orderliness.this court stated in united states that i t is the practice of this circuit for panels to abide by a prior fifth circuit decision until the decision is overruled,expressly or implicitly,by either the united states supreme court or by the fifth circuit sitting en banc.kirk itself demonstrates that our panel opinion in little lake binds us on the issue of act alleged discrimination against the united states,despite its reversal by the supreme court in kirk,the defendant argued that a jury instruction,which had previously been approved by this court in united states rogers was improper.the decision in rogers,however,had been reversed by the supreme court on other grounds nevertheless,this court in kirk held that the decision of the rogers panel was still binding,because the supreme court had not explicitly or implicitly overruled our panel opinion 
having concluded that act can not be applied retroactively to the transfers of the group a and b lands,we must decide whether or not the servitudes affecting those lands have prescribed under the residual rule of louisiana law that allows prescription after years of.appellants argue that various acts of the united states operated to legally suspend prescription,such that the period has not run.we are persuaded that no obstacle existed after the moratorium ended in and that in any event an obstacle must cover the entirety of the land subject to the servitude before it can suspend prescription as a matter of louisiana law.we therefore affirm the district court holding that the servitudes on the group a and b lands have prescribed for.
appellants first claim that the doctrine of contra non valentum agere nulla cirrut should apply to suspend prescription when the owner of the servient estate impedes or hinders the servitude owner access to the servitude.the government argues that the controlling provisions of the mineral code formerly of the civil code govern the suspension of prescription by obstacle.
under louisiana law,an obstacle will suspend prescription if the servitude owner is prevented from using the servitude by an obstacle that he can neither prevent or remove.this is nearly identical to the corresponding provision of the civil code that governed until the adoption of the mineral code in the district court held,and we agree,that since a the mineral code of generally applies retroactively and b the two provisions are identical,the mineral code should be applied as the law of prescription in this case 
the louisiana supreme court has stated that statutory prescription is an example of the doctrine of contra non valentum nevertheless,appellants urge that the general louisiana law of contra non valentum be applied as an addition to the statutory and case law on prescription of mineral servitudes.this extension of contra non valentum is not supported by the case law cited by the appellants.in plaquemines parish commission council delta development plaquemines parish sued to regain title to mineral interests,arguing that they had been wrongfully expropriated by corrupt public officials.the defendants argued that those interests had prescribed under the period applicable to claims of breach of fiduciary duty.the court invoked contra non valentem because the defendants concealment prevented the plaintiffs from discovering their claim similarly,in nathan the defendants fraud and misrepresentation prevented plaintiff from discovering a cause of action for wrongful death.the louisiana supreme court applied contra non valentem on these facts the appellants present no evidence of fraud,concealment,or bad faith on the part of the government.delta development and nathan are therefore inapposite.
a look at even an abbreviated chronological account of the use of the servitude persuades us that it has prescribed.the last active drilling on the servitude land was in and was performed by pan american as a lessee of the servitude.the period of required for prescription of a mineral servitude can be interrupted when the holder of the mineral servitude,in good faith,engages in operations on the land these operations,however,must be more than mere p reparations for the commencement of actual drilling or mining operations,such as geological or geophysical exploration,surveying,clearing of a site,and the hauling and erection of materials and structures necessary to conduct operations it is undisputed that the appellants did not interrupt the prescriptive period by drilling at any time after.
an obstacle to the use of a servitude will suspend prescription since appellants present no evidence of use of the servitude since the only way they can prevail is by demonstrating that an obstacle created by the government denied them access to the servitude lands for a total length of time of approximately years from march,when pan american plugged its well to the filing of this lawsuit in 
the moratorium on entry to the lands comprising the fort polk artillery range most of the group b lands and of the group a lands ended on march.in the time since,neither appellants nor their predecessor,burton,engaged in any drilling,so they must show that there was some other obstacle that suspended the prescriptive period.appellants claim that after the moratorium was lifted the army instituted a de facto moratorium that prevented them from making use of the servitude,but do not offer sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment on this issue burton had notice of the end of the moratorium and the army allowed others to enter the lands for the purpose of performing geological surveys,including shell oil,which did so on the basis of a permit granted by burton.
there is also no evidence that burton or appellants drilled or even attempted to enter the servitude lands after the moratorium ended.nor did they request permission to do so from the army.shell oil shot seismic lines on the servitude lands under a permit from burton after the moratorium had ended.the record provides us with no evidence that,after the moratorium ended,the united states created an obstacle to use of the servitude lands.thus,we have no difficulty concluding that appellants failed to create a genuine issue of material fact on the question of obstacle.as a result,we find that the mineral servitude terminated by prescription at some time before.
even assuming that a de facto moratorium prevented the appellants from accessing the servitude after,appellants must still explain why a partial obstacle is sufficient to suspend prescription.the moratoriums both real and alleged indisputably did not cover all of the group a and b lands,but rather most of the group b lands and of the group a lands.all that remains is to determine louisiana law on partial obstacles and the suspension of prescription.
in hanszen cocke the louisiana court of appeals held that litigation over one portion of land subject to a mineral servitude did not suspend prescription of the servitude because other portions of it were still available for exploitation the litigation in that case is analogous to the alleged de facto moratorium in this case each forecloses operations on only a portion of the land burdened by the servitude.appellant replies that hanszen was incorrectly decided and we may refuse to follow an intermediate state appellate court when its decision does not represent the likely result in the state highest court 
this argument relies on a questionable reading of the louisiana supreme court decision in boddie drewett a case overruled ten years later in mire hawkins in boddie the court held that a drilling order of the department of conservation prohibiting drilling on the entirety of a acre tract of land subject to a mineral servitude constituted an obstacle that suspended prescription.the court refused to hold that the drilling of a dry hole in good faith outside the tract burdened by the servitude but inside the drilling unit constituted use that would interrupt the prescriptive period however,this was precisely the theory the court elected to adopt in mire,overruling boddie and declaring that the department of conservation drilling orders could not be obstacles that would suspend the prescriptive period however,operations anywhere within the drilling unit would be a use of the servitude thus interrupting prescription even if these operations were not on the tract subject to the servitude nothing in boddie or mire explicitly addresses whether or not a partial obstacle is sufficient to suspend prescription.
appellants,however,argue that one of the holdings of boddie is that a partial obstruction is sufficient to suspend prescription.this can be deduced,they believe,from the fact that the drilling order in boddie only affected certain sands geological formations at particular depths rather than all sands since the mire court reversed on other grounds that department of conservation orders can not be obstacles,appellants argue that this holding of boddie remains good law.
we disagree.the department of conservation order in boddie covered the only useful sand under the tract in question,meaning it was not a partial obstacle in any real sense.moreover,this partial obstacle argument is not addressed by the louisiana supreme court in boddie,and we will not question hanszen interpretation of louisiana law on this basis.thus,following hanszen,no obstacle sufficient to suspend prescription has ever existed over the group a and b lands.
lumber salling heirs,so.
see leiter minerals,california,so d,citing provisions of the louisiana civil code and case law recognizing the prescriptive period.the mineral code now governs prescription of mineral servitudes and retains the prescriptive period.
see leiter minerals,so d at if a servitude is established for years or less,it will remain in force for the time so stipulated regardless of whether it is used by the servitude owner.in such a case no question of prescription arises.
