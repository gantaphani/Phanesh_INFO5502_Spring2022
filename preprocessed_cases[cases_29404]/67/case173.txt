en banc opinion 
the en banc court has convened to consider a series of issues concerning the relative powers of the federal secretary of the interior,the state of rhode island,and the narragansett tribe over a parcel of land taken into trust and designated for indian housing.the case is in many ways a proxy for the state larger concerns about its sovereignty federal and tribal control over lands within the state.
in,the secretary of the interior agreed to take into unreserved trust for the tribe benefit a or parcel in charlestown,rhode island the parcel.gale norton cited her powers under section of the indian reorganization act of ira.the tribe had purchased the parcel in.
under the indian commerce clause of the constitution,const.art.i,cl,congress has plenary power to legislate on the subject of indian tribes.cotton petroleum new mexico,d.as a result,congress may preempt the operation of state law in indian country.see new mexico mescalero apache tribe,d.under section of the ira,congress has authorized the secretary in his discretion to acquire and take into trust for indian tribes any interest in lands within or without existing reservations for the purpose of providing land for indians.the secretary may take land into trust for these purposes,as was done here,without the consent of the state

w hen conduct involving only indians is at issue,state law is generally inapplicable,for the state regulatory interest is likely to be minimal and the federal interest in encouraging tribal is at its strongest.when,however,state interests outside the reservation are implicated,states sometimes may regulate the activities even of tribe members on tribal land 
nevada hicks,d citation omitted quoting white mountain apache tribe bracker,d.
recognizing a conflict between state jurisdiction and the federal interest in encouraging tribal,the secretary regulations under the ira provide that none of the laws of any state limiting,zoning or otherwise governing,regulating,or controlling the use or development of any real or personal property shall be applicable to land held in trust for a tribe by the united states.a.this provision is subject to the secretary power in specific cases or areas to make applicable those local laws determined to be in the best interest of the indian owners in achieving the highest and best use of the property.id.b.
concerned over the loss of sovereignty over the parcel and what it may portend for the future,the state,its governor,and the town of charlestown collectively,the state,sued the secretary of the interior,now dirk kempthorne,and the regional director of the bureau of indian affairs bia,franklin keel,in federal court.see carcieri norton,d.having exhausted administrative remedies,the state brought suit under the administrative procedure act,seeking review of the secretary decision to take the parcel into trust.id.at.
the state case asserts three major theories.first,the state argues that the ira does not authorize the secretary to take land into trust for any tribe,including the narragansetts,that first received federal recognition after june,the effective date of the ira.second,the state argues that the rhode island indian claims settlement act the settlement act,restricts the secretary authority to place the parcel into trust pursuant to the ira.third,the state argues that the constitution prohibits this exercise of authority by the secretary 
as to the ira,the state argues that the narragansetts do not meet the definition of indian contained in.the pertinent definition recognizes,inter alia,all persons of indian descent who are members of any recognized indian tribe now under federal jurisdiction.emphasis added.the state reads are members now under federal jurisdiction to plainly and literally mean the effective date of the ira.the state thus contends that the secretary has no authority under the ira to take land into trust for any tribe that was not federally recognized in.as a result,the state argues,the secretary is precluded entirely from placing the parcel into trust for the narragansetts,who were not recognized as a tribe until.
next,the state argues that the terms of the settlement act preclude the secretary from placing the parcel into trust because the settlement act is a later specific act of congress that must be read to have explicitly and implicitly cabined the tribe and the secretary power as to the parcel.the state argues that the settlement act bars the imposition of any trust.the state fallback position is that any trust must be restricted by the terms of the settlement act so that it is clear that state and local law apply to the parcel,just as they do to the settlement lands.
finally,the state asserts various constitutional theories,with the common underpinning that the placing of the parcel into trust violates the state sovereignty.the state argues that the indian commerce clause does not authorize the secretary exercise of power and that the exercise violates the tenth amendment,as well as the enclave and admissions clauses of the constitution.the state also argues that section of the ira,constitutes an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.
we hold that the language of does not plainly refer to the enactment date of the ira.we find that the text is sufficiently ambiguous in its use of the term now that the secretary has,under the chevron doctrine,authority to construe the act.we reject the state claim that we do not owe deference to the secretary interpretation because he has inconsistently interpreted or applied section.the state evidence of inconsistency is mixed and is not persuasive.the secretary position has not been inconsistent,much less arbitrary.the secretary interpretation is rational and not inconsistent with the statutory language or legislative history,and must be honored.
likewise,the settlement act neither explicitly bars by its terms the secretary actions,nor implicitly repeals or constrains the secretary authority under the ira to place land into trust for the tribe.while the state apparently failed to anticipate this particular problem at the time of the settlement,the settlement act did specifically contemplate the event of federal recognition of the tribe and did not restrict the secretary power,should the tribe be recognized,to take into trust land outside of the settlement lands.we are not free to reform the act.if aggrieved,the state must turn to congress.
the state arguments based on allocations of power under the constitution also do not prevail.they do,however,underscore the seriousness of the state concern about the abrogation of state sovereignty at stake here.
in order to understand the nature of the controversy and the consequences of this decision,a brief recounting of the history of relations between the state and the tribe is required.further background can be found in the district court opinion,carcieri,d,as well as the opinions previously issued in the disputes between the state and the tribe,see narragansett indian tribe rhode island narragansett iii,cir en banc narragansett indian tribe narragansett narragansett ii,cir rhode island narragansett indian tribe narragansett i,cir.
in,the state acquired the majority of the tribe lands.in,the tribe organized as a corporation.in,the tribe sued to recover its lands,arguing that the state had acquired the lands in violation of the indian nonintercourse act.the tribe claimed that this violation rendered void the transfer of title to the lands.
this cloud on title prompted the state to enter into settlement negotiations with the tribe,which led in to an agreement embodied in a joint memorandum of understanding jmou.under the jmou,the tribe would receive acres of settlement lands,half of which were provided by the state and half of which were purchased with federal funds.the state agreed to create an corporation to hold the settlement lands in trust for the tribe,to exempt the settlement lands from local taxation,and to help secure the federal legislation necessary to implement the agreement.in exchange,the tribe abandoned its claims of aboriginal title and its claims to lands in the state other than the settlement lands.
in turn,congress approved and codified the agreement in the settlement act.the settlement act provided that the settlement lands shall be subject to the civil and criminal laws and jurisdiction of the state of rhode island.id.a.
five years later,in,the secretary granted the tribe official federal recognition.see final determination for federal acknowledgment of narragansett indian tribe of rhode island.following that recognition,in,rhode island amended the pertinent state statute to permit the conveyance of the settlement lands directly to the tribe,explicitly preserving the state jurisdiction over the settlement lands,consistent with the settlement act,a.see laws b.the holding company conveyed the settlement lands to the tribe,and three years later,the tribe conveyed the settlement lands to the bia as trustee.the trust deed confirmed the application of state law to the settlement lands,as provided in a.the bia continues to hold the settlement lands in trust for the tribe,subject to this restriction that state law applies.see narragansett i,at.significantly,in our earlier en banc decision in narragansett iii,we held that the language of section a trumped any residual tribal sovereignty over the settlement lands,under which the tribe had refused to comply with certain state laws see at.
then,in,the tribal housing authority purchased the parcel in fee simple,acquiring title through purchase from a private developer.the parcel was part of the tribe aboriginal lands claimed in the lawsuit.under the settlement act,the tribe had thus relinquished aboriginal title to the parcel,but the parcel is not part of the acres of settlement lands.it is adjacent to the settlement lands,across a town road.in,the housing authority transferred the parcel to the tribe with a deed restriction that the parcel be placed in trust with the bia for the purpose of providing housing.
a dispute soon arose over whether development of the parcel had to comply with local law.the tribe began construction on the planned housing project without obtaining a building permit from the town or the state approval of the individual sewage disposal systems.the tribe essentially took the position that once it had purchased the parcel,the land had become tribal land,and the tribe inherent sovereignty meant that the parcel was exempt from local law.the state disagreed and filed suit in federal court to enjoin the tribe.see narragansett indian tribe narragansett.ultimately,the tribe lost that litigation see narragansett ii,at.
the tribe had sought to solve the issue of the applicability of state law to the parcel by applying to the secretary in to have the parcel taken into trust under section of the ira.the secretary determination of whether to do so was stayed pending the resolution of the federal court litigation.after the litigation was resolved against the tribe by this court in,id.at,the tribe submitted a second application to the secretary.
the tribe filed this updated application with the secretary in july.in determining whether to take lands into trust,the secretary follows a regulatory process set forth at part,which requires consideration of several factors.if,as here,the land is off reservation,additional criteria apply.see.generally,the farther from a reservation the land is,the greater the scrutiny the secretary gives to the justification of anticipated benefits from the acquisition.see id.e see also sheppard,taking indian land into trust.
on march,the bia notified the state of the secretary intent to take the parcel into trust for the tribe.the state appealed the decision to the interior board of indian appeals ibia.the state argued,inter alia,that the settlement act prohibited this action by the secretary,and that in taking the land into trust without the state consent,the secretary had acted unconstitutionally.the ibia affirmed the bia determination on june.town of charlestown area,bureau of indian affairs.it noted it had no jurisdiction over the claims of unconstitutionality id.at.
the state then instituted this action in federal court.the district court,in a comprehensive decision,rejected the state claims.see carcieri,d.a divided panel of this court affirmed.carcieri norton,cir.the en banc court granted rehearing and withdrew the panel opinion.
as described above and recounted in our en banc decision in narragansett iii,at,for several decades the relationship between the tribe and the state has been fraught with tension.
the state concerns in this case have to do with whether the particular project will conform with state and local law.the state also has concerns that once land is taken into trust,there will be very few mechanisms,other than negotiation with the tribe or appeal to the secretary authority under b,by which the state may secure compliance with state and local laws the state fears that the tribe will convert or otherwise use the parcel,or any future parcels that might be acquired and put into trust,for activities in which it normally would not be permitted to engage under state law.
there has been federal litigation between state officials and the tribe and its members over such activities.in,the tribe,seeking revenue,established on the settlement lands an indian smoke shop that sold cigarettes without purchasing state cigarette stamps or collecting sales taxes then paid to the state,as required by state law.the state police raided the smoke shop and initiated criminal prosecutions against tribe members.the tribe sought a declaratory judgment in federal court asserting that its control over the smoke shop was an inherent function of tribal sovereignty that survived the settlement act,despite the explicit language in section a.we rejected that claim en banc.narragansett iii,at.
standard of review 
technically,the claims at issue here are reviewed through the lens of an apa appeal under.our review of such an appeal is de novo as to the district court conclusions.see harvey veneman,cir.the underlying issues remaining in the case are statutory and constitutional.statutory issues are reviewed de novo by the courts,but subject to established principles of deference to the administering agency.id.constitutional claims are reviewed de novo.see cousins sec y of,cir en banc.
b.the indian reorganization act 
the state argues that the secretary lacks authority to place the parcel into trust under since,under the definition of indian in,that authority extends only to tribes that were both federally recognized and under f ederal jurisdiction on june,the effective date of the ira.
the state presents a series of cascading arguments.first,the state argues that the plain language of section is clear,and that under that plain language,the tribe status is measured as of.the state further argues that its interpretation of the statute is the only one consistent with the purposes and legislative history of the act.thus,the state argues that because the statute is unambiguous,deference to the secretary is unwarranted.in any event,the state argues that even if deference might have been warranted,the secretary current interpretation is not entitled to deference because it contradicts the secretary practice in the more than seventy years since the passage of the ira.
chevron analysis 
the secretary has offered an interpretation of the ira that permits trust acquisitions for tribes recognized and under federal jurisdiction at the time the request for a trust acquisition is made.a court reviewing an agency interpretation of a statute that it administers engages in a analysis.chevron,natural res.def.council,d.we must first consider whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.id.at.if congressional intent is clear,we must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.i f the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,however,we must consider whether the agency interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.
a whether section is ambiguous 
we begin our analysis with the statutory text.rucker lee holding,cir.the language at issue is that contained in,which provides 
the term indian as used in this act shall include all persons of indian descent who are members of any recognized indian tribe now under federal jurisdiction,and all persons who are descendants of such members who were,on june,residing within the present boundaries of any indian reservation,and shall further include all other persons of or more indian blood.
one might have an initial instinct to read the word now in the statute as the state does,to mean the date of enactment of the statute,june.congress certainly has used the word now in this way.see,montana kennedy,d interpreting the word now in a reenactment of an earlier act to refer to the initial date of enactment.
any such instinct quickly disappears upon further examination,however.this is not a case that can be resolved by looking to the plain meaning of the term now standing by itself.now means at the present time,but there is ambiguity as to whether to view the term now as operating at the moment congress enacted it or at the moment the secretary invokes it.indeed,congress sometimes uses the word now to refer to a time other than the moment of enactment.see difford sec y of health human,cir interpreting the word now in a disability benefits termination provision to refer to the time of the hearing see also pierce pierce,iowa noting that the phrase now hav ing jurisdiction in the uniform child custody jurisdiction act refers to the time of the filing of the petition williams ragland,so d,declining to interpret now serving in a mandatory judicial retirement provision to refer to the date of enactment.there also are other layers of ambiguity.
given that the word now does not itself have a clear meaning,we must look to context.here,the context is equivocal.on the one hand,the state points to,another provision of the ira,which refers to positions maintained,now or hereafter,by the indian office.the state argues that this use of now unambiguously refers to the date of enactment and that had congress wanted to include tribes in section,it would have similarly added the words or hereafter.
on the other hand,the secretary points out that section itself specifies the date of june,as the relevant date for determining eligibility based on residing within the present boundaries of any indian reservation.the secretary thus counters that had congress wanted to require recognition of a tribe on the date of enactment,it would have specified that date,rather than using the term now.see also requiring elections to be held within one year after june.hence,now might mean now or hereafter or it might mean june,either would be consistent with some other part of the statute.
policy does not provide an obvious answer either each side has a plausible explanation that policy considerations favor its interpretation.the state argues that the principal,perhaps exclusive,concern of the statute was with remedying the perceived ills of the prior practice of allotment.see kahawaiolaa norton,d.because the ira ended allotments in,see,they would not have affected tribes,and hence there would have been no reason to include such tribes within the ambit of the statute.
the secretary takes the view that the act was intended not only to remedy past wrongs,but also to set a template for the future that would encourage the strength and stability of tribal communities.based on this view,it would make no sense to distinguish among tribes based on the happenstance of their federal recognition status in.the secretary view is buttressed by the fact that the act contains a number of provisions that have nothing to do with land consolidation.see id.indian employment preference id.tribal organization.
the state reads united states john,d,to indicate that the supreme court had an initial interpretation of the act that coincides with the state interpretation.it is unclear if the court had any such interpretation,and in any event,we find that john is not controlling here.in john,the fifth circuit had found that the mississippi choctaws were not eligible for benefits under the ira because the tribe had not been recognized in.united states john,cir see also united states.tax comm n,cir.the supreme court reversed,relying on a different clause in the statute and finding the tribe eligible for benefits under the ira,but on the basis that its members were persons of or more indian blood.at.
along the way,the supreme court stated 
the act defined indians not only as all persons of indian descent who are members of any recognized in tribe now under federal jurisdiction,and their descendants who then were residing on any indian reservation,but also as all other persons of or more indian blood.
id.alteration in original quoting.the bracketed addition may be read to support the state position,but the opinion contains no analysis on this point,and the court rested its holding on an entirely separate provision of the act,one not at issue here.we are mindful that the supreme court musings may warrant our attention.see rossiter potter,cir but see leval,judging under the constitution dicta about dicta.in this case,however,given john complete lack of analysis of the provision that concerns us,the relevant language seems to us to fall short even of being dicta.
having found both text and context to be ambiguous,we turn to legislative history.despite the state arguments to the contrary,that history also does not clearly resolve the issue.indeed,it suggests a reading of the phrase now under federal jurisdiction different from that offered by any of the parties,and is thus another source of ambiguity.
the congressional record establishes that the phrase now under federal jurisdiction was specifically added to the statutory definition of indian,a term defined separately from tribe.see.the phrase was suggested by of indian affairs john collier in response to the concern that not all indians deserved to benefit from the act 
the chairman.but the thing about it is this,senator i think you have to sooner or later eliminate those indians who are at the present i said the other day,you have a tribe of indians here,for instance in northern california,several tribes there.they are no more indians than you or i,perhaps.i mean they are white people essentially.and yet they are under the supervision of the government of the united states,and there is no reason for it at all,in my judgment.their lands ought to be turned over to them in severalty and divided up and let them go ahead and operate their own property in their own way.
senator.if i may suggest,that could be handled by some separate provision excluding from the benefits of the act certain types,but must have a general definition.
commissioner collier.would this not meet your thought,senator after the words recognized indian tribe in line insert now under federal jurisdiction that would limit the act to the indians now under federal jurisdiction,except that other indians of more than indian blood would get help.
to grant to indians living under federal tutelage the freedom to organize for purposes of local and economic enterprise hearing on and before the comm.on indian affairs,cong.
commissioner collier offered the phrase as a limitation,but it is not clear whether it was intended as a temporal limitation.if the committee was concerned about the bona fides of an individual status as an indian and wanted to use the fact of federal jurisdiction to measure those bona fides,then there would have been no reason to distinguish between those under federal jurisdiction in and those who later came under federal jurisdiction.in fact,the colloquy quoted above suggests that the committee sought to exclude some indians already under the supervision of the government of the united states.if the purpose was to exclude those who might later be dropped from federal jurisdiction,it would make more sense to measure status as of the date benefits were sought,not as of the date of enactment of the statute.
indeed,the colloquy and the remainder of the hearing suggest that the committee was focused on the issue of individual indians who received benefits from the federal government on the basis of a limited heritage and without acting as a part of a tribal community.earlier in the session,the chairman had raised the case of a former vice president of the united states,who was apparently receiving indian benefits,asking,why should the government of the united states be managing the property of a lot of indians who are practically white and hold office and do everything else,but in order to evade taxes or in order to do something else they come in under the government supervision and control id.at.
thus,although none of the parties have raised this,it may well be that the phrase now under federal jurisdiction was intended to modify not recognized indian tribe,but rather all persons of indian descent.so interpreted,the purpose of the phrase might well have been to grandfather in those individuals already receiving federal benefits,but to otherwise insist that in the future,only individuals with at least indian blood would qualify.in that case,the limitation may well have been a temporal one,but the limitation,temporal or not,may have been intended to affect only the secretary authority to act for the benefit of an individual indian,not an indian tribe.see title to any lands or rights acquired pursuant to this act shall be taken in the name of the united states in trust for the indian tribe or individual indian for which the land is acquired emphasis added.after all,while congress may have been concerned about misdirecting resources to individuals who were only indians in name,the same concern would not apply to federally recognized tribes,regardless of the date of federal recognition.in any event,this piece of legislative history amply supports the view that the statute is at least ambiguous and leaves room for administrative interpretation.
the other relevant piece of legislative history,heavily relied upon by the state,is the statement of representative edgar howard,a cosponsor of the ira 
for purposes of this act,the definitional section defines the persons who shall be classed as indian.in essence,it recognizes the status quo of the present reservation indians and further includes all other persons of indian blood.the latter provision is intended to prevent persons of less than indian blood who are already enrolled members of a tribe or descendants of such members living on a reservation from claiming financial and other benefits of the act.obviously the line must be drawn somewhere 
kahawaiolaa,d at emphasis omitted quoting congressional debate on bill in iii the american indian and the united states internal quotation marks omitted.
the state interprets the reference to status quo as supporting its view that federal recognition of tribes was essentially frozen for purposes of the ira in.this seems to be a misinterpretation of the quote,however.representative howard did not say that the act would maintain or preserve the status quo rather he stated that the act would recognize it.moreover,the quote refers not to indian tribes,but to reservation indians.thus,in context,this sentence is more likely a reference to that portion of the definition of an indian,not at issue here,that covers all persons who are descendants of such members who were,on june,residing within the present boundaries of any indian reservation.this provision,with its explicit reference to,covered those people of indian descent then living on a reservation,without regard to whether they might independently qualify as indians under the act.in that sense,the definition accepted and recognized the status quo of the reservations.
thus,we find from the text,context,and legislative history that section is at least ambiguous as to whether the phrase now under federal jurisdiction disqualifies tribes that were federally recognized after,such as the narragansett tribe,from the benefits of the ira 
b whether the secretary interpretation is permissible 
as we have found the meaning of section to be ambiguous,we must consider whether the secretary interpretation is permissible.chevron,at.an interpretation is permissible if it is rational and consistent with the statute.nlrb united food commercial workers union,local,d.the secretary construction meets this test.as discussed above,it is reasonable and is consistent with the language and legislative history of the ira.it also is consistent with the policy of the ira,which,as we have indicated,may permissibly be viewed not only as intending to reverse the government allotment policy,but also as affirmatively conferring benefits on indians,including indian employment preferences and a statutory right to organize and adopt governing documents.
we therefore reject the state argument that the text and purposes of the ira prohibit the secretary interpretation of section.rather,we find that the secretary construction of section as allowing trust acquisitions for tribes that are recognized and under federal jurisdiction at the time of the trust application is entitled to deference.
alleged inconsistency of the secretary interpretation 
the state makes a separate argument on which it heavily relies.it argues that the secretary interpretation of section to allow trust acquisitions for tribes not federally recognized in represents a change in position as to the eligibility of tribes for ira benefits,and that this interpretation therefore is not entitled to deference.the state relies particularly on historical practice,and says that the secretary has never,or at least has hardly ever,identified as a tribal entity that was not federally recognized in and does not meet the test.the evidence is limited with respect to whether the secretary interpretation of section of the ira has been consistent over the past years 
the consistency of the secretary construction is supported,though not directly,by a regulation promulgated by the secretary in.the regulation,found at,sets forth definitions that pertain to the regulations governing trust acquisitions.b defines a tribe that may be eligible for a trust acquisition as any indian tribe,band,nation,pueblo,community,rancheria,colony,or other group of indians which is recognized by the secretary as eligible for the special programs and services from the bureau of indian affairs.the regulation does not distinguish between tribes recognized before june,and those recognized thereafter.rather,it suggests that whether or not a group of indians is considered a tribe,and therefore may be eligible to have land taken into trust,turns on a tribe federal recognition status at the time a trust acquisition is requested.
moreover,the secretary proffered interpretation of now as meaning today is consistent with regulations implementing other provisions of the ira for example,the regulation implementing,which directs the secretary to regulate the operation and management of indian forestry units,states that it applies to any indian tribe which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the united states to indians because of their status as indians.similarly,the regulation implementing,which allows eligible indian tribes to organize and adopt constitutions and bylaws,defines eligibility in current terms all indian entities that have not voted to exclude themselves from the ira and that are included,or are eligible to be included,among those tribes recognized and receiving services from the bia are eligible to organize under section.
as to the secretary trust acquisition practice,it is not seriously disputed that the secretary has never rejected an application to take land into trust for a federally recognized tribe on the ground that the tribe was not recognized and under federal jurisdiction in.responding to the state allegations about whose trust acquisition applications have been granted,the secretary and indian amici have submitted to us lists of tribes that they assert were not federally recognized in for whom land has since been taken into trust.the state disputes this evidence,arguing that nearly all of the identified tribes either have no trust lands,are not newly recognized because they were under federal jurisdiction in,or have obtained legislation from congress specifically permitting trust acquisitions on their behalf.
the state evidence of inconsistent practice is not persuasive.for example,although the state seems to concede that the miccosukee tribe was not recognized in,it argues that the later trust acquisition for that tribe identified by indian amici was made pursuant to specific statutory authorization,not section.but the statute to which the state points us,does not itself authorize acquisition of the parcel identified by indian amici.rather,it authorizes acquisition of a different parcel.indeed,in taking the parcel identified by indian amici into trust,the secretary explicitly relied on his authority under section.
turning to a different distinction,the state argues that eight of the tribes identified by indian amici were recognized and under federal jurisdiction in because they previously had signed treaties with the united states.it is not that simply because a tribe had signed a treaty with the government it necessarily was recognized and under federal jurisdiction in recognition as intended in section requires an ongoing relationship between a tribe and the united states.see cohen handbook of federal indian law,at newton et,eds.
whether or not a treaty executed before has significance,however,the evidence is still that the secretary has taken land into trust for tribes that did not appear to be federally recognized in.we note two examples.the secretary has taken land into trust for the sault marie band of chippewa indians despite the secretary position that,regardless of prior treaties,the band was not federally recognized in.the sault marie band is a successor to some of the chippewa tribes that had signed treaties with the united states between and.in addition,in the band had signed two treaties with the united states.despite those treaties,however,by the department of the interior did not recognize the band as an entity with which it had relations.opinion of indian gaming comm n,the ignace parcel at july,see also city of sault marie andrus,indicating that a period of existed by stating that although the question of whether some groups qualified as indian tribes for purposes of ira benefits might have been unclear in,that fact does not preclude the secretary from subsequently determining that a given tribe deserved recognition in.the state rejoins that the department of the interior can not abrogate an indian treaty.but the validity of the department treatment of the sault marie band status under the treaties is not the issue before us.what is important is the department position that the band was not recognized and under federal jurisdiction in.id.at.nevertheless,after,the secretary has invoked his section authority to take land into trust for the band.
the grand traverse band of ottawa and chippewa indians provides a similar example.the secretary has taken land into trust for the grand traverse band,which the department of the interior ceased to recognize in.the grand traverse band signed the treaty of detroit with the united states.in,however,the of the interior severed the united states relationship with the band and ceased to treat the band as a federally recognized tribe.grand traverse band of ottawa chippewa indians attorney for the dist.of,cir see also grand traverse band of ottawa chippewa indians attorney for the dist.of,d,between and,the band continually sought to regain its status as a federally recognized tribe.yet,the secretary has invoked his authority under section to take parcels of land into trust for the band 
the state also concedes that the secretary appears to have taken land into trust for two tribes,the indian tribe and the narragansetts themselves,that were not under federal jurisdiction in and for whom congress has passed no specific act authorizing trust acquisitions.even if we had no reason to doubt the state argument that the secretary has not historically taken land into trust for tribes not recognized in,however,in at least some cases the secretary has not looked to the status of the tribe in or to the specific statutory authority identified by the state in making the determination to take land into trust.in baker muskogee area,for example,the ibia,in concluding that particular members of the cherokee nation of oklahoma were eligible to have land taken into trust,did not rely on the oklahoma indian welfare act,which authorized the secretary to take land into trust for indians in oklahoma.rather,the ibia stated that the indians c a me within the ira definition because they are members of a recognized indian tribe under federal jurisdiction.at.the secretary thus seems to have intended to exercise his section authority to take land into trust on the basis of current federal recognition.
the state has not met its burden of showing inconsistent interpretation by the secretary.moreover,even if the state had shown that the secretary has changed his interpretation of section over time,that would not necessarily resolve the matter in the state favor.the chevron doctrine permits the secretary some ability to alter his interpretation over time.see cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,d under chevron,an agency should have flexibility to vary its interpretation of a statute over time.the secretary has given a reasoned explanation for his interpretation.
we reject the state argument that the secretary has been inconsistent in his interpretation of section and is therefore not entitled to deference.
c.the settlement act 
the state next attack is to argue that the settlement act repealed the secretary trust authority as to all lands in rhode island.alternatively,the state argues that the settlement act at least curtailed that authority so that any trust must preserve the state civil and criminal jurisdiction over the parcel.
there is simply nothing in the text of the settlement act,however,that accomplishes such a repeal or curtailment of the secretary trust authority.a provides 
except as otherwise provided in this act,the settlement lands shall be subject to the civil and criminal laws and jurisdiction of the state of rhode island.
emphasis added.the state would have us read the act as if section a applied to all lands the tribe might ever acquire,either directly or as the beneficiary of a trust,but that is not what the section says.by its terms,section a applies state law only to the acres of settlement lands.the parcel is not part of the settlement lands.no other provision of the settlement act directly provides for state jurisdiction outside of the settlement lands.no language in the act applies state law to lands the tribe might later acquire.more importantly,no language explicitly curtails,or even references,the secretary power under the ira to take lands into trust and thereby to create indian country 
the state argument thus depends on finding that the settlement act implicitly repealed the ira,at least in part the framework for evaluating such a claim of implicit repeal was set out by the supreme court in morton mancari,d.first,we must look to affirmative manifestations of congressional intent to repeal the prior act,mindful of the cardinal rule that repeals by implication are not favored.id.at.omission in original quoting posadas city bank of.internal quotation marks omitted.in the absence of some affirmative showing of an intention to repeal,the only permissible justification for finding a repeal by implication is that the earlier and later statutes are irreconcilable.id.at.such a conflict is not lightly to be found.a bsent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary,we must give effect to both acts if possible.id.at.quoting united states borden.internal quotation marks omitted.
a determination of congressional intent must be rooted in the text of the act.nothing in the act explicitly curtails the secretary trust authority.the state offers two different lines of argument as to why provisions of the act must be read to restrict that authority.one concerns how the act affects the tribe rights the other concerns how the act affects the secretary authority.the provisions of the settlement act cited by the state,however,are most naturally read as merely resolving the claims that had clouded the titles of so much land in rhode island and that had led to the settlement embodied in the act.
as to the provisions affecting the tribe,the state relies independently on the extinguishment of aboriginal title in a and a and the further extinguishment in sections a and a of all claims based upon any interest in or right involving certain land or natural resources.these provisions,however,follow sections a and a,respectively,which validate any transfer of land or natural resources in the united states by the narragansett tribe or in rhode island by any indian tribe as of the date of said transfer.the provisions then go on to state 
t o the extent that any transfer of land or natural resources described in subsection a of this section may involve land or natural resources to which an indian tribe had aboriginal title,subsection a of this section shall be regarded as an extinguishment of such aboriginal title as of the date of said transfer and 
by virtue of the approval of a transfer of land or natural resources effected by this section,or an extinguishment of aboriginal title effected thereby,all claims by the narragansett tribe,or any predecessor or successor in interest,member or stockholder thereof,or any other indian,indian nation,or tribe of indians,arising subsequent to the transfer and based upon any interest in or right involving such land or natural resources including but not limited to claims for trespass damages or claims for use and occupancy shall be regarded as extinguished as of the date of the transfer.
a.given the references back to the transfers validated in paragraph,the evident purpose of these provisions is to extinguish claims based on the purported invalidity of those transfers.
the state arguments that the provisions should be read more broadly are unavailing.first,the state argues that the extinguishment of aboriginal title over land in rhode island precludes the later exercise of tribal sovereignty over rhode island land acquired by the secretary in unrestricted trust.the secretary disputes whether aboriginal title is ever the basis for tribal sovereignty,but in any event,it is clear that such title is not the only basis for tribal sovereignty.this is evident from the supreme court decision in city of sherrill oneida indian nation,d.in sherrill,the supreme court both held that the tribe could not unilaterally revive its ancient sovereignty,in whole or in part,over the parcels at issue,id.at,and directed the oneidas to as the proper avenue for the tribe to reestablish sovereign authority over the relevant territory,id.at.the state protestation that sherrill did not involve a statutory extinguishment of aboriginal title is beside the point.however aboriginal title or ancient sovereignty was lost,the ira provides an alternative means of establishing tribal sovereignty over land.
trust acquisition is not incompatible with the extinguishment of aboriginal title.the mashantucket pequot indian claims settlement act,for example,contains virtually identical language extinguishing aboriginal title to any land or natural resources the transfer of which was approved and ratified by the act.b.at the same time,the act provides that certain land and natural resources located within the settlement lands shall be held in trust by the united states for the benefit of the tribe,id.b,and that such lands are declared to be indian country,id.it is implausible to think that congress intended the extinguishment of aboriginal title in the rhode island settlement act to preclude the taking of land into unrestricted trust,but did not intend for identical language in the mashantucket settlement act to do so 
alternatively,the state argues that the all claims language in paragraph even more broadly forecloses the assertion of tribal sovereignty over lands.to hold otherwise,says the state,would render that language surplusage.paragraphs and are complementary,however,not duplicative.while paragraph extinguishes a form of title,paragraph extinguishes claims.moreover,paragraph covers claims based on other forms of title,besides aboriginal title,that the tribe might have held to land in rhode island prior to the settlement act.
the state broad interpretation of paragraph proves too much.the state argues that the paragraph precludes an assertion of tribal sovereignty over any land in rhode island.nothing in the language of the provision,which refers to any interest in or right involving such land,distinguishes between claims of sovereignty and traditional property claims.indeed,the latter are explicitly included.see id.a including but not limited to claims for trespass damages or claims for use and occupancy.it would be highly improbable that congress intended to prevent the tribe from asserting any ownership interest over land it purchased outside the settlement lands,and it would be contradictory as to the settlement lands themselves.thus,there is no support for reading this provision as precluding all future assertions of tribal sovereignty over land in rhode island.
ultimately,this entire line of argument by the state misses the point that what is at issue is not what the tribe may do in the exercise of its rights,but what the secretary may do.the displacement of state law arises from the secretary authority and not from the tribe mere purchase of the land.see cass county,leech lake band of chippewa indians,d.in order to prevail on its claim of implied repeal,the state must show that the settlement act repeals the secretary authority under the ira.
as to the implied repeal of the secretary power,the state first argues that the secretary is bound by the extinguishment of the tribe claims because that extinguishment binds the tribe successor in interest.a.even if the secretary is such a successor in interest,however,those provisions can not plausibly be read to repeal the secretary power under the ira to take land into trust.the secretary power does not turn on the tribe original aboriginal interest in the parcel,before it purchased the land,nor does it turn on whether the secretary is a successor in interest to the tribe 
the state also relies on c,which provides 
upon the discharge of the secretary duties under sections,and of this title,the united states shall have no further duties or liabilities under this subchapter with respect to the indian corporation or its successor,the state corporation,or the settlement lands 
the language of this provision,however,can not be read to have a preclusive effect or to limit the secretary powers in any way.the statement that the united states has no further duties or liabilities under this subchapter merely delimits the federal government obligations in implementing the settlement act.
we reject the state suggestion that this language parallels the language in the mashantucket settlement act that the second circuit found to prohibit certain trust acquisitions.see connecticut ex rel.blumenthal dep t of interior,cir.the mashantucket settlement act uses very different language that provides that the united states shall have no further trust responsibility with respect to certain land and natural resources outside of the settlement lands.b.disclaiming trust responsibility over land is nothing like disclaiming duties or liabilities under this subchapter.
there is nothing in the text of the settlement act that clearly indicates an intent to repeal the secretary trust acquisition powers under the ira,or that is fundamentally inconsistent with those powers this lack of language is not because either congress or the parties failed to anticipate that the tribe might later become federally recognized and eligible for the benefits of the ira.the settlement act specifically provides for a restraint on alienation of the settlement lands if the secretary subsequently acknowledges the existence of the narragansett tribe of indians.id.c.the underlying jmou also explicitly recognized that the tribe would not receive federal recognition in the implementation of the settlement,but would have the same right to petition for such recognition as other groups.jmou para.
had the act intended to limit the secretary trust authority in case of federal recognition,it could have done so explicitly.it would have been easy to extend the provisions of section a preserving state sovereignty to cover all lands in rhode island owned by or held in trust for the tribe.no such language appears in the act.similarly,as the ibia also noted,paragraph of the jmou would have been a logical place for the parties to set out any restrictions on the secretary trust authority following federal recognition of the tribe.town of charlestown,at.no such restrictions appear.nor does the settlement act contemplate any role for the state to play in the secretary decision whether to take the land into trust.this is in contrast to the indian gaming regulatory act.
in other settlement acts,congress has specifically described limits on the secretary trust authority.in the maine indian claims settlement act,congress expressly precluded application of section.e except for the provisions of this act,the united states shall have no other authority to acquire lands or natural resources in trust for the benefit of indians or indian nations,or tribes,or bands of indians in the state of maine.in the mashantucket settlement act,congress precluded the trust acquisition of lands purchased with settlement funds.see blumenthal,at.the absence of any restrictions in the settlement act supports our finding that no restrictions were intended see id.at.
the state fallback position is that the settlement act requires that this court order the secretary to honor the intent of the bargain it believes is embodied in the act by putting the parcel into a restricted trust,subject to state laws and jurisdiction acknowledging the genuineness of the state sense that its bargain has been upset,we find that the relief it seeks is not an appropriate exercise of judicial power.
in the settlement act,the state procured at least two clear benefits the settling of disputed land claims and the application of its civil and criminal laws and jurisdiction to the settlement lands.beyond that,the state argues that it would never have agreed to displacement of state law as to later acquired parcels if the issue had surfaced during the negotiations.the state argues that the practical consequences of the unrestricted trust leave it in an entirely unsatisfactory position and undermine the central bargain.rhode island points out that it is a small,very populous state and that the practical consequences of establishing indian country for its nearby towns may be far greater than they would be in less densely populated areas.
even so,we are still bound by the language of the settlement act.even viewing the state argument in contract terms,it is rare that a court will step in and reform a contract.see broadley mashpee neck marina,cir reversing the district court reformation of a contract.our ability to edit,as opposed to interpret,an act of congress is no less constrained only a finding of absurdity,not present here,provides the necessary precondition.compare green bock laundry mach,d editing a federal rule of evidence where the apparent distinction between civil plaintiffs and civil defendants would be unfathomable,with.hosps.casey,d refusing to read in an additional component to a provision on the basis that congress simply forgot to include it.see also blumenthal,at while we might question the wisdom of different jurisdictional provisions governing different trust lands,we will not provide a strained interpretation of the settlement act simply to avoid such a result.the judiciary may not usurp the role of congress.
constitutional claims 
in support of recognition of its state sovereignty interests under the constitution,the state presents four arguments.it argues first that the indian commerce clause,const.art.i,cl,does not provide the secretary the authority to displace state law within a state boundaries,and that section of the ira therefore violates the tenth amendment.next,it argues that the secretary may not,in any event,displace state law without the state consent,by operation of the enclave clause of the constitution.id.art.i,cl.the state further argues that the secretary action is barred by the admissions clause,id.art.iv,cl,which prohibits formation of new states within the jurisdiction of any other state.finally,the state argues that section is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.we reject all of these arguments.
the indian commerce clause and the tenth amendment 
the authority to regulate indian affairs is within the enumerated powers of the federal government.id.art.i,cl.cotton petroleum,at.t he central function of the indian commerce clause is to provide congress with plenary power to legislate in the field of indian affairs.morton,at.noting that congress has plenary power to deal with the special problems of indians,including the power to legislate on their behalf.with the adoption of the constitution,indian relations became the exclusive province of federal law.county of oneida oneida indian nation of,d see also united states gallons of whiskey.congress now has the exclusive and absolute power to regulate commerce with the indian tribes.
the tenth amendment to the constitution reserves to the states those powers not expressly delegated to the federal government.the powers delegated to the federal government and those reserved to the states by the tenth amendment are mutually exclusive.if a power is delegated to congress in the constitution,the tenth amendment expressly disclaims any reservation of that power to the states new york united states,d.because congress has plenary authority to regulate indian affairs,section of the ira does not offend the tenth amendment.ins,cir because congress possesses plenary authority over matters,it may freely displace or preempt state laws in respect to such matters.
the enclave clause 
the enclave clause of the constitution provides that congress may exercise exclusive legislation over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be,for the erection of forts,magazines,arsenals,dockyards,and other needful buildings.const.art.i,cl.the enclave clause provision for exclusive federal jurisdiction was intended to ensure that places on which the security of the entire union may depend are not in any degree dependent on a particular member of it.fort leavenworth lowe.quoting the federalist james madison internal quotation marks omitted.the state argues that p rimary federal jurisdiction through federal superintendence over the land coupled with congress exclusive legislative authority over indian matters collectively operate to exclude state law on trust lands.as a result,it argues,trust acquisitions create federal enclaves and therefore require state consent.
we disagree.first,trust land does not fall within the plain language of the enclave clause.it is not purchased for the erection of forts,magazines,arsenals,dockyards,or other needful buildings.rather,it is held in trust for the benefit of indians.
second,in surplus trading cook,the supreme court offered an indian reservation as a typical illustration of federally owned land that is not a federal enclave because state civil and criminal laws may still have partial application thereon.id.at.the supreme court recently confirmed the reasoning underlying the observation that indian lands are not federal enclaves 
indians right to make their own laws and be governed by them does not exclude all state regulatory authority on the reservation.state sovereignty does not end at a reservation border.though tribes are often referred to as sovereign entities,it was long ago that the court departed from chief justice marshall view that the laws of a state can have no force within reservation boundaries.
hicks,at.alteration in original quoting white mountain apache tribe,at.quoting worcester georgia,pet.as a result,the secretary trust acquisition of lands for the narragansetts does not even implicate the enclave clause.
the admissions clause 
the admissions clause of the constitution provides that no new state shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other state nor any state be formed by the junction of two or more states,or parts of states,without the consent of the legislatures of the states concerned as well as of the congress.const.art.iv,cl.the state argues that the creation of indian country within rhode island amounts to the formation of a new state within rhode island jurisdiction.
this argument is without merit.the admissions clause prohibits congress only from unilaterally establishing within an existing state a body on an equal footing with the original states in all respects whatsoever.coyle smith.internal quotation marks omitted.for purposes of the admissions clause,a state is a body equal in power,dignity and authority to existing states.id.the secretary trust acquisition for the narragansetts does not establish such a body.as a result,the acquisition does not violate the admissions clause.
the nondelegation doctrine 
the constitution vests a ll legislative powers t herein granted in a congress of the united states.const.art.i.congress is not permitted to abdicate,or to transfer to others,the essential legislative functions with which it is vested.panama refining ryan.yet,the supreme court has recognized that in our increasingly complex society,replete with ever changing and more technical problems,congress simply can not do its job absent an ability to delegate power under broad general directives.mistretta united states,d.as a result,the supreme court has repeatedly held that congress may confer decisionmaking authority on agencies as long as it lay s down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to act is directed to conform.whitman am.trucking ass ns,d second alteration in original quoting hampton,united states.internal quotation marks omitted.the court has deemed it constitutionally sufficient if congress clearly delineates the general policy,the public agency which is to apply it,and the boundaries of this delegated authority.mistretta,at.quoting am.power light sec.
the state and its amici argue that section lacks the requisite intelligible principle and therefore is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.
the secretary of the interior is authorized,in his discretion,to acquire any interest in lands,for the purpose of providing land for indians.
for the acquisition of such lands,and for expenses incident to such acquisition,there is authorized to be appropriated,out of any funds in the treasury not otherwise appropriated,a sum not to exceed in any one fiscal year provided,that no part of such funds shall be used to acquire additional land outside of the exterior boundaries of navajo indian reservation for the navajo indians in arizona,nor in new mexico,in the event that legislation to define the exterior boundaries of the navajo indian reservation in new mexico becomes law.
title to any lands or rights acquired pursuant to this act shall be taken in the name of the united states in trust for the indian tribe or individual indian for which the land is acquired,and such lands or rights shall be exempt from state and local taxation.
in support of its argument,the state relies primarily on an eighth circuit decision,south dakota dep t of the interior,cir,vacated,d,that held that section was an impermissible delegation that was completely lacking in boundaries and intelligible principles and that would permit the secretary to purchase the empire state building in trust for a tribal chieftain as a wedding present.id.at.the circuit opinion in south dakota was vacated by the supreme court,which did not publish an opinion explaining its decision,at,and as a result has not set any precedent.lovelace se,cir per curiam.
on remand,the eighth circuit held that the purposes evident in the whole of the ira and its legislative history sufficiently narrow the delegation and guide the secretary discretion in deciding when to take land into trust.south dakota dep t of interior,cir.the court noted that the statute allows the secretary to acquire trust lands only for indians as defined in,and that the statute prohibits the secretary from taking lands into trust for navajo indians.see at.the south dakota court also referred to the legislative history of the ira which explains that the goals motivating trust acquisitions are rehabilitati on of the indian economic life and develop ment of the initiative destroyed by oppression and paternalism.id.at quoting mescalero apache tribe jones,d quoting,at internal quotation marks omitted.as the dissent from the original south dakota decision had noted,the historical context of the ira is important section direction that land be acquired for the purpose of providing land for indians has specific meaning in light of the failure of the allotment policy and c ongressional rejection of assimilation as a goal.at murphy,dissenting.
other provisions of the ira reinforce such an interpretation.see prohibiting allotment of reservation lands to individual indians id.extending indefinitely existing trust periods and restrictions on alienation of indian lands id.a authorizing restoration of surplus lands to tribal ownership id.prohibiting the transfer of restricted indian lands except to indian tribes.we find the reasoning of the eighth circuit second south dakota opinion persuasive.
the ninth circuit decision in confederated tribes of siletz indians of oregon united states,cir,also supports the secretary position that section is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.although not addressing a nondelegation challenge to section,the confederated tribes court stated that t he general delegation of power to the executive to take land into trust for the indians is a valid delegation because congress has decided under what circumstances land should be taken into trust and has delegated to the secretary of the interior the task of deciding when this power should be used.id.at.
the supreme court has upheld the constitutionality of statutes authorizing regulation in the public interest,see,broad.united states.cent.sec.united states,as well as statutes authorizing regulation to ensure fairness and equity,see am.power light,at.yakus united states.as the court stated in its most recent nondelegation decision,it has almost never felt qualified to congress regarding the permissible degree of policy judgment that can be left to those executing or applying the law.am.trucking ass ns,at.quoting mistretta,at.scalia,dissenting internal quotation marks omitted.we similarly decline to do so here.we hold that section is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.
the focus of the en banc proceedings was on the three sets of arguments discussed above.the state presented another set of claims,rejected by the panel,that the secretary decision to take the parcel into trust for the tribe violates the apa.the state did not seek en banc review of this issue.in granting en banc review,we withdrew our panel opinion,which had been reported at.in the interests of completeness,we now also reject the state apa claims.
we set forth here a shortened and slightly modified version of the panel opinion as to this issue.
the state claims that the secretary action was an abuse of discretion under the apa.our review of the secretary decision is governed by section a of the apa,which provides that a court may set aside agency action only where it finds the action arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.an agency determination is arbitrary and capricious if the agency lacks a rational basis for making the determination or if the decision was not based on consideration of the relevant factors.see motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d associated fisheries of,daley,cir.the court review under section a is highly deferential,and the secretary action is presumed to be valid.see conservation law found.of new,sec y of interior,cir.a reviewing court can not substitute its own judgment for that of the agency.citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d associated fisheries,at.no deference is given to the district court decision.associated fisheries,at.
the state makes five arguments as to why the secretary decision was unlawful under section a the bia relied on the tribe findings,rather than conducting an independent evaluation of the tribe application the bia misapplied the factors enumerated in for evaluating a transfer the native american housing assistance and act cooperation agreement waiver violated due process the bia failed to consider the environmental impact of the housing project planned for the parcel and the project compliance with the coastal zone management act and the bia failed to consider noncompliance with the indian gaming regulatory act.we disagree,and we find that the secretary decision to accept the parcel into trust did not violate the apa.
independent evaluation of the tribe trust application 
the state claims that the bia decision to take the parcel into trust was arbitrary and capricious because it relied exclusively on the tribe assertions and failed to consider other important facts that occurred between and.the state points to substantial passages in the secretary decision that contain verbatim restatements of information provided by the narragansett tribe in support of their trust application as evidence that the bia failed to conduct an independent evaluation of the tribe application.
there is ample evidence in the administrative record that the bia conducted its own,independent evaluation of the tribe application and that it considered the events following the tribe application.for example,between and,the bia required the tribe to supplement its initial environmental assessment conducted an environmental hazard survey of the parcel required confirmation of consistency with the state coastal resources management plan was apprised of,and offered to facilitate,negotiations between the tribe,the town,and the state concerning both environmental and jurisdictional issues attendant to the tribe development of the parcel and specifically requested that the regional solicitor address several legal and jurisdictional issues raised by the state in its comments to the bia on the tribe trust application.this demonstrates that the bia determination was the result of its own,independent evaluation of the application.
application of the factors 
the state claims that the bia failed to apply the proper criteria when it evaluated the tribe application for trust acquisition.the regulations governing the bia evaluation of applications to have land taken in trust are laid out at part.the factors to be considered for an acquisition are found in section,and the factors for an acquisition are found in section in making the decision to accept the parcel into trust,the bia considered the factors in section the state claims that the bia failed to consider the need of the tribe for additional land,b.the state also questions whether the bia sufficiently scrutinized the tribe justification of anticipated benefits from the acquisition as required by section b 
a reviewing court will determine only whether the bia decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.citizens to preserve overton park,at.the fact that the bia found the parcel,which is across a town road from the settlement lands,to be contiguous to the settlement lands that are currently in trust,and thus determined that it should consider the factors enumerated in,is certainly not clear error and is within the secretary discretion.the record shows that the bia complied with section,including evaluating the tribe need for the additional land,and the state has not shown that the secretary made a clear error of judgment.
it was not necessary for the bia to consider the factors under section,since it found section to be applicable to this trust determination.while the secretary need not have considered section b,the close proximity between the tribe settlement lands and the parcel would not have required the secretary to give the greatest scrutiny to the tribe justification of anticipated benefits from the acquisition.b.
the native american housing assistance and act cooperation agreement requirement 
at the time of the bia decision to acquire the parcel into trust,hud was precluded from releasing funds pursuant to the native american housing assistance and act for any tribe housing development unless an agreement for local cooperation on issues such as taxes and jurisdiction had been entered into by the tribe and the local government where the housing was located.c.in the instant case,the narragansett tribe did not obtain such an agreement with the town.however,section c has since been amended to permit hud to waive the cooperation agreement requirement,c,as amended by,a,stat,and the tribe claims to have obtained such a waiver.
the state argues that this waiver is invalid because the state apparently did not receive notice of the tribe application for a waiver until after the waiver had been granted.on appeal,the state contends that if the bia accepted the waiver,the bia has inherited the legal error and acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner.as the district court noted,c establishes a prerequisite to hud award of housing grants.it does not pertain to the bia trust acquisition authority.carcieri,d at.nothing in the factors requires the bia to ensure that a local cooperation agreement is in place for an indian housing project.
environmental considerations 
the national environmental policy act nepa,f,and its supporting regulations promulgated by the council on environmental quality ceq,parts,direct federal agencies to consider the environmental impact of agency decisions.the state argues that the secretary and the bia failed to consider the environmental impact in reaching the decision to accept the parcel into trust because no environmental impact statement eis was prepared,and failed to conduct their own evaluation of the environmental impact and instead improperly relied on an environmental assessment ea submitted by the narragansett tribe.we disagree.
federal agencies are required to prepare an eis for any action that could significantly affect the quality of the human environment.c.nepa provides that to the fullest extent possible all agencies of the federal government shall include in every recommendation or report on proposals for major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,a detailed statement by the responsible official on the environmental impact of the proposed action.c.however,in the absence of a finding that the proposed action would significantly affect the quality of the human environment,the bia was not required to prepare an eis.see,londonderry neighborhood coal.fed.energy regulatory comm n,cir quoting.outdoor council forest.
the ceq has issued guidance on whether to prepare an eis.this guidance provides that if the agency determines on the basis of the environmental assessment not to prepare a statement,then the agency should p repare a finding of no significant impact pursuant to section.e.the applicant may prepare the ea provided that the agency make s its own evaluation of the environmental issues and take s responsibility for the scope and content of the environmental assessment.id.b.in this case,the bia followed its standard operating procedure for externally initiated proposals by obtaining an ea from the tribe and considering it along with supplemental information the bia requested from the tribe and information gathered independently by the bia.see nepa handbook para.b.after reviewing the ea and the requisite supplemental information,the bia completed its environmental analysis and issued a finding of no significant impact.the bia issuance of a finding of no significant impact satisfied its responsibilities under nepa.see e.
separately,the state contends that the bia should have obtained a federal consistency review in accordance with the coastal zone management act czma,before making its trust determination.the czma requires state consultation on federally permitted coastal development activities the state asserts that the bia failure to take direct action to ensure that the housing project was consistent with the rhode island coastal zone management program riczmp before making its trust determination was a violation of the czma.we disagree.
the state has failed to demonstrate that a consistency review of the tribe housing development was necessary at the trust acquisition stage.the development of the parcel is a project that was commenced by the tribe,in conjunction with hud,prior to the tribe application for trust acquisition.the rhode island coastal resources management council correctly recognized that the development of the parcel,which required its own federal consistency determination,was a separate matter from the trust acquisition,and properly found that the tribe application for trust status was consistent with the riczmp.
the indian gaming regulatory act 
finally,the state contends that the true purpose of the tribe application for trust acquisition is the development of gambling facilities on the than development of tribal housing as the bia found in its evaluation pursuant to c and that the bia failure to consider the indian gaming regulatory act,in its decision was an abuse of discretion.we reject the state argument that the secretary decision to acquire the parcel in trust should be reversed and that further inquiry into whether the parcel would be used for gaming purposes is now required.
no evidence that the tribe intends to use the parcel for anything other than tribal housing,as determined by the bia,was presented.in fact,after the plaintiffs expressed concern over the potential for development of a gaming facility on the parcel,the tribe reaffirmed that it intended to use the parcel for a housing development and stated that it had no immediate plans for any further future development.carcieri,d at quoting ii admin,tab n.
as support for its position,the state points to an ibia decision that reversed a trust acquisition decision due to the bia failure to consider the impact of a potential casino,even though the applicants denied any intention of using the property for a casino.see vill.of ruidoso,albuquerque area,bureau of indian affairs.however,in village of ruidoso,the ibia determined that,despite the tribe denial that the application for trust acquisition was for gaming purposes,it was clear from the planned uses of the property and the fact that the property had been given to the tribe by a company that the bia apparently understood to have some gaming connection with the tribe that the application might well have been for gaming purposes.id.at.in that situation,the bia should have further analyzed the possibility of gaming.id.at.
we agree with the district court that 
although the possibility that the parcel might be used for gaming activities was raised before the bia,the bureau determination that the parcel would be used to provide housing was amply supported by the record.in view of the deferential standard of review afforded to agency decisions under the apa,the bureau determination in this regard must be sustained.
carcieri,d at.
the decision of the district court is affirmed.costs are awarded to the secretary.
respectfully,i disagree with the majority analysis of the settlement act.in my view,the majority opinion disregards congress and the parties purpose in passing the settlement act and is inconsistent with our own recent interpretation of the settlement act.see narragansett indian tribe rhode island,cir en banc.at bottom,under the settlement act,the secretary may only take the parcel into a restricted trust that provides for rhode island continued criminal and civil jurisdiction over the parcel.the state makes this argument in two forms.first,by arguing that the settlement act effectuates a partial implied repeal of the ira as to state jurisdiction on land taken into trust by the bia.second,by arguing that the statutes can be harmonized by reading the ira narrowly and subject to the settlement act provisions.either approach gets to the same conclusion.significantly,the generous rules of indian construction do not apply in analyzing an implied repeal.see passamaquoddy tribe state of maine,cir the normal principles of implied repeal are applied in the indian law context.
the parties and amici do an excellent job in acquainting the court with the many complexities of both the case and the issues inherent in indian law.however,the ultimate resolution of the case comes down to a very narrow question in the specific context of the tribe and state,what did congress intend the settlement act to do 
the key provision is section,which is written far more broadly than the majority concludes in its first two provisions that section retroactively ratifies all the tribe prior land transfers anywhere in the united states and extinguishes the tribe aboriginal title in all such lands.see a.more significantly,section goes on to extinguish future land claims 
by virtue of the approval of a transfer of land or natural resources effected by this section,or an extinguishment of aboriginal title effected thereby,all claims against the united states,any state or subdivision thereof,or any other person or entity,by the indian corporation or any other entity presently or at any time in the past known as the narragansett tribe of indians,or any predecessor or successor in interest,member of stockholder thereof,or any other indian,indian nation,or tribe of indians,arising subsequent to the transfer and based upon any interest in or right involving such land or natural resources including but not limited to claims for trespass damages or claims for use and occupancy shall be regarded as extinguished as of the date of the transfer.
id.a.this provision obviously goes well beyond merely extinguishing aboriginal title and claims based thereon,which was accomplished in the prior subsection.see id.a.this language forecloses any future indian land claim of any type by the tribe regarding land in rhode island or anywhere in the united states,for that matter.thus,congress and the parties intended to resolve all the tribe land claims in the state once and for all.
the majority argues that section a can not be read so broadly otherwise,the tribe would be barred from asserting any land claims.see ante,at.but the majority disregards a significant nature of the land claims that were barred.the legislative history of the settlement act specifically states that the extinguishment of indian land claims is limited to those claims raised by indians qua indians,cong,at emphasis added.as we recently stated,through the settlement act the tribe abandoned any right to an autonomous enclave,submitting itself to state law as a quid pro quo for obtaining the land that it cherished.narragansett tribe,at.thus,the tribe would be free to assert any claim that any other landowner in rhode island could make under state law,but would be foreclosed from making claims based entirely on the tribe status as an indian tribe.it is beyond peradventure that asking to have land taken into trust by the bia under the ira to effect an ouster of state jurisdiction is a quintessential indian land claim 
moreover,congress does not legislate in a vacuum,and among the matters that a court must consider in assessing a statute are general policies and statutory provisions.passamaquoddy tribe,at.the settlement act was enacted over years after section of the ira and,given the explicit acknowledgment of possible future recognition for the tribe congress was well aware of the ira when enacting the settlement act.it is neither logical nor necessary to find that congress enacted legislation effectuating this carefully calibrated compromise between three sovereigns,which required significant expenditures by both the federal government and the state,which provided a significant amount of land to the tribe,and which provided for a delicate balancing of the parties interests,only to permit the legislation to be completely subverted by subsequent agency action.
on this score,the majority misses the exquisite irony that the parcel was part of the lands originally claimed by the tribe.it would be antithetical to congress intent to allow the tribe to purchase a portion of the originally disputed lands that were the subject of the earlier lawsuits that ultimately led to the jmou and settlement act,place it in trust with the bia,and thereby create indian country in direct contravention of the settlement act prohibitions.for this same reason,the majority attempt to distinguish our recent narragansett tribe opinion as pertaining only to the settlement lands is unpersuasive.see ante,at.by that reasoning,the tribe could swap the settlement lands for adjacent land and undo any limitations contained in the settlement act.the settlement act can not be reasonably construed to allow such absurd results.
further,the settlement act was novel it was the first statute resolving indian land claims,premised upon the nonintercourse act,growing out of an settlement negotiated by a tribe and the.see,at.indeed,it was expected to serve as a template for the resolution of other eastern tribes land claims under the nonintercourse act.see see also oneida indian nation.at discussing nonintercourse act and original states right to purchase from the indians.in light of the fact that the settlement act was the first statute of its kind,the majority observation that subsequent statutes were more explicit in limiting certain aspects of the secretary power proves nothing.elaborate statements regarding the tribe relationship with the bia would have been unwarranted in the settlement act,given that the tribe had not yet been recognized.
moreover,that subsequent acts dealing with eastern tribes made specific provision for the secretary ability to take land in trust for a tribe,see,c d massachusetts indian claims settlement id.d maine indian claims settlement id.b connecticut indian claims settlement,supports the conclusion that congress anticipated no such result under the settlement act.given that the state had full criminal and civil jurisdiction over its territory,that any potential jurisdictional issue concerning the settlement lands was specifically addressed,and that all future indian land claims were barred,there would be no future land scenarios that congress would need to address more specifically as it did in the other acts as we have noted,the settlement act,properly read,ensures that the state may demand the tribe compliance with state laws of general application.narragansett tribe,at.
there is also nothing novel about requiring the bia to accept the parcel into trust with restrictions.the bia is authorized to take restricted interests in land into trust,see,and,in dealing with other tribes,congress has specifically directed the bia to take land into trust subject to a settlement act provisions,see,id.d id.
it is also worth noting that congress acted promptly to preserve the state jurisdiction over the tribe lands the last time this court challenged it.when this court held that the tribe exercised sufficient jurisdiction and governmental authority over the settlement lands to invoke the indian regulatory gaming act,see narragansett tribe,at,congress promptly amended the settlement act to provide explicitly that the settlement lands are not indian lands for purposes of that act,see b.
i respectfully dissent.
i am in complete agreement with judge howard cogent and articulate dissent,and i join it unreservedly.nevertheless,i write separately to express my regret that,in taking far too narrow a view of the settlement act,the majority gives short shrift not only to the interests of the state of rhode island but also to the carefully calibrated arrangements crafted between the state and the tribe.
we previously have made clear that the touchstone in resolving jurisdictional disputes between the state and the tribe is the full effectuation of the parties intent.see narragansett indian tribe rhode island,cir en banc.yet,today,the majority sets aside the parties intent in favor of a wooden reading of one subsection of the settlement act.see ante at by its terms,section a applies state law only to the acres of settlement lands.the parcel is not part of the settlement lands.
despite the artful draftmanship of the majority opinion,the provision on which it relies can not be wrested from its historical context and read in a vacuum.the settlement act,when taken together with the extinguishment of all indian claims referable to lands in rhode island,the tribe surrender of its right to an autonomous enclave,and the waiver of much of its sovereign immunity,see narragansett indian tribe,at,suggests with unmistakable clarity that the parties intended to fashion a broad arrangement that preserved the state civil,criminal,and regulatory jurisdiction over any and all lands within its borders.therefore,the settlement act logically and equitably should be read to prohibit any unilateral action that would upset this and delicate jurisdictional balance.
the secretary taking of an parcel into an unrestricted trust is just such an event.it strains credulity to surmise,as does the majority,that the state would have made such substantial the transfer,free and clear,of acres of its leaving open the gaping loophole that today decision creates.
the majority admits that this case is in many ways a proxy for the state larger concerns about its sovereignty,ante at,including the state understandable worry that the tribe will use this parcel or future parcels that might be acquired and placed into trust for activities that would be forbidden under state law and anathema to a majority of the state citizens.at oral argument,the secretary of the interior and the bureau of indian affairs appeared to disclaim any vestige of responsibility for the state concerns.despite this disclaimer and the genuineness of the state sense that its bargain has been upset,ante at,the majority turns its back on the state.
in my view,this is error of the most deleterious kind.the majority,without anything approaching sufficient justification,is engaging in pointless literalism and forcing the state to rely on the faint velleity that the secretary will use caution in the exercise of his responsibilities in connection with the parcel.while hope is the official motto of rhode island,the state should not be hope in place of rights for which it has bargained.
as indian tribes evolve in modern society,old legal rules tend to blur.the controversy that divides our court today is vexing and of paramount importance to both the state and the tribe.thus,the well as the underlying principles of indian would benefit from consideration by the supreme court.that is a consummation devoutly to be wished.in the meantime,however,there is too much at stake to allow the tribe,with the contrivance of the secretary taking the parcel into trust,to walk away from an arrangement that it helped to fashion and from which it has benefitted over the years.
i respectfully dissent.
by contrast,the indian gaming regulatory act provides the state with a limited role in determining whether land is taken into trust for gaming purposes.see b a.
the state challenges to the secretary authority under the ira and the constitution have national implications that reach beyond rhode island accordingly,ten states and the national coalition against gambling expansion have filed amicus briefs in support of rhode island.similarly,numerous tribes and tribal organizations have filed amicus briefs in support of the secretary.we acknowledge the able assistance provided by the amici curiae states and national coalition against gambling expansion on behalf of the state,and amici curiae national congress of american indians,individual indian tribes and tribal organizations,and the mississippi band of choctaw indians on behalf of the secretary.
in an abundance of caution,we recognized that the tribe may still possess some autonomy in local government matters such as membership rules,inheritance rules,and regulation of domestic relations.narragansett iii,at.
