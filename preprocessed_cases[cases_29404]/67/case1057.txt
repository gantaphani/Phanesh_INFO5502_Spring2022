howard groner and the metropolitan strategy group,a nonprofit housing rights organization,brought suit against the owners and the manager of golden gate gardens apartments under the federal fair housing act and ohio analogous housing provisions.the dispute arose when golden gate threatened to evict groner,a tenant with a known mental disability,following numerous complaints from another tenant about groner excessive noisemaking at all hours of the day and night.groner alleges that golden gate refusal to provide a reasonable accommodation that would have enabled him to remain in his apartment amounted to unlawful discrimination.the district court granted golden gate motion for summary judgment,concluding that the defendants had attempted to reasonably accommodate groner,albeit unsuccessfully.groner now challenges that decision.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
the golden gate apartment complex is located in mayfield heights,ohio.groner,who suffers from schizophrenia and depression,moved into one of the apartments in april of.golden gate was aware of his mental disability,but groner was able to live independently and had no special needs.he paid his rent in a timely manner and properly maintained the condition of his apartment.
diane arter had lived in the apartment located directly above groner since.approximately four months after groner moved in,she registered her first complaint with the apartment manager,kathleen boyle.arter reported that she was unable to sleep because groner was screaming and slamming doors within his apartment throughout the night.in response to this complaint,boyle contacted ray gonzalez,groner social worker,to inform him of the problem created by groner behavior.the disturbances persisted during the next month and a half,causing arter to file a second complaint.boyle again notified gonzalez,who replied that he was working with groner to resolve the issue.shortly thereafter,with no noticeable improvement,arter complained a third time.gonzalez was once again contacted by boyle.this time,he informed her that he had counseled groner to scream into the pillow to muffle the noises at night.
by may of,arter had registered a total of four or five complaints concerning groner noisemaking.because the situation remained unchanged when groner lease expired that month,golden gate did not renew the annual lease.groner became a tenant,whose tenancy could be terminated on days notice to vacate the premises.
during the period in question,golden gate soundproofed the front door to groner apartment in an attempt to lessen the noise.this was done after arter complained that groner had caused a picture to fall off the wall in her apartment and break.golden gate also gave arter the option of moving to a different apartment within the complex,or terminating her lease without penalty.arter,however,refused the offer,saying that it would be unfair to expect her to move as the solution to a problem caused by groner behavior.
when arter complained again in august of about groner yelling and,boyle notified groner that his tenancy was not being renewed,and that he would have to vacate his apartment by november.groner relayed this information to gonzalez,who then contacted boyle to ascertain why groner tenancy was being terminated.boyle informed him that groner noisemaking had continued and was disturbing arter.
in a letter dated october,gonzalez requested that groner lease be renewed as a reasonable accommodation in light of his disability.when gonzalez had received no response by october,he faxed the letter along with a cover sheet that asked boyle to call him to discuss the matter further.boyle then sent gonzalez a response by fax,agreeing to grant groner a extension that would provide additional time for gonzalez to develop a strategy to resolve groner noisemaking.the letter cautioned,however,that the extension was conditioned on boyle not receiving any further complaints about groner.otherwise,he would have to vacate his apartment.
in a reply dated october,gonzalez wrote that he was continuing to work with groner on a weekly basis in an attempt to modify groner behavior.gonzalez again requested that golden gate make reasonable accommodations for groner by providing him a regular,lease and contacting gonzalez immediately upon the receipt of any complaints about groner.on october,boyle called gonzalez to inform him that groner could remain in his apartment until at least november.
less than two weeks later,arter complained that groner noisemaking had persisted.again boyle notified gonzalez,who consulted with groner.groner allegedly told gonzalez that he was no longer making any noise.despite groner purported denial to gonzalez,boyle notified groner by letter dated november,that his tenancy would not be renewed and that he should plan to vacate his apartment by december.gonzalez then phoned boyle on december to urge her to reconsider.boyle,however,refused,stating that previous delays had not helped to resolve the problem and that it would be too burdensome for golden gate to continue apprising gonzalez each time groner caused a disturbance.by this point,arter had registered approximately ten to twelve complaints concerning groner excessive noisemaking.
in an attempt to extend groner tenancy,gonzalez wrote boyle on december,to request a meeting and to reiterate the request for a reasonable accommodation.gonzalez affidavit states that when he did not hear from boyle,he left her a phone message on december and wrote yet another letter on december,restating his desire to discuss these matters in person.boyle apparently never responded to these final inquiries made by gonzalez.when groner had not vacated his apartment by december,golden gate served him with an eviction notice to leave by january.groner moved from his apartment at some point thereafter without awaiting the final outcome of this litigation.
procedural background 
on january,groner and the metropolitan strategy group filed this suit pursuant to the federal fair housing act,and equivalent ohio provisions ohio ann.the complaint alleged that golden gate had violated federal and state fair housing laws when it threatened to evict groner rather than provide a reasonable accommodation that would have enabled him to remain in his apartment.groner filed a contemporaneous motion for emergency injunctive relief to prevent golden gate from evicting him.golden gate agreed not to take any action until a mental health analysis of groner took place.accordingly,the preliminary injunction was denied as moot.
golden gate then filed its answer,as well as a counterclaim against the metropolitan strategy group,asserting that metropolitan was interfering with arter contractual and common law right to the quiet enjoyment of her apartment.on september,golden gate moved for summary judgment on all of groner claims.groner requested leave to file a supplemental reply,which included an affidavit of groner treating psychiatrist to the effect that any loud noises he made were directly related to his mental disability.golden gate opposed this motion.the district court entered a marginal order denying groner motion to file the supplemental reply.on december,the district court granted golden gate motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case.golden gate then moved to dismiss without prejudice its counterclaim against the metropolitan strategy group.upon the district court grant of golden gate motion,groner filed the instant appeal.
