plaintiff,rvs filed suit against the city of rockford rockford seeking a temporary restraining order and to preliminarily and permanently enjoin rockford from enforcing an ordinance regulating exotic dancing nightclubs.rockford ordinance the ordinance prohibits the operation of those businesses within feet of churches,schools,residences and other exotic dancing nightclubs,and in addition,requires the issuance of a special use permit before such businesses may operate in nonproscribed locations.rvs argues that the ordinance violates its rights under the first amendment to the united states constitution and appeals the district court judgment in favor of rockford.for the reasons stated herein,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for entry of judgment consistent with this opinion.
background 
a.the ordinance 
rvs leases commercial property on auburn street in rockford,illinois.rvs was preparing to open a business at the auburn street location called moulin rouge.according to rvs owner,james roddy,moulin rouge planned to be an upscale facility serving food along with theme dancing and artistic performances.on december,in response to an application for a liquor license,rvs received a letter from the rockford city attorney explaining that a new ordinance enacted the previous day would prevent rvs from opening moulin rouge.
this newly passed ordinance defined,for the first time,a category of businesses known as exotic dancing nightclubs and required that such businesses apply for a special use permit.by definition,the ordinance only applies to dancers who are and dancers are regulated by a separate rockford ordinance that deals with sexually oriented businesses.it is undisputed that the business rvs planned to operate could fall within the exotic dancing nightclub definition but not the sexually oriented business definition.under the ordinance,an exotic dancing nightclub is defined as 
a business establishment at which one or more exotic dancers perform or provide entertainment to a patron or patrons.exotic dancer means any person,whether compensated or not,who dances,performs,or entertains by doing a striptease or performs an erotic dance or other movements which include the performer touching their breasts or pubic area,or performing any movements simulating sexual activity while wearing fully opaque clothing covering over primarily the genitalia,pubic region,buttocks and if the person is female,the portions of the breast below the top of the areola.
the ordinance provides that exotic dancing nightclubs are prevented from operating within feet of a church,school,residential district or another exotic dancing nightclub.the auburn street property is positioned within feet of a residential area.furthermore,even in those areas that are not within feet of the designated locations,an exotic dancing nightclub must obtain a special use permit specifically allowing its operation at the location it has selected 
in august,the ordinance was first proposed at a meeting of the rockford city council.alderman ald.douglas mark suggested the adoption of a resolution amending rockford zoning ordinance to add business establishments featuring exotic dancers to the existing land uses that require a special use permit.the matter was referred to the council codes and regulations committee.on september,the city council adopted the codes and regulations committee report recommending that rockford file text amendments to the zoning ordinance regarding exotic dancing nightclubs.accordingly,the text amendments were filed with rockford zoning officer and a hearing was held on the proposed text amendments by the zoning board of appeals zba.on november,after hearing testimony on the matter from city attorney kathleen elliott and ald.mark,the zba recommended approval of the text amendments.on november,the codes and regulations committee of the city council voted to recommend sustaining the zba decision to approve the text amendments.on december,the city council approved the ordinance.
in considering whether to pass the ordinance,it is undisputed that the city council did not rely on any studies from other towns or conduct any of their own studies regarding the relationship between exotic dancing nightclubs and undesirable secondary effects,such as decreased property values and higher incidence of crime,public health risks,and illegal sexual activities such as prostitution.the ordinance does not contain any preamble or legislative findings and the journal of proceedings for the city council meeting at which it was adopted does not state any findings.in fact,the legislative record reflects that the only evidence to support the ordinance was the testimony offered by city attorney elliot and ald.mark at the november,zba meeting.the minutes from that meeting contain the following passage 
it is the city experience that exotic dancing nightclubs in a concentrated area or near residential uses attract prostitution and other problems that are part of this atmosphere.alderman mark stated there have been incidents where liquor sales were procured with the intent of establishing dancing clubs.the proposed text amendments would allow the city more control over the location of these type of clubs to prevent adverse effects on adjoining neighborhoods.
additionally,the minutes of the council codes and regulations meeting for november,contain the following statement although they are not considered sexually oriented business sic,strip clubs have similar secondary effects in the neighborhood as sexually oriented businesses.
in response to the action filed by rvs against rockford,the district court denied rvs request for a temporary restraining order and subsequently conducted a bench trial combining the preliminary and permanent injunction hearings.at trial,ald.mark testified that he drafted the ordinance with the intent of creating three different categories of behavior that would fall within the definition of exotic dancing.according to ald.mark,fully clothed individuals are considered exotic dancers if they dance,perform,or entertain by doing a striptease,or perform an erotic dance or other movements which include touching their breasts or pubic area.under the third category,ald.mark testified,individuals are exotic dancers if they perform any movements simulating sexual activity while wearing the specified limited clothing.wayne dust,rockford zoning manager,testified after ald.mark.he disagreed with ald.mark interpretation of the ordinance.dust testified that he understands the clothing limitation to modify all three categories of conduct.
rockford also introduced evidence to attempt to show that adverse secondary effects result from the operation of exotic dancing nightclubs.rockford police officer david dominguez,who performs crime analysis for the police department,presented reports summarizing calls relating to prostitution for the years and.the summaries showed that many calls originated from an area of rockford known as street and broadway ald.jeffrey holt,whose ward includes the street and broadway area,provided testimony pertaining to the conditions of his ward.he testified that the area is comprised of a commercial district in close proximity to a residential area.the neighborhood contains a community center,a homeless outreach center,a outpatient clinic,restaurants,furniture stores,rental properties,and adult establishments,including massage parlors,lingerie modeling shops,and dancing clubs.ald.holt testified that he received complaints from residents concerning sexually oriented businesses located in the area,relating to their advertising and signage,hours of operation,and density.in ald.holt opinion,the presence of sexually oriented businesses in the street and broadway area contributes to lower property values,deteriorated properties,difficulty in attracting development,and prostitution.
ald.nancy johnson,whose ward is adjacent to holt,testified that she received calls from residents,complaining about noise,traffic,and litter caused by bigfoot,an exotic dancing nightclub in her ward.in her opinion,sexually oriented businesses create unattractive appearances due to neon lights,gaudy window displays,and unsavory clientele.
to refute the evidence presented by rockford,rvs presented expert evidence from daniel linz.linz testified that studies show that no adverse secondary effects are associated with establishments featuring nude or dancing.additionally,linz found no studies concerning the secondary effects of establishments where performers wear clothing.rvs also presented testimony from judith hanna,an anthropologist who has conducted studies of dance and dancers.in hanna expert opinion,the definitions of exotic dance in the ordinance are insufficient to define conduct in any meaningful way.she explained that it is common in many forms of mainstream dancing to touch parts of the body,including the breasts and pelvic area.it was also her opinion that the ordinance clothing definition encompasses a wide range of dance costumes,uniforms,and practice attire.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the district court issued an opinion finding in favor of rockford,denying the injunction requests and dismissing the entire case with prejudice.the district court found that the ordinance was not an unconstitutional prior restraint.furthermore,the court found that the ordinance was a proper time,place,and manner restriction because rockford was entitled to rely on its experience that exotic dancing nightclubs cause undesirable secondary effects.the district court also found that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad.rvs appeals the district court decision with respect to its determination that the ordinance is not a prior restraint and that sufficient evidence exists to uphold the ordinance on a secondary effects rationale.
ii.discussion 
legal framework 
in renton playtime theatres,d,the supreme court applied a analysis in reviewing the first amendment validity of a municipal zoning ordinance that regulated adult movie theaters.the renton analysis instructs courts reviewing regulations of adult entertainment establishments to consider whether the regulation constitutes an invalid total ban or merely a time,place,and manner regulation,whether the regulation is or,and accordingly,whether strict or intermediate scrutiny is to be applied,and if,whether the regulation is designed to serve a substantial government interest and allows for reasonable alternative channels of communication.
in upholding a ban on adult establishments,the plurality opinion in city of los angeles alameda books,d,adhered to the renton framework.however,in his concurrence,justice kennedy joined the four dissenters,id.at,in eschewing the fiction of adult entertainment zoning ordinances.id.at.these ordinances are content based and we should call them so.see also enterprises town of joseph,cir explaining that the versus inquiry is unnecessary.generally,content based restrictions on speech are analyzed with the strictest scrutiny,but justice kennedy explained that content based zoning regulations can be exceptions to that rule.in so concluding,he agreed with the plurality that the central holding of renton is sound a zoning restriction that is designed to decrease secondary effects and not speech should be subject to intermediate rather than strict scrutiny.alameda books,at.whatever the label,renton second step is best conceived as an inquiry into the purpose behind an ordinance rather than an evaluation of an ordinance form.see alameda books,at.plurality opinion explaining renton second step requires courts to verify that the predominant concerns motivating the ordinance were with the secondary effects of adult speech emphasis added internal quotations omitted ben bar village of somerset,cir regulations of adult entertainment receive intermediate scrutiny if they are designed not to suppress the content of erotic expression,but rather to address the negative secondary effects caused by such expression emphasis added enterprises,at noting that courts must first determine whether the ordinances at issue are motivated by an interest in reducing the secondary effects associated with the speech,rather than an interest in reducing speech itself,before applying intermediate scrutiny emphasis added as we noted in ben bar,while the label has changed,the substance of renton second step remains the same.at.
accordingly,only after confirming that a zoning ordinance purpose is to combat the secondary effects of speech do we employ renton intermediate scrutiny test.under this test,zoning regulations are constitutional so long as they are designed to serve a substantial government interest and do not unreasonably limit alternative avenues of communication.renton,at.see also alameda books,at.at this stage,courts are required to ask whether the municipality can demonstrate a connection between the speech regulated by the ordinance and the secondary effects that motivated the adoption of the ordinance.ben bar,at quoting alameda books,at.in other words,simply stating that an ordinance is designed to combat secondary effects is insufficient to survive intermediate scrutiny.the governmental interest of regulating secondary effects may only be upheld as substantial if a connection can be made between the negative effects and the regulated speech.in evaluating the sufficiency of this connection,courts must examine evidence concerning regulated speech and secondary effects.alameda books,at.according to the alameda books plurality,the evidentiary requirement is met if the evidence upon which the municipality enacted the regulation is reasonably believed to be relevant for demonstrating a connection between secondary effects producing speech and a substantial,independent government interest.at.internal quotations omitted.
however,justice kennedy clarified that simply evaluating the strength of the connection is insufficient to pass intermediate scrutiny.it is essential,he explained,to consider the impact or effect that the ordinance will have on speech.that is,not only must the regulation have the purpose and effect of suppressing secondary effects,it must also leave the quantity and accessibility of speech substantially intact.alameda books,at.kennedy,concurring.this approach requires that two questions be asked and answered to resolve whether a zoning ordinance is justified what proposition does a city need to advance in order to sustain a ordinance and how much evidence is required to support the proposition see also ben bar,at.as justice kennedy explained,the necessary rationale for applying intermediate scrutiny is the promise that zoning ordinances may reduce the costs of secondary effects without substantially reducing speech.alameda books,at.kennedy,concurring.accordingly,only once a cost effective rationale has been identified to justify a regulation can the sufficiency of the evidence supporting that rationale be evaluated 
in sum,alameda plurality opinion along with justice kennedy concurrence establish that in order to justify a time,place,and manner restriction,a municipality must advance some basis to show that its regulation has the purpose and effect of suppressing secondary effects,is designed to serve or furthers a substantial or important government interest,while leaving the quantity and accessibility of speech substantially intact,the regulation is narrowly tailored and does not unreasonably limit alternative avenues of communication.ben bar,at.
application of books to the ordinance 
strict or intermediate scrutiny complete ban or time place and manner regulation 
first,we note that the ordinance is not a complete ban on exotic dancing nightclubs,but a zoning regulation,which renton and alameda books instruct us to consider as a time,place,and manner regulation.rather than acting as an outright prohibition on exotic dancing,the ordinance regulates the locations where that activity may occur.however,the special use permit scheme does create the potential of substantially restricting,or even preventing,the establishment of new exotic dancing nightclubs.nevertheless,the record does not support the conclusion that the ordinance amounts to a total ban on protected considering that existing exotic dancing nightclubs are unaffected by the ordinance.
strict or intermediate scrutiny were the secondary effects of speech the predominant concerns motivating enactment of the ordinance 
next,we must examine whether the ordinance was designed to suppress the content of erotic expression or to address the negative secondary effects caused by such expression.ben bar,at.in other words,we must determine whether the predominant concerns motivating rockford enactment of the ordinance were the secondary effects of adult speech,and not the content of adult speech.id rockford claims to have enacted the ordinance to combat the negative secondary effects allegedly created by exotic dancing nightclubs,including prostitution,crime,and decreased property values.to support this claim,rockford points to testimony from ald.mark and city attorney elliott given at the zba meeting explaining that the purpose of the ordinance was to ameliorate the negative secondary effects of exotic dancing nightclubs.in addition,ald.holt and ald.johnson offered testimony at trial relating to the negative effects produced by businesses.
however,observations made by ald.mark during trial somewhat complicate this inquiry.in response to questions relating to the purpose of the ordinance,ald.mark stated that while rockford had experienced no problems with the exotic dancing nightclubs currently in operation,there were some concerns that some people just do like this type of entertainment.combating the adverse secondary effects caused by sexually explicit speech is a permissible purpose for a regulation open and explicit hostility toward and disapproval of the speech itself is not.certainly,such a direct acknowledgment from the official responsible for introducing the ordinance makes us sensitive to the possibility that the ordinance might be a pretextual use of the power to zone as a means of suppressing expression.see young american mini theatres,d powell,concurring.nonetheless,what motivates one legislator to support a statute is not necessarily what motivates others to enact it.see renton,at.citing united states,d see also dima town of hallie,cir rejecting an argument that legislators improper motive can invalidate an otherwise constitutional ordinance.accordingly,on balance,it seems that the predominant concerns motivating enactment of the ordinance related to combating prostitution,crime,and other negative externalities.
intermediate scrutiny substantial government interest,narrowly tailored,and reasonable alternate channels of communication 
even accepting that the predominant concerns motivating rockford adoption of the ordinance were the alleged secondary effects caused by exotic dancing nightclubs,we are compelled to reverse the decision of the district court because the ordinance can not survive books intermediate scrutiny,designed to serve a substantial government interest,narrowly tailored and does not unreasonably limit alternate avenues of communication.see ben bar,at.
substantial government interest 
as previously noted,our inquiry requires us to answer two questions what proposition does a city need to advance in order to sustain a ordinance and how much evidence is required to support the proposition alameda books,at.kennedy,concurring.justice kennedy put forth a proportionality principle to guide courts in answering the first question.he explained that,a city may not assert that it will reduce secondary effects by reducing speech in the same proportion.id.following this guideline,justice kennedy concluded that the rationale of a dispersal statute must be that the targeted businesses will disperse rather than shut down.id.at.
accordingly,rockford premise in support of the ordinance must be that locating exotic dancing nightclubs away from churches,schools,and residential neighborhoods,and separating exotic dancing nightclubs from one another will significantly reduce negative secondary effects that occur when there is a concentration of adult uses in an area without substantially diminishing the availability of speech.
as we move to the second question,we are confronted with a critical deficiency of the lack of evidence to support this premise.the record is devoid of evidence connecting exotic dancing nightclubs and the secondary effects that allegedly motivated the ordinance adoption.while it seems apparent that the ordinance will have the effect of reducing the availability of speech,evidence is lacking to support the proposition that secondary effects will be reduced by the same degree,if at all.
the supreme court has consistently held,a city must have latitude to experiment,at least at the outset,and very little evidence is required to support an ordinance proposition.id.as previously noted,a municipality may rely on any evidence that is reasonably believed to be relevant for demonstrating a connection between speech and a substantial,independent government interest.alameda books,at.plurality opinion quoting renton,at.however,rockford has produced little evidence of harmful secondary effects connected to exotic dancing nightclubs beyond the assumption that such effects exist.while it is true that common experience may be relied upon to bolster a claim that a regulation serves a current governmental interest,the experience in this case falls short of satisfying the minimal evidentiary showing required by alameda books.indeed,while courts may credit a municipality experience,such consideration can not amount to an acceptance of an if they say so standard.
rockford does not identify any studies,judicial opinions,or testimony that it considered in adopting the ordinance.furthermore,the evidence presented at trial represented only a limited showing,consisting of evidence of a higher than average incidence of prostitution in the street and broadway area,testimony from two local officials that police action had not been effective to curb prostitution activity,and testimony from ald.johnson that based on her personal observations strip clubs have negative secondary effects on adjoining residential properties 
even if we were dealing with a typical adult entertainment zoning ordinance,it is questionable whether this modest amount of support would be sufficient under the albeit permissive guidelines set by the supreme court and this court previous cases.while reasonably believed to be relevant is not a particularly demanding evidentiary standard,neither the supreme court nor this court has found it satisfied by a similarly limited proffer of evidence.compare alameda books,at.city relied on study it conducted a number of years prior to enacting ordinance renton,at.planning committee conducted extensive studies and hearings enterprises,at town board collected studies and consulted judicial opinions and police reports ben bar,at village board relied on numerous judicial decisions,studies from different cities,and findings in a report from the state attorney general schultz city of cumberland,cir city collected and reviewed studies and conducted legislative research dima,at town minimally met its evidentiary burden by relying on the factual record supporting the experience of another community as reported in a judicial opinion.
we reiterate that courts should not be in the business of empirical assessments of city planners.enterprises,at quoting alameda books.however,in a situation like the one before us,where rockford has not adequately engaged in such an assessment,to conclude that the reasonably believed to be relevant requirement has been satisfied would be to permit a municipality to employ an unacceptably low level of justification,as proscribed by the alameda books plurality.see at.
nonetheless,the requirement that municipalities be allowed a reasonable opportunity to experiment with solutions to an admittedly serious problem might render the offered evidence sufficient if the ordinance applied only to bars and clubs that present nude or dancing.such entertainment has a long history of spawning deleterious effects,including prostitution and the criminal abuse and exploitation of young women,and in most cases a city or state need only carry a minimal burden to demonstrate its interest
