introduction 
this putative class action has a long and tortuous history in this court.presumably this opinion will be known as taylor appellants challenge the constitutionality of california unclaimed property law upl,which provides for the conditional transfer of unclaimed property to the state of california while this court has previously held the upl facially constitutional,see taylor iii,at,the instant suit challenges the california state controller betty yee the controller application of the statute appellants claim that the procedures used both before unclaimed property is transferred to the controller and after it is transferred violate appellants due process rights.the district court dismissed appellants suit with prejudice for failure to state a claim.we affirm.
appellants first and primary argument is that the notice provided by the controller is constitutionally inadequate because the controller does not attempt to locate property owners using the data sources required by section of the upl.appellants further argue that the controller notice process is inadequate because it is carried out by companies that have an alleged conflict of interest because they receive a portion of the escheated property value.finally,appellants argue that the controller procedures violate the due process and takings clauses because they do not provide an adequate remedy when the controller denies an individual claim to escheated property.
ii.background 
as explained below in more detail,under the upl,property that appears to be lost or abandoned by the owner is conditionally transferred to the state if it remains unclaimed after notice is provided to the owner.examples of such lost or abandoned property are savings accounts at a bank or shares of stock held in a brokerage account.in august of,in response to taylor ii,which found the upl notice requirements insufficient,the california legislature amended the upl to provide additional notice to owners of unclaimed property.in taylor iii,this court determined that the amended upl is facially constitutional.appellants now bring this challenge to the law.
california unclaimed property law 
according to the controller,the purpose of the upl is to locate owners of apparently lost or abandoned property and restore their property to them but if these efforts are unsuccessful,to give the benefit of any unclaimed property to california,rather than to financial institutions or other private entities holding the property holders.as the controller explains,the upl thus ensures that unless and until the owner reclaims it,unclaimed property will be used for the public good rather than for the benefit of private banks and financial institutions.
pursuant to the upl,holders must transfer property to the state once the property meets the upl definition of unclaimed property.see et.however,prior to escheatment to california,the upl requires that multiple forms of notice be given to the apparent owners of unclaimed property,including two notice letters.
as an initial step,the upl provides that the holder shall make reasonable efforts to notify any owner by mail or,if the owner has consented to electronic notice,electronically,that the owner property will escheat to the state.id.d,b,d.the same general notice requirements apply to all types of property under the upl,although the specifics vary by property type.compare id.safe deposit boxes,with business dividends and distributions.this notice is sent to the apparent owner address,as reflected in the holder records.the notice contains a form that the owner is to complete,sign,and return,in which case,it shall be deemed that the holder knows the location of the owner,who claims the property,id d.the holder may also provide telephonic or electronic methods by which the owner can claim the property.id.
if the owner does not respond to the holder notice,the property is deemed unclaimed and the holder must report to the controller the name,if known,and last known address,if any,of each person appearing from the records of the holder to be the owner of any property of value of at least fifty dollars escheated under this chapter.id.b.the statute mandates specific dates,depending on the property classification,by which a holder must report the unclaimed property to the controller.id.d.the holder notice to the owner is to be given n ot less than nor more than months before the time the account,deposit,shares,or other interest becomes reportable to the controller in accordance with this chapter.id.
after the holder has reported the unclaimed property to the controller,but before it is transferred,that is,the controller shall mail a notice to each person having an address listed in the report who appears to be entitled to property of the value of fifty dollars or more escheated under this chapter.id.d the controller notice must state that property is being held,name the addressee who may be entitled to it,and give the name and address of the holder.id.e.further,the notice must provide 
a statement that,if satisfactory proof of claim is not presented by the owner to the holder by the date specified in the notice,the property will be placed in the custody of the controller and may be sold or destroyed pursuant to this chapter,and all further claims concerning the property or,if sold,the net proceeds of its sale,must be directed to the controller.
id.e.usually,the controller notice is mailed to the owner address provided by the holder.
the controller takes an additional step to determine the current address of the owner.under the upl,if the holder report includes the owner social security number,the controller shall request the franchise tax board to provide a current address for the apparent owner on the basis of that number.id.d.if the franchise tax board provides an address different from the one provided by the holder,the controller sends notice to that address.id.otherwise,if the franchise tax board does not provide any address,or provides the same address as the holder,the controller mails notice to the address provided by the holder.id.
if the owner fails to timely establish his or her right to receive any property specified in the report to the satisfaction of the holder before that property has been delivered to the controller then the property must be transferred that is,escheated to the controller in the time specified by the statute.id.a b.however,the property transferred to the controller does not permanently escheat to the state.id.a.rather,the controller holds the unclaimed property in trust for the owner who may claim it at any time.those who claim to have been the owner of property paid or delivered to the controller under this chapter may file a claim to the property or to the net proceeds from its sale.id.a.
beyond the notice mailed by the controller,the upl requires additional forms of notice.the controller must also provide notice via publication in a newspaper of general circulation which the controller determines is most likely to give notice to the apparent owner of the property.id.a.the newspaper notice does not state which property was taken or from whom,but instead explains generally that the controller takes custody of unclaimed property.the advertisement states that california may have received property belonging to you and explains that property is deemed unclaimed if there has been no owner contact with the property holder or account activity for three years.
the newspaper notice also informs potential owners of the controller website where they may perform a search to determine whether they may be the owner of unclaimed property.if there is property in that person name,the website further describes what the property is,what it is worth,which holder reported it,and the owner name and address as reported by the holder.the website provides instructions for filling out a claim form,which can be done online.
in taylor iii,this court explained that the upl,as amended in,passes constitutional muster because the state,in addition to the holder,is required to provide notice reasonably calculated,under all the circumstances,to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.at quoting jones flowers,d.the upl declares,i t is the intent of the legislature that property owners be reunited with their property and that in amending the law,california intended to provide n otification by the state to all owners of unclaimed property prior to escheatment.c emphasis added.the amended upl came about as a result of this court decision in taylor ii.
taylor i,ii,and iii 
in taylor i,two sued after the controller escheated purportedly unclaimed shares of stock that the individuals owned.taylor i,at.the issue then was whether the notice provided to plaintiffs was constitutionally adequate.the district court dismissed the complaint under the eleventh amendment for lack of jurisdiction.this court reversed.id.at.we ruled that the suit was not barred by the eleventh amendment because plaintiffs action was for return of their own properties.see id.
after remand,plaintiffs,challenging the adequacy of the notice provided prior to escheat of the unclaimed property to the controller,moved for a preliminary injunction.in response,the controller argued the upl provided constitutionally adequate notice by requiring that the controller place advertisements in the newspaper explaining that owners could check an unclaimed property website to see if their names or property were listed as escheated to the state the controller mails written notice to some,but not all,individuals whose property has been escheated and the holders of the property subject to escheat provide notice to individuals prior to the property being escheated.taylor ii,at.
the district court denied plaintiffs request for a preliminary injunction and this court again reversed,noting that california needed to take action to remedy the constitutional problem with its escheat statute,specifically,the lack of adequate notice.id.at.we explained,b efore the government may disturb a person ownership of his property,due process requires the government to provide notice reasonably calculated,under all the circumstances,to apprise the interested party of the pendency of the action and afford him an opportunity to present his objections.id.at quoting jones,at.
in reversing the district court denial of the injunction,this court ruled that the plaintiffs had a strong likelihood of success in proving that the notice provisions of the upl did not provide due process.id.first,we held that the website and the controller mailings which only went to some individuals did not respond to the requirement that notice be given before an individual control of his property is disturbed.id.further,mere publication is not constitutionally adequate.id.finally,the holder obligation to provide notice did not satisfy the obligation of the state itself to give notice.id.as a result,this court ruled that a preliminary injunction should have been granted.id.at.
on remand,the district court issued the preliminary injunction.taylor chiang,no.civ.s wbs ggh,wl cal.june.the injunction enjoined the controller from receiving,taking title to,possessing,selling,or destroying any property pursuant to the upl until the controller has first promulgated regulations providing for fair notice to the owner and public,satisfactory to and approved by this court.id.at.
as a result of taylor ii,in the california legislature eliminated the statutory and administrative procedure that this court had determined to be unconstitutional and promulgated an entirely new statutory procedure addressing escheat.taylor iii,at.in light of the revised upl,the district court dissolved the injunction.taylor chiang,no.civ.s wbs ggh,wl.the district court ruled that the notice provision of the amended upl remedied the constitutional problems identified by taylor ii because it required the controller to send notice before an individual property is transferred to the state and maintain a searchable unclaimed property website.id.at.
appellants appealed the dissolution of the injunction,which resulted in taylor iii.there,this court ruled that o n its face,the new procedure complies with the due process standard established by the supreme court in mullane cent.hanover bank trust,and jones flowers,d.taylor iii,at.appellants could not prevail on a facial challenge because u nder the new law,the controller is required to provide notice reasonably calculated,under all the circumstances,to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.id.citations and quotation marks omitted.therefore,it is clear that this court has held that the upl,on its face,provides for constitutionally adequate notice.this court reiterated the facial constitutionality of the upl in suever ii,at,stating 
in taylor westly taylor iii,cir per curiam,we held that the entirely new statutory procedure addressing escheat promulgated by the state following the issuance of the preliminary injunction in taylor ii is facially constitutional,and that,as a result,the district court did not abuse its discretion in dissolving the injunction.id.at.
as a result of taylor iii,appellants ostensibly last hope is to craft an challenge to the upl,which they have done in their second amended class action complaint.
appellants second amended class action complaint 
appellants second amended class action complaint alleges that the controller is administering the upl in a manner that violates appellants due process rights guaranteed by the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution and.the district court dismissed all counts for failure to state a claim.
here,the primary issue to be resolved is whether appellants have sufficiently stated an claim that the controller is not providing constitutionally adequate notice because she is not taking additional steps to locate and notify property owners.

iv.analysis 
appellants claim of inadequate notice 
since taylor i,appellants have continuously argued that under the upl the controller is not providing notice in compliance with the due process clause.
the supreme court announced that where persons may be deprived of their property,the due process clause requires notice reasonably calculated,under all the circumstances,to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.mullane,at.
a second,more recent,supreme court opinion further defined the law regarding adequate notice,explaining that b efore a state may take property and sell it for unpaid taxes,the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment requires the government to provide the owner notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.jones,at quoting mullane,at.
in jones,the petitioner purchased a house and lived there with his wife for more than years before they separated.id.after the separation,the petitioner moved out,but continued to pay the mortgage each month,and the mortgage company paid the property taxes.id.however,once the mortgage was paid,the property taxes were unpaid and delinquent.id.arkansas commissioner of state lands notified the petitioner of the tax delinquency by mailing a certified letter to the petitioner at the property address.id.this letter stated that unless the
