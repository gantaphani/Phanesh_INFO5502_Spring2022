the alaska national interest lands conservation act anilca set aside million acres of land in alaska for preservation purposes.under anilca,those lands were placed into conservation system units,which were defined to include any unit in alaska of the national park system,national wildlife refuge system,national wild and scenic rivers systems,national trails system,national wilderness preservation system,or a national forest monument.in addition to federal land,over million acres of state,native corporation,and private land were also included within the boundaries of those conservation system units.

the secretary of the interior has authority to prescribe regulations concerning boating and other activities on or relating to water located within system units.b.the park service hovercraft regulation was adopted pursuant to section b.the hovercraft ban is not limited to alaska,but instead has effect in federally managed preservation areas across the country.section c of anilca,in contrast,addresses the scope of the park service authority over lands within the boundaries of conservation system units in alaska.the first sentence of section c specifies the property included as a portion of those units.it states only those lands within the boundaries of any conservation system unit which are public lands as such term is defined in this act shall be deemed to be included as a portion of such unit.c.anilca defines the word land to include lands,waters,and interests therein,and the term public lands to include lands to which the united states has title,with certain exceptions.
the second sentence of section c concerns the park service authority to regulate lands in alaska,which include state,native corporation,and private property.it provides no lands which,before,on,or after december,are conveyed to the state,to any native corporation,or to any private party shall be subject to the regulations applicable solely to public lands within such units.c.the third sentence of section c explains how new lands become part of conservation system units if the state,a native corporation,or other owner desires to convey any such lands,the secretary may acquire such lands in accordance with applicable law including this act,and any such lands shall become part of the unit,and be administered accordingly.ibid.
interpreting section c of anilca,the district court granted summary judgment to the park service,and the ninth circuit affirmed in pertinent part.according to the ninth circuit,because the hovercraft regulation applies to all lands and waters administered by the park service nationwide,as well as all navigable waters lying within national parks,the hovercraft ban does not apply solely within conservation system units in alaska.the ninth circuit concluded that the park service therefore has authority to enforce its hovercraft regulation on the nation river.the ninth circuit did not address whether the nation river counts as public land for purposes of anilca.
held the ninth circuit interpretation of section c is inconsistent with both the text and context of anilca.
a the ninth circuit interpretation of section c violates a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme,roberts services.anilca repeatedly recognizes that alaska is different,and anilca itself accordingly carves out numerous exceptions to the park service general authority over federally managed preservation areas.those provisions reflect the simple truth that alaska is often the exception,not the rule.yet the reading below would prevent the park service from recognizing alaska unique conditions.under that reading,the park service could regulate lands in alaska only through rules applicable outside alaska as well.the court concludes that,whatever the reach of the park service authority under anilca,section c did not adopt such a approach.
b moreover,it is clear that section c draws a distinction between public and lands within the boundaries of conservation system units in alaska.and yet,according to the court below,if the park service wanted to differentiate between that public and land in an way,it would have to regulate the land pursuant to rules applicable outside alaska,and the public land pursuant to provisions.assuming the park service has authority over land in alaska an issue the court does not decide,the court concludes that this is an implausible reading of the statute.the court therefore rejects the interpretation of section c adopted by the court below.
c the court does not reach the remainder of the parties arguments.in particular,it does not decide whether the nation river qualifies as public land for purposes of anilca.it also does not decide whether the park service has authority under section b to regulate sturgeon activities on the nation river,even if the river is not public land,or whether as sturgeon argues any such authority is limited by anilca.finally,the court does not consider whether the park service has authority under anilca over both public and lands within the boundaries of conservation system units in alaska,to the extent a regulation is written to apply specifically to both types of land.the court leaves those arguments to the lower courts for consideration as necessary.

john sturgeon,petitioner bert frost,in his official capacity as alaska regional director of the national park service,et.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
chief justice roberts delivered the opinion of the court.
for almost years,john sturgeon has hunted moose along the nation river in alaska.because parts of the river are shallow and difficult to navigate,sturgeon travels by hovercraft,an amphibious vehicle capable of gliding over land and water.to reach his preferred hunting grounds,sturgeon must pilot his hovercraft over a stretch of the nation river that flows through the rivers national preserve,a million acre federal preservation area managed by the national park service.
alaska law permits the use of hovercraft.national park service regulations do not.see cfr e.after park service rangers informed sturgeon that he was prohibited from using his hovercraft within the boundaries of the preserve,sturgeon filed suit,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.he argues that the nation river is owned by the state,and that the alaska national interest lands conservation act anilca prohibits the park service from enforcing its regulations on land in alaska.the park service disagrees,contending that it has authority to regulate waters flowing through federally managed preservation areas.the district court and the court of appeals ruled in favor of the park service.we granted certiorari.
in,secretary of state william seward,serving under president andrew johnson,negotiated a treaty to purchase alaska from russia for million.treaty concerning the cession of the russian possessions in north america,stat.in a single stroke,the united states gained million acres of land an area more than twice the size of texas.despite the bargain price of two cents an acre,however,the purchase was mocked by contemporaries as seward folly and president johnson polar bear garden.see naske slotnick,alaska a history naske slotnick.
the monikers did stick.in,the three lucky swedes jafet lindeberg,eric lindblom,and jon brynteson struck gold in nome,alaska.as word of their discovery spread,thousands traveled to alaska to try their hand at mining.once the gold rush subsided,settlers turned to other types of mining,fishing,and trapping,fueling an emerging export economy.see naske slotnick,wharton,the alaska gold rush.
despite newfound recognition of alaska economic potential,however,it was not until the that congress seriously considered admitting alaska as a state.by that time,it was clear that alaska was strategically important both in the pacific and arctic,and that the territory was rich in natural resources,including oil.moreover,the people of alaska favored statehood.see naske slotnick.but there was a problem out of the million acres of land in alaska,percent were owned by the federal government.as a result,absent a land grant from the federal government to the state,there would be little land available to drive private economic activity and contribute to the state tax base.see,at,the expenses of the state of alaska will be comparatively high,partially due to the vast land areas within the state but the state would be able to realize revenues from only percent of this vast area unless some provision were made to modify the present conditions 
a solution was struck.the alaska statehood act permitted alaska to select million acres of vacant,unappropriated,and unreserved federal land just over a quarter of all land in alaska for state ownership.a b,stat.that land grant included mineral deposits,which were subject to lease by the state as the state legislature may direct.i,at.upon statehood,alaska also gained title to and ownership of the lands beneath navigable waters within the state,in addition to the natural resources within such lands and waters,including the right and power to manage,administer,lease,develop,and use the said lands and natural resources.a,stat,a m,stat.with over million acres of land now available to the new state,alaska could begin to fulfill its state policy to encourage the settlement of its land and the development of its resources by making them available for maximum use consistent with the public interest.alaska,art.viii.
the statehood act did not,however,determine the rights of the alaska natives,who asserted aboriginal title to much of the same land now claimed by the state.naske slotnick.to resolve the dispute,congress in passed the alaska native claims settlement act ancsa,which extinguished aboriginal land claims in alaska.stat,as amended,et.in exchange,congress provided for a million settlement and permitted corporations organized by groups of alaska natives to select million acres of federal land to manage within the state,naske slotnick.congress sought to implement the settlement rapidly,with certainty,in conformity with the real economic and social needs of alaska natives.b.
in addition to settling the claims of the alaska natives,ancsa directed the secretary of the interior to select up to million acres of unreserved federal land in alaska for addition to the national park,forest,wildlife refuge,and wild and scenic rivers systems,subject to congressional approval.d.when congress failed to approve the secretary selections,however,president carter unilaterally designated million acres of federal land in alaska as national monuments.see presidential proclamation,cfr comp.
president carter actions were unpopular among many alaskans,who were concerned that the new monuments would be subject to restrictive federal regulations.protesters demonstrated in fairbanks,and more than alaskans participated in the great trespass.the goal of the trespass was to break over park service rules in a period including by camping,hunting,snowmobiling,setting campfires,shooting guns,and unleashing dogs.during the event,a rider on horseback,acting the part of paul revere,galloped through the crowd yelling,the feds are coming the feds are coming times,anchorage daily news.
congress once again stepped in to settle the controversy,passing the alaska national interest lands conservation act.stat,et.anilca had two stated goals first,to provide sufficient protection for the national interest in the scenic,natural,cultural and environmental values on the public lands in alaska.d.and second,to provide adequate opportunity for satisfaction of the economic and social needs of the state of alaska and its people.ibid.
anilca set aside million acres of land in alaska for preservation purposes,in the process creating ten new national parks,preserves,and monuments including the rivers national preserve and tripling the number of acres set aside in the united states for federal wilderness preservation.see naske slotnick.at the same time,anilca specified that the park service could not prohibit on those lands certain activities of particular importance to alaskans.see,a secretary must permit reasonable use of vehicles for travel to and from villages and homesites secretary must permit the taking of fish and wildlife for sport purposes and subsistence uses within national preserves in alaska,subject to regulation and certain exceptions.president carter earlier land designations were rescinded.see a.
under anilca,federal preservation lands in alaska were placed into conservation system units,which were defined to include any unit in alaska of the national park system,national wildlife refuge system,national wild and scenic rivers systems,national trails system,national wilderness preservation system,or a national forest monument.congress drew the boundaries of those units to follow hydrographic divides or embrace other topographic or natural features,however,rather than to map the federal government landholdings.b.as a consequence,in addition to federal land,over million acres of state,native corporation,and private land ended up inside the boundaries of conservation system units.see brief for petitioner.
this brings us back to sturgeon and his hovercraft.
one fall day in,sturgeon was piloting his hovercraft on the nation river,which rises in the ogilvie mountains in canada and joins the yukon river within the boundaries of the rivers national preserve conservation system unit.sturgeon was headed to a hunting ground upstream from the preserve,just shy of the canadian border.to reach that hunting ground,dubbed moose meadows,sturgeon had to travel on a portion of the river that flows through the preserve.
about two miles into his trip on the nation river,sturgeon stopped on a gravel bar to repair the steering cable of his hovercraft.as he was performing the repairs,sturgeon was approached by three park service rangers.the rangers informed him that hovercraft were prohibited under park service regulations,and that he was committing a crime by operating his hovercraft within the boundaries of the.despite sturgeon protests that park service regulations did not apply because the river was owned by the state of alaska,the rangers ordered sturgeon to remove his hovercraft from the preserve.sturgeon complied,heading home without a moose.
sturgeon now fears that he will be criminally prosecuted if he returns to hunt along the nation river in his hovercraft.to avoid prosecution,sturgeon sued the park service and several federal officials in the united states district court for the district of alaska.he seeks declaratory and injunctive relief permitting him to operate his hovercraft within the boundaries of the.alaska intervened in support of sturgeon,and the park service opposed the suit.
the district court granted summary judgment to the park service.sturgeon masica,wl.the co
