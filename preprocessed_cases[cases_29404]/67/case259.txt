the federal courts now routinely hear cases brought under the telecommunications act of by those who wish to construct cellular antenna towers and have been denied permission to do so by local town officials.here,the zoning board of appeals of the town of plainville,massachusetts denied the needed zoning permits and variances to national tower and omnipoint communications collectively omnipoint.
omnipoint sued under c b v,which provides a federal cause of action to a person adversely affected by a state or local decision that violates the act.it also raised claims under state law and under.the district court found that defendants had violated the act,and granted omnipoint summary judgment.tower,llc frey,d.the court concluded that the actions of the board effectively prohibited the provision of seamless wireless service in plainville in violation of c b i ii.as a remedy,the court ordered issuance of the variances and permit.we affirm.
because the district court granted summary judgment,we review the facts taking all inferences in the light most favorable to the board.reckitt colman,cir.the material facts as set forth in the district court opinion are essentially undisputed,and so we adopt them and add some others from the record.the parties do,however,dispute the inferences to be drawn from those facts.
in june,omnipoint applied to the board for variances from the dimensional prohibiting both multiple uses on one lot and structures over two stories and from the prohibiting radio transmission use.omnipoint needed these variances in order to erect a lattice transmission tower on approximately square feet of a parcel at washington street in plainville.the site abuts property owned by the new england power company,which contains electric transmission lines and poles and is developed for public utility use.
omnipoint objective was to close a gap in its cellular coverage along the heavily traveled highway routes and.in the vicinity of the coverage gap,approximately vehicles travel daily along route and along route.because of the gap in coverage,a cellular user either can not connect or can not maintain a connection.the proposed site lies in a general commercial district a cb district,and is partially covered by a watershed protection overlay district.under the town,a radio tower is a prohibited use in a cb district and requires a special permit in a watershed protection district.plainville.zoning ch.iii.moreover,a structure in a cb district may not exceed two stories in height.an engineer working for omnipoint testified,and the board does not dispute,that a tower in compliance with the would not close the gap.the board may,however,grant both use and dimensional variances for reasons consistent with the state zoning law.see.laws ch.similarly,the board may grant a special use permit in a watershed protection district so long as it makes certain findings,primarily that there will be no adverse impact on the watershed as a result.ch.iii.
omnipoint conducted computer simulations and drive tests to identify possible sites for a tower to rectify the break in its coverage.an investigation of the sites thus identified led to the selection of the disputed site.all other possible sites were in the same general area and therefore subject to the same zoning restrictions this evidence was submitted to the board,primarily through omnipoint application for the use and dimensional variances.in its initial application omnipoint characterized its tower as a wireless communications facility.it sought the needed permits and variances,which the permitted the town to grant.see ch.iii.
the board published the requisite notice in a local newspaper,characterizing the application as being for a radio tower.it held a hearing to consider the application on july.midway through the hearing,the board determined that it had been mistaken in publishing notice of a proposed siting of a radio tower on the site.the board voted to suspend the hearing and readvertise the tower as a public utility a permitted use in a cb district.the hearing resumed on september,with omnipoint pressing its case for a dimensional variance.omnipoint presented evidence of the coverage gap and evidence that it said showed there were no other suitable sites.the board at the hearing articulated no objections to the application,although several owners of abutting property did object.
meanwhile,on august,omnipoint filed an application for a special watershed permit.the hearing on this application was held on october.as at the hearing on the application for the dimensional variance,the board gave no indication that it might not grant the permit.
on october,the board unanimously rejected both applications.the board sent omnipoint two letters dated october explaining its decision.as to the request for the variances,the first letter stated 
in denying the variances,the board found that in a cb zoning district a wireless communications facility is not a use permitted as a matter of right or a use permitted by special permit and that a use variance,which would be required for the construction of such is not permitted under the zoning.in this respect,the board notes that chapter,section of the general laws,provides in relevant part as follows 
except where local ordinances or shall expressly permit variances for use,no variance may authorize a use or activity not otherwise permitted in the district in which the land or structure is located.
the zoning makes no provision for use variances.as the basis for its denial of the variances is that it has no legal authority to grant them,the board made no further findings with respect to other objections made to the construction of such facility,particularly as to whether there exists any other location in the town where such construction is permitted under the zoning.
the reasons given in the second letter for the rejection of the watershed permit were as terse 
on this date,the board denied the variances requested by the applicant on the grounds that in the underlying cb zoning district a wireless communications facility is not a use permitted as a matter of right or a use permitted by special permit and that a use variance,which would be required for the construction of such facility,is not permitted under the zoning.the construction of a wireless communications facility is clearly not permitted in the underlying cb zoning district.accordingly,it is not permitted by special permit in the overlay watershed protection district as the proposed use must meet the zoning requirements of both the underlying district and the overlay district.
this lawsuit,and appeal,followed.
the board appeals the order against it,making three arguments.it says the district court erred in granting omnipoint motion for partial summary judgment on the facts in this case because,first,the board decisions do not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of wireless services in the town second,the board decisions are supported by substantial evidence in a written record and,third,the board decisions do not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services.
we reach only the first two of these arguments.
general standards 
the telecommunications act is an exercise in cooperative federalism and represents a dramatic shift in the nature of telecommunications regulation.see generally cablevision of boston pub.improvement comm n,cir.the act attempts,subject to five limitations,to preserve state and local authority over the placement and construction of facilities.c a b supp.ii town of amherst,omnipoint communications,cir.several of those limiting provisions apply to this case.
the first relevant limitation,set forth in subsection b i,provides that in regulating the placement and construction of facilities,a state or local government or instrumentality shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services.c b i ii.it is undisputed that in this case there is a significant coverage gap.the argument that no tower is needed is unavailable to the town.several courts have held that local zoning decisions and ordinances that prevent the closing of significant gaps in the availability of wireless services violate the statute.see cellular.zoning bd.of adjustment,cir sprint spectrum willoth,cir omnipoint communications mb operations,llc town of lincoln,d.finding their reasoning persuasive,we now join their number and will analyze omnipoint claim with that standard in mind.
the second limitation requires the local government to act on any request for authorization to place,construct,or modify personal wireless service facilities within a reasonable period of time after the request is duly filed taking into account the nature and scope of such request.c b ii.similarly,a reviewing court must hear and decide the action on an expedited basis.id.c b v.the third states that the denial of a request must be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.id.c b iii.the fourth authorizes judicial review of either final action or a failure to act by the local government that is inconsistent with statutory requirements and limitations.id.c b v 
there is tension between two objectives of the act the objective to facilitate nationally the growth of wireless telephone service,and the objective to maintain substantial local control over siting of towers this and other courts have attempted to achieve the proper balance.amherst,at.the principles announced in our opinions provide guidance as to that balance.the first a town may not through its decisions have the effect of prohibiting wireless the question whether the statute refers only to a blanket ban or whether it may,depending on the facts,encompass individual application decisions.this court has resolved that question and read the statute to encompass individual decisions 
o bviously,an individual denial is not automatically a forbidden prohibition violating the effects provision.but neither can we rule out the possibility on language or individual decisions could be shown to reflect,or represent,an effective prohibition on personal wireless service.
id.at.the effective prohibition clause can be violated even if substantial evidence exists to support the denial of an individual permit under the terms of the town ordinances.the burden is on the proponent of the tower to show that further reasonable efforts are so likely to be fruitless that it is a waste of time even to try.id.
similarly,this court has resolved the tension between the recognition that local authorities are frequently lay member boards without many resources and the recognition that the act provides for judicial review based on a written decision,supported by substantial evidence in a written record.the balance struck is that we do not require formal findings of fact or conclusions of law in a board written decision.nor need a board written decision state every fact in the record that supports its decision.bell mobile todd,cir.by the same token,the board,in its decision,may not hide the ball.its written denial must contain a sufficient explanation of the reasons for the denial to allow a reviewing court to evaluate the evidence in the record supporting those reasons.id.at.
we now make explicit another aspect of judicial review of local decisions.a board may not provide the applicant with one reason for a denial and then,in court,seek to uphold its decision on different grounds.that result follows not only from the requirement that the decision provide an adequate explanation to support judicial review,but also from the background understanding of the model of judicial review of administrative actions against which the act was enacted.see conf,at,reprinted in,the phrase substantial evidence contained in a written record is the traditional standard used for judicial review of agency actions.that model customarily prohibits a court from affirming an agency on grounds other than those the agency gave in its decision.fec akins,d motor vehicle mfrs.ass of state farm mut.auto.ins,d sec chenery.if an order is valid only as a determination of policy or judgment which the agency alone is authorized to make and which it has not made,a judicial judgment can not be made to do service for an administrative judgment.
the analogy of a local zoning board to a federal administrative agency for judicial review purposes has its limits,however.when a federal court refuses to uphold a federal agency decision based on reasons the agency has advanced only after the fact,the court will ordinarily remand to the agency for further action.if the agency chooses,it may then reach the same result and defend it with new reasons.see akins,at.noting that a reviewing court unsatisfied with the reasons given for an agency decision will set aside the agency action and remand the though the agency might later,in the exercise of its lawful discretion,reach the same result for a different reason.courts remand to agencies in such cases because,among other reasons,congress has committed to the agency the task of policymaking where the governing statute is not clear.see chenery,at.for purposes of affirming no less than reversing its orders,an appellate court can not intrude upon the domain which congress has exclusively entrusted to an administrative agency.
although congress in the telecommunications act left intact some of local zoning boards authority under state law,we do not think it meant to provide for them as much deference as a federal agency receives,nor to give them new policymaking authority under the act.the statutory requirements that the board act within a reasonable period of time,and that the reviewing court hear and decide the action on an expedited basis,indicate that congress did not intend multiple rounds of decisions and litigation,in which a court rejects one reason and then gives the board the opportunity,if it chooses,to proffer another.instead,in the majority of cases the proper remedy for a zoning board decision that violates the act will be an order,like the one the district court issued in this case,instructing the board to authorize construction.see brehmer planning,cir discussing and approving decisions by the majority of district courts granting injunctive relief in telecommunications act cases cellular.town of oyster bay,cir same.
in short,a board decision may not present a moving target and a board will not ordinarily receive a second chance.in addition to preventing undue delay,this approach gives the applicant a fair chance to respond to the board reasons,and perhaps satisfy the board,without first having,literally,to make a federal case out of the dispute.thus,we will not uphold a board denial of a permit on grounds that it did not present in its written decision.as we discuss later,however,the appropriate remedy in that situation may not always be an injunction,but may sometimes be a remand,depending on the nature of the board decision and the circumstances of the case.
apart from its instructions to local zoning authorities,congress has also specified the terms of judicial review.these terms themselves amount to an allocation of decisional authority between the local boards and the federal courts.the standards by which district courts,and this court,review state and local decisions under the act are not unitary.the scope of judicial review depends on the nature of the issue presented and the statutory limitation involved.
the,and unreasonable delay provisions,c b i ii,present questions that a federal district court determines in the first instance without any deference to the board.any or all of these questions may well require evidence to be presented in court that is outside of the administrative record compiled by the local authority.amherst,at.if the district court then grants summary judgment,our review of the grant is de novo as well.id.at.if the district court makes evidentiary findings on such claims that go beyond the administrative record,then we will review its factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.
by contrast,where judicial review is on the issue of whether the board written decision is supported by substantial evidence in the record,then judicial review is confined to the administrative reco
