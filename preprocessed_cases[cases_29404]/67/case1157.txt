this case concerns who is responsible for certain environmental costs.industrial partners,the plaintiff,claims that an environmental assessment of a parcel of land performed by warzyn,the predecessor of defendant montgomery watson americas,montgomery,was deficient insofar as it failed to reveal to the full extent of contamination and costs.the property in question was called the chicago enterprise center the property,which purchased after receiving warzyn report in.later,when it decided to refinance the property in,conducted another environmental assessment of the land.the new assessor discovered contamination that was present in but that warzyn had not detected.sued montgomery,warzyn successor,claiming negligent misrepresentation on warzyn part,but the district court ruled that its evidence of damages was insufficient and dismissed the case with prejudice.we affirm.
in february,an entity called the prime group,not to be confused with plaintiff,hired warzyn to conduct an environmental assessment of the property,a stretch of industrial land in south chicago,to determine whether the property had unknown environmental hazards or problems.the property would soon be bought by a new partnership to be known as.as planned,purchased the property after warzyn issued its final reports in june of.
as part of its assessment,warzyn conducted a evaluation of the property,including a site visit,an historical records search,a review of previous reports about the property,an investigation of information from state and federal sources relevant to the property,soil testing,soil boring,installation of monitoring wells,analyses of decontamination procedures,water level measurements,ground water sampling,pcb wipe sampling procedures and other field testing.warzyn concluded that there were still unreviewed areas in the property,but based on the scope of the work that the prime group had commissioned,it did not investigate these additional areas.
warzyn published two reports for the prime group in june of.the reports identified some contamination,focusing in particular on two sections of land identified as and within the property that were part of a major area of concern south of building s.the prime group had expected warzyn to retrieve sanborn fire maps for the property,but warzyn reported that such maps were unavailable.at some point after warzyn assessment,the parties learned that this was incorrect,and that sanborn maps were available for the years,and.the sanborn maps for and showed underground storage tanks on the property.the later two sanborn maps showed none of these tanks.
after issuing its reports,warzyn sent a short letter to the prime group noting that warzyn had developed a proposal to quantify the extent of contamination identified.neither the reports nor the letter stated that warzyn had taken the next step and quantified the full environmental remediation costs for the property.instead,the reports and the letter identify some costs for cleaning up some of the identified contamination.in context,it appears that the costs may relate to the major area of concern near building s,because the cost discussion follows immediately after the discussion of the building s area.that area is not a part of the property at issue in this litigation.
between and,two other environmental assessment were done on the by dunn corporation in and one by carlson environmental,in.also during this time,subdivided and sold significant sections of the property.taken together,these sales yielded millions of dollars in profits for.
was nevertheless displeased to learn that the property had more environmental contamination than it had been led to believe before its initial purchase.in,sued montgomery.then in,several of the entities that had purchased sections of the property joined the suit as plaintiffs.also in,montgomery filed a claim against the prime group pursuant to an indemnification provision in the agreement between the prime group and warzyn.in,the district court dismissed the claims brought by the plaintiffs.no claims have been filed between and the prime group.this is important because a defendant impleader under fed.civ.of a party that is not diverse from the plaintiff does not destroy jurisdiction.see b.
although filed its complaint against montgomery in,the litigation dragged on for several years.in,montgomery made two motions in limine about the standard of damages the district court should employ,questioning whether would be able to satisfy its burden of proof under the appropriate standard.the district court expressed serious doubts about the ability of to provide evidence of damages.then filed a memorandum of evidence on damages that it will present at trial.after montgomery filed a responsive brief,the district court concluded that plaintiff can not offer proof of all necessary parameters of the damages calculation,and therefore plaintiff is barred from presenting evidence of damages at trial and dismissed the case with prejudice,in substance granting summary judgment in montgomery favor.appeals its dismissal to this court.we note that montgomery claim for indemnification against the prime group is still pending in the district court,which would ordinarily mean that the judgment is not yet final in this case for purposes of.here,however,the court issued an order under fed.civ.b certifying that all claims between and montgomery were resolved and there was no just reason for delay for purposes of appeal.our appellate jurisdiction is therefore secure.
because the district court jurisdiction was based on diversity of citizenship,a,we look to state law here,that of illinois for the rules of decision.see mcclain fiberglas,cir specifically addressing the question of whether evidence supports an award of damages.the illinois supreme court allows suits alleging negligent misrepresentation where the defendant is in the business of supplying information for the guidance of others in their business transactions.brogan mitchell int l,moorman national tank.a plaintiff alleging negligent misrepresentation must prove the defendant made a false statement of material fact,the defendant had the intention to induce the other party to act,the plaintiff relied on the truth of the statements,damage to the other party resulting from such reliance,and the defendant owes a duty to the plaintiff to communicate accurate information.board of educ.a,c s.at issue in this appeal is the fourth element,damage resulting from such reliance.
the illinois state courts have not adopted a particular approach to damages for negligent misrepresentation cases.montgomery argued before the district court that the proper measure of damages here is the diminution of value of the land at issue,while asked the district court to adopt the damages standard set forth in of the second restatement of torts.the district court agreed with and looked to for its standard.
this court faced a similar lack of standards for damages in a diversity action in trytko hubbell,cir.in trytko,the plaintiff brought a negligent misrepresentation action under indiana law.id.at.the trytko court noted that a lthough the indiana supreme court adopted of the restatement describing the elements of the tort of negligent misrepresentation,no indiana court has discussed or adopted view of damages.nevertheless,the restatement,in its stature,seems an appropriate starting point for our discussion.id.at.the trytko court,consistently with many others,adopted and its commentary as the proper standard of damages,including that section limitation of damages in negligent misrepresentation cases to reliance damages only,not expectancy damages.id.at citing.see also becker painewebber,cir cunha ward foods,cir battenfeld of am.holding baird,kurtz dobson,d,rosales v.at t information systems,first interstate bank of gallup foutz,law offices of stockler rose.
we agree with the district court that if illinois courts were to address the issue of standard of damages in a negligent misrepresentation action,they likely would adopt as their standard.section reads
