background 
new par provides cellular telephone service in the greater detroit area,including the city of saginaw,in accordance with a license issued by the federal communications commission fcc.to improve its cellular coverage in the area,new par obtained a property the property in saginaw with the intent of erecting a cellular telephone monopole.appellee br.at.the property has a frontage of sixty feet,and it is approximately square feet.originally,the property was zoned for residential use,but it is currently zoned for light industrial use however,under the zoning code,properties must have a minimum frontage of feet and a minimum square footage of feet.in march,new par submitted an application for a building permit for the cellular tower with the city of saginaw.because the property did not meet the minimum size requirements,saginaw denied the application.on april,therefore,new par sought a variance from the saginaw zoning board of appeals the board from the minimum size requirements.
the board considered new par request for a variance at its meetings on may,and june.at the meetings,new par explained that it needed the property to fill a gap in its coverage area because there were no reasonable alternative sites.a few board members and neighbors asked questions,and new par agreed to look into a proposed alternative site and to landscape the area around the tower base.on june,the board denied new par request for a variance of the six board members,two voted for the request,three voted against the request,and one abstained.on june,new par filed a complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan against the city of saginaw,alleging that the board denial of its request for a variance violated the telecommunications act of the act,as codified at et violated new par substantive due process rights and constituted a regulatory taking.both saginaw and new par subsequently filed motions for summary judgment.

in writing requirement 
new par argues that the board denial of its variance request violated c b iii because the denial was not in writing for the purposes of the act.the district court described the board decision in this case as follows 
in the instant case,the zoning board of appeals did not issue written reasons for its decision.it did,however,issue an order summarizing the request,the decision,and the votes of individual board members.the order does state that the denial was b ased on the facts presented and the board determination,both of which will appear in the minutes of this meeting.
joint appendix at op.and order emphasis in original omitted see also at.the district court then concluded,after reviewing some of the case law from other district courts,that the board denial satisfied the in writing requirement.we have not defined the in writing requirement of the act in this circuit,and we recognize that other courts have differed in their interpretations of the requirement.we now,however,adopt a definition of the in writing requirement similar to the definition adopted by the first circuit,and we conclude that,under this definition,the board denial of new par variance request was not in writing for the purposes of the act.
courts have varied considerably in their interpretations of the in writing requirement of c b iii.on one end of the spectrum are a few district court cases that interpret the act in writing requirement to require decisions setting forth the reasons for the decision and linking the reasons to record evidence.see,omnipoint communications,planning zoning comm n,d.on the other end of the spectrum,the fourth circuit has held that the stamping of denied on a zoning application satisfied the in writing requirement the city council decision was clearly in writing,and the district court could only find to the contrary by importing additional language into the statute.at t wireless pcs,city council,cir see also at t wireless pcs,zoning bd.of adjustment,cir.in a recent opinion,the first circuit carefully evaluated the opposing precedents and took a middle position,concluding 
the act requires local boards to issue a written denial separate from the written record.that written denial must contain a sufficient explanation of the reasons for the permit denial to allow a reviewing court to evaluate the evidence in the record supporting those reasons.
southwestern bell mobile,todd,cir.the todd court explained that t he requirement of formal findings of fact and conclusions of law has no basis in the language of the act on the other hand,permitting local boards to issue written denials that give no reasons for a decision would frustrate meaningful judicial review,even where the written record may offer some guidance as to the board rationale.id.at.
we find the reasoning of the todd court persuasive.we hold that for a decision by a state or local government or instrumentality thereof denying a request to place,construct,or modify personal wireless service facilities to be in writing for the purposes of c b iii,it must be separate from the written record describe the reasons for the denial and contain a sufficient explanation of the reasons for the denial to allow a reviewing court to evaluate the evidence in the record that supports those reasons.in this case,the board order denying new par variance request was separate from the written record,but it did not contain any explanation of the reasons for the denial.the order simply stated that b ased on the facts presented and the board determination,both of which will appear in the minutes of this meeting,it is ordered that new par variance request is hereby denied.at.therefore,we conclude that the board order was not in writing for the purposes of the act.
substantial evidence requirement 
the district court granted new par motion for summary judgment because it concluded that the board decision to deny new par variance request was not supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.we agree with this conclusion.we have stated that the substantial evidence standard of section is the traditional standard employed by the courts for review of agency action.telespectrum,at see also conf.t he phrase,substantial evidence contained in the written record is the traditional standard used for judicial review of agency actions.substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla.it means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.richardson perales,d quoting consolidated edison nlrb.this court reviews the entire record,including evidence opposed to the result of the decision.telespectrum,at citing american textile mfrs,donovan,d.
the saginaw zoning code authorizes the board to grant variances from the strict application of any provision of the code 
where by reason of exceptional irregularity,narrowness,shallowness,shape or area of a specific piece of property,or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary or exceptional conditions of such property,the strict application of the provisions of this ordinance would result in peculiar or exceptional practical difficulties to or unnecessary undue hardship upon the owner of such property.
saginaw zoning code a at.in order to qualify for a variance,new par therefore had to show that by reason of the property,application of the code minimum frontage and area requirements would cause new par peculiar or exceptional practical difficulties or unnecessary undue hardship.we believe that new par did make such a showing.at the zoning board meetings,new par argued that it suffered unnecessary undue hardship by reason of the property.a new par representative argued at the first meeting that 
with regards to the specific hardship suffice it to say that what we have here is a legally existing lot.verizon did not create this lot,did not split it off and end up with some small piece.it is a legally existing lot within the zoning district.i have looked at the permitted uses and special approved uses for and there is a single one that can reasonably or even remotely be operating on such a small parcel.the hardship is basically that it is impossible to develop this property for any use absent the variance.
at may,meeting tr.and a new par representative argued at the second meeting that 
i guess the bottom line is that the sic if you think of hardship what could anybody do with that lot that permitted i mean i do think that the size of that lot will permit anybody to do anything as a practical matter without coming in with a variance.
at june,meeting tr.as the district court found,new par proposed use is consistent with existing zoning,but the unique size of the lot in the rezoned area does not permit compliance with the frontage and square foot requirements of the ordinance.at op.and order.
in addition,new par meets all of the criteria listed in the zoning code for determining the existence of practical difficulties unnecessary hardships.saginaw zoning code b provides that 
b.in hearing and deciding appeals for variances,the board of appeals on zoning shall adhere to the following criteria in determining whether practical difficulties unnecessary hardships exist.
that if the property owner complies with the provisions of this ordinance he can secure no reasonable return from or make no reasonable use of his property.
that the hardship results from the application of this ordinance to his property,rather than from some other factor.
that the hardship of which he complains is suffered merely by his property directly,and not by others.
that the hardship is not the result of his own actions.
that the hardship is peculiar to the property of the applicant.
saginaw zoning code at.first,if the property can not be used for the kind of uses for which it is zoned,it seems likely that new par,or any owner of the property,will not be able to make reasonable use of the property.second,new par inability to use the from the application of the minimum frontage and area requirements to the property.third,new par hardship is suffered merely by its property in that owners of other properties zoned for use can use their properties for uses.fourth,new par hardship is not the result of its own actions,and,fifth,as explained above,new par hardship is peculiar to the property.therefore,as the district court also found,new par did make a showing at the board meetings that,by reason of the property,application of the minimum frontage and area requirements would cause new par practical difficulties unnecessary hardships.
the saginaw zoning code also provides that in considering all appeals and proposed variances from the code,the board must make the following findings 
a.the proposed use will be of such location,size,and character that it will be in harmony with the appropriate and orderly development of the surrounding neighborhood.
b.the proposed use will be of a nature that will make vehicular and pedestrian traffic no more hazardous than is normal for the district involved 
c.the location,size,intens
