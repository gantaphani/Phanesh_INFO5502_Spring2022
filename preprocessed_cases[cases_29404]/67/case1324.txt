julie rutherford brought this action to quiet title in three condominium properties she claims to own.these properties were the subject of a north dakota state trial court order entered against rutherford brother,robert rutherford.such order held the transfers of ownership between the brother and sister were fraudulent and therefore null and void.rutherford appeals the district court determination that her quiet title action is barred by the doctrine of res judicata.we affirm.
on may,robert rutherford assaulted dean kessel in the latter home in bismarck,north dakota.robert was charged with burglary and assault,convicted,and sentenced to serve four years.kessel brought a civil action in state court against robert for the injuries suffered in the assault.at the outset of the civil action,the state trial court entered an order enjoining robert from disposing of his assets.near the same time,kessel discovered three condominiums recorded as being owned by robert.on september,kessel filed and recorded a lis pendens against the properties,giving notice that a personal injury action had been filed against robert and that title to the properties could be affected by a judgment in such action.
in august,robert informed his sister,julie,of the civil action brought against him by kessel.on october,while robert was incarcerated,he appointed julie his.in december,acting pursuant to her appointment,julie executed warranty deeds transferring the three condominium properties to herself.the deeds recorded by julie show her both as grantor via her power of attorney and as grantee.julie contends,however,her actual ownership of two of the properties dates back to february and february.at those times,two deeds were recorded showing robert as the legal title holder,but julie contends she was the actual owner.she claims robert did not provide any consideration for the deeds and only held legal title in trust for her benefit.with respect to the third property,julie contends robert granted her a security interest in the property in february to secure obligations owed to her by him.she contends the december transfers pursuant to her power of attorney were to fulfill expressed or implied agreements between herself and her brother regarding her actual ownership of the properties.
the personal injury action proceeded to trial in april.during the course of the trial,julie sat at defense counsel table as her brother representative he was still incarcerated.acting pursuant to her power of attorney,she also controlled certain aspects of the litigation,such as paying attorney fees.when documentation was introduced showing robert owned the three condominium properties,julie said nothing about her alleged ownership.the jury found in favor of kessel and awarded damages.on april,the state trial court entered a judgment in kessel favor in the amount of,plus interest.
following the trial,both kessel and the rutherfords brought motions.of particular note,on september,kessel brought an ex parte motion to set aside the december transfers of the three condominium properties,alleging the transfers were fraudulent.the state trial court granted the motion,holding that the transfers were null and void and title to the properties remained with robert.on october,kessel provided robert with notice of the order.robert,in turn,forwarded the notice to his sister attorneys,who received it on october.on that same day,robert appealed the judgment entered against him in state trial court to the north dakota supreme court,and julie filed her quiet title action in federal district court.the north dakota supreme court subsequently affirmed the judgment of the state trial court.kessel rutherford,unpublished table disposition.
in the quiet title action,kessel brought a motion for summary judgment.kessel contended,in part,julie was improperly attempting to seek relief from the ex parte order of the state trial court and should be barred from doing so because she was in privity with her brother as a result of the power of attorney to act on his behalf.the district court initially denied kessel motion,concluding julie claims of a property interest in the three condominium properties was not identical to the issues decided in the state trial court ex parte order.in addition,the district court found julie was not in privity with her brother,but acknowledged it was a close question.
after conducting discovery,which included taking julie deposition during which she admitted sitting silently in court when the issue of robert ownership of the three condominiums was discussed,kessel filed a second motion for summary judgment.he renewed his argument that julie should be precluded from challenging the state trial court order voiding the transfers of the properties as fraudulent.the district court revisited kessel preclusion arguments,this time finding julie was in privity with her brother and concluding the quiet title action was barred by the doctrine of res judicata.rutherford rutherford,d.julie filed a timely appeal to this court.
the district court grant of summary judgment on the issue of res judicata is reviewed de novo.morse comm r,cir.for a claim to be precluded under the doctrine of res judicata due to a determination reached in a prior lawsuit,five elements must be satisfied.those elements are 
the first suit resulted in a final judgment on the merits the first suit was based on proper jurisdiction both suits involve the same parties or those in privity with them and both suits are based upon the same claims or causes of action.furthermore,the party against whom res judicata is asserted must have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the matter in the proceeding that is to be given preclusive effect.
costner urs consultants,cir internal citations and quotations omitted.julie contends none of these five elements are present in this case,and thus we examine them seriatim.
final judgment on the merits 
this element is satisfied.the state court action resulted in a final judgment on the merits.a jury awarded kessel plus interest,and a judgment was entered in his favor in that amount.rutherford appealed the judgment to the north dakota supreme court,and it was affirmed.see kessel rutherford.
robert did not specifically appeal the ex parte order setting aside the transfer of the three condominium properties.relying upon,julie argues the order was not appealable due to its ex parte nature.the statute states in part an order made by the district court or judge thereof without notice is not appealable.the statute,however,goes on to state 
b ut an order made by the district court after a hearing is had upon notice which vacates or refuses to set aside an order previously made without notice may be appealed to the supreme court when by the provisions of this chapter an appeal might have been taken from such order so made without notice,had the same been made upon notice.
thus,after receiving notice of entry of the ex parte order,robert could have asked the district court to vacate or set aside the ex parte order.if the district court refused to do so,he could have then appealed the second order.see beck smith,although an ex parte order is not appealable the party against whom it is issued can move the district court to vacate the ex parte order,and the court order denying such motion may then be appealable under the terms of section.see also prod.credit ass of minot schlak,the terms of section prohibit the appeal of an ex parte order and require an unsuccessful party to obtain a decision based on traditional adversarial methods,either on a motion to vacate the order or on a motion for reconsideration.
after receiving notice of the ex parte order,robert failed to request a hearing on the matter,or to ask the district court to vacate the order.if he had done so,he could have appealed the order.having failed to request a hearing,and consequently having failed to appeal the order,robert is bound by the judgment entered in the state court suit with respect to the issue of the fraudulent transfers of the condominiums.
b.the state trial court jurisdiction 
julie contends the state trial court lacked jurisdiction,
