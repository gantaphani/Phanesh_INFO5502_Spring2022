grubb,grubb ellis agreed to be gaedeke holdings exclusive broker in trying to lease the highland ridge tower office building the tower,a piece of commercial property located in nashville,tennessee.the agreement provided that grubb ellis would receive a commission on all leases signed during the term of the agreement,and it provided that grubb ellis would earn a commission on leases signed after the termination of the agreement so long as within ninety days of termination negotiations continue or resume leading to the execution of a lease with any person or entity with whom grubb ellis negotiated.ja.
barry smith,a broker for grubb ellis,served as gaedeke primary brokerage agent and in the fall of was in negotiations with,a potential tenant of the tower.when smith left grubb ellis in december,gaedeke terminated its agreement with grubb ellis.nine months later,gaedeke signed a lease agreement with bridgestone,prompting grubb ellis to seek a commission under the terms of the brokerage contract.the district court rejected the claim,concluding that tennessee common law required grubb ellis to show that it was the procuring cause of the lease and that this tenet of tennessee law trumped any contrary terms in the brokerage contract,including the provision.in our view,tennessee law places no such constraint on the rights of contracting parties to determine when a commission is or is not due under a brokerage agreement,and accordingly we reverse.
on march,gaedeke signed an agreement with grubb ellis to lease the tower,one of several pieces of commercial property owned by gaedeke in nashville highland ridge office park.among other provisions,the agreement contained the following terms 
agreement to refer offers and inquiries.on and after the effective date hereof,and thereafter during the term of this agreement,gaedeke agrees to refer to grubb ellis any and all offers and inquiries by prospective tenants and grubb ellis agrees to diligently investigate and develop such offers or inquiries,to canvass,solicit and otherwise employ its best efforts and services to lease space in the building.
owner reservation to preempt broker.gaedeke reserves the right to preempt grubb ellis and deal directly with a tenant with the understanding that should gaedeke exercise said right the commission otherwise payable under this agreement will be payable.
broker commission.
in consideration of this authorization and grubb ellis agreement to professionally use its best efforts to lease space in the building,gaedeke agrees to pay grubb ellis a leasing commission any commissions payable beyond ten years must be agreed to in writing by gaedeke.
gaedeke further agrees to pay grubb ellis a commission if,within ninety calendar days after the expiration of the termination of the term the property is leased to,or negotiations continue or resume leading to the execution of a lease with any person or entity with whom grubb ellis has negotiated either directly or through another broker or agent or to whom the property has been submitted prior to expiration or termination of the term.grubb ellis agrees to submit a list of such persons or entities to gaedeke not later than fifteen calendar days following the expiration of the term.
in october,bridgestone,which had been a tenant of other buildings in the highland ridge office park since,made a proposal to gaedeke to rent space in the tower.in accordance with section of the agreement,gaedeke referred the inquiry to barry smith.later that month,bridgestone broker joseph cherry contacted gaedeke about the proposal and requested that gaedeke negotiate directly with bridgestone due to their relationship.gaedeke agreed to the request and informed smith that gaedeke would be exercising its right under section of the agreement to negotiate directly with bridgestone but that gaedeke would need smith to work behind the scenes to bring the deal to a conclusion.ja.
on november,cherry sent gaedeke a lease proposal contemplating that bridgestone would lease square feet of space in the tower and renew and expand its existing space in other parts of the highland ridge office park.gaedeke claims that it forwarded this information to smith for his input and assistance,ja,an assertion that grubb ellis does not contradict.
on november,smith told gaedeke that he planned to leave grubb ellis effective december.gaedeke expressed interest in continuing to use smith as its broker,provided that he either became associated with a national brokerage firm or was willing to work for gaedeke directly.however,according to gaedeke,smith became difficult to reach and failed to return numerous phone calls and over the course of the next month or so.throughout this period of time,gaedeke continued to negotiate with bridgestone directly.
on january,gaedeke sent a letter to grubb ellis exercising its right to terminate the agreement with days written notice.in response to the notice and in accordance with section of the agreement,grubb ellis sent gaedeke a letter listing all individuals and entities with whom it had negotiated in its efforts to lease the tower property.the list included bridgestone.the termination became effective on february.
at this point in the chronology,the parties part ways over what happened next.according to gaedeke,negotiations between gaedeke and bridgestone regarding the lease proposal ended on march.and the period during which negotiations must have resumed in order for grubb ellis to obtain a commission ended on may.it was not until may,that gaedeke resumed negotiations with bridgestone.and the new negotiations,which proposed that bridgestone would lease just square feet in the tower and sublease additional space in the tower from gaedeke largest tenant,the tennessee valley authority,took on a materially different character from the negotiations that had occurred up until that point.gaedeke br.at.not until september,did gaedeke and bridgestone sign a lease agreement for the tower on these new terms.
according to grubb ellis,no break in the negotiations occurred,as negotiations between gaedeke and bridgestone continued unabated from november until the deal was formalized by a june,letter of intent.grubb ellis br.at.proving the point,it adds,the final lease is consistent with the proposal that barry smith first prepared for gaedeke in november.
relying on its chronology of the negotiations,grubb ellis sought a commission arising from the lease based on section of the brokerage agreement.that provision,as noted,says that grubb ellis is entitled to a commission if,within ninety calendar days after the expiration of the termination of the term the property is leased to,or negotiations continue or resume leading to the execution of a lease with any person or entity with whom grubb ellis has negotiated.ja.gaedeke declined to pay the commission,and grubb ellis responded by filing a action in tennessee state court.gaedeke removed the lawsuit to federal court on diversity grounds,and both parties filed motions for summary judgment.
in ruling for gaedeke,the district court did not rely on any one chronology of events or on the terms of the contract.it instead determined that tennessee common law establishes that a real estate broker earns his or her commission by actually consummating a sale of property,or by showing that his or her efforts were the procuring cause of the transaction.op.at quotation marks omitted.relying on several cases applying tennessee law,see ratner william morris agency.pacesetter properties,hardaway,robinson kemmons wilson realty,marx bensdorf hall,slip op,the district court held that grubb ellis was entitled to a commission under the contract only if it could show that it was the procuring cause of the lease between gaedeke and bridgestone.op.at.it then determined that grubb ellis was not the procuring cause of the lease as a matter of law and denied the request for a commission.
our standard of review is familiar.the granting of a motion receives de novo review,see wojcik city of romulus,cir,which requires us to determine whether there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and whether the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
as grubb ellis sees the matter,it has a contractual right to the commission under section of the contract.the district court erred,grubb ellis contends,by failing to appreciate the difference between a contractual commission claim which is at issue here and a commission claim which was at issue in most of the tennessee cases upon which the court relied and by writing a requirement into an unambiguously worded contract.gaedeke responds that under tennessee law,a requirement overshadows all brokerage contracts and prohibits a commission from being awarded when this minimum has not been established,no matter what the terms of the contract say.
in answering this question,we begin by looking at the contract.under tennessee law,a ll contracts shall be prima facie evidence that the contract contains the true intention of the parties,and shall be enforced as written.ann.when construing contracts,courts are to give effect to the expressed intention of the parties by construing the contract fairly and reasonably and by giving the contract language its common and ordinary meaning.black aetna,citations omitted see first tennessee bank ass resorts,wl,at.lexis,at,contracts are to be judged by an objective standard,what a reasonable onlooker would conclude the parties intended from the words expressed in the instrument.when the language of a contract is unambiguous,a court must interpret it as written rather than according to the unexpressed intentions of one of the parties.pitt tyree org.courts are precluded from making new contracts for the parties by adding or deleting provisions,warren metro.gov t of nashville,and generally may only enforce the contract which the parties themselves have made,pitt,at,even when the result may be thought harsh and unjust,jordan.
the relevant terms of the contract between gaedeke and grubb ellis leave little room for interpretation regarding the right to a commission after the agreement has ended.section of the contract says that gaedeke 
agrees to pay grubb ellis a commission if,within ninety calendar days after the expiration of the termination of the term the property is leased to,or negotiations continue or resume leading to the execution of a lease with any person or entity with whom grubb ellis has negotiated either directly or through another broker or agent or to whom the property has been submitted prior to expiration or termination of the term.
ja.by its terms,this provision gives grubb ellis a right to a commission on the lease of the tower long as within days after the expiration of the term of the brokerage contract the negotiations continue d or resume d leading to the execution of the lease.
nor does the contract anywhere require grubb ellis to establish that it was the procuring cause of a signed lease in order to receive a commission.section contains no such requirement,and neither does any other provision of the agreement.to the contrary other provisions of the agreement show that the parties contemplated circumstances where grubb ellis could receive a commission even though it was not the procuring cause of the lease.section of the agreement requires gaedeke to refer all tenant inquiries to grubb ellis but in no way prevents grubb ellis from obtaining a commission on all resulting leases,regardless of the brokerage company ultimate responsibility for producing the lease.and section allows gaedeke to preempt grubb ellis and deal directly with prospective lessors,though it still gives grubb ellis a right to a commission on all resulting leases no matter how little or how much it contributed,or indeed whether it contributed at all,to the sale.so far as the terms of the contract are concerned,they do not require an inquiry into whether grubb ellis was the procuring cause of the tower lease before it has a right to a commission.
yet that does not end the matter,the district court concluded.relying on a prior opinion from the middle district of tennessee,ratner william morris agency,the court determined that tennessee law prohibits brokers from obtaining commissions on real estate sales unless they are the procuring cause of the transaction.op.at.it is not clear whether the district court or more pertinently ratner conceived of this tennessee rule as an interpretive aid that applies to ambiguous brokerage agreements or as a common law rule that the parties could not contradict through the terms of a freely contract.for our purposes,it makes no difference.in either event,there is no such limitation on brokerage least when the brokerage contract specifically provides for a commission and sets out the prerequisites for obtaining one.
in reaching a contrary conclusion,ratner relied on two published tennessee,and robinson.while each of these cases applies a requirement,they do so in the context of a broker claiming a commission not guaranteed under a brokerage contract.take pacesetter,where the broker had an agreement with a property owner to lease his property.see at.during the term of the agreement,the broker found a prospective tenant,introduced the tenant to the owner and participated in the ensuing negotiations.the negotiations ended unsuccessfully and the broker term of agency expired on november.id.several months later,the property company and the prospective tenant resumed negotiations and executed a lease on may.id.although his agency had expired,the broker continued to contact the parties to stay abreast of the negotiations.id.the broker claimed a commission on the lease,not because of any contractual right but because he believed he was the proximate,efficient,and procuring cause of the lease.id.the court rejected the broker argument and noted that a broker does not have a perpetually vested interest in any transaction taking place between the customer and the principal.id.at.any rights that a broker may have,the court held,are limited to those transactions of which his efforts are found to be the efficient,procuring cause.id.at.but in pacesetter,the court concluded,negotiations were instituted in good faith after a substantial delay following termination of first negotiations,so the broker had no right to a commission.id.
robinson is to the same effect.there,too,the broker claimed a commission on a sale of property after the agency agreement had terminated,arguing that he had introduced the buyer and seller and that this introduction made him the procuring cause of the lease.see at.in rejecting the broker argument,the court observed that in the tennessee cases in which commissions have been awarded to brokers,such recovery was based either on the express terms of the contract with the broker,or resulted from some element of bad faith,sharp practice,fraud,or attempt to overreach the broker.id.at.finding no contractual provision entitling the broker to a commission and no bad faith on the part of the seller,the court overturned a trial court judgment in favor of the broker.id.at.
as these cases illustrate,tennessee requirement is not a sword that property owners may use to deprive brokers of contractually guaranteed commissions but a shield designed to protect brokers from being stripped of their commissions by property owners who fraudulently or in bad faith delay the consummation of a real estate transaction until after a brokerage agreement has ended.see pacesetter,at w hen a broker has commenced negotiation,the owner may not defeat the claim of the broker by removing the broker and completing negotiations himself.peavy walker,holding that a broker who diligently participated in negotiations was entitled to a commission where the owner delayed consummating a lease four or five days after the expiration of the brokerage agreement newman hill,in rejecting the broker claim for a commission,the court held that t his is not a case of the owner stepping in and secretly closing the deal with the agent customer for the purpose of escaping liability for the commission.
several tennessee cases,moreover,have upheld contractually based commission claims without giving any indication that the broker had to be the procuring cause of the sale.see hagan nashville trust,upon breach o
