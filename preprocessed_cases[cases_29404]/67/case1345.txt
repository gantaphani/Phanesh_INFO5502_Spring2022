background 
we recite the facts in the light most favorable to red,the nonmoving party.ruminer motors,cir.
red is a commercial property development company.rave owns and operates a chain of movie theaters.previously,red and rave collaborated on the construction,operation,and lease of a theater project in fort wayne,indiana,known as the jefferson pointe project.in march,red submitted a request for plat approval to the omaha city planning department to begin development of village pointe,an outdoor shopping center,located near and dodge street in omaha,nebraska.the omaha city planning board recommended conditional approval of the plat.at that time,the plat did not include plans for a movie theater complex.
in april,rave contacted red about a proposal to build a theater complex at village pointe.later that month,tom stephenson,president and chief executive officer of rave,and bob painter,chief operating officer of rave,traveled to omaha to tour the site with red representatives.from march through june,red and rave exchanged plans and discussed the proposal to build the theater complex.on june,at rave request,red sent rave a site plan and proposal for village pointe,which included a movie theater complex.
in september,red revised and submitted to the omaha city planning board a village pointe plat that included a movie theater complex.on september,red bought an additional acres of land to incorporate the movie theater complex into village pointe.the sales agreement provided that red had a due diligence period to inspect and review the due diligence items.additionally,the agreement obligated red to obtain written evidence that the city of omaha has adopted a comprehensive zoning ordinance allowing the use of the real estate for retail purposes and that the real estate has received final plat approval from the omaha city council 
on october,at rave request,red faxed rave the june,letter of intent.in a letter from painter to red dated october,painter expressed his belief that rave was in agreement on most of all of the major issues set forth in the june,term sheet.painter concluded the letter by stating,i look forward to moving on to the completion of the lease documentation,which we can then take to our board for final discussion and,as you know from jefferson pointe,is our final step in the approval process.
the principal dispute in this case is the meaning and effect of a letter of intent dated november.red sent the letter of intent to rave detailing the proposed terms of a lease between the parties.on november,the parties executed the letter of intent.the introductory paragraph provides as follows 
the purpose of this letter is to express the intent of lessor to earnestly investigate and work in good faith toward an agreement whereby the lessor would lease to lessee the property described herein upon the terms detailed below.although this letter is binding on the parties as to terms herein detailed,should the transaction contemplated occur,this shall not be construed as either a lease agreement or an option to lease.until a definitive agreement the lease is executed,this shall serve only to detail the terms and conditions which would control these parties in a subsequent agreement should one be executed.if the following terms and conditions are acceptable to the lessee,please sign below indicating your agreement to the same.as soon as this letter of intent is fully executed by both parties,we will proceed to draw up the lease in accordance with the letter of intent.
on november,painter also sent a letter to rehorn,a red principal,which accompanied the signed letter of intent.the letter provided,in relevant part 
i have also sent a copy of the letter of intent to our attorney and told him that we all agree that this lease should basically mirror the jefferson pointe lease and that he should expect some communications from richard katz to begin the drafting of the lease for omaha as soon as possible.
as i told you,it is my intent to get our presentation completed in the next few weeks so that we can get this deal in front of the board by the end of the year,or early january,for their review and approval or comments.
early after the first of the new year,i would want to get terry parish rave vice president of construction together with your construction people for a visit to the site and his preliminary prep work on his construction contract so that we are ready for a pad delivery date from you by late may and a construction start date by early june.
following a public hearing on december,the omaha city planning board recommended approval of red rezoning plan and revised plat,which included the movie theater complex.at a december,meeting between rehorn and stephenson,rehorn,on behalf of red,advised stephenson of the approved plat.rehorn also told stephenson that red was going to incur additional significant expenses to accommodate a rave theater complex at village pointe.these expenses included purchase of the additional property and for removal of a gas line.stephenson,for rave,replied to rehorn that the village pointe project was a done deal.
by,the deal was not written lease had been executed.red pushed rave to close the deal.when rave asked about the urgency of signing the lease,red indicated that its financing package depended on obtaining a signed lease with rave.the parties continued negotiations in february and march.during this time,red began talks with douglas theaters as a possible replacement for rave.
on march,rave informed red that it did not intend to build and lease a theater at village pointe and that rave board had rejected the agreement.in august,red entered into a contract with douglas theaters for construction of the movie theater complex.red subsequently sued rave alleging various contract theories.after the district court dismissed the various claims,the instant appeal ensued.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,red asserts that the district court erred in granting rave motion to dismiss the express contract claim granting rave summary judgment on the implied contract claim granting rave summary judgment on the promissory estoppel claim and affirming the clerk of the district court taxation of costs.
express contract claim 
first,red argues that the district court erroneously dismissed red express contract claim because the terms of the letter of intent were sufficiently definite to demonstrate an objective intent to be bound in contract.according to red,the letter of intent bound rave to the terms set forth in that letter.a ny subsequent agreement between the parties would represent nothing more than a mere formality.red contends that subsequent actions by red and rave evince a clear intent to be bound by the terms of the letter of intent.
we review the grant of a motion to dismiss de novo,taking all well pleaded factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.katun clarke,cir.the parties agree that nebraska substantive law governs this diversity case.see diesel power,addco,cir.nebraska courts consider whether a contract exists to be a question of law.id.citing.nutrients,shepherd,solar motors,first bank of chadron.
under nebraska law,to recover for breach of express contract,the plaintiff must plead and prove the existence of a promise,its breach,damage,and compliance with any conditions precedent that activate the defendant duty.phipps skyview farms.to establish an express contract under nebraska law,a definite proposal and absolute and unconditional acceptance must exist.diesel,at citing viking broad.snell publ g.additionally,a meeting of the minds must occur at every point,with nothing left open for future agreement.id.citing cimino firstier bank.a contract is not formed if the parties contemplate that something remains to be done to establish contractual arrangements or if elements are left for future arrangement.id.quoting.nutrients,at.an informal agreement may be binding,despite the parties intentions to enter a formal agreement at a later time,only if the later,formal agreement contains no new provisions not contained in or inferred from the prior informal agreement.id.at citing reynolds maginn omaha iron works.
we consider the viking broad.case to be on point and controlling with respect to the existence of an express contract.in viking,a utah corporation filed an action to force a nebraska corporation into a merger based on a letter of intent prepared by the utah corporation and signed by both corporations.at.in describing the nature of the controversy before it,the nebraska supreme court quoted the seventh circuit,stating 
we have a pattern common in commercial life.two firms reach concord on the general terms of their transaction.they sign a document,captioned agreement in principle or letter of intent,memorializing these terms but anticipating further negotiations and appraisal of the assets,the clearing of a title,the list is endless.one of these terms proves decisive,and the deal collapses.the party that perceives itself the loser then claims that the preliminary document has legal force independent of the definitive contract.
id.at quoting empro,cir.according to the viking court,the issue of whether a letter of intent constitutes an enforceable contract is one of law.id.at.in keeping with its rules that intent in the realm of contract law is to be viewed objectively,not subjectively,and that in order to establish an express contract there must be a definite proposal and an unconditional and absolute acceptance thereof,the court held that the letter of intent was so cursory,indefinite,and conditional as to fail as a matter of law to establish an objective intent on the part of the parties to be bound thereby.id.internal citations omitted.the court noted that the letter of involved a million transaction 
recite d in numbered paragraph that it is with the nebraska corporation consent that an agreement and plan of merger would be entered into it declare d in the same paragraph that certain of the nebraska corporation assets,only some of which were specified,would not be included in the transaction and further,it acknowledge d in numbered paragraph that the merger might not be consummated.
id.based on these findings,the court held that no factual issues existed,entitling the nebraska corporation to judgment as a matter of law.id.
in reaching its decision in viking,the nebraska supreme court extensively relied on the seventh circuit empro decision.in empro,the prospective purchaser of a business assets filed suit,contending that the letter of intent obligated the seller to sell only to the prospective purchaser.the purchaser sent the seller a letter of intent to purchase the assets.at.the letter of intent stated that t he general terms and conditions of such proposal which will be subject to and incorporated in a formal,definitive asset purchase agreement signed by both parties.id.the letter of intent also stated that the prospective purchaser purchase shall be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent to closing,including,but not limited to the definitive asset purchase agreement and,among five other conditions,t he approval of the shareholders and board of directors of the prospective purchaser.id.the parties signed the letter of intent.id.when the prospective purchaser learned that the seller was negotiating with another party,it filed suit,arguing that the letter of intent bound the seller.id.
on appeal,the seventh circuit explained that p arties may decide for themselves whether the results of preliminary negotiations bind them,but they do this through words.id.internal citation omitted.in rejecting the prospective purchaser argument,the court explained 
a canvass of the terms of the letter the prospective purchaser sent does not assist it,however.subject to a definitive agreement appears twice.the letter also recites,twice,that it contains the general terms and conditions,implying that each side retained the right to make and stand on additional demands.the prospective purchaser insulated itself from binding effect by listing,among the conditions to which the deal was subject,the approval of the shareholders and board of directors of the prospective purchaser.the board could veto a deal negotiated by the firm agents for a reason such as the belief that the seller had been offered too much otherwise the officers,not the board,would be the firm final decisionmakers,yet state law vests major decisions in the board.the shareholders could decline to give their assent for any reason such as distrust of new business ventures and could not even be required to look at the documents,let alone consider the merits of the deal.
id.at.the court concluded that the prospective purchaser made clear that it was free to walk.id.at.
finally,the court commented on letters of intent generally,stating 
letters of intent and agreements in principle often,and here,do no more than set the stage for negotiations on details.sometimes the details can be ironed out sometimes they ca.illinois allows parties to approach agreement in stages,without fear that by reaching a preliminary understanding they have bargained away their privilege to disagree on the specifics.approaching agreement by stages is a valuable method of doing business.
here,the letter of intent expressly states that it shall not be construed as either a lease agreement or an option to lease.the letter of intent was not definite,as it contemplates that a definitive agreement may be executed in the future.furthermore,the letter was expressly conditional,as it stated that the terms and conditions detailed in the letter would control the parties in a subsequent agreement should one be executed.this same language also indicates,as did the letter of intent in viking,that an agreement might not be consummated at all.also,as in empro,painter letter accompanying the signed letter of intent indicated that board approval was necessary before rave could enter a definitive agreement.in the absence of such a definitive lease agreement,no express contract exists.
implied contract claim 
second,red asserts that the district court erroneously found that the statute of frauds bars its implied contract claim.according to red,the nebraska statute of frauds permits either a signed lease,notes,or memoranda signed by the party to be charged to satisfy the writing requirement.red claims that numerous writings exist signed by rave to satisfy this requirement.
this court reviews de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.huber stores,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence and reasonable inferences,viewed in the light most favorable to the party,show no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.
an implied contract is one that arises from mutual agreement and intent to promise,when the agreement and promise have simply not been expressed in words.an implied contract arises where the intention of the parties is not expressed but where the circumstances are such as to show a mutual intent to contract.turner fehrs.tractor equip.the determination of the parties intent to make a contract is normally a question of fact.such intent is to be gathered from objective conduct of the parties,language used,or acts done by them,or other pertinent circumstances surrounding the transaction.kaiser millard lumber,internal citation omitted.no implied contract can exist where there is an express agreement between the parties relative to the same.acton schoenauer,holding that implied contract did not arise between father and daughter in care for father wife because the evidence conclusively established that there was a refusal to contract to pay for the services even on the part of the defendant wife.
section of the nebraska revised statutes provides that e very contract for the leasing for a longer period than one year,or for the sale of any lands,shall be void unless the contract or some note or memorandum thereof be in writing and signed by the party whom the lease or sale is to be made.to satisfy,the memorandum must be signed by the party to be charged or by his or her agent actually or apparently authorized to do so state each party to the contract either by his or her own name,or by such a description as will serve to identify him or her,or by the name or description of his or her agent state the land,goods or other subject matter to which the contract relates and state the terms and conditions of all promises constituting the contract and by whom and to whom the promises are made.pallas black,internal quotations and citation omitted.
the memorandum required by the statute of frauds must contain the essential terms of the contract.reifenrath hansen.section 
clearly contemplates that the memorandum thereof in writing,shall contain within itself all of the essential elements which go to make up a contract,and,when essential elements of the contract are lacking,the contract must fail,because essential elements can not be supplied by parol testimony.the very purpose of the statute was to prevent such contracts from resting in parol.

here,the subject of the purported implied contract is a lease for an interest in real estate.without question,such a contract is subject to the statute of frauds.red asserts that the series of writings that satisfy the statute of frauds are the letter of intent the november,letter from painter and correspondence from rave attorney to red.
as we previously explained,the letter of intent is not an express contract,and neither can it support an implied contract.a contract can not be implied if it is against the declaration of the party to be charged or against the intention of the parties.see d contracts a contract can not be implied in fact if it is against the declaration of the party to be charged or against the intention or understanding of the parties,if the evidence is inconsistent with its existence or if there is an express contract between the same parties that covers the same subject matter.here,the letter of intent explicitly states that no binding agreement exists until a definitive agreement is executed by the parties.finding an implied contract in the present case would contradict the parties expressed intent as reflected in the plain language of the letter of intent.see budget,centronics,cir stating that finding an implied duty would contradict the express disclaimer of the letter of intent.
likewise,painter letter dated november,does not satisfy the statute of frauds.implying such a contract from the letter would be against rave intention or understanding and is thus prohibited.in the letter,painter merely expressed his future intentions,stating that it is my intent to get this presentation completed in the next few weeks so that we can get this deal in front of the board by the end of the year,or early january,for their review and approval or comments and 
e arly after the first of the new year,i would want to get rave vice president of construction together with your construction people for a visit to the site and preliminary prep work so that we are ready for a pad delivery date from you by late may and a construction start date by early june.
emphasis added.
for support,red relies on selected portions of the statement however,we must read the statement in its entirety.red notes painter statement that we all agree that this lease should basically mirror the jefferson pointe lease.but the statement goes on to say that his attorney should merely expect some communication from richard katz to begin the drafting of the lease for omaha as soon as possible.emphasis added.the remainder of this statement illustrates the indefiniteness of painter understanding.c are should be taken not to attach promissory and contractual effect to what was at the time merely an expression of intention concerning future action.thomas kearney little league baseball ass n,internal quotations and citation omitted.
similarly,the correspondence from rave attorney,either alone or combined with the aforementioned writings,is insufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds.in the correspondence,rave attorney indicated that rave needed to get the lease signed prior to their financing,which was to occur in january or february.in addition,rave attorney informed red that rave wanted to move quickly towards execution.nothing in this correspondence deviates from the understanding expressed in the parties letter of intent.the goal was to work towards a definitive lease agreement.the parties never reached that goal.on this record,red can not transform the parties incomplete negotiations into a finished lease agreement.
therefore,we hold that red implied contract claim fails as a matter of law,as no writing exists to satisfy the statute of frauds.
promissory estoppel claim 
third,red argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to rave on red promissory estoppel claim.specifically,red contends that the district court erroneously found,as a matter of law,that red did not establish a promise upon which it could reasonably rely.red asserts that whether a promise has been made or reasonably relied are questions of fact for a jury to decide.moreover,red contends that the district court also erroneously ruled that the statute of frauds bars red promissory estoppel claim.
the nebraska supreme court defines promissory estoppel as 
a promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.the remedy granted for breach may be limited as justice requires.
yankton prod.credit ass larsen,quoting restatement second of contracts at.
promissory estoppel requires evidence that the promisor made a promise to the promisee.a statement of opinion or future intent is insufficient to give rise to a promise.maxwell,kenney deans,no,wl,at,unpublished quoting richard lord,williston on contracts,at ed.see also city of joseph sw.bell,cir a supposed promise that is wholly illusory or a mere expression of intention,hope,desire,or opinion,which shows no real commitment,can not be expected to induce reliance.internal quotations and citation omitted.in addition,p romissory estoppel can not be based on preliminary negotiations and discussions or an agreement to negotiate the terms of a contract.id.at quoting keil glacier park,alteration in maxwell.
promissory estoppel also requires that the promisee reliance on the promise be reasonable and foreseeable.rosnick dinsmore.for example,in abboud michals,the court held that the plaintiffs reliance on the defendant oral representations was not reasonable because,as licensed real estate agents and brokers,the plaintiffs knew that contracts for commission must be in writing under state law.id.at discussing reasonable reliance in a claim for fraudulent misrepresentation see also weiner hazer,weiner was a licensed real estate broker,charged with knowledge of concerning the necessity of a written contract for a specified real estate commission.under the circumstances,weiner could not in good faith rely on an oral contract for payment of a real estate commission to a broker.
the statute of frauds may bar a plaintiff claim for promissory estoppel.see farmland serv.coop,klein.in farmland,the plaintiff sought damages for the defendants br
