citifinancial mortgage assigned its interest in a mortgage to two business as the patrick group but never delivered the original or a copy of the underlying note.when the patrick group tried to foreclose on the mortgage in illinois state court,its action was dismissed because it could not produce the note.after an unsuccessful appeal,the patrick group filed this lawsuit against citifinancial.the suit was removed to federal court,and the district court granted summary judgment in favor of citifinancial.
we reverse.the district court based its decision primarily on a determination that citifinancial never agreed to deliver the note as part of the parties agreement to transfer the mortgage.but whether they agreed on this term is a question of fact,and the patrick group presented enough evidence from which a reasonable fact finder could conclude that it was a part of the parties agreement.the district court alternative basis for summary citifinancial alleged breach did not cause the patrick group also erroneous.under the circumstances of this case,the causation question should have been resolved in the patrick group favor as a matter of law the state trial and appellate courts rejected the patrick group foreclosure action because without a copy of the note,it could not prove it was the holder of the debt the mortgage secured.
background 
in november citifinancial initiated proceedings in state court to foreclose on a mortgage secured by residential property in illinois around the same time,patrick cogswell and patrick,who at the time were doing business as the patrick group,approached citifinancial and offered to purchase the mortgage and the underlying note.the parties settled on a purchase price of,and in january citifinancial assigned its interest in the mortgage and the note to the patrick group.the original note and mortgage could not be located,however,and while citifinancial was able to give the patrick group a copy of the mortgage,it did not have a copy of the note.
after the assignment,the patrick group stepped into citifinancial shoes in the foreclosure proceeding but quickly ran into problems.the current owners of the property had not discovered citifinancial mortgage lien in their title search,and further inquiry revealed a gap in the recorded ownership of the mortgage.the original mortgagee,equity mortgage,assigned the mortgage to fleet finance,but the next recorded assignments were from home equity to citifinancial and from citifinancial to the patrick group nothing in the record indicated how home equity acquired the mortgage from fleet finance.since the patrick group could not produce either an original or a copy of the underlying note,the property owners contended that the patrick group was not a mortgagee entitled to foreclose upon the property within the meaning of.comp.stat.
the patrick group introduced testimony and citifinancial computer records at trial in an effort to prove it was entitled to enforce the note,but the state trial court sided with the property owners and entered a directed verdict against the patrick group.the illinois appellate court affirmed.the appellate court observed that under illinois law only the holder of a note may foreclose on property transferring a mortgage is not enough by itself to confer the right to foreclose upon property.see,moore lewis.the court concluded that the patrick group had not proved it was a noteholder because it never received the note from citifinancial or otherwise possessed it and therefore was not entitled to foreclose upon the mortgage.
frustrated that it paid to purchase an unenforceable mortgage,the patrick group filed this action in state court against citifinancial.citifinancial removed the case to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction.both parties moved for summary judgment,and the district court granted citifinancial motion.the court first concluded that the patrick group had not proven that the parties agreement required citifinancial to transfer the original or a copy of the note.the court also concluded that even if citifinancial was obligated to turn over a copy of the note,its failure to do so did not cause the patrick group damages.this conclusion was based on the court view that illinois law permitted the patrick group to foreclose on the mortgage even if it did not hold the note.the court entered judgment for citifinancial,and this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
we review the district court decision to grant summary judgement de novo.when the district court decides for summary judgment,as it did here,we construe all facts and inferences therefrom in favor of the party against whom the motion under consideration is made,which in this case is the patrick group.first state bank of monticello ohio cas.ins,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.summary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
the parties agree that illinois law governs this action.in illinois,as elsewhere,a claim requires an offer and acceptance consideration definite and certain terms performance by the plaintiff of all required conditions breach and damages caused by the breach,ass benefit,caremark rx,cir citation omitted barille sears roebuck.only the third and sixth elements are at issue in this appeal.more specifically,the first question is whether the parties agreement required citifinancial to deliver the original or a copy of the note secured by the mortgage when it sold the mortgage to the patrick group.the second question is whether citifinancial failure to deliver an original or a copy of the note caused the patrick group foreclosure action to fail.
a.the terms of the contract 
the patrick group maintains that the parties agreed citifinancial would deliver the note when it transferred the mortgage.the district court treated this issue as a question of law,drawing on language from our cases stating that t he question of the existence of a contract is a matter of law for determination by the court.caremark,at quoting arneson bd.of,mckendree.but this refers to the determination of whether the parties have created an enforceable contract,which turns on whether they described their essential obligations in definite and certain terms.id.at accord acad.chi.publishers cheever.the contract between citifinancial and the patrick group meets this test the essence of the parties agreement was to transfer the mortgage in exchange for.
the real question here is whether the obligation to transfer physical possession of the at least a part of the parties agreement.this is a question of fact.see mulliken lewis,whether a contract exists,its terms,and the intent of the parties are questions of fact for the trier of fact.citation omitted see also otto variable annuity life ins,cir estate of kern handelsman.accordingly,the pertinent inquiry is whether the patrick group has produced enough evidence to convince a reasonable fact finder that the parties agreed citifinancial would transfer the original or a copy of the note.
the patrick group has met its burden of production.in the district court,it relied on three pieces of evidence.the first was its letter to citifinancial offering to purchase the note secured by the mortgage this offer was subject to certain conditions,one of which was v erification of all documents including but not limited to the note.the second piece of evidence was the assignment executed by the parties,which provided that citifinancial grants,assigns and transfers all beneficial interest under the mortgage together with the notes therein described or referred to,the money due and to become due thereon with interest,and all rights accrued or to accrue under the mortgage.finally,patrick cogswell submitted an uncontested affidavit in which he testified that the parties agreed citifinancial was required to transfer both the original note and the mortgage to the patrick group.
as even citifinancial agrees,this evidence is open to different interpretations.but the district court analysis shows it mistakenly believed it could resolve the issue on the for summary judgment,when a reasonable fact finder could accept either party proffered interpretation.for example,the district court discounted the patrick group offer letter because it said only that the patrick group would have an opportunity to verify the note and was silent as to whether citifinancial would have to transfer the note.this does not conclusively resolve the issue.to the contrary,that the note was mentioned in the offer letter demonstrates that the patrick group believed that the transfer of the note was part of the transaction.
next,the district court discounted the language of the assignment by interpreting that document to mean only that citifinancial transfer red all beneficial interest under the notes and had no bearing on whether citifinancial was required to transfer physical possession of the note.the court interpretation is one plausible reading of this evidence but is hardly conclusive a reasonable fact finder could reject it in favor of the patrick group interpretation.
finally,the district court rejected the cogswell affidavit because cogswell also testified that he requested the original note and the mortgage on several occasions after the parties came to an agreement.in the district court view,this course of conduct indicated that any obligation to turn over the note did not arise as part of the parties original agreement.again,this is one possible interpretation of cogswell testimony,but it is not the only reasonable one cogswell might simply have been reminding citifinancial of its promise.the patrick group is entitled to have reasonable inferences drawn in its favor,akande grounds,cir,but the district court analysis shows that it essentially resolved the factual dispute itself.
citifinancial takes issue with the patrick group argument on appeal that it was entitled to the original note or a copy,noting that the cogswell affidavit and the complaint claim entitlement to the original.caremark,at finding relevant for purposes of determining whether a contract existed as a matter of law the fact that a party adopted inconsistent positions.this hardly makes a difference.for reasons we will explain in a moment,either one would have changed the outcome in the foreclosure proceeding.in addition,citifinancial argues that the patrick group course of conduct suggests that transfer of the note was not a term of the parties agreement.on this point citifinancial notes that the patrick group executed the purchase agreement and attempted to foreclose on the property without ever seeing the note.the apparent argument is that if the patrick group really thought copies of both the note and the mortgage were required to foreclose,it would have waited until it had physical possession of both of these documents on summary judgment this argument is unconvincing.evaluating the weight of the evidence is a task for a jury,not a judge,and the evidence here is not so that no reasonable fact finder could agree with the patrick group interpretation.see,wheeler lawson,cir.t he district court was not presented with a situation where it could simply interpret the contract as a matter of law,and as such,it is the jury responsibility to,in light of all the documentary and testimonial evidence,glean the intent of the parties and determine the terms of the contract.otto,at.
there remains one final loose end on this issue.on remand the district court might conclude that the obligation to transfer physical possession of the note or a copy is a missing term in the contract that should be supplied by a court as a matter of law.see,cheever,at it is not uncommon for a court to supply a missing material term,as the reasonable conclusion often is that the parties intended that the term be supplied by implication.courts are generally reluctant to imply missing contract terms this reluctance flows from a concern about mistakenly binding contracting parties to terms outside their agreement,architectural metal,consol,cir the more willing the courts are to interpolate missing terms,the more difficult it is for the recipient of a vague offer to interpret the intentions behind the offer.even so,the conduct of the parties or customary practice may suggest that the purchaser of a mortgage must receive the note,a copy,or other documentary evidence establishing ownership of the debt as an implicit term of the parties contractual understanding,especially since a party may not transfer its interest in the mortgage without transferring its interest in the debt.see moore,at.we express no opinion on this question.because the patrick group never raised this argument in this court,we leave the matter for the district court to consider in the first instance.
damages caused by the alleged breach 
the district court alternative basis for entering summary judgment for citifinancial was that citifinancial failure to turn over the original or a copy of the note was not the cause of the patrick group damages.the patrick group argues that causation is established as a matter of law because the decisions would have been different if it could have produced an original or a copy of the note.citifinancial maintains that because there were alternative ways of proving ownership of the note,the dismissal of the foreclosure action was not caused by its failure to deliver the note.
we begin with the observation that the particular causation question here is a legal,not a factual one.although the general rule is that the determination of causation is for the fact finder,illinois courts apply a special rule in claims where the asserted damage is caused by an adverse outcome of a judicial proceeding.see,cont l bank.in the plaintiff submitted a bid to purchase real estate in a bankruptcy proceeding the plaintiff claimed the defendant agreed to support confirmation of the bid in the bankruptcy court.when the time came for the defendant to so,however,the defendant remained silent and the bankruptcy judge accepted a competitor bid.in the ensuing action,the illinois appellate court held that as a matter of law,the defendant breach caused the plaintiff bid to fail.id.at.the causation inquiry,the court said,was a legal question for the court if the bankruptcy judge acted in his role as judge,not as fact finder.id.at.
under,as we have noted,the causation inquiry in this context is a legal question the state courts that rejected the patrick group foreclosure action were acting in their capacity as judges and not as fact finders.the trial court in the foreclosure action took the issue out of the jury hands by entering a directed verdict against the patrick decision the appellate court affirmed.these courts concluded that the patrick group failed to make out a prima facie case because it had not shown it was a noteholder,and in illinois the question of whether a plaintiff has presented a prima facie case is a question of law,people ex rel.sherman cryns.since the illinois courts acted in their capacity as judges,not as fact finders,this particular causation question is a legal one.
is also instructive because it emphasizes that in a action like this one,which turns on how the defendant conduct affected the outcome of a judicial proceeding,the proper question to ask at the causation stage is what a reasonable court should have done had the defendants followed through on their agreement.at.the inquiry therefore focuses on what a reasonable court should have done in the foreclosure action had citifinancial given the patrick group the original or a copy of the note secured by the mortgage 
this question turns on principles of illinois law.generally speaking,only a mortgagee can foreclose on property,and a mortgagee must at a minimum be the holder of an indebtedness secured by a mortgage.comp.stat.under the uniform commercial code,which illinois has adopted.comp.stat.et,a key requirement to being a holder is physical possession of the note secured by the mortgage.see id.b a defining a holder as the person in possession of a negotiable instrument that is payable either to bearer or to an identified person that is the person in possession.had citifinancial delivered the original or a copy of the note,the patrick group wou
