forest park ii then commenced this declaratory judgment action,seeking a declaration that the minnesota notice provision is preempted by federal law and violates the contracts clause of the federal constitution.forest park ii named as defendants the tenants association,a number of individual tenants,the commissioner of the mhfa,the minnesota metropolitan council met council,and the city of forest lake,minnesota.the tenants association filed a motion for a preliminary injunction,permanent injunction,and summary judgment,seeking to require forest park ii to comply with the minnesota statutes.the met council joined the tenants association motion,and the mhfa filed a memorandum in support of the public interest in the minnesota statutes and supporting the tenants association arguments against preemption.

on remand,forest park ii filed a postappeal motion for judgment on the pleadings,which the district court granted in part and denied in part.the district court granted forest park ii declaratory judgment on claim i of the complaint,concluding that of the national housing act preempts the application of minnesota statutes and to mortgages,as decided by this court in the first appeal.see forest park ii,at.the district court denied injunctive relief as requested in claim ii as moot,because forest park ii had already prepaid its federal mortgage and there remained no possibility that the defendants could interfere with forest park ii ability to prepay.on claim iii,the district court dismissed the abandoned contract clause claim without prejudice.finally,the district court dismissed the claim articulated in claim iv,concluding that,assuming the right to prepay the federal mortgage was a protected right for purposes,the state and local governmental defendants took no action in violation of that right that caused injury to forest park ii.the district court also concluded that forest park ii was not entitled to prevailing party status or attorneys fees under.

forest park ii argues that this court prior ruling mandated the entry of judgment in its favor on all claims of its original complaint.we disagree.in our prior opinion,we reviewed the propriety of the district court grant of the tenants association summary judgment motion and a permanent injunction that prohibited forest park ii from prepaying its federal mortgage until it fully complied with the state statutes.we reversed,holding that the federal law preempts the state statutes.forest park ii,at.we vacated the permanent injunction and remanded with directions for the district court to enter judgment in favor of appellant forest park.id.while this instruction is facially broad,it is necessarily limited by the context of the claims and issues decided in that appeal.
on remand,following our instructions,the district court entered a declaratory judgment in favor of forest park ii on the only claim that was fully addressed in the prior request for a declaratory judgment on preemption grounds as articulated in claim i of the complaint.the district court then considered the elements of forest park ii claim and concluded that there was no state action that caused injury to justify relief on that claim.the judgment on claim i,declaring that the state statutes are preempted by federal law,is not itself a legally sufficient basis on which to render a judgment in the context of claim iv.to enter judgment on a claim,the plaintiff must demonstrate that a state actor took action that violated the plaintiff rights under federal law or the constitution.
section does not provide an avenue for relief every time a state actor violates a federal law.city of rancho palos ve
