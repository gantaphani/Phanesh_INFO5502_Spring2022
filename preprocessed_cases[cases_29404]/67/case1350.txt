ron frithiof,kim hollrah,and melody harrell appeal the district court determination that a lease agreement between frithiof and harding county,south dakota,was invalid because the county commission did not hold a public hearing before approving the lease.frithiof,hollrah,and harrell also appeal the dismissal of their unjust enrichment counterclaim against the county.we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
on november,harding county reached a agreement with ron frithiof allowing him to collect,prepare,and sell fossil vertebrates he might find on acres of the county land in the badlands of western south dakota.prior to negotiating the lease,frithiof had been excavating fossils in the same general area pursuant to a lease agreement negotiated with gilbert cattle company and gary gilbert,the adjacent landowner.gilbert cattle company leased the acres from the county for grazing purposes.
the rent provision of the lease did not provide for a fixed annual payment,but instead indicated frithiof would pay 
t en percent of the actual selling price of any fossils collected from the lessor s property and which are sold by the lessee for a sum exceeding one thousand and dollars.lessee will pay such sum to lessor s within thirty days of such sale and receipt of the purchase price by lessee.
this rent provision is identical to the payment terms used in one of two exemplar leases the county provided frithiof attorney during negotiations for the lease,specifically,a lease the county reached with an individual named mike triebold in.
on august,the county brought suit against frithiof and his partners in federal district court.the suit alleged frithiof excavated the fossil remains of a juvenile tyrannosaurus to as the leased land prior to the year secured an million offer for tinker,and did not advise the county of the discovery during the lease negotiations despite having a duty to disclose such information.the suit contained nine counts sounding in actual fraud,constructive fraud,conversion,trespass,civil conspiracy,rescission,breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,breach of fiduciary duty,and one count for a declaratory judgment.the declaratory judgment count alleged in part because the commission failed to comply with various rules governing the sale sic of property owned by county when it executed the second lease the second lease is void voidable.frithiof and his partners denied the county allegations and brought a counterclaim for breach of contract and unjust meruit.
frithiof and his partners brought a motion for summary judgment arguing they did not commit fraud and had title to tinker pursuant to the valid and enforceable lease the county filed a motion for partial summary judgment arguing the agreement was invalid on three grounds a the agreement was actually a contract for the sale of public property,not a lease,and invalid because the county did not follow statutory requirements for the sale of public property b if a lease,the county did not follow the public hearing requirements under south dakota codified law rendering the lease void ab initio and c the lease should be rescinded based upon a mutual mistake of law.
with respect to the second argument,requires the county to hold a public hearing before authorizing a lease for a term exceeding one hundred twenty days and for an amount exceeding five hundred dollars annual value.in the district court,the county contended the lease had an annual value of more than five hundred dollars because frithiof removed a portion of the fossils before the lease was negotiated,and then later received an million offer for their sale.frithiof countered no public hearing was required because the lease should be construed as of the date on which it was made,and as of that date the lease value to the county was highly speculative and contingent upon the sale of fossils found on the land,and no sale had occurred.he further contended the county did not present any evidence to prove the value of the contingency.in the alternative,he contended the failure to hold a public hearing did not render the lease void ab initio but merely meant the county exercised its power irregularly and was estopped from rescinding the lease under south dakota law.see mellette county arnold,distinguishing between the irregular exercise of a granted power and a total absence of power,stating when an act or contract is beyond the power conferred upon a county,it can not be estopped.when,however,a county has power to act,it may be estopped by the acts of its agents although the method of exercising the power was irregular.
the district court granted the county motion for partial summary judgment and denied frithiof motion.the district court focused on the county argument regarding the public hearing requirements of.although the county complaint alleged frithiof received an million offer for the sale of tinker,the district court noted he denied receiving such an offer in his answer.instead,the district court indicated frithiof did not contest federal diversity jurisdiction which required the amount in controversy to be or more,and had alleged a counterclaim of unjust enrichment in the amount of.based upon those two facts,the district court concluded it was not unreasonable to place the value of the contract as an amount exceeding five hundred dollars.the district court held the county failure to hold a public hearing rendered the lease invalid ab initio.pursuant to the order granting the county motion for partial summary judgment,a final judgment was entered in the county favor,which also resulted in a dismissal of frithiof counterclaim for unjust enrichment.
frithiof and his partners filed a timely appeal.on appeal,they contend the public hearing requirements of do not apply because the county did not present any evidence of the value of the lease at the time it was entered.in the alternative,they contend the county failure to hold a public hearing was merely an irregular exercise of the county power and the county should be estopped from rescinding the lease.finally,frithiof contends the district court erred when it entered full judgment in the county favor without giving notice the counterclaim would be dismissed,or independently addressing the merits of the counterclaim.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.revels vincenz,cir.
frithiof first contends the district court erred in determining the lease was invalid for lack of a public hearing under because the county presented no evidence of the value of the lease at the time it was entered.we agree.section does not require a public hearing unless a lease is for an amount exceeding five hundred dollars annual value.because the statute does not further define the term value,we understand it to mean fair market value.in addition,we agree with frithiof contention the relevant time period for analyzing the fair market value of the lease requires it to be construed as of the date on which it was made,without regard to events which may have occurred subsequent to its execution thus,the value relevant to determining whether a public hearing was required is the amount for which the county could have sold the lease on november,as calculated on an annual basis,its fair market value on the day it was signed.
our view that the relevant inquiry requires us to determine fair market value on the day the lease was signed is buttressed by one apparent purpose of,which is to ensure public assets are not used unfairly to advantage private interests,that is,to prevent the county commission from entering sweetheart deals with select individuals.the circumstances under which meaning of value is disputed in this case are somewhat unusual we expect the more common situation in which a dispute about value would arise might be where a taxpayer sues the county alleging someone received a sweetheart deal without the benefit of a public hearing.in such a situation,it would be incumbent upon the county to show it received adequate compensation,fair market value.similar statutes in other states explicitly refer to fair market value.see.providing a county board has power to sell or lease real estate owned by the county and not required for county purposes at a fair market value after an open and public hearing requiring state agencies to hold a public hearing prior to the sale or lease of land or title to minerals,at which the evidence must establish by a preponderance that an appraisal of the item to be transferred reflect s the true,fair market value see also salt lake county comm salt lake county attorney,utah discussing the policy of preventing government from in any way using public assets for private purposes which requires counties to receive fair market value in any transfer of an interest in public property.thus,even though the circumstances of this case are somewhat unusual,in that the county itself is attempting to show a public hearing should have been held,it is still incumbent upon the county to prove the fair market value of the lease at the time it was entered.
the three allegations relied upon by the district court or the county as proof of the lease fair market value at the time it was entered are the alleged million offer for the sale of tinker the fact diversity jurisdiction depends on the amount in controversy being over and the allegation the unjust enrichment counterclaim has a value of.we address each of these contentions in turn.
a.the million offer 
although the district court did not rely upon the million offer for the sale of tinker,the county does.on appeal,frithiof does not deny receiving an million offer for the sale of tinker,but argues the offer is irrelevant because it was received subsequent to the date the lease was entered and never consummated.we agree.as discussed above,the relevant inquiry is the fair market value of the lease at the time it was entered,without regard to events which may have occurred subsequent to its execution.because the million offer for the sale of tinker occurred subsequent to the lease execution,the county can not rely upon it to prove the fair market value of the lease.
the county reliance upon the subsequent offer to prove the fair market value of the lease is based upon two flawed premises.first,the county appears to equate the value of a realized contingency with the value of the contingency itself.because the rent provision in the lease is based on a contingency,the lease fair market value is the value of the future chance fossils exceeding will be discovered on the county land and sold,as reflected by the right to receive ten percent of their sale price.equating the value of the chance with the value of the realized contingency is somewhat analogous to equating the value of a lottery ticket with the value of the jackpot.the two are not the same.similarly,the value of a chance at discovering dinosaur fossils on a particular parcel of land is not the same as the value of the dinosaur fossils after they have been discovered.in this case,the county failed to present any competent evidence of the value of the contingency at the time the lease was signed,such as testimony from an appraiser familiar with the value of leases,who could appraise the value of the right to receive ten percent of the sale price of any fossils in excess of that might be found on this particular parcel of county land.
at oral argument,the county took its argument regarding the contingent nature of the lease one step further by arguing should be read as requiring a public hearing whenever a contingent lease has the potential of resulting in future payments exceeding five hundred dollars annual value.we disagree.section only requires a public hearing when a lease is for a term over days and for an amount exceeding five hundred dollars annual value.the statute does not require a public hearing whenever future payments under the lease may potentially exceed five hundred dollars annual value.certainly,nothing compelled the county to introduce a future contingency into this lease.the fact the county complicated the determination of the lease fair market value by introducing a future contingency did not mean there was no ascertainable present value of the lease,and did not absolve the county of the duty to determine present value in order to determine whether a public hearing was required.
for example,if the county agreed to lease the same acres to a rancher for one year and decided the rancher payment would be any calves which two of his cows produced the following year,the county would still have the obligation to determine the present value of the lease by considering the chance the two cows would have calves,the number of calves they might have,and the market price those calves might bring in the future.the county could not wait until the following year to evaluate the lease at because the two cows did not have calves,or at because the cows each had two calves.
the county second flawed premise is the notion the fair market value of the lease is affected by the information known to frithiof at the time the lease was negotiated,which the county alleges he had a duty to disclose.we disagree.whether frithiof acted fraudulently,whether he had a duty to disclose certain information during the negotiations for the lease which he did not,and whether his alleged fraud may give rise to an independent basis for invalidating the lease,are all issues that remain to be resolved in the district court,and are not before us at this time.for purposes of determining whether a public hearing was required under,we can not presume the presence of fraud before the county proves such fraud.thus,at this juncture,our analysis must be limited to what the county actually knew,without consideration of any additional information it alleges frithiof had a duty to disclose 
b.the amount in controversy 
the district court relied upon frithiof failure to contest the court diversity jurisdiction,and concomitant amount in controversy,as proof the fair market value of the lease exceeded a year.this reliance is misplaced for two reasons.
first,the alleged amount in controversy can not substitute as proof of the actual amount in controversy.such an approach is the epitome of circular reasoning.a party can not prove up its case simply by referring back to its allegations regarding the amount in controversy.zhuang datacard,cir when a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule,an adverse party may not rest upon mere allegations or denials.quoting.e.
second,in this particular case,the fair market value of the lease is not the same as the amount in controversy in any event.the amount in controversy relates to the full value of tinker,whatever such value might be.the fair market value of the lease is not the same as tinker value.further,as explained above,the estimated value of tinker is based on events which occurred subsequent to the lease execution,and can not be relied upon to prove the fair market value of the lease at the time it was entered.
c.the counterclaim 
the district court also relied upon the alleged value of frithiof counterclaim to conclude the value of the lease exceeded a year.the district court never explained how the value of the counterclaim related to the fair market value of the lease at the time it was entered.frithiof counterclaim is for the amount he and his partners spent in finding,excavating,preparing,and marketing the fossils.equating those costs to the value of the lease is like equating the cost of an oil lease with all the costs associated with finding the oil,capturing it,refining it,and the marketing costs attributable to placing the same in the stream of commerce.the two simply can not be equated.the county offered no evidence to establish a relationship between the value of a lease,and the costs associated with excavating,preparing,and marketing fossils pursuant to such a lease.
although the record in this case is bereft of any direct evidence of the fair market value of the lease at the time it was entered,the sparse evidence which does exist supports an inference the lease annual value was less than.frithiof refers to deposition testimony indicating the county customarily failed
