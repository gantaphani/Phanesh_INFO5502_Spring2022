inflection energy,llc inflection,victory energy corporation victory,and megaenergy,mega collectively,the energy companies appeal from the district court order granting summary judgment to walter and elizabeth beardslee and over thirty other landowners collectively,the landowners,and denying summary judgment to the energy companies.
starting in,the landowners entered into certain oil and gas leases the leases with the energy companies,granting the energy companies specified rights to extract oil and gas underlying the landowners real property the properties in the southern tier of new york state.each of the leases has an initial primary term of five years and provided for a secondary term that,once triggered,would last as long thereafter as the said land is operated by lessee in the production of oil or gas.app x.
the energy companies failed to produce oil and gas from the properties within the leases primary terms,and thereafter,in,the landowners filed this action seeking a declaration that the leases had expired.the energy companies counterclaimed for a declaration to the contrary.they argued that each lease was extended by operation of a purported force majeure clause,triggered they argued by new york state de facto moratorium the moratorium on the use of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing hvhf.
the district court ruled in favor of the landowners and declared that the leases had expired.beardslee inflection energy,llc,d hurd,judge the energy companies timely appealed.
for the reasons discussed below,we conclude that this case turns on significant and novel issues of new york law concerning the interpretation of oil and gas leases,a legal field that is both relatively undeveloped in the state and of potentially great commercial and environmental significance to state residents and businesses.accordingly,we certify two pivotal questions of new york law to the new york court of appeals,requesting its consideration of these questions in the first instance.
background 
the oil and gas leases 
this action concerns rights of access to the important natural resources underlying land in tioga county,new york located in the southern tier of new york and bordering pennsylvania,tioga county sits on the marcellus shale,a black shale formation extending deep underground from ohio and west virginia northeast into pennsylvania and southern new york.the formation as a whole is estimated to contain up to trillion cubic feet of natural gas an energy resource of enormous potential the formation has been characterized in recent years as offering one of the most significant opportunities for domestic natural gas development in many years.
beginning in,the landowners separately entered into the oil and gas leases with victory,granting victory certain rights to extract oil and gas resources underlying the properties for a nominal annual fee or,if drilling commenced,the right to receive a royalty on gross proceeds related to oil and gas extracted and sold,victory acquired the rights of drilling,producing,and otherwise operating for oil and gas and their constituents during the lease term.app x.it undertook no obligation,however,to drill.
victory shared its leasehold interests with mega.in july,inflection assumed from mega the operational rights and responsibilities under most of the leases 
each of the leases contains an identical habendum clause.this clause establishes the period during which the energy companies may exercise the drilling rights granted by the lease.the leases habendum clauses contain both a primary term,and an option for a secondary term.each clause provides 
it is agreed that this lease shall remain in force for a primary term of five years from the date hereof and as long thereafter as the said land is operated by lessee in the production of oil or gas.
in addition,each lease contains what the parties refer to as a force majeure clause,which speaks to delays and interruptions in drilling.that clause provides,in relevant part 
if and when drilling is delayed or interrupted as a result of some order,rule,regulation or necessity of the government,or as the result of any other cause whatsoever beyond the control of lessee,the time of such delay or interruption shall not be counted against lessee,anything in this lease to the contrary notwithstanding.all express or implied covenants of this lease shall be subject to all federal and state laws,executive orders,rules or regulations,and this lease shall not be terminated,in whole or in part,nor lessee held liable in damages for failure to comply therewith,if compliance is prevented by,or if such failure is the result of any such law,order,rule or regulation.
applicable state statutory law and regulatory actions 
article of the new york environmental conservation law,mineral resources,governs oil and gas production in the state of new york.envtl.conserv.law et.article of the new york environmental conservation law,environmental quality review,governs how state agencies address the environmental effects of their actions,including their actions with respect to oil and gas production.envtl.conserv.law et.enacted in and codified in article,the state environmental quality review act seqra represents an attempt to strike a balance between social and economic goals and concerns about the environment.matter of jackson state urban dev.seqra requires that new york state agencies prepare,or cause to be prepared an environmental impact statement eis on any action which may have a significant effect on the environment.envtl.conserv.law.when separate actions hav e generic or common impacts,regulations issued pursuant to seqra permit agencies to prepare a generic eis geis assessing the environmental impacts of those actions.regs.tit,a.if,after issuing a geis,an agency proposes to take actions not addressed by the geis but that might significantly and adversely affect the environment,it must prepare either a supplemental geis sgeis or a eis.id.d.
in,the new york state department of environmental conservation the department or dec issued a geis that addressed the environmental impact of conventional drilling techniques then in use the geis described fracs as the most common stimulation technique then employed to derive gas from the shale formation.that technique required using approximately twenty to eighty thousand gallons of fluid in a stimulation operation.geis at.
more recently,however,the techniques available for extracting gas have undergone a dramatic transformation as hydraulic fracturing combined with horizontal drilling has become feasible.hvhf also commonly known as fracking is an unconventional drilling technology which involves the injection of more than a million gallons of water,sand,and chemicals at high pressure down and across into horizontally drilled wells as far as feet below the surface.beardslee,d at.the pressurized mixture causes the rock layer to crack and the gas to flow into the well.see generally wallach town of dryden,wl june.
the technological development,not surprisingly,was accompanied by increased interest in obtaining permits for the combined use of horizontal drilling and hvhf.on july,in response to these paired developments,david paterson directed the department to update and supplement the geis the directive.he instructed the dec to ensure that it is suitable to address potential new environmental impacts from drilling,including horizontal drilling in marcellus shale formations.the energy companies allege that this directive marked the beginning of the moratorium 
over one year later,on september,the department issued a draft supplemental geis the draft sgeis,which quickly received extensive public comment and generated vigorous controversy on december,governor paterson issued executive order,entitled requiring further environmental review of high volume hydraulic fracturing in the marcellus shale the order.regs.tit.in the order,the governor observed that tens of thousands of citizens,landowners,local governments,and large and small businesses have expressed their heartfelt support for or opposition to the new technology.id.he instructed the dec to revise the draft sgeis and address comprehensively the environmental impacts associated with hydraulic fracturing combined with horizontal drilling in a prescribed timeframe.id.he further recogniz ed that,pursuant to seqra,no permits could be issued by the state before the completion of a final sgeis.id.
in response to these developments,inflection sent notices of extension to the landowners,asserting that new york regulatory actions constituted a force majeure event under the leases,extending the lease terms.on september,the department released a revised draft sgeis.that day,it also issued a press release informing the public that n o permits for hvhf will be issued until the sgeis is finalized and the department issues the required findings statement.app x.as of this writing,the department has yet to release a final sgeis.
prior proceedings 
on february,the landowners filed this declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the northern district of new york.they subsequently sought summary judgment on their claims,alleging that the energy companies did not drill any wells on the properties since entering into the leases,and that the leases had therefore expired at the end of their primary terms.according to the landowners,the energy companies could have acquired permits that would allow drilling on the properties during the primary terms using the conventional drilling methods described in the geis.they argued that nothing precluded the energy companies from performing any obligation under the leases to the extent there was any obligation to drill at all.finally,they argued that,in any event,the habendum clauses could not be modified by operation of the force majeure clause,even if the moratorium was correctly classified as a force majeure event.the landowners therefore sought a declaration that the leases had expired.
the energy companies for summary judgment,arguing primarily that the moratorium instituted by the governor directive prevented them from using the combination of horizontal drilling and hvhf that they characterized as the only commercially viable method of drilling in the marcellus shale during the leases primary terms therefore,they contended,the moratorium constituted a force majeure event it modified the habendum clause,and it worked to extend the leases primary terms until the state lifted the moratorium,whenever that might be.
on november,the district court granted summary judgment to the landowners,declaring all of the leases expired.the court found that the force majeure clause was not triggered by the moratorium and did not extend the leases.it declined to rule on whether a force majeure event occurred,explaining that even if it did,the force majeure clause would have no effect on the habendum clause and the lease terms.it reasoned that the invocation of a force majeure clause to relieve the energy companies from their contractual duties is unnecessary,because the leases simply provide the energy companies with the option rather than the obligation to drill.beardslee,d at.it also concluded that governor paterson directive did not frustrate the purpose of the leases,because the energy companies could drill using conventional methods.id.at.while acknowledging that the energy companies adduced evidence supporting their position that hvhf was currently the only commercially viable method of drilling and production in the marcellus shale,the court found that mere impracticality was not enough to trigger the force majeure clause and extend the lease terms.id.at internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.
the energy companies appeal.
standard for certification 
second circuit local rule provides a means by which our court may certify questions of new york law to the new york court of appeals.the regulations of the new york court of appeals permit that court,in its discretion,to entertain dispositive questions certified to it for resolution.certified questions must be determinative questions that are involved in a case pending before us for which no controlling precedent of the court of appeals exists.in re thelen llp,cir citing regs.tit,a const,b.
we have deemed certification appropriate where state law is not clear and state courts have had little opportunity to interpret it,where an unsettled question of state law raises important issues of public policy,where the question is likely to recur,and where the result may significantly impact a highly regulated industry.cruz td bank,cir internal quotation marks omitted.before we may certify,however,we make three inquiries whether the new york court of appeals has addressed the issue and,if not,whether the decisions of other new york courts permit us to predict how the court of appeals would resolve it whether the question is of importance to the state and may require value judgments and public policy choices and whether the certified question is determinative of a claim before us.barenboim starbucks,cir.
application 
under new york law,o il and gas leases or contracts stand on an entirely different basis from any other leasehold agreements.conkling krandusky,dep t.oil and gas leases are entered into in the context of a highly technical industry,which employs distinct terminology used by those in the business.wiser enervest operating,d.currently,however,there is a dearth of authority in new york relating to oil and gas leases such as those now at issue.id.thus,although this case turns on questions of contract interpretation that may not be the typical material for certification,because the dispute arises in a relatively underdeveloped area of law and because it implicates matters of public policy integral to the economic and environmental wellbeing of the state of new york,we certify the following questions to the new york court of appeals,based on the motion for summary judgment and accompanying submissions first,whether,in the context of an oil and gas lease,the state moratorium amounted to a force majeure event and second,if so,whether the force majeure clause modifies the habendum clause and extends the primary terms of the leases.we explain below why these questions admit of no clear answer under new york law,and why they warrant certification.
was the moratorium a force majeure event 
virtually every lease was executed more than five years before the landowners brought suit in.the energy companies never drilled on any of the landowners properties,let alone produced oil or gas.absent some exception or modification to the primary terms in the habendum clauses,therefore,each lease had expired by 
the first issue,then,is whether the moratorium qualified as a force majeure event.the force majeure clause provides,in relevant part,that when an order,rule,regulation,requisition or necessity of the government,or other cause that is beyond the control of lessee causes delay or interruption of drilling or other operations under the lease,the time of such delay or interruption shall not be counted against lessee,anything in this lease to the contrary notwithstanding.app x.
determining whether the moratorium was a force majeure event under the leases requires examination of whether regulatory actions barring commercially viable drilling but not all drilling can constitute such an event.the energy companies allege and landowners do not seriously dispute that the combined use of hvhf and horizontal drilling is currently the only commercially viable read profitable method of drilling in the marcellus shale.but the leases almost all of which appear to have been executed before current fracking methods were fully developed do not explicitly note the type of drilling they permit.nor do they excuse the energy companies from paying rent during the primary period if drilling produces nothing,or from paying royalties if the royalties due pale in comparison to those that might be derived from a fracked well nevertheless,the energy companies argue that the purpose of every oil and gas lease,including theirs,is to achieve paying production,and that requiring them in effect to drill at a loss would violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that new york law acknowledge
