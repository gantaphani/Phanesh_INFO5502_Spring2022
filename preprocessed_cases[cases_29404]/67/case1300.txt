for their first issue on appeal,the knutsons argue that none of their federal constitutional claims is barred by the rooker feldman doctrine.we agree.
congress reserved review of final decisions to the united states supreme court,and such appeals can not be taken in the lower federal courts.as a consequence,a party losing in state court is barred from seeking what in substance would be appellate review of the state judgment in a united states district court,based on the losing party claim that the state judgment itself violates the loser federal rights,a rule known as the rooker feldman abstention doctrine.johnson de grandy,d.in recent years,the court has expressed some disapproval of the lower federal courts extension of the doctrine to overrid e congress conferral of jurisdiction concurrent with jurisdiction exercised by state courts,and supersed e the ordinary application of preclusion law.exxon mobil saudi basic indus,d.indeed,the supreme court has observed that rooker and feldman were the only two cases in which the court applied the doctrine to conclude there was no federal jurisdiction.id.at.lance dennis,d per curiam.one justice has gone so far as to declare the doctrine interred as a result of the unanimous opinion in exxon mobil.lance,at.stevens,dissenting.at the very least,we are reminded of the narrow application of the rule,confined to cases brought by losers complaining of injuries caused by judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.exxon mobil,at.rooker feldman is not simply preclusion by another name.lance,at.
in this case,the knutsons are not complaining of an injury caused by the judgment and seeking review and rejection of that judgment.exxon mobil,at.emphasis added the injury they complained of,and sought compensation for,in the district court damage to their property was the result of the alleged action or inaction of the city of fargo,not a consequence of the judgment wherein that court declined to grant the requested remedy money damages for the injury.skit int l,dac techs.of,cir.t he alleged injury for which plaintiff seeks redress stems directly from the state court judgment itself rather than from some separate injury caused by the defendant,cert.denied,d.we hold that the district court erred in concluding that it lacked jurisdiction under rooker feldman to decide the knutsons fifth and fourteenth amendment claims 
but that does not mean that the district court should have reached the merits of the knutsons claims,for to do so would have violated the full faith and credit act.under,the federal courts are required to give the same preclusive effect to state court judgments that those judgments would be given in the courts of the state from which the judgments emerged.kremer chem.constr,d.full faith and credit comprises the law of issue and claim preclusion and is not a jurisdictional matter.exxon mobil,at.this brings us to the knutsons second issue on appeal,which challenges the district court application of preclusion principles to their case.the court held that their fifth amendment claim was barred by issue preclusion and their fourth and fourteenth amendment claims were barred by claim preclusion.we agree that the knutsons are foreclosed by the statute from litigating their claims in federal court.
under issue preclusion,previously known as collateral estoppel,once a court has decided an issue of fact or law necessary to its judgment,that decision may preclude relitigation of the issue in a suit on a different cause of action involving a party to the first case.allen mccurry,d.under claim preclusion,also called res judicata,a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action.id.according to the terms of the,we apply state preclusion law in our analysis.see marrese am.acad.of orthopaedic surgeons,d.in north dakota,the preclusion doctrines operate to promote the finality of judgments,resulting in increased certainty for litigants and conservation of judicial resources.ungar state.
under north dakota law,issue preclusion will apply in a case like this one if the issue decided in the adjudication is identical to the one presented in federal court,the judgment on the merits is final,the party against which the doctrine is invoked in the federal action was a party in the state case,and that party was given a fair opportunity in state court to be heard on the issue.see baker,chaske,cir.the rule forecloses relitigation of issues of either fact or law in a second action based on a different claim,which were necessarily litigated,or by logical and necessary implication must have been litigated,and decided in the prior action.ungar,at.the knutsons contend that the issues are not identical and that they were not given a fair opportunity to be heard in the state court.
in their claim in state court,the knutsons sought just compensation for the taking or damage of their property under article,section of the north dakota constitution.state compl.at.in federal court,the knutsons sought just compensation for the taking of their property under the fifth amendment to the united states constitution.federal compl.at.as relevant here,the north dakota constitution declares that p rivate property shall not be taken or damaged for public use without just compensation.under the fifth amendment,nor shall private property be taken for public use,without just compensation.the language in the two constitutions is nearly identical,such that the north dakota supreme court has looked to both state and federal precedents in construing takings claims under the state constitution,and its cases on inverse condemnation under the state constitution bear some similarities to the federal analysis.wild rice river estates,city of fargo,citations omitted,cert.denied,d.we conclude that the issue sought to be litigated in federal court the city alleged taking of private property without just compensation was necessarily litigated and decided by the state courts in their consideration of the knutsons claim where they sought compensation from the c
