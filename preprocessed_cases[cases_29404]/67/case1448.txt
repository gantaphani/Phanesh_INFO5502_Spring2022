appellants,tenant association board,peabody tenant association,and housing comes first,brought this action against the united states department of housing and urban development hud and the louis housing authority slha.this suit was intended to address grievances arising out of the implementation of revitalization plans for the and clinton peabody public housing complexes in louis,missouri.
this was a very complicated case that involved a total of nineteen counts,all of which were maintained throughout the proceedings in the district court.the district court resolved one count in favor of hud after a motion for summary judgment.we affirm that decision.
the district court then held a bench trial to consider the remaining eighteen counts.after the trial,the court decided two counts in favor of the appellants and enjoined the appellees from spending hope vi funds on the clinton peabody housing complex.the appellees have not appealed the district court decision on these two counts.
the district court ruled in favor of the appellees,hud slha,on the remaining sixteen counts.the appellants have appealed the district court decision on eight of those counts.we affirm the district court decision on two of those counts and remand the remaining six counts for further findings by the district court.
this case involved three appellants.tenant association board and peabody tenant association are housing associations.the third appellant housing comes first,is a missouri corporation that engages in activities designed to help the homeless and encourage affordable housing.for the purpose of this appeal,we will not determine which appellant would be entitled to any relief that the district court could order on remand.instead,we leave that determination to the district court if it determines that the appellants have prevailed on any of the remaining six counts.
appellee,slha,is a missouri corporation,and a public housing agency.see b the term public housing agency means any state,county,municipality,or other governmental entity or public body or agency or instrumentality thereof which is authorized to engage in or assist in the development or operation of housing.appellee,hud,is the federal agency responsible for the administration and enforcement of various government programs designed to promote housing opportunities in the united states.the complaint specifically addressed each count against either the housing authority defendants slha or the federal defendants hud and we will consider these counts in that same manner.
in,the slha applied for and received a million hope vi grant to revitalize the,webbe elderly and paul simon elderly public housing complexes in louis,missouri the revitalization plan involved demolishing all existing units at the housing complex,and replacing them with a housing community.the slha did not proceed with the revitalization as promised in the grant application.as a result,hud placed the slha in default of its hope vi grant.the slha cured this default by developing a new revitalization plan in.like the plan,the revitalization plan provided for the demolition of the public housing complex.it also proposed the selective demolition of units at the clinton peabody public housing complex.the city of louis also applied for and received a million section loan guarantee for infrastructure improvements necessary to support the revitalization plan hud approved the slha new revitalization plan in april of and the city section loan guarantee in june of.
the portion of the new revitalization plan addressing the clinton peabody public housing complex was enjoined by the district court until such time that hud might determine that the clinton peabody development qualifies as severely distressed public housing tenant ass,et.louis hous,et,mem.op.at,emphasis in original.this portion of the district court decision has not been appealed 
the complex originally contained approximately units.when the revitalization plan was submitted only approximately of these units were occupied.at this time,all the original units have been demolished and the former tenants have been relocated.under the revitalization plan,the slha plans to replace the demolished housing units with a mixed income community.
the community will be composed of three types of rental units public housing,tax credit,and market rate rental units.the income criteria for individuals living in these units can generally be described in the following manner.public housing units are designated for individuals with incomes below of the median area income.the rent for these units is of the tenant family income.the tax credit units are designated for individuals with incomes below of the median area income,but the rent for these units is set at of the median area income,instead of the tenant family income.the market rate rental units will be rented at prevailing market rates and do not have an income threshold for the tenants living in them.in addition to rental units,the plan also calls for the construction of units.
appellants request that more public housing units be built at the complex currently,the slha plans to build approximately rental units not including units designated for the elderly,of which would be public housing units,tax credit units,and market rate units.appellants request that an additional public housing units be built.in addition,appellants want more of the public housing units to be built for larger families.
the crucial question in this case and on appeal is whether appellants have a legal basis for the relief they request.appellants argue that the appellees have not complied with the requirements of two federal programs and are acting in violation of federal statutes designed to prevent discrimination in public housing.the two programs at the heart of this dispute are the hope vi program and section loan guarantees.congress created the homeownership opportunity for people everywhere hope program to provide grants to carry out an urban revitalization demonstration program involving major reconstruction of severely distressed or obsolete public housing projects,to be administered by local public housing agencies,stat.the hope program is part of the united states housing act,et.the appellants are challenging the process involved in making,approving,and implementing the hope vi grant received by the slha.
the appellants also challenge a section loan guarantee awarded to the city of louis.the housing and community development act of created the community development block grant program.see et.as part of the community development block grant program,congress authorized hud to make section loan guarantees to local governments.these loan guarantees were authorized for a variety of purposes related to,inter alia,the rehabilitation of housing developments.see a.in this case,the city of louis a distinct and separate entity from the slha applied for a section loan guarantee to support ancillary projects related to the slha revitalization plans.these projects were primarily targeted at improving the infrastructure surrounding the developments,building new streets and sidewalks.the appellants are challenging hud approval of this loan guarantee because they claim the city obtained it through making inaccurate certifications.
also at issue in this case are federal statutes designed to remedy and prevent discrimination in the provision of public housing.congress required hud,and the secretary of housing and urban development,to affirmatively further fair housing in implementing programs for which it was responsible.e the secretary of housing and urban development shall administer the programs and activities relating to housing and urban development in a manner affirmatively to further the policies of this subchapter including the duty to achieve equal housing opportunities.congress also prohibited discrimination on the basis of race,color,religion,sex,familial status,or national origin in the sale or rental of a dwelling.a b.
the appellants argue that the district court committed three errors in resolving this dispute.they claim that the district court erred as a matter of law in granting hud motion for summary judgment on count xiv,which requested the court to set aside hud approval of the section loan guarantee to the city of louis.the second and third alleged errors concern the district court ruling after the bench trial.the appellants claim that the district court abused its discretion by failing to comply with federal rule of civil procedure c,which requires a district court,in a case,to consider any relief requested even if it was not requested in the pleadings.the appellants also argue that the district court abused its discretion by failing to make adequate findings of fact and conclusions of law,as required by federal rule of civil procedure a.
on appeal the appellants have,for the first time in this litigation,narrowed the counts upon which they seek relief.specifically,they appeal the district court decision on only eight of the eighteen counts decided after a bench trial on the merits.on these counts,appellants argue that the district court failed to make sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law.the first three counts allege that the slha discriminated on the basis of race count i,sex count ii,and familial status count iii.appellants also argue that the slha is conducting its revitalization efforts in violation of the hope vi program requirements counts vi viii.finally,appellants contend that the district court erred in determining that hud fulfilled its duty to affirmatively further fair housing and did not violate the administrative procedures act,a,c,and d when it approved the section loan guarantee and the hope vi plan without properly considering the impact these programs would have on fair housing counts xiii,xvii,xviii.
again we note that this is a very complicated case,made even more difficult by the parties failure to narrow the issues and specifically address each other arguments.after reading the pleadings,briefs and documents in this case,it is clear that the district court faced a monumental task in resolving this dispute.however,we are constrained by a to remand this case to the district court for a more detailed explanation of how it reached its decision on counts i,ii,iii,xiii,xvii,xviii.
we affirm the district court decisions on all other counts.in particular,we hold that the district court properly granted the summary judgment motion in favor of hud on count xiv.we also hold that the manner in which the district court handled the relief requested by the appellants does not constitute reversible error.finally,we hold the district court did not abuse its discretion by ruling in favor of the slha on counts vi viii,regarding compliance with the hope vi program requirements.
ii.motion for summary judgment 
the district court treated appellants motion for summary judgment on count xiv as a for summary judgment.this count challenged hud approval of the city of louis city application for a section loan and requested that the district court set aside this approval under the administrative procedure act apa,a,c,and d.the district court upheld hud approval of the city application and granted hud motion for summary judgment.
the city of louis applied for a section loan guarantee to assist with ancillary projects related to the slha revitalization efforts.these projects included improving the infrastructure at the housing complexes,adding new streets,utilities,sidewalks and green spaces,and demolishing and redeveloping an abandoned city hospital.in applying for this loan guarantee,the city was required to make several certifications to hud.
appellants argue that hud should have investigated the assurances made in these certifications and determined whether the city certifications were accurate.appellants claim two specific certifications were inaccurate at the time they were made.the first was that the city had in place a residential antidisplacement and relocation assistance plan rarap when it applied for the loan guarantee.see d.the second certification involved the city assurance that it would comply with the requirements governing displacement,relocation and the replacement of low and moderate income housing.see e.
we agree with the district court that hud did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in accepting the city certifications.we also agree with the district court that to the extent appellants seek to compel the city to comply with these certifications,the proper party to sue would have been the city,not hud.both sides have argued about whether these replacement requirements are even applicable in this case.like the district court,we believe this case can be resolved without deciding the applicability of these requirements to a hope vi project.even assuming that a replacement obligation is required,we hold that appellants have failed to demonstrate that the evidence presented creates an issue sufficient to create a jury question that hud acted inappropriately in approving the city section application.
we review a district court decision to grant summary judgment de novo.eddings city of hot springs,cir.in doing so we view the record in a light most favorable to the party and give the party the benefit of all reasonable inferences supported by the record.id.summary judgment is appropriate where one party has failed to present evidence sufficient to create a jury question as to an essential element of its claim.gentry,cir internal citations omitted.
under the apa,a court can set aside an agency action for several reasons.these include if the court determines that the agency actions were 
a arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law 
c in excess of statutory jurisdiction,authority,or limitations,or short of statutory right or 
d without observance of procedure required by law 
we disagree with the appellants argument that hud acted inappropriately in approving the city section loan application.we decline to reverse the district court decision refusing to set aside this loan application under the apa.as an initial matter,we note that the federal regulations state that hud will normally accept the certifications submitted with the application.c.given this procedure,there are several reasons why hud did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in accepting the city certifications.first,nothing in the record indicates that the city had a history of providing inadequate certifications or failing to comply with promises made to hud.secondly,the certifications were not contested by an outside party at the time they were made.finally,at least one of these certifications was forward looking,something that would make it very difficult,if not impossible,for hud to determine if the certification was accurate when made.
to the extent appellants are requesting this court require hud to force the city to comply with these certifications,the appellants have brought this case against the wrong party.we disagree with the appellants that the supreme court decision in wilder virginia hospital association,d,can be read to require hud to enforce compliance with the certifications made to it by the city.the court in wilder addressed only whether a state can be compelled to submit accurate assurances and findings to the secretary of health and human services as required by the medicaid act.id.at.the issue before the court in wilder was not whether the secretary was required to review these assurances or was required to enforce compliance with them.we decline to interpret the court holding in wilder to create such a requirement.thus,to the extent appellants feel that the city is not complying with certifications it made to hud,the proper party to seek relief against would be the city,not hud.
we hold that hud did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in approving the city certifications.we also hold that hud can not be forced to require the city to comply with the certifications it made.therefore,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of hud on count xiv.
iii.bench trial 
after granting the motion for summary judgment on count xiv in favor of hud,the district court held a bench trial on the remaining claims.the appellants maintained all eighteen counts during the bench trial.the district court resolved two of these counts,vii and xix,in favor of the appellants.neither the decision nor the relief granted by the district court on these counts has been appealed by either party.appellants have also chosen not to appeal the district court decision on eight other counts iv,v,ix,x,xi,xii,xv,xvi.as such,appellants and appellees have waived their rights to appeal the district court decision on ten of their original eighteen counts.
we will review only the district court decision on the eight counts that the appellants have appealed,all of which were decided in favor of the appellees.these counts can be grouped into three categories the discrimination counts alleging the slha discriminated on the basis or race,sex,familial status counts i,ii,iii the three counts alleging that hud is not complying with its obligations to affirmatively further fair housing counts xiii,xvii,xviii and finally,the two counts alleging the slha is not complying with the requirements of the hope vi program counts vi viii.
appellants argue that we should reverse the district court ruling on these eight claims because of two errors made by the district court.first,appellants contend that the district court failed to consider any relief requested beyond that stated in the pleadings in violation of c.appellants also argue that the district court failed to make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law on all eight counts,as required by a.
standard of review 
in an appeal from a civil bench trial,we review the trial court findings of fact for clear error.its conclusions of law are subject to de novo review.mixed questions of law and fact that require the consideration of legal concepts and the exercise of judgment about the values underlying legal principles are also reviewed de novo.cooper tire rubber paul fire marine insur,et,cir.a district court consideration of the relief available is reviewed for abuse of discretion.shen leo daly,cir.the parties agree that the district court failure to make specific findings of fact,as required by a,is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.medtronic,daig.
federal rule of civil procedure c 
federal rule of civil procedure c requires that,in cases,every final judgment shall grant the relief to which the party in whose favor it is rendered is entitled,even if the party has not demanded such relief in the party pleadings.emphasis added.appellants argue that the district court failed to consider all the relief they requested.the district court stated that t he court can only consider the prayer in the complaint,and therefore,any additional requests for relief made during argument will not be addressed.mem.op.at.this statement contradicts the explicit requirements of c.however,it does not necessitate remanding all the counts appellants have appealed.the failure to address all relief requested would at most constitute harmless error on those counts where appellants did not prevail.w hile a meritorious claim will not be rejected for want of a prayer for appropriate relief,a claim lacking substantive merit obviously should be rejected.holt civic club city of tuscaloosa,d.therefore,we decline to remand any claims on which appellants have not prevailed because of an error made by the district court in applying c.
we also note that the district court may have actually considered all relief requested and simply characterized that relief incorrectly.the court could have determined that any relief requested during the trial was also requested in the pleadings.indeed,the appellants seem to suggest that this was the case the relief outlined at closing arguments was not different from or broader than what was prayed for in the pleadings.instead,plaintiffs quantified and particularized the relief sought in their pleading.brief of appellants at.
on the counts we are remanding for further findings of fact and conclusions of law,counts i,ii,iii,xiii,xvii,and xviii,the district court should first determine whether the appellants have prevailed on any of these counts.if the district court determines that the appellants have prevailed on any counts,the district court should then consider all relief requested by the appellants.
federal rule of civil procedure a 
federal rule of civil procedure a requires a district court,following a bench trial,to find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law.the memorandum opinion contains several statements that lead this court to conclude that this rule was not followed.in particular,the court stated that it has determined that it would be impossible to go through and address each count in the plaintiffs complaint.mem.op.at.additionally,the court stated that counts,xiii,xvii,and xviii contain allegations of discrimination although the court did not analyze these counts,it would like to note that it found absolutely no evidence of discrimination.id.at emphasis added.for the reasons explained below,we are not satisfied that this statement provides the necessary analysis for us to evaluate the district court decision on these counts.
this court has previously stated that the failure to specifically state the facts upon which a decision was reached can be reversible error.if an appellate court does not know what facts the trial court took into consideration in drawing its conclusions,its findings become suspect.duffie deere,cir.providing for a meaningful appellate review of a district court decision is one of the primary purposes for placing this requirement on the district courts.squirtco,cir.however,we have also held that in some circumstances,w hile appellate review would have been simplified if the district court had made more detailed findings its ultimate findings are sufficient to meet the requirements of rule a.collins henderson,cir.
in reviewing the remaining eight counts,we do not believe the district court made sufficient findings to subject its decision to meaningful appellate review on the discrimination counts counts i,ii,iii,xiii,xvii,xviii.however,with regard to the counts asserting that the slha has not complied with the requirements of the hope vi program,counts vi viii,we feel that the district court made sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law to allow us to resolve the legal questions presented in these counts.
discrimination claims against the slha 
counts i,ii,and iii allege that the slha discriminated on the basis of race,sex and familial status,in violation of the fair housing act,a b,by implementing the proposed revitalization plan.in addressing these claims the district court stated a lthough the court did not analyze these counts,it would like to note that it found absolutely no evidence of discrimination.mem.op.at.
we recognize the district court found absolutely no evidence of discrimination.id.we also acknowledge that there may be cases where the evidence is so lacking that a statement similar to the one made by the district court in this case may be sufficient.however,the appellants presented evidence of disparate impact discrimination and we believe that the district court should have provided some explanation as to why that evidence is insufficient.see united states badgett,cir setting out the proper test to apply when analyzing alleged discrimination under the fair housing act.as such,these three counts are remanded to the district court for a more thorough explanation on the appellants disparate impact claims.
failure to affirmatively further fair housing claims against hud 
counts xiii,xvii,xviii all involve assertions that hud failed to fulfill its duty to affirmatively further fair housing when it approved the hope vi plan and the city section loan.in addition to the brief statement made by the district court in footnote,that it did not analyze these counts,the district also made the following statement 
finally,plaintiffs requested that the court enjoin the federal defendants to take all necessary steps to further fair housing affirmatively in the hope vi program.obviously,hud believes that it has taken all necessary steps to further fair housing.if plaintiffs are requesting that the court set out de
