this is a contract dispute between a real estate development company,roseland property company roseland,and the former head of its boston office,jeffrey nadherny.the district court,on for summary judgment,entered judgment for nadherny on his claims for declaratory judgment on the meaning of the contract.it also entered summary judgment for roseland on nadherny claim of breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.finally,it found nadherny suit for damages under the contract to be premature and dismissed that claim.both sides appeal.
while the district court construction of the contract may or may not in the end be correct,the rules of summary judgment preclude resolution of the issue now.we reverse entry of summary judgment for nadherny on his declaratory judgment claims,affirm entry of summary judgment for roseland on nadherny implied covenant claims,and vacate the dismissal of the contract damages claim.
roseland,a new jersey based real estate development firm,opened a boston office in in order to develop real estate projects in the boston area.in doing so,they hired nadherny to head the boston office as their main developer.the employment contract at issue in this case was the result of months of negotiation between nadherny and marshall tycher,one of the principals of roseland.the relevant portions of nadherny employment contract with roseland are set forth below.key provisions,inter alia,in dispute are found in the employment and vesting clause at paragraph eight and the termination clause at paragraph fifteen and are underlined.

roseland terminated nadherny employment on february.at that time,both parties agree,there were four projects that began to be developed during the time of nadherny employment but that had not vested within the meaning of the contract terms,because the closing or construction start dates had not yet passed.roseland informed nadherny that he would not be entitled to a participation interest in these projects,since none of them had vested prior to his termination.nadherny disagrees.
nadherny filed a diversity action on june,in federal court against roseland and various entities.he sued for breach of contract and sought both damages and declaratory relief stating that he is entitled to a participation interest in the four projects that began during the term of his employment but had not yet vested prior to the termination of his employment.he also sued roseland for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,charging it with having terminated his employment solely for the purpose of depriving him of his participation interests in the above deals.both parties moved for summary judgment on all counts.they did not submit the case as a case stated.
the district court granted nadherny motion for summary judgment on his declaratory judgment claim,dismissed his breach of contract claim as unripe,and granted roseland motion for summary judgment on nadherny breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim.on the declaratory judgment claim,the court held that the evidence supported nadherny interpretation of the contract as to when nadherny interests in the development projects were required to vest in order for him to be entitled to a participation interest.nadherny argued that the contract entitled him to a participation interest in all projects originating out of the boston office while he was employed and that the vesting language referred only to the time of payment.the district court recounted roseland argument that 
plaintiff admitted in deposition testimony that vesting occurs at the moment of project when the financing is secure and construction is about to begin none of the four projects for which plaintiff seeks declaratory relief was even close to project when he was fired and the contract expressly requires that vesting occur during the period of employment because,in addition to plaintiff employment,it allows the parties to terminate at will this relationship.
the first two of roseland argument points were undisputed,save as to one project 
the court interpreted the contract by looking at the contract language as well as context and other factors.as to contract language,the court concluded that the employment clause in paragraph eight gave nadherny a participation interest in the projects,because they originat ed out of roseland boston office during the period of his employment,and that language was neither negated nor made ambiguous by the termination clause or any other clause.
the other factors utilized by the court included the fact that other reported decisions showed that other contracts denying employees rights to unvested stocks and other property options had far more explicit language accomplishing those ends.the court held that the lack of such language here suggests that the vesting of plaintiff interests is not contingent upon continued employment.the court also considered the circumstances leading up to the execution of the contract,concluding that it makes perfect sense that plaintiff would forgo his money in exchange for a larger amount down the line.the court finally looked at the nature of the duties and risks each party bore and stated if plaintiff interests had been contingent upon continued employment,roseland was bearing very little risk at all.in short,the court concluded 
taken as a whole,the language of the contract and absence of a termination provision as to plaintiff unvested real estate interests construed against roseland,which drafted the agreement,the circumstances leading up to the contract,and the case law concerning analogous contracts all demonstrate that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to the interpretation of the contract.
the court also granted summary judgment for roseland on nadherny claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the court held that there was no genuine issue of material fact with respect to the bad faith element of the claim,because roseland had submitted ample evidence of concern over plaintiff performance and that the risk they had taken in hiring someone with limited development experience was not working in their favor.
finally,the court dismissed nadherny breach of contract claim as unripe,since none of the projects in question had yet vested,and any attempt to quantify those interests in present value was spe
