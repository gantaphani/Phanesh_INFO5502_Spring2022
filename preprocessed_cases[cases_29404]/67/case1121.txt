in this interlocutory appeal,we are called on to answer one question may a class action be certified for claims seeking the remedy of rescission under the truth in lending act tila,the only two federal appellate courts to have addressed this question have answered no,see mckenna first horizon home loan,cir james home constr.of mobile,cir,and we agree.tila remedy,a,specifically references class actions by providing a damages cap,but tila rescission remedy,omits any reference to class actions.this omission,and the fundamental incompatibility between the remedy set forth in and the class form of action,persuade us as a matter of law that tila rescission class actions may not be maintained.
background 
in june plaintiffs susan and bryan andrews obtained a loan from defendant chevy chase bank,a federally chartered bank,to refinance their home in cedarburg,wisconsin.bryan andrews runs his own business,and the andrews are experienced mortgagors,having previously taken out many original and refinancing mortgage loans for various residential and investment properties.this time,they opted for a unique type of loan product offered by chevy chase that allowed them to vary their payment,depending on their monthly cash flow.this cashflow payment option,as chevy chase called it,was more flexible than a traditional fixed or mortgage because it allowed the debtor to choose between multiple payment options.it was also more complex,with a potential trap for the unwary.the debtor could pay a monthly minimum payment at a low interest rate for an initial term under this option,while the interest rate would adjust monthly,the minimum payments would remain fixed at the low rate until the initial term expired or the outstanding balance exceeded percent of the original loan through negative amortization,whichever event occurred first.the debtor could also decide to make payments larger than the minimum monthly payment,pay interest only based on the fully indexed rate,pay an amount sufficient to amortize the loan over years,or pay an amount sufficient to amortize the loan over years.
chevy chase provided preliminary disclosures about the loan and,at closing,an note,a disclosure statement tilds,and an rider.when the andrews obtained the loan,they thought that the monthly payment and the interest rate were fixed for the initial term of five years and became variable thereafter.they were correct about the minimum monthly payment but not about the interest rate.the loan discounted or teaser interest rate of percent applied only to the first monthly payment.after that,the interest rate adjusted every month,even though the minimum monthly payment remained fixed according to the initial rate.so as the interest rate climbed,an portion of the minimum monthly payment of was required to cover the interest.soon,the minimum monthly payment itself became insufficient to cover the accrued interest,and the negative amortization feature adding the unpaid interest to the principal kicked in.
in april the andrews filed this purported lawsuit against chevy chase claiming violations of tila and seeking statutory damages under a,rescission under,and attorneys fees under a the complaint alleged that certain of chevy chase disclosures were misleading or unclear,particularly as to whether the initial interest rate was fixed and whether the payment periods were properly stated.more specifically,they alleged that chevy chase payment schedule was not sufficiently detailed because it listed only the first and last payment dates they also claimed that a stamp on the top of one of chevy chase disclosure forms made the disclosures misleading.this stamp,they referred to the note as a ws cashflow fixed note interest rate could be understood to identify the note as a note.
the district court granted summary judgment for the andrews,authorizing rescission and awarding attorneys fees,though it denied their claim for statutory damages because chevy chase tila violations were not those enumerated in a,for which statutory damages are available.see andrews chevy chase bank,fsb.in the same order,the district court granted the andrews motion for class certification under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,declaring that all class members would have the right to rescind their mortgages.the certified class includes anyone who obtained an mortgage from chevy chase on a primary residence between april,and january,and who received a tilds from chevy chase containing any of the language the court had found deficient under tila.
in its decision on class certification,the district court relied heavily on the massachusetts district court decision in mckenna.mckenna first horizon home loan,d.but that decision was reversed by the court of appeals for the first circuit less than two weeks after the court granted class certification.mckenna,at.after we granted chevy chase petition for leave to appeal pursuant to rule f,the district court agreed to stay its proceedings.the court then issued a memorandum explaining why its order should stand,despite the reversal of the district court decision in mckenna.andrews chevy chase bank,fsb,d.also,recognizing that it had failed to consider tila provisions that prohibit certain debtors from rescinding,see e,the court stated that it would likely narrow the definition of the class,if its decision survived the appeal.
ii.discussion 
we generally review a grant of class certification for an abuse of discretion,but purely legal determinations made in support of that decision are reviewed de novo.mace van ru credit,cir.whether tila allows claims for rescission to be maintained in a format is an issue of first impression in our circuit,but the first and fifth circuits,in addition to california court of appeals,have held as a matter of law that rescission class actions are unavailable under tila.see mckenna,at james,at see also laliberte pac.mercantile bank,th,d,cert.denied,d.
tila was designed to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms to the consumer.a.creditors who violate the disclosure requirements may be ordered to pay actual damages or statutory damages,depending upon the nature of the violation.see a a.in certain loan transactions,tila also provides debtors with a right of process in which the creditor terminates its security interest and returns any payments made by the debtor in exchange for the debtor return of all funds or property received from the creditor usually,the loan proceeds.see.debtors may rescind under tila by midnight of the third business day after the transaction for any reason whatsoever.see a.the postclosing cooling off period is extended if the creditor does not deliver the required notice of the right to rescind and all material disclosures in that instance,the right to rescind continues until the creditor provides the required notice and disclosures,or up to three years after consummation of the loan,whichever occurs first.see f.
rescinding a loan transaction under tila requires unwinding the transaction in its entirety and thus requires returning the borrowers to the position they occupied prior to the loan agreement.handy anchor mortgage,cir quoting barrett jp morgan chase bank,cir.tila rescission is therefore considered a purely personal remedy.see,mckenna,at james,at laliberte,d at.it is intended to operate privately,at least initially,with the creditor and debtor working out the logistics of a given rescission.mckenna,at see also belini.mut.bank,fa,cir.section sets forth certain deadlines and duties that apply to the creditor upon receipt of a notice of rescission from the debtor,return of earnest money,down payment,or other payments,and initiating the termination of the security interest the statute,in turn,specifies the duties that apply to the debtor,tendering return of the property or its reasonable value.see b.these procedures apply except when otherwise ordered by a court,making it clear that when disagreements over the particulars of a given rescission arise,the court may tailor the remedy to the circumstances.
we note initially that the rescission remedy described in appears to contemplate only individual proceedings the personal character of the remedy makes it procedurally and substantively unsuited to deployment in a class action.see also richard lord,williston on contracts ed noting that many statutes require the individual borrower to make the demand for rescission.rescission is a highly individualized remedy as a general matter,and rescission under tila is no exception.the variations in the transactional unwinding process that may arise from one rescission to the next make it an extremely poor fit for the mechanism.
a court certification of a class of persons entitled to seek rescission would be just the beginning.each class member individually would have the option of exercising his or her right to rescind,and not all class members will want to do so because it requires returning the loan principle in exchange for the release of the lien and any interest or other payments.individual controversies would erupt and likely continue because the equitable nature of rescission generally entitles the affected creditor to judicial consideration of the individual circumstances of the particular transaction.mckenna,at.accordingly,a host of individual proceedings would almost certainly follow in the wake of the certification of a class whose loan transactions are referable to rescission.as we have noted,b provides that t he procedures prescribed by this subsection shall apply except when otherwise ordered by a court,suggesting that the remedy must proceed on a basis.in short,the rescission remedy prescribed by tila is procedurally and substantively incompatible with the device.
it is true,as the andrews point out,that tila does not explicitly prohibit the use of a class action for rescission.the supreme court has said that i n the absence of a direct expression by congress of its intent to depart from the usual course of trying all suits of a civil nature under the rules established for that purpose,class relief is appropriate in civil actions brought in federal court.califano yamasaki,d quoting.some district courts have ended their inquiry there and certified rescission classes under tila.see,in re ameriquest mortgage.mortgage lending practices,wl,latham residential loan ctrs.of,c,wl.may,hickey great mortgage,see also mckenna,at listing cases.but tila is entirely different from the jurisdictional statute at issue in yamasaki.
yamasaki concerned a statute setting forth the procedure by which judicial review of an administrative decision could be obtained.at.the court rejected the argument that the statute language authorizing a suit for judicial review by any individual meant that individual suits class be brought.id.at.the court held that this any individual language,without more,did not preclude the use of class actions in this category of suit.id.at.while an express exception might be expected in the context of a jurisdictional statute specifying the rules by which judicial review may be sought,we think is quite different.tila rescission remedy is written with the goal of making the rescission process a private one,worked out between creditor and debtor without the intervention of the courts.belini,at.the lack of an explicit prohibition against class actions in is not dispositive.see mckenna,at.
class actions are specifically mentioned in the tila provision addressing claims for damages.see a b.there,congress established a cap of the lesser of or percent of the creditor net worth on the total recovery of damages in class actions.because vast recoveries are also possible for rescission claims here,the andrews estimate that chevy chase liability could amount to perhaps million,the absence of a similar cap in strongly suggests that class actions are not available for rescission.see bates united states,d where congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.internal quotation marks omitted see also duncan walker,d where congress distinguished between state and federal review in related subsections,that statutory context suggests that congress would have explicitly mentioned federal review if it intended to include it.this direct contrast between the text of tila damages and rescission provisions can not be ignored.see mckenna,at.
it is of course possible as our dissenting colleague suggests that this difference in tila remedial provisions could be understood to mean that tila rescission remedy may be pursued on a class basis,without any liability limit.but we agree with the first circuit that t he notion that congress would limit liability to with respect to one remedy while allowing the sky to be the limit with respect to another for the same violation strains credulity.id.we think the presence of a cap on recovery in tila damages provision,the absence of any reference at all to class recovery in its rescission provision,and the mechanics of the rescission process spelled out in,all point more plausibly to the opposite interpretation that tila rescission its terms an individualized,restorative rather than compensatory just that,a purely individual remedy that may not be pursued on behalf of a class.
the amendments to tila confirm this interpretation,as the first circuit opinion in mckenna noted.in that year,congress limited the potential for expansive tila liability by temporarily suspending class actions for relatively minor violations including some involving rescission rights and then by increasing the tolerance levels for honest,minor mistakes in carrying out disclosure obligations.see truth in lending class actions relief act of,stat,truth in lending act amendments of,stat.these actions were taken in response to the eleventh circuit decision in rodash aib mortgage,cir,which had held that a creditor minor tila violations triggered a debtor right to rescind.see ralph rohner fred miller,truth in lending robert cook et.in taking this step,congress made manifest that although it had designed the tila to protect consumers,it had not intended that lenders would be made to face overwhelming liability for relatively minor violations.mckenna,at.
the andrews also make an argument flowing from the language of the additional relief subsection of,and the attorney fees subsection of tila damages provision.section g provides that i n any action in which it is determined that a creditor has violated this section,in addition to rescission the court may award relief under section,that is,damages.g.section a,in turn,provides that attorney fees are recoverable in a successful action to enforce liability,liability for damages or in any action in which a person is determined to have a right of rescission under section.a.the andrews contend that this parallel use of the phrase in any action in g and a means that rescission is available in any action,including class actions.
there is no support for this novel argument,which rests on a faulty reading of g and a,treating g as the center of all remedial relief available under tila.section g is a simple remedial it provides that rescission plaintiffs may also seek damages under.it does no more.section a simply provides that attorney fees are recoverable in a successful action for damages or a successful action for rescission.it does no more.the use of the phrase in any action in these provisions carries no meaning for the question of whether tila permits rescission class actions.
finally,we note that creating a circuit split generally requires quite solid justification we do not lightly conclude that our sister circuits are wrong.here,the andrews have not persuaded us that the first and fifth circuits have misinterpreted the operative provisions of tila.we now join those circuits in concluding that tila rescission remedy,may not be pursued on a class basis.mckenna,at james,at.
we note for completeness that the fundamental incompatibility between the rescission remedy under tila and the device raises serious questions as to whether a tila rescission class could ever be properly certified under federal rule of civil procedure b a rule b class may be maintained wh
