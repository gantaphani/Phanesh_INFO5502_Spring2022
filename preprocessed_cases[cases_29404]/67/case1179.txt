the city of chicago enacted an ordinance that prohibited the keeping of pigeons in most residential areas of the city.an organization of homing pigeon keepers,known as the greater chicago combine and center,sued the city claiming that the ordinance violated the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution.the district court granted the city summary judgment.we affirm.
in september,chicago city council passed the restrictions on pigeons ordinance in response to citizen complaints about feathers,droppings,odor,and noise cooing generated by pigeons housed in residential areas,coops in homes,backyards,and garages.the council also enacted the ordinance due to public health concerns,disease.
specifically,the ordinance,chicago municipal code,prohibits the keeping of pigeons within residential districts.pursuant to b,it is unlawful for any person to import,own,keep or otherwise possess any live pigeon within any area designated as a residence under the chicago zoning ordinance except for transporting a live pigeon through a residential district,if the pigeon is caged during transport and not released in a residential district.in addition,c makes it unlawful for any person to construct or maintain any coop or cote that is,or may be used for the storage,maintenance or sheltering of any live pigeon within the aforementioned residential areas.by its terms,the ordinance does not apply to areas,such as those zoned commercial or industrial.
under e,violations of the ordinance are treated as a public nuisance.as such,violations are abated in accordance with the notice and other procedures set forth in chicago municipal code.section f subjects violators to fines ranging from to or jail time up to six months per offense.each day a violation continues is deemed a separate offense.
prior to this ordinance,the city did not restrict the keeping of pigeons,and a number of city residents housed pigeons on their property.among those keeping pigeons were members of a organization called the greater chicago combine and center,gccc.according to gccc,its members raise,train,and breed homing pigeons for educational purposes.
the ordinance went into effect on january.at that time,the ordinance contained an exemption for educational,medical,scientific,and zoological purposes.thus,under this exemption in d,a pigeon could be kept in a residential area if it were kept for one of the four enumerated purposes and if its owner obtained a license.
gccc members in the city residential areas seized on the educational exemption to continue their homing pigeon pursuits.viewing this development as an unintended loophole,the city council amended the exemption in may.it replaced d broad language exempting the four aforementioned purposes with narrower language exempting two specific sites the lincoln park zoo and the zoo at indian boundary park.other than those two zoos,pigeons could no longer be kept in residential areas for any purpose.
later in that same month,the city council amended the ordinance a second time.this amendment exempted two of the city fifty wards the and wards from the residential pigeon ban.the aldermen representing these two wards initiated this amendment.the record does not reveal the precise reason that these two particular wards were exempted,but presumably the aldermen were responding to constituents.
with the educational exemption repealed,gccc members in residential areas of the other wards no longer had a plausible means of keeping their pigeons and simultaneously complying with the ordinance.consequently,in august,gccc sued the city on behalf of its affected members.gccc claimed that the ordinance violated its affected members equal protection rights under the fourteenth amendment.the complaint specifically claimed that the ordinance violates the equal protection clause because the classifications are disparate in that they allow certain residents to continue to harbor homing pigeons within the city of chicago.the complaint also included a substantive due process claim under the fourteenth amendment as well as a supplemental state law claim 
with the complaint,gccc filed a motion for a preliminary injunction.resting primarily on the exemption,the district court granted the motion in late august.the district court vacated the injunction in september on a procedural ground,but,at the district court request,the city agreed to voluntarily refrain from enforcing the ordinance until the matter was resolved.
in apparent response to gccc equal protection claims,the city council passed another amendment in november,which repealed the exemption.therefore,as of this most recent amendment to the ordinance all residential areas of the city save for the two zoos are equally subject to the ban.areas remain.
ultimately,the city moved for summary judgment.in december,the district court granted that motion,rejecting gccc federal and state claims.gccc appeals,raising only its federal equal protection and substantive due process claims.
before addressing gccc arguments on appeal,we turn to a jurisdictional matter raised at oral argument.gccc brought this suit as a federal question case.one component of federal question jurisdiction is substantiality.gammon gc servs,cir ricketts midwest bank,cir.that is,for subject matter jurisdiction to exist in such a case,the face of the complaint must demonstrate that a claim under the constitution or other laws of the united states is sufficiently substantial.gammon,at.as a result,if a federal claim is immaterial to the true thrust of the complaint and thus made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction or if the federal claim is wholly insubstantial and frivolous,ricketts,at quoting bell hood,then the court does not have the power to decide the case and must dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,gammon,at.
since substantiality is a jurisdictional matter,the assessment of whether a claim is insubstantial or frivolous is made as of the time the lawsuit was initiated.see hagans lavine,d j urisdiction,a matter for threshold determination,turned on whether the question was too insubstantial for consideration.waste city of gary,cir jurisdiction is established or not at the outset of a case.gammon,at ricketts,at.at the outset of the present case,the city treated residents keeping pigeons in two wards of the city differently than residents keeping pigeons in the other wards of the city.gccc based its equal protection claim in part on this exemption,and the district court issued a preliminary injunction primarily because of this exemption.again,the complaint specifically averred that the ordinance violates the equal protection clause because the classifications are disparate in that they allow certain residents to continue to harbor homing pigeons within the city of chicago.this equal protection claim is sufficiently plausible to secure subject matter jurisdiction for gccc entire complaint we need not discuss the other constitutional allegations here.see ricketts,at if there is any foundation of plausibility to the federal claim federal jurisdiction exists.internal quotation omitted,at district court grant of a tro was one reason supporting this court determination that a claim was not frivolous for jurisdictional purposes.the fact that the city repealed the exemption does not change this jurisdictional inquiry.while the repeal diminished the strength of gccc equal protection claim,the repeal did not retroactively divest the court of jurisdiction,at.satisfied that gccc secured federal question jurisdiction at the outset and that we have the authority to adjudicate this case,we turn to the merits.
our review of a district court summary judgment decision is de novo.see civil liberties for urban believers city of chicago,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
we begin with the standard by which the ordinance should be reviewed,which is a matter the parties sharp
