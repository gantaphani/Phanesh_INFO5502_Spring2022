we are asked to determine the ownership of biological materials contributed by individuals for the purpose of genetic cancer research and currently housed on the campus of washington university wu.wu brought a declaratory judgment action against william catalona catalona,a former wu medical school faculty member,seeking to establish wu ownership of the research biological materials.catalona counterclaimed,seeking a declaration the contributing individuals could direct the transfer of their biological materials to him.catalona also moved for an order prohibiting wu from utilizing,disseminating,transferring,or destroying the biological materials at issue.the district court concluded wu owns the biological materials and neither catalona nor any contributing individual has any ownership or proprietary interest in the disputed biological materials.these appeals followed.we affirm.
background 
wu,a prominent private research university located in louis,missouri,houses its own medical school,including a division of urologic surgery division.within the division,wu physicians treat patients,teach students and residents,and conduct medical research on urologic diseases such as prostate cancer.catalona,a highly respected urologist and urologic surgeon and researcher,was employed by wu from to,and he served as division chief from to.during catalona tenure at wu,he performed thousands of surgeries,many involving prostate cancer.as a leading medical researcher for wu,one of catalona principal areas of research was the genetic basis of prostate cancer.in,catalona began collecting samples of biological materials,such as blood and tissue removed during surgery,to be used later for prostate cancer research.catalona encouraged his colleagues to do the same.
catalona was instrumental in establishing the gu biorepository biorepository,the world largest storage facility for biological samples collected by catalona and other wu physicians for prostate cancer research.the biorepository is housed in one or more buildings owned by wu.wu provides the majority of funding necessary to support the maintenance and operation of the biorepository.additional funding is provided by public and private grants payable to and administered by wu as the grantee.while employed by wu,catalona raised several million dollars in outside funding for the biorepository.other wu employees,including catalona successor as division chief,also have raised a substantial amount of funds.
during the relevant time period,catalona and other division physicians performed many genetic cancer research studies,with each study naming a particular wu physician as the principal investigator,a term designating the person in charge of conducting the research protocol.regardless of the physician designated as principal investigator on a particular research study,the named principal investigator generally collaborated with several other individuals in the research studies.
in order to conduct these studies,individuals were invited to participate in genetic research.individuals who chose to donate excised prostate tissue or a blood sample to medical research and to become a research participant rp were required to complete an informed consent form although the language of the consent forms differs,depending upon the nature of the particular study or the study principal investigator,generally all of the forms contain similar provisions,such as the wu medical center or wu school of medicine logo,the principal investigator,the purpose of the research,and the nature of the rp participation.
the consent forms often used the term donation to describe the biological sample transfer from the rp to a wu physician or medical technician.the forms also noted biological samples may be used for research with our collaborators at wu,other institutions,or companies.the consent forms typically provided that by participating in the study,the rp agree s to waive any claim he might have to the body tissues that he donate s and also waive s the right to any new material or process developed through research involving his tissues.rps also were informed by the consent forms,your participation is voluntary and you may choose not to participate in this research study or withdraw your consent at any time.some consent forms indicated rps could request destruction of their biological materials if they changed their minds about participating in the study,but noted it would not be possible to destroy or recall any research results already obtained.other consent forms made no mention about an rp right to request destruction of materials donated to research 
in addition to the consent form,rps received a genetic research information brochure brochure to review and sign.the brochure provided rps tissue samples will be used by wu medical center researchers,may be shared with other authorized researchers doing research in similar fields at wu and other research centers,and may be used for studies currently in progress or studies conducted or years from now.similar to the consent forms,the brochure used the term donation to describe the rp participation,noting,by agreeing to participate,you are making a free and generous gift of your tissue to research that may benefit society.the brochure advised rps,you will receive no monetary payment for your tissue nor can you claim ownership rights to any medical or scientific product that results from research with your tissue.the brochure also informed rps of their right to have their biological materials destroyed upon request should they change their minds about participating in the research study.
at the time of the district court permanent injunction hearing in this case,more than rps were enrolled in wu prostate cancer research studies.about to rps had been patients of catalona.the biorepository contains approximately prostate tissue samples taken from patients of catalona and other wu physicians within the division about blood or serum samples donated by over men,of whom were not patients of any wu physician,but rather were volunteers recruited through the media and dna samples provided by approximately men,which included patients of different wu physicians and relatives of those patients.
over the years,other research institutions requested and received biological samples from the biorepository to conduct genetic cancer research projects either in partnership with or independent of wu.while at wu,catalona repeatedly transferred biorepository materials to other research institutions pursuant to material transfer agreements mtas.the mtas typically were signed by an authorized wu official as well as a providing investigator.several mtas personally signed by catalona,as the principal or providing investigator,acknowledge wu as the owner of the biological samples.
in early,catalona accepted a faculty position at northwestern university in chicago,illinois.given his plan to continue genetic research in the area of prostate cancer,catalona sent a letter in february to his patients,their relatives,and other individuals who had served as rps informing them of his departure from wu and requesting transfer of biological materials.attached to the letter was a medical consent authorization form release form.in addition,both the letter and release form were printed in a newsletter from the urological research foundation,for which catalona served as the medical director.catalona estimated between and individuals received the letter and release form.although catalona was still a wu employee at the time he sent the letter and release form,catalona was no longer the principal investigator on any of the research protocols involving biological samples he sought to have transferred to northwestern university.neither the letter nor the release form were approved by any wu administrators or wu institutional review board.the letter discussed,among other things,catalona availability for treatment,his continuation of prostate cancer research,and his need for the tissue and blood samples contributed to him over the years.in connection with catalona stated necessity,the letter requested the recipient sign and return to c
