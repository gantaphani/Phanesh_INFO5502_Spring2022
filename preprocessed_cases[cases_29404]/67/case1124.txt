the are the owners and the agent of a building in chicago that for more than four decades has displayed an advertising sign without a permit.current zoning provisions prohibit the sign given its size and proximity to a residential district,but the plaintiffs contend that because the sign was lawful when first erected,they have a right to continue displaying the sign.after the city of chicago declared the sign unlawful and ordered it removed,the filed suit under challenging the city action on a variety of constitutional grounds.the district court resolved the suit in the city favor.we affirm.
bernard heerey purchased the building located at north state street in chicago in.pursuant to a trust agreement,cosmopolitan bank and trust now holds legal title to the property.heerey assigned his beneficial interest in the property to general auto service station an illinois corporation which in merged with and into general auto service station llc collectively,gass.properties,is an illinois corporation that acts as an agent and lessor for gass.heerey was the sole owner of both gass and heerey died in at the age of without immediate family to survive him.the terms of his will provide that once certain bequests are made,the assets in his estate,which include a number of properties on chicago north side,are to be placed in a charitable trust in order to fund distributions to religious and charitable organizations.as of the date this case was tried in december,the probate of heerey estate was ongoing and the trust had not yet been funded.
the south exterior wall of the building at north state street is a desirable location for advertising.the building is four stories tall,and soon after heerey purchased the property,the buildings to its immediate south were torn down,eventually to be replaced by a building.as a result,the exposed south wall of the building at north state is visible to motorists and pedestrians passing through the nearby intersection of north rush and state streets,in the heart of chicago gold coast.
in,heerey,without first seeking or obtaining a permit from the city,had an advertising sign painted on the south wall of the building.that wall has been continuously used for advertising since that time.in the ensuing years,heerey and later gass,through,leased the advertising space on the building to a variety of entities,including whiteco industries,whose successor,lamar advertising company,holds the current lease.we shall refer to these lessees collectively as whiteco.for the period ending july,gass is being paid for the lease of the sign.
when heerey first began using the side of his building for advertising in,section of the city electrical code provided in relevant part that i t shall be unlawful to proceed with the erection,enlargement,alteration or rehang of any illuminated sign or illumination of signboard unless a permit therefore shall have first been obtained from the commissioner of buildings.the district court understood this language to require a permit only for an illuminated sign.because the original sign on heerey building was not illuminated,the court concluded that no permit was required.at.the city accepts that ruling for purposes of this appeal,as do we.
at all times relevant to this suit,the property at north state street has been located within a district zoned by the city for business use.however,the sign on the south wall of the building has always been within feet of a district zoned for residential use.
as of,section of the city zoning ordinance prohibited advertising signs within feet of any property in a residence district.the district court took the phrase any property in this provision to mean any improved property.although the sign on heerey building is within feet of a residential district,when first erected it was not within feet of any improved property in such a district.consequently,the court assumed that the sign was lawful when first painted on heerey building.at.although the city contested this point below,it has not quarreled with the district court assumption for purposes of this appeal.consequently,we like the district court shall assume that the sign was lawful when first erected.
in subsequent years,however,heerey made two changes the advertising on his building for which a permit was indubitably required under the terms of the city electrical code.first,at some point between and,heerey illuminated the sign by installing lights near the roof line of his building.section of the code,which we quoted from above,required that a permit be issued by the commissioner of buildings for,among other things,the erection of an illuminated sign and the illumination of signboard.second,between and,heerey allowed the lessee of the advertising space on his building to combine what had been two signs into a larger,single sign by covering the building windows that had separated the two signs.then,in,that sign was enlarged to its current dimensions of feet by feet.these changes again triggered the permit requirement of section,which applied to any enlargement or alteration made to any illuminated sign.the district court thus concluded that heerey was required to obtain a permit before illuminating and enlarging the signage on his building.at.so far as the record reveals,heerey did not obtain a permit before he made any of these modifications 
in,the city finally took notice that the sign lacked a permit.on september of that year,it issued a violation notice to heerey property management company asserting that the illuminated sign had been installed without a permit in violation of section of the electrical code.app.a hearing before the city electrical compliance board was scheduled and continued on several occasions,but the city took no further action on the notice.
in,the provision of the city zoning ordinance regarding the distance between advertising signs and residential districts was toughened.whereas before,section of the ordinance as construed by the district court permitted no advertising sign within feet of improved property in a residential district,section of the revised ordinance now provided that n o advertising sign having a face which exceeds square feet shall be permitted within feet of a residence district and that no advertising sign of any size shall be permitted within feet of a residence district.app.a grandfather provision,section a,was added to the ordinance providing that any sign not conforming to the new distance requirements among others which had been lawfully erected pursuant to a permit lawfully issued prior to the effective date of this section,may remain in use as a legal sign.app.
on september,the city issued a second violation notice to heerey,this one charging that because the face of the sign was larger than square feet and was within feet of a residential district,the sign violated the distance requirement adopted in.app.heerey attorney forwarded the notice to whiteco and asked that it handle the matter.whiteco in turn submitted a permit application to the.that application was approved initially by the city zoning department on january.zoning employee william merritt determined that the sign was a legal use,and he therefore stamped the permit application to indicate that the sign conforms to zoning ordinance.app,app.at that point,the approval of the city building department was required,and whiteco submitted its permit application to that department for review.however,for any sign that exceeded square feet in size,the municipal code required city council approval in addition to a permit.app.on april,the building department noted on a plan correction sheet issued to whiteco that a copy of the council order approving the sign must be attached to the permit application.app.whiteco had written to the city alderman whose ward included the state street property one week earlier requesting his support and assistance in obtaining such approval.but for reasons that the record does not reveal,whiteco never obtained an order from the city council approving the sign.for its part,the city took no further action on whiteco permit application.
on august,the city issued a third notice of violation to heerey property management company directing heerey to o btain permit for outdoor flat building sign installed without permit.app.app.heerey attorney again forwarded the notice to whiteco asking that it handle the matter.whiteco appeared as the respondent before the city department of administrative hearings on september,and admitted that it was not in compliance with the permit requirement.the hearing officer entered the following findings and order 
respondent is found to be in violation of the chicago building code with regards to the afore stated charges however,respondent afforded opportunity of mitigation via compliance.compliance must be evidenced by reinspection other evidence corroborating conditions.this matter is continued for hearing on fines 
app.footnote omitted.
whiteco subsequently attempted to bring the sign into compliance with the building code by applying for a permit,but its efforts met with failure.on april,the city zoning administrator denied zoning certification for the sign on the grounds that the sign violated the provision of the zoning ordinance regarding the proximity of signs to residential districts and was not grandfathered because there was no prior permit for the sign on file.given the lack of zoning certification,the city did not issue a permit for the sign.whiteco appealed the denial of zoning certification to the city zoning board of appeals zba,but the zba sustained the denial on september.
the following month,a city hearing officer entered a final order on the notice of violation imposing a fine of and ordering whiteco to remove the sign within days in the event it did not obtain a permit.app.by the terms of the city zoning ordinance,gass as the effective owner of the property is liable for the violation to the same extent as its lessee,whiteco.the city order has yet to be enforced to this day,whiteco successor continues to lease the sign and display advertising on the south wall of gass building.
whiteco filed suit in the circuit court of cook county seeking judicial review of the zba decision,arguing in part that the zba had overlooked the fact that no permit had been required when the sign was first erected in and that,consequently,the sign qualified as a legal,use under the grandfather provision of the zoning ordinance.the circuit court denied review on march.the court found that whiteco had failed to present any evidence to the zba in support of the notion that the sign constituted a legal,use.whiteco appealed,but the illinois appellate court affirmed in september and the illinois supreme court subsequently denied whiteco petition for leave to appeal.
in the meantime,gass,as the owner of the property,was seeking relief of its own.late in,gass filed a declaratory judgment action in state court challenging the relevant provisions of the zoning ordinance and the city failure to grant it a permit in on a variety of grounds.at the same time,gass sought leave to intervene in whiteco action so that it too could challenge the zba refusal to order zoning certification for the sign.the state court denied gass request to intervene in whiteco suit and gass eventually dismissed its own suit in favor of the instant federal suit.
gass along with and cosmopolitan bank,but for the sake of simplicity,we shall refer only to gass filed this section action against the city in january.gass second amended complaint asserted a variety of constitutional claims,four of which are pursued in this appeal.first,gass asserted that the advertising sign constituted commercial speech that was not misleading and which the city had no legitimate or substantial interest in restricting or prohibiting.the city invocation of its zoning ordinance to prohibit the sign therefore deprived gass of its rights under the first amendment to the constitution,count second,gass contended that the city,in failing to process its application for a permit,violated its right to procedural due process under the constitution,count ii.third,gass asserted that in refusing to recognizing its sign as a lawful,nonconforming use under the grandfather provision found in section of the zoning ordinance,the city had applied its laws in a way that did not promote the public health,safety,morals,or general welfare and therefore had deprived gass of substantive due process under the constitution,count iii.fourth,gass claimed that the city application of the zoning provisions,and its refusal to grandfather the sign,amounted to a retroactive application of laws enacted after the sign erection that deprived gass of its vested property and contractual rights in a harsh,oppressive,and arbitrary manner,thereby again depriving gass of its right to substantive due process,count iv gass sought a declaratory judgment on each of its claims and an injunction barring the city from enforcing the zoning ordinance as to its sign requiring the city to issue a permit for the sign.
initially,the district court dismissed the suit without prejudice,abstaining pursuant to younger harris,d,in deference to whiteco suit for administrative review in state court,wl,wl.we reversed that dismissal in auto serv.station llc city of chicago,cir.we reasoned in relevant part that because gass request to intervene in whiteco state court action had been denied,gass had not had the opportunity to defend its interests as the owner of the property in that action.id.at.
on remand,the district dismissed gass first amendment and procedural due process claims.the court concluded that the real focus of the first amendment claim was on the distinction that the grandfather provision drew between signs erected pursuant to a permit and signs,like gass,which were erected at a time when no permits were required.as such,the court reasoned,this claim was nothing more than a restatement of gass separate substantive due process claim.
plaintiffs claim that the zoning ordinance violates the first amendment because it allows advertising signs that the amendments and which now violate those amendments to remain only if the signs were initially erected pursuant to a permit,regardless of whether such a permit was even required at the time the sign was erected.plaintiffs sign happens to be an advertising sign,but the provisions they really challenge legal,use and permit provisions,by which the city only grandfathers in those signs that were issued pursuant to a to all signs,not just advertising signs.plaintiffs nowhere argue that the size and distance restrictions on advertising signs found in section will not pass constitutional muster.thus,the court agrees with the city that the plaintiffs challenge is not aimed at the ordinance regulation of commercial speech.
moreover,as the court noted in its earlier decision dismissing the suit on abstention grounds,plaintiffs first amendment argument is nothing more than a restatement of its arguments that the city refusal to grandfather plaintiffs sign deprives it of due process.general auto service station,wl,at.plaintiffs can not convert what is essentially a due process claim into one under the first amendment merely by noting that theirs is an advertising sign.plaintiffs have not effectively alleged a first amendment challenge to the zoning ordinance 
wl,at.the court found the procedural due process claim to be untimely.that claim was based on the city purported failure to process whiteco permit application.but gass knew by august,when the city issued yet another notice of violation,that the city had not processed the application.consequently,in the court view,the statute of limitations on this claim began to run no later than august and had expired well before gass filed this suit in january.id.at the court rejected the city contention that the substantive due process claims were also untimely.id.at.
the district court conducted a bench trial on the substantive due process claims,and ultimately found in favor of the city on those two claims.the court ruled in the first instance that the claims were time barred,contrary to its earlier holding on the motion to dismiss.both claims were focused on the city preferential treatment of signs that were erected with a permit.however,as with the procedural due process claim,the court concluded that the august notice of violation put the plaintiffs on notice that the city was not treating the sign as grandfathered.though the zoning administrator did not officially deny whiteco permit application until april,plaintiffs knew the circumstances that support the claim they are presenting,the differential treatment of permitted and legal,nonconforming september when heerey attorney forwarded the violation notice to whiteco.at.therefore,gass was obliged to file suit on these claims no later than september,which it did not.id.the court ruled alternatively that the claims failed on their merits.the premise of these claims was that because no permit was required when gass erected its sign,the sign constituted a legal,use just as if it had been erected with a permit.for that reason,in gass view,it was irrational to treat permitted signs differently from signs for purposes of the grandfather provision.but gass was wrong in characterizing its sign as a legal use,the court found.although a permit was not required when heerey installed the first sign in,a permit was required when he later illuminated and enlarged the sign,and a permit had never been obtained.id.at.gass rejoined that the permit requirement as it existed at those times amounted to an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech and should be treated a nullity rendering its sign legal but the court was not convinced.plaintiffs have not explained how chapter,which at all relevant times applied to all illuminated signs and not just to advertising signs,constitutes a regulation of commercial speech sufficient to implicate the first amendment.id.at.
gass moved to amend the judgment,challenging the court rationale in disposing of the substantive due process claims,but the court denied the motion.the court reiterated that gass was made aware by the violation notice that the city would not deem its sign covered by the grandfather clause,thus obligating gass to file suit no later than,wl,at.as to the merits,the court again rejected gass contention that the permit requirement,as it existed in the and when gass sign was illuminated and then expanded,constituted an unlawful prior restraint on speech.the court pointed out that a key danger posed by licensing schemes that grant unfettered discretion to government officials is that a potential speaker will be intimidated into censoring his own speech.id.at citing city of lakewood plain dealer publ g,d.that danger was not implicated here the permit applied only to illuminated signs,leaving signs open as an alternative outlet for unregulated speech and,at the same time,the permit requirement applied to all illuminated signs,drawing no distinctions between commercial and noncommercial speech.id.at.finally,the court rejected as untimely gass argument,made in a supplemental brief in support of the motion to amend,that it retained,at a minimum,a vested property interest in the sign in a,state given that no permit was required when heerey first erected the sign in.this is the first time that plaintiffs have claimed a property interest in the wall sign other than as currently configured,and plaintiffs make no attempt to explain why they failed to raise this claim previously.id.the court noted alternatively that gass had never firmly established that its sign as originally erected truly complied with all applicable ordinances.id.the court had assumed that the sign was consistent with the version of the zoning ordinance,but gass had never actually proven to the satisfaction of the court that the sign was in fact legal in its,state.id.
substantive due process 
gass has asserted two claims for deprivation of its fourteenth amendment right to substantive due process.see generally county of sacramento lewis,d.
the claim that a person is entitled to substantive due process means,as we understand the concept,that state action which deprives him of life,liberty,or property must have a rational is to say,the reason for the deprivation may not be so inadequate that the judiciary will characterize it as arbitrary.
jeffries turkey run consol.sch,cir stevens.see also indiana land city of greenwood,cir.
both of gass due process claims are premised on the notion that its sign was an established and lawful use of its property before the city zoning ordinance was modified in to prohibit advertising signs within feet of a residential district,and that,consequently,gass has a vested property interest in continuing to display its sign of which it may not be deprived without substantive due process.for purposes of a due process claim,property interests are created and defined by an independent source,such as a contract or state law,miyler vill.of galesburg,cir citing bd.of regents of state colls.roth,d.illinois case law recognizes that a property owner can acquire a property interest in continuing a land use that was lawful when commenced and rendered unlawful,only by a subsequent legislative enactment.see taylor zoning bd.of appeals of city of evanston,d.
once a landowner obtains such a property right,the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment circumscribes,but does not eliminate,the government ability to deprive him of that interest.as we observed in lee city of chicago,s ubstantive due process is not a blanket protection against unjustifiable interferences with property,cir quoting schroeder city of chicago,cir.and it does not confer on federal courts a license to act as zoning boards of appeals,town of brookfield,cir albiero city of kankakee,cir.it is instead a modest limitation that prohibits government action only when it is random and irrational.unless a governmental practice encroaches on a fundamental right,substantive due process requires only that the practice be rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest,or alternatively phrased,that the practice be neither arbitrary nor irrational.lee,at citing washington glucksberg,d.a property owner challenging a regulation as a violation of due process is therefore obliged to show that the regulation is arbitrary and unreasonable,bearing no substantial relationship to public health,safety,or welfare,greater chicago combine,city of chicago,cir.and because the right infringed upon is an interest in property rather than life or liberty,the property owner must first establish either an independent constitutional violation or the inadequacy of state remedies to redress the deprivation before a court will consider whether the interference with property is arbitrary or irrational.lee,at.
in this case,gass contends that the city conduct in prohibiting its sign was arbitrary and irrational in two ways.it contends first that the application of the zoning ordinance failed to promote the public health,safety,morals,welfare because it arbitrarily grandfathered advertising signs that had been erected pursuant to a permit but not signs for which no permit had been required.count iii.second,it contends that the city application of the zoning ordinance was apparently retroactive,resulting in an infringement of gass vested property rights in a harsh and oppressive manner.specifically,gass notes that the city demanded in that it obtain a permit for a sign that had been erected some thirty years earlier,but then denied gass application for a permit based on current zoning restrictions that did not exist when the sign was installed.count iv.
there is an initial question as to the timeliness of these claims.the district court concluded,and the city argues here,that the notice of violation was sufficient to put heerey and gass on notice that it intended to treat permitted and signs differently for purposes of grandfathering,and thus supplied the plaintiffs with all of the information they needed in order to assert a due process claim.under that view,gass was obliged to file suit no later than,within the statute of limitations for section claims that we have borrowed from illinois law.see,jenkins vill.of maywood,cir.gass replies that it was not yet clear in that the city would not belatedly grant the plaintiffs a permit for the sign indeed,in,the city zoning department had signaled an inclination to grant such a permit when its employee merritt characterized the sign as a legal use.gass also makes a more fundamental contention that because it seeks only declaratory and injunctive relief its sign still exists today,so it has yet to suffer any injury for which it might seek compensation,its substantive due process claims are not subject to a statute of limitations.see lavey city of two rivers,rejecting argument that section challenge to local sign ordinance was untimely,noting that plaintiff sought only declaratory and injunctive relief,judgment aff,cir adver.city of raleigh,cir cited in lavey it is doubtful that an ordinance facially offensive to the first amendment can be insulated from challenge by a statutory limitations period maldonado harris,cir seconding fourth circuit doubts and collecting district court cases in like vein.
we need not resolve the timeliness question.the expiration of the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense that does not affect our subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case,jogi voges,cir.we may assume that even if gass claim is subject to a statute of limitations,the limitations period did not begin to run when heerey received the notice of limitation,as it was not yet clear at that time that the city would refuse to grant a permit for the sign.but even if we assume that the due process claims are timely,they nonetheless fail on their merits.
intrusion upon a cognizable property interest is a threshold prerequisite to a substantive due process claim of the type that gass asserts.see,am.mfrs.mut.ins.sullivan,d the first inquiry in every due process challenge is whether the plaintiff has been deprived of a protected interest in property or liberty.swartz scruton,cir garza miller,cir.in other words,no abstract right to substantive due process exists under the constitution.zorzi county of putnam,cir.consequently,the lack of a protected property interest is fatal to a substantive due process claim.id.at.
gass substantive due process claims,as we have said,are premised on the notion that because its advertising sign constituted a legal use of its property prior to the amendments to the chicago zoning ordinance,gass has a protected property interest in continuing this prior,legitimate,albeit now,use of the property.this might be true of the original,sign that heerey first had painted on his building in.although that sign was painted on the building without a permit,the district court determined or assumed that the relevant provisions of the zoning ordinance and electrical code did not require a permit for such a sign,and we like the parties have accepted her ruling in that regard as correct.consequently,the sign in its original form arguably constituted a prior nonconforming use in which gass has a protected property interest and of which it may not be deprived arbitrarily.and gass,of course,contends that it is arbitrary and irrational for the city to treat as grandfathered signs that were erected with a permit but not signs,like its own,that were lawfully erected without a permit.
but even granting that gass may have had a protected property interest in the original,sign,it could not have acquired such an interest in the later manifestations of the sign.when heerey illuminated the sign in the late,and when he expanded the sign in the,he was obligated by the express terms of the city electrical code to obtain a permit,which,so far as the evidence reveals,he did not do.thus,the expanded and illuminated sign that existed in,when the city amended the zoning ordinance to prohibit advertising signs within feet of a residential district,was not an authorized use of the property that gass had any protected interest in continuing as a legal use.taylor,at citing wright county of dupage,d,city of marengo pollack,d.and absent a protected property interest in the sign,gass substantive due process claims necessarily fail,zorzi,at.
gass does not dispute that the terms of the electrical code required heerey to obtain a permit when he illuminated and expanded the sign,but gass argues that the permit requirement itself was constitutionally invalid.specifically,gass contends that the permit requirement amounted to an invalid prior restraint on speech as advertising,the sign constituted commercial speech,see metromedia,city of san diego,d plurality,in that the relevant terms of the permitting scheme placed no limits on the city discretion to deny a permit nor any time constraints on the city decision to grant or deny a permit.see generally,city of dallas,d plurality weinberg city of chicago,cir see also,solantic llc city of neptune beach,cir permitting scheme for signs amounted to unconstitutional prior restraint given lack of time limits on city obligation to act on permit applications desert outdoor,city of moreno valley,cir sign permit ordinance constituted unlawful prior restraint in view of city unbridled discretion to deny sign permits.gass adds that the permit application itself requested information about the content of the proposed sign inquiring,for example,what the sign will read,suggesting that the city may have been making decisions about which permit applications it would grant and which it would deny in any case,given the asserted defects in the permitting scheme as it existed when heerey illuminated and expanded the sign,gass contends that the permit requirement should be treated as a nullity with which heerey was not obligated to comply.see shuttlesworth city of birmingham,d a person faced with such an unconstitutional licensing law may ignore it and engage with impunity in the exercise of free expression for which the law purports to require a license.
we may accept without deciding that the features of the city permitting scheme on which gass has focused indeed rendered the permit requirement incompatible with the first amendment,such that heerey was entitled to ignore it.indeed,heerey did ignore it.so far as the record reveals,he not only never obtained a permit authorizing him to illuminate and then expand the sign on his building,but never bothered applying for one nonetheless,he proceeded to illuminate and enlarge the sign.his speech,or more properly,that of his lessees,was never restrained.of course,this does not preclude gass from attacking the validity of the permit requirement.shuttlesworth,at.at.but the question for us is whether,by virtue of the defects in the permitting scheme as it existed in that time period,heerey and gass also obtained a protected property interest in the sign as a lawful,use,just as if heerey had obtained a permit or as if the electrical code had not required a permit for the illumination or expansion of an existing sign.
our decision in petra presbyterian church vill.of northbrook,cir,cert.denied,d,decided shortly after we heard argument in this case,reveals that the answer to this question is no.the plaintiff in petra was a religious congregation that had purchased a warehouse in the hopes of converting the facility into a church.the property was located in an area of a suburban chicago village that was zoned for industrial use.although a zoning ordinance permitted other membership organizations,including community and youth centers,fraternal associations,and political clubs,to operate facilities in an industrial district,the ordinance did not allow a church to locate there absent rezoning of the property and issuance of a special use permit.before purchasing its property,petra applied for the necessary rezoning and permit.however,after neighboring landowners voiced opposition to the request,the local planning commission recommended to the village board of trustees that the application be denied,and the trustees signaled their inclination to acquiesce in the commission advice.before the denial could be formalized,petra withdrew its application but it nonetheless proceeded to purchase the property and,without authorization,began using the warehouse as a church.in the meantime,congress had enacted the religious land use and institutionalized persons act of rluipa,which among other things prohibits a local government from imposing or implementing a land use regulation that treats a religious assembly or institution on less than equal terms with a nonreligious assembly or institution.b.fearing that its ordinance might be invalid under rluipa because it treated religious organizations less favorably than other membership organizations in terms of their ability to operate in an industrial district,the village in adopted a revised ordinance that banned all membership organizations from industrial districts.existing organizations were grandfathered,but petra,which had never received permission to operate a church in the industrial district,was not.after the new ordinance was enacted,the village sought and obtained an injunction in state court effectively barring petra from conducting worship services in its facility.the plaintiff filed suit in federal court under rluipa and lost in the district court.
among other arguments,petra contended on appeal that although it had never obtained the requisite rezoning and permit to operate a church within the industrial zone of the village,it nonetheless had obtained a vested interest in continuing to operate a church there.petra claimed that when it bought the property,it was relying on the invalidity of the zoning ordinance,which by treating religious organizations less favorably than other membership organizations violated not only rluipa but the clause of the first amendment.by virtue of that reliance,petra maintained that it had obtained an indefeasible right to use the warehouse for a church.so in petra view,even if the zoning ordinance enacted in barring all membership organizations from the industrial zone were valid,petra would still have the right to operate its church there like any other grandfathered other words,as if it had obtained the village permission to do so in the first instance.
we categorically rejected the notion that petra could have acquired any right to operate a church in reliance on the invalidity of the zoning ordinance that was in effect when it purchased the property and established its church 
we can not find any basis,whether in cases or other conventional sources of law,or in good sense,for the proposition that the federal constitution forbids a state that has prevented a use of property by means of an invalid even an unconstitutional enactment to continue to prevent that use by means of a valid one.from the proposition that the village should not have discriminated in the industrial zone in favor of secular membership organizations it does not follow that when it eliminated the discrimination by banning all membership from the zone,this entitled the victim of the discrimination to claim,by way of remedy,discrimination in its favor.so strange a rule of estoppel could hardly be thought an imperative of due process,especially since,although property rights are protected to a degree by the due process clauses of the constitution,the scope of those rights is determined by state law within broad limits that include the conditions under which a governmental act can render a property right indefeasible.crown media,gwinnett county,cir coral springs street,city of sunrise,cir lakeview dev.city of south lake tahoe,cir.
and if there were such a rule of constitutional law vesting by estoppel,it would be inapplicable to this case.if the ordinance violated rluipa,as northbrook comes close to conceding,petra did have to comply with it.but that does mean that it acquired an immunity from all zoning regulation.it knew or should have known that northbrook could redo its ordinance to comply with the less than equal terms provision of rluipa in one of two ways by permitting religious organizations in the industrial zone,or by forbidding all membership organizations in the zone.petra could not reasonably assume that the village would choose the first option.and since it therefore did not reasonably rely on the illegality of the ordinance in going ahead and buying the property,but instead assumed the palpable risk that a new,valid ordinance would continue the ban on its desired use of the property,it has no ground for blocking the village from enforcing the amended ordinance against it,on the theory that the village pulled the rug out from under it by changing the ordinance.
at emphasis in original.
gass finds itself in essentially the same position as the plaintiff in petra.gass wishes to continue using its property in a manner that the current version of the city zoning ordinance prohibits,because its sign is larger than square feet and is within feet of a residential district gass only means of preserving its sign is to establish that the sign was a lawful use prior to the zoning change.the problem for gass,as it was for petra,is that neither gass nor heerey ever obtained the permits that were required for its use heerey illuminated and expanded the sign without even seeking a permit.so even before the current zoning took effect,gass sign,like petra church,was an unauthorized use of its property.gass can not claim a protected interest in continuing to display advertising that,once illuminated and expanded,was illegal from the start.to circumvent that obstacle,gass seeks to rely on constitutional defects in the permitting scheme in effect in the and,contending that these defects rendered the permit requirement a nullity and rendered its illuminated and expanded sign a lawful use of the property notwithstanding its lack of the requisite permits for such a sign.gass,just like the plaintiff in petra,is retrospectively relying on the supposed illegality of former incarnations of the zoning ordinance to transform its unlicensed use of property into an authorized use and to give it a property interest in continued use of that property despite subsequent changes to the zoning code.gass creative bootstrapping effort fails for precisely the same reasons that petra did.
we note that,consistent with our decision in petra,illinois cases also reject the notion that a property owner may rely on purported defects in prior versions of the law as the springboard to claim a vested interest in a property use for which it never obtained permission.as the court reasoned in city of elgin all nations worship,d,
v ested rights are acquired by attempting to comply with an ordinance as written w hen a party expends substantial time and effort attempting to comply with an ordinance as it then exists and then the legislative body amends the ordinance,the party may acquire a vested right to proceed under the old ordinance.citation omitted.here,however all nations proceeded in violation of the zoning ordinance as written.it is difficult to see how all nations can claim a vested right to ignore the existing ordinance.
emphasis in original.see also adver.vill.of downers grove,d.as it is illinois law to which gass must look for a property right,these holdings confirm that gass lacks the requisite basis for a due process claim.
as a fallback,gass contends that at the very least,it has a protected property interest in continuing to display a smaller,sign on its building.because,as the district court assumed,no permit was required for the sign or signs heerey originally had painted on his building in the early,that type of sign was an authorized use and gass argues that it may assert a right to display at least that type of advertising,even if it has no claim to the larger,illuminated sign for which it never sought the requisite permits.
but this is an argument that gass made too late in the day.gass first advanced this argument in a meaningful way in its supplement to its motion under rule to amend the judgment.arguments that could have been made earlier but are instead raised for the first time in a rule motion are waived,estremera united states,cir.the argument was hinted at parenthetically in the pretrial order recitation of gass proposed legal conclusions see ex.l at,and again in the opening statement that gass lawyer made at trial,at,but those references alone were insufficient to alert either the city or the court to the argument that gass finally developed and supported in the supplement to its rule motion.as the district court noted,gass
