background 
david eckles owns real property including a house in corydon,a city located in wayne county,iowa.he purchased the property in for the sum of.eckles companion lived in the house until his death in.eckles moved in shortly thereafter.in,the assessed value of the residence was.around this time eckles began renovating the house.the assessed value of the property increased during the next several years,and by,it had risen to.eckles appealed the valuation,alleging the property had been wrongfully overvalued due to his perceived homosexuality.the appeal hearing was scheduled for a date when eckles would be out of town and unable to attend.the wayne county board of review board of review denied eckles request to reschedule the hearing.as a result,eckles attorney represented him at the hearing.the board of review upheld the assessment without viewing the property.in june,eckles appealed the board of review decision to the iowa state court for wayne county.in october,while the appeal was pending,the state of iowa issued a state equalization order for increases in the assessed value of all residential property in wayne county.accordingly,the wayne county assessor,kay middlebrook,increased the assessed value of eckles property to.
in july,eckles posted a large sign on his house and other signs on his property.the signs expressed eckles dissatisfaction with the valuation of his home,combined religious and political statements,and criticized officials of both the city and the county on august,eckles attorney received a letter from an attorney representing the board of review stating 
as i am sure you are aware,your client has erected three large signs on his property relating to the assessment of his property,and the equity of property taxes in general.please note that his signs appear to be in violation of the zoning ordinance of the city of corydon and iowa code.
the corydon zoning ordinance governing signs,clearly prohibits signs in residential districts except for those that fall into the enumerated exceptions,which your client signs clearly do not.in addition,on information and belief,your client has not obtained the required permit from the department of transportation as mandated by iowa code,which regulates billboards erected adjacent to iowa highways eckles residence is adjacent to iowa highway.
since your client signs fail to comply with the corydon zoning ordinances as well as the permit requirements of the iowa department of transportation,you may want to advise eckles to remove these signs as soon as possible.failure to remove these signs could result in action from both the city of corydon and the iowa department of transportation.
appellant app.at.
in response to this letter,eckles painted at least two additional signs on his property.on august,he replied,via letter,to the law firm representing the board of review,reiterating his belief that his property was wrongfully and the city and county officials were corrupt.
on august,the firm representing the board of review sent eckles attorney another letter,opining that the signs were a public nuisance and their messages libelous.the letter stated that if the signs were not removed and their messages publicly retracted,the firm would advise county officials to institute private actions against eckles.
shortly thereafter,eckles dropped his pending appeal of the property value assessment.he then removed his deck,garage,sunroom,and other improvements he had made to the property,and painted five additional signs on or around the house 
on october,the city sent eckles a notice to abate nuisance,requiring eckles to remove all refuse from his residential property,as well as all signs,lettering,statements,verses,and objects whatsoever that refer to actions taken by state,county,and city officials in the legally constituted performance of their duties.appellant app.at.the notice stated that if eckles did not adhere to the notice or request a hearing within ten days,the city would have the items removed and charge eckles with the cost of removal.
eckles then filed a complaint in federal district court for damages,injunctive relief,and declaratory relief against the city,the county,david clayton richard couchman maurice auxier gene gibbs paul overton and kay middlebrook the complaint alleged first amendment violations by the city and mayor clayton,first amendment violations by the county,equal protection violations by couchman,auxier,gibbs,overton,and middlebrook and intentional infliction of emotional distress by couchman,auxier,gibbs,and overton.
the city assured eckles that it would not seek to abate the nuisance during the pendency of the federal suit.on may,the city revoked the october,notice and issued a revised notice.the revised notice stated that the city,through mayor clayton,will consider eckles statements to be a nuisance only insofar as those statements are objectively false.in particular,the mayor finds that said statements constitute a nuisance insofar as they falsely suggest that any state,county,and city official,including without limitation the county assessor,has violated any law.appellant app.at.the letter that accompanied the revocation of notice to abate and the revised notice requested that eckles dismiss his suit against the city defendants.the letter also stated that the city would enforce the notice but agreed to abstain from enforcement in part if eckles asserted that it violated his first amendment rights appellant app.at.
the district court granted summary judgment to all of the defendants,finding that eckles failed to allege a threat of imminent harm sufficient to establish standing.we hold that eckles has standing in his suit against the city and clayton,but not against the other defendants.

a.the city 
eckles contends he was subjected to a threat of imminent harm by the city.he directs us to the notices of abatement issued by the city requiring him to remove signs and other items from his property.the district court conducted a brief analysis of the claim against the city,concluding that the notice to abate did not satisfy the test for.we disagree.
on may,the city withdrew the october,notice to abate and issued the revised notice to abate the city has agreed to not enforce the revised notice,at least in part while this suit is pending.thus,the city argues that there is no risk of imminent harm.we disagree.the city has stated that it will only abstain from enforcing the notice while the suit is pending.the revised notice is in effect,and if the suit is dismissed eckles could expect the city to enforce the notice.moreover,there is nothing to prevent the city from enforcing it immediately if it so chose.the threat of injury to eckles is imminent and concrete.eckles is clearly in imminent danger of suffering some consequence as a result of his allegedly protected activity the concrete and particular harm that eckles will suffer is financial,and spelled out in the city notice to abate.if eckles fails to act in accordance with the notice,the city will remove the signs and other items and charge eckles for the removal.in other words,eckles stands to suffer direct,financial injury should he choose to ignore the demands of the notice.it is not necessary that eckles wait until the city actually enforces the notice to bring suit challenging the city actions as long as the those actions are imminent and not speculative.see harmon,at finding a plaintiff does not have to subject self to actual arrest and prosecution in order to challenge the constitutionality of statute.the city planned actions are not merely speculative,the city has clearly outlined the actions it plans to take with regard to eckles property as soon as the federal case ends.the district court erred in holding the city conduct did not subject eckles to,and thus,we reverse as to the city and clayton.the question of whether the city notice to abate violates eckles first amendment rights shall be decided on remand 
b.the county 
eckles first amendment action against the county is based on letters he received on august and,from the law firm representing the board of review.eckles argues that these letters show a threat of imminent harm sufficient to satisfy the requirement for standing.unlike the notice to abate issued by the city,which outlines the specific actions the city will take,the august letter merely states that f ailure to remove these signs could result in action from the city of corydon and the iowa department of transportation.appellant app.at emphasis added.similarly,the august letter states that the firm would recommend that county officials pursue private actions against eckles if he failed to remove the signs and retract their messages.appellant app.at emphasis added.
eckles contends that the letters from the attorney for the board of review threatened prosecution and a civil lawsuit if he failed to remove the signs on his property,and therefore are sufficient to show.the district court held that the comments in the august,letter are too general and speculative to confer standing,and that the threats were not concrete nor particularized,not actual nor imminent,but merely conjectural or hypothetical.further,the district court recognized that the august,letter did not contain a threat of prosecution and that eckles suffered no based on either letter.eckles has brought to bear no evidence that the county or board of review possessed the authority to enforce the city or state ordinances mentioned in its letters.we agree with the district court that these two letters are insufficient to establish that eckles was threatened with harm by the county.
iii.equal protection 
eckles next alleged that couchman,auxier,gibbs,overtown,and middlebrook violated his constitutional right to equal protection.he claimed that the increases in his assessed property value were arbitrary,unfair,disproportionate to other similarly situated property,and done solely to punish him because of his perceived homosexuality.his property value changed annually from to to reflect improvements to his house,but eckles only appealed the valuation.he lost the appeal against the board of review and voluntarily dismissed his appeal of this board decision although this court can not serve as a property tax valuation appeal board,see schutterle united states,cir,we may consider an equal protection claim based on an alleged purposeful of property.to show that his right to equal protection has been violated by the defendants,eckles must show that either the state or county taxing officials did not adhere to a uniform standard of valuation when assessing the value of his property,and that the standard was purposely not applied to his property.additionally,t he difference must be due to a purposeful discrimination,which may be evidenced,for example,by a systematic of the property of some taxpayers and a systematic of the property of others,so that the practical effect of the official breach of law is the same as though the discrimination were incorporated in and proclaimed by the statute.snowden hughes.the does not need to be systematic so long as it is shown to be purposeful.id.at.eckles presented no evidence showing that the county or any of the named county officials purposely his property.moreover,there is no evidence that the county or named county officials failed to abide by the assessment standard for the county in assessing eckles property.he claimed that his property was unfairly,but there appears to be no proof that the property value assessment is unfair.in fact,eckles estimated in a interview that he might be able to sell his home for to.eckles lacks evidence that the county value assessments of his property were unfair and therefore can not show that he has been treated unfairly.we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment for the defendants on the charge of violation of eckles equal protection rights.
iv.intentional infliction of emotional distress 
finally,eckles argues that defendants couchman,auxier,gibbs,and overton intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon him in various ways.intentional infliction of emotional distress is a state tort claim.under iowa law 
four elements must be established to make a prima facie showing of intentional infliction of emotional distress outrageous conduct by the defendants the defendants intentional causing,or reckless disregard of the probability of causing emotional distress the plaintiff suffering severe or extreme emotional distress and actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by the defendants outrageous conduct.
marks estate of hartgerink,iowa.
we agree with the district court that eckles has failed to establish the first element that defendants conduct was outrageous.to be outrageous,the conduct must be so extreme in degree,as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency,and to be regarded as atrocious,and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.id.quoting vinson cmty.sch,iowa.
eckles claim is based primarily on his contention that county officials purposely his property because of his perceived homosexuality.as discussed above,eckles has failed to show that his property was indeed unfairly.we must therefore assume that the property assessments were fair.it would be difficult to show that a fair property value assessment would be considered atrocious or intolerable in a civilized community,and eckles has failed to do so.
next eckles claims that the board of review failure to resche
