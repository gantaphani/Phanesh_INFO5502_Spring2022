opinion of the court 
the district court held that unless asbestos in a building was of such quantity and condition as to make the structure unusable,the expense of correcting the situation was not within the scope of a first party insurance policy covering physical loss or damage.we agree and will affirm.
plaintiffs,the port authority of new york and new jersey and its subsidiary,the port authority corporation,own numerous facilities in new york and new jersey that incorporated asbestos products in their construction.alleging asbestos contamination,plaintiffs filed suit for damages in the new jersey state courts against the defendants,a number of insurance companies that had policies on the various structures.the case was removed to the united states district court for the district of new jersey.
plaintiffs seek recovery for expenses incurred in conjunction with the abatement of materials in their structures such as the world trade center complex in new york and newark international airport in new jersey.the plaintiffs contend that physical damage has occurred in these structures as a result of the presence of asbestos,threat of release and reintrainment of asbestos fibers,and the actual release and reintrainment of asbestos fibers.
to support their claims,plaintiffs point to the existence of friable asbestos in some of their buildings.once an asbestos product reaches the friability stage,it may be crumbled by vibrations or hand pressure and it continues to deteriorate into separate fibers.in this condition,the asbestos becomes more susceptible to dispersion in the air and poses an increased risk to human health.plaintiffs cite this as a documented problem at newark airport,where insulation had to be removed from pipes around the heating and ventilating units.in other locations,asbestos fibers were actually released during the performance of routine building functions,the renovation of existing structures,and demolition projects.
in the,the plaintiffs undertook a renovation program to remove asbestos products from portions of the world trade center.pursuant to osha regulations,plaintiffs augmented their abatement policy by conducting regular surveys of materials and employing air monitoring procedures.during these activities,maintenance and construction workers were subjected to stringent safety requirements,including mandatory protective clothing and equipment.however,air samples taken in each location did not reveal the presence of asbestos fibers exceeding epa standards.
even after the world trade center was severely damaged by a truck bomb in,extensive air sampling tests indicated that,except for the occasional spikes of higher levels,the existing conditions were not problematic.relying on these tests,plaintiffs continually assured their employees,as well as current and prospective tenants,that the buildings were safe and within regulatory limits.
the port authority policy on the asbestos present was to manage it in place and to abate it only when required.the record in the district court established that none of the plaintiffs structures violated applicable regulations,and asbestos levels inside the buildings were comparable to background levels on the streets.in the more than locations alleged to contain asbestos or an imminent threat of its release,plaintiffs assert claims for abatement projects,which the record shows had been carried out in only instances.during this time,all of plaintiffs structures continued in normal use.
plaintiffs made claims against the defendants under their insurance policies which contained one of the following statements of the perils within the scope of the policies 
all risks of physical loss or damage occurring during the period of this policy including loss of revenue and business interruption,are insured against,except as otherwise specifically excluded.
all risks of physical loss or damage occurring during the period of this policy including loss of revenue are insured against,except as otherwise specifically excluded.
all risks of direct physical loss or damage occurring during the period of this policy including loss of revenue are insured against,except as otherwise specifically excluded.
the policies define loss occurrence as a loss or combination of losses caused by all risks of physical loss or damage subject to the perils excluded arising out of one single event o r a loss by any peril or combination of perils insured against arising out of a single event.the periods covered in the policies were from to.unlike usual contracts of adhesion,the manuscript policies issued by the defendants were drafted by plaintiffs with the aid of counsel and insurance professionals,and,in some respects,negotiated with the underwriters.
in view of the number of claims and complexity of the case,the district court divided the litigation into three stages.the first was limited to such preliminary determinations as timeliness of notice and suit limitations in various policies.some of the defendants were dismissed at the conclusion of this initial phase and no appeal has been taken from those rulings.
the second stage of the litigation was to encompass all issues relating to whether,and if so,to what extent,physical loss or damage happened at a time for which an insurer is responsible under a policy.in order to simplify the proceedings,and at the suggestion of the parties,the court designated six buildings of the world trade center and nine at newark international airport as test structures.the third stage was to have been devoted to determining the monetary loss.because the district court entered summary judgment in favor of all defendants,however,it did not reach the third stage.
the district court framed the issue as whether coverage was triggered in the first instance,without regard to language excluding certain risks of loss.finding that the language of the policies was unambiguous,the court determined that the only question that needed to be decided was whether the insured had suffered physical loss or damage.
the plaintiffs have the burden to establish that their structures were,in fact,physically damaged in order to trigger coverage.see,koppers aetna cas.surety,cir cobra products federal ins.in resolving the issues before it,the court concluded that it is important to differentiate between the authorities generated by and coverage.where,in the district court opinion,the central issue is a fundamental one delimiting the scope of coverage under a first party insuring agreement.t here is more than adequate justification to seek guidance only from first party precedent.
acknowledging that no controlling case on point existed,the court reasoned that physical loss or damage could be found only if an imminent threat of asbestos release existed,or actual release of asbestos resulted in contamination of the property so as to nearly eliminate or destroy its function,or render it uninhabitable.the mere presence of asbestos,on the other hand,was not enough to trigger coverage.
the court determined that the plaintiffs had failed to introduce evidence of physical loss or damage sufficient to survive summary judgment.notably,the court observed that a significant portion of the plaintiffs claimed losses arise from the presence of asbestos,unaccompanied by even the suggestion of actual release or imminent threat of release of asbestos fibers.of the plaintiffs locations where proof of release was shown,the court noted that the continued and uninterrupted use of the buildings without any indication of elevated airborne asbestos level,coupled with the plaintiffs own assurances of public safety,belie the existence of contamination to the extent required to constitute physical loss or damage.finally,the court concluded that the plaintiffs can not create a material issue based on imminent threat of release of asbestos manifested during the years to if it has failed to abate the purported threat to date.
the port authority has appealed,asserting that the district court adopted an incorrect standard for physical loss and misconstrued and insurance case law.moreover,the plaintiffs argue that they produced ample proof that there w
