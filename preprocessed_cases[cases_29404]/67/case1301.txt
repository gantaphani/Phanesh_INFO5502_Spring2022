from through,appellants loaned approximately million to hartmann for the purpose of purchasing properties to be rehabbed and sold.the funds were held in an escrow account at capital title,and all of the loan transactions were closed at capital title appellants understood that the loans would be secured by first deeds of trust on the properties hartmann purchased.with one exception,there is no evidence that capital title issued a first american title insurance commitment or policy to appellants as the insured to insure any of the loans,properties,or transaction at issue ultimately,hartmann diverted funds in the escrow account to his own use,and when appellants sought to foreclose on properties for which they supposedly held deeds of trust,they learned that for many of the properties their deeds of trust were not valid or lacked priority.appellants claim hartmann was able to misappropriate escrow funds,and they received effectively worthless deeds of trust because capital title mishandled escrow accounts and real estate closings 
in november,first american learned that capital title had bounced checks,and first american initiated an audit of capital title accounts.as of january,first american findings revealed that the aggregate amount of outstanding checks drawn on capital title escrow account exceeded the balance on deposit in the escrow account by approximately million.first american terminated its agency relationship with capital title and filed a receivership lawsuit.capital title ceased doing business in missouri when all of its assets were seized and liquidated by a trustee for the benefit of creditors in the receivership proceeding.

vicarious liability claims counts of the complaint 
appellants argue the district court erred when it found capital title did not have authority to engage in the activities alleged in the complaint.specifically,appellants contend there is a genuine dispute as to whether capital title had express or implied authority to perform escrow and closing services

appellants vicarious liability claims rely on the premise that capital title had authority to provide escrow and closing services as first american agent.the district court appeared to find that capital title had authority to provide escrow and closing services for insured transactions transactions in which a title insurance commitment or policy was issued,but capital title did not have authority to provide escrow and closing services for uninsured transactions.because the district court concluded that all of the transactions at issue were uninsured transactions,it found that capital title did not have authority to engage in the activities identified in the complaint.we agree with the district court ultimate conclusion that capital title lacked such authority.
the agency agreement clearly and unambiguously defines the nature and scope of first american and capital title agency relationship.under the agency agreement,capital title authority to act as first american agent is limited to those purposes specifically set forth in the agency agreement,and for no other purpose and in no other manner whatsoever.the agency agreement specifically grants capital title authority to issue title insurance commitments and policies for specified land the agency agreement does not specifically grant capital title authority to provide escrow and closing services.there is no evidence that first american manifested its express consent to grant capital title authority in addition to the authority granted in the agency agreement.accordingly,there is no genuine dispute that the scope of capital title express authority was limited to issuing title insurance commitments and policies and did not include the authority to provide escrow and closing services.
appellants argument that section of the agency agreement somehow expands the scope of capital title express authority is
