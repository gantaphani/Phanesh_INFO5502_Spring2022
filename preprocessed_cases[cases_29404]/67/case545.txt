opinion of the court 
the united states appeals from the district court judgment awarding compensation to overview limited partnership overview and hans and christina enggren the enggrens pursuant to the government taking of acres of land in the gettysburg national military park.the government asserts that the district court impermissibly failed to apply the unit rule of valuation in determining the fair market value of the condemned land instead valuing separate interests rather than the aggregate interests as a single unit.moreover,the government contends that in so doing the district court awarded compensation to overview and the enggrens that exceeded,in aggregate,the amount the united states could fairly be obliged to pay.in essence,the government argues that the district court strayed from the clear path of the unit rule and,mired in a jungle of valuations of partial interests,double counted a key component of its estimate of the land value,in effect charging the government twice.because we agree,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings.
facts and procedural history 
a.the condemned properties 
on december,the united states filed a complaint in condemnation to acquire approximately acres of land within the boundaries of the gettysburg national military park.the condemned land consisted of two fee simple interests,designated tract and tract,and multiple easements in three tracts of land,designated tract,tract,and tract collectively,the condemned properties.
tract was owned in fee simple by the enggrens in,the enggrens leased this parcel,which was unimproved at the time,to overview for a term of years overview intended to build on tract an observation tower overlooking the gettysburg battlefield and to operate the tower as a tourist attraction.accordingly,the lease provided that overview would own,insure,and pay all applicable taxes with respect to the proposed tower.at the end of the lease term,the enggrens would retake possession of the land and would also take ownership of the tower.construction of the observation tower was completed in.
tract was owned in fee simple by overview on this land,which lay adjacent to tract,overview owned and operated a gift shop,restaurant,and parking lot.these improvements were operated in conjunction with the tower as a tourist attraction.overview generated revenue from the gift shop and restaurant,and through fees for admission to the tower.overview also received rent from two cellular phone companies for space on the tower subleased for cellular antennae.
trial proceedings 
the declaration of taking,which transferred title in the condemned properties to the united states,was filed by the government on may,the government thereafter deposited with the registry of the district court an estimate of just compensation for the condemned properties million.because the enggrens and overview contested the fairness of the government estimated payment,a bench trial was set for the sole purpose of determining and awarding just compensation.
prior to trial,the parties submitted briefing on the appropriate methodology for valuing the condemned properties.as a result of that briefing,the district court issued a pretrial order on april,which stated in relevant part 
the highest and best use evaluation for the properties at issue can be determined in either of the two following ways 
a as a single unit together with their appurtenant easements,or 
b two covering tract and another appraisal covering tract,each with their appurtenant easements 
a bench trial was held in november,at which three expert appraisers testified to the fair market value of the condemned properties david lennhoff for the government,robert von ancken for overview,and william siverling for the enggrens.lennhoff and von ancken,in accordance with the first option available under the district court pretrial order,offered appraisals that valued the condemned properties as a single unit.siverling purported to take the second option,but rather than offer an appraisal of tract with its appurtenant easement,he appraised only the value of the enggrens legal interest in that parcel.
lennhoff testified that the most reliable methodology by which to appraise the condemned properties was the income capitalization approach using this approach,lennhoff testified that the condemned properties could generate an estimated annual net operating income of.he then divided this amount by an estimated capitalization rate of in order to conclude that the fair market value of the condemned properties was approximately million.lennhoff also valued the condemned properties using a cost approach applying this alternative approach,he testified that the fair market value of the condemned properties would be million.finally,lennhoff compared the income capitalization approach with the cost approach and determined that the former method was a more reliable indicator of the value of the condemned properties.nonetheless,he adopted a value that represented a reasonable rounding between the two approaches,yielding a final conclusion that the condemned properties were worth million.
overview appraiser,von ancken,testified that the cost approach,and not the income capitalization approach,was the more appropriate methodology for calculating the value of the condemned properties.according to von ancken,the cost approach resulted in an million valuation of the condemned properties.while that estimate was appropriate in von ancken opinion,he nonetheless engaged in an income capitalization analysis for the limited purpose of calculating for use under the cost approach certain depreciation amounts with respect to improvements on the condemned properties.von ancken income capitalization modification to his appraisal resulted in an estimated fair market value of million.von ancken explicitly testified that his calculations,using both the cost and income capitalization approaches,represented the total fair market value of the condemned properties as a single unit 
siverling,the enggrens expert,did not value the condemned properties as a single unit.nor did he calculate the total value of tract with its appurtenant easement as a unit.rather,he testified that his appraisal consisted of the value of the enggrens lease with overview.he did so using two methods.first,he estimated the amount of the annual rent payments the enggrens would receive from overview during the year halfway through the lease period the year and capitalized that income using a capitalization rate of.this yielded a value of million.second,he calculated the net present value of the cash flow to the enggrens under the remaining years on the lease using a discount rate of.this alternative calculation resulted in a value of million.siverling then averaged the results of the two methods and concluded that the enggrens legal interest in tract and its appurtenant easement was worth million.
district court findings 
the district court weighed the testimony of all three expert appraisers and decided that the income capitalization approach used by lennhoff was the most appropriate method of valuation.however,the court opined that,contrary to lennhoff own testimony,the income capitalization approach did not actually result in the fair market value of the condemned properties as a whole.rather,the court stated its belief that w hile the united states and overview purported to value the property as a whole,their capitalization of income approach was based only on the value that a hypothetical buyer would expect to earn from operating the t ower,or overview interest.in accordance with that belief,the court stated that it would use lennhoff approach to calculate the value of overview interest in the condemned properties,the value of overview fee simple interest in tract and its appurtenant easements plus the value of overview leasehold interest in tract and that it would calculate separately the value of the enggrens interest based on siverling testimony.according to the court,this procedure was consistent with its april,order that allowed the parties to value the condemned properties either as a single unit or as two different units of land.
with respect to its calculation of the value of overview interest,the district court made factual determinations regarding the projected income and expenses attributable to the condemned properties using a combination of both lennhoff and von ancken testimony.applying lennhoff methodology,the court concluded that the value of overview interest in the condemned properties was million.the court then proceeded to calculate separately the value of the enggrens interest.in so doing,it determined that the best way to do this was to use the income capitalization approach to calculate the present value of the future income the enggrens could expect to receive from their lease to overview.using this approach,the court concluded that the value of the enggrens interest in the condemned properties was million.
accordingly,the district court entered a final judgment against the united states in the amount of million million in favor of overview and million to the enggrens.the government timely appealed 
ii.discussion 
the government contends that the district court committed legal error when it purported to determine its award of just compensation by separately valuing the distinct legal interests of overview and the enggrens in the condemned properties.according to the government,the court should have followed the unit rule,calculating the fee simple value of the condemned properties as if in single ownership without regard to the constituent legal interests.the government further argues that the district court valuation,by its own terms,was clearly erroneous.

recognizing that condemnations proceed in rem,we have held that an award of just compensation under federal law can not be determined by separately valuing the various legal interests in the land condemned.see acres of land,at.this settled principle,referred to as the unit rule or undivided fee rule,embodies the idea that when land in which various persons have separate interests or estates is taken by the united states for public use,the amount of compensation to be paid must be determined as if the property was in a single ownership and without reference to conflicting claims or liens.id.citing meadows,at,united states,acres of land,cir bogart united states,cir a condemnation proceeding is an in rem proceeding and when land is taken in which separate interests or estates are owned by two or more persons,as between the public and the owners,it is regarded as one estate.nebraska,at the general federal rule of compensation for condemnation of a fee is well settled.the measure of just compensation under the fifth amendment for the taking of property in fee simple ordinarily is the fair market value of the property in fee ownership as of the time of taking irrespective of the number and kind of interests existing in it.but see united states city of new york,cir calling into doubt the existence of the unit rule.in prescribing this rule,we have explained that the value of the separate interests can not exceed the worth of the whole.acres of land,at see also united states acres of land,cir t he undivided fee rule provides that the division of a fee into separate interests can not increase the amount of compensation that the condemnor has to pay for the taking of the fee.
under the unit rule,the role of the united states,as condemnor,ends once the total amount of just compensation is determined.only after the total award is determined is it apportioned among the holders of various legal interests in the condemned property.see united states acres of land,cir the undivided fee rule essentially operates by permitting the governmental authority to condemn property by providing just compensation,then allowing the respective interest holders to apportion the award among themselves,either by contract or judicial intervention once the government provides just compensation for the condemned property,its role is at an end internal citations omitted eagle lake improvement,at the sum determined to be due for the taking is apportioned between the claimants,but,as between the condemnor and the condemnee,the property is valued as a whole.internal quotation omitted nebraska,at t he guarantee of the fifth amendment is regarded as being satisfied generally where the cash value of property taken in fee is substituted for it and the cash is allocated or apportioned among the respective estates or interests on the basis of their relative values.meadows,at the value of the property once being determined in a proper proceeding,the sum so determined stands in the place of the property and can be distributed upon the adjudication of the value of the respective interests.carlock united states,it is a fundamental principle,governing condemnation proceedings,where several interests are involved,such as estates for life,or in remainder,or leaseholds,or in reversion,in the property to be condemned,all should be combined in determining the value of the fee,after which the total value of the fee can be subdivided in satisfaction of the values fixed upon the various interests involved.
