river of life kingdom ministries the church attempted to relocate its congregation from a crowded warehouse in chicago heights to its very own property a dated in a blighted community in the village of hazel crest.the problem was the village had a zoning ordinance in place that designated the area a service business district.the ordinance permitted a number of commercial uses for the property,but not religious services.the church was aware of this ordinance,but it bought the property anyway hoping it would receive a special use permit,a form of relief,which,unbeknownst to the church,was no longer available under the current zoning ordinance.so the church sued the village under the religious land use and institutionalized persons act rluipa to allow it to relocate to the business district.before the case could be decided on the merits,the church filed a motion for preliminary injunction to allow it to relocate to the property in the interim.the district court denied the motion and the church appealed.we conclude that the church has only a slim chance of success on the merits and that any irreparable harm it may suffer does not significantly outweigh the potential harm to the village.as a result,we affirm the district court denial of the church motion for preliminary injunction.
background 
river of life kingdom ministries is a nonprofit religious organization with approximately members.every sunday,approximately thirty members of the church assemble for worship in a chicago heights warehouse that it rents from a larger church.about half of its members regularly attend services.it also holds weekly bible study sessions and a women ministry every third saturday of the month.in addition to these services,the church wanted to do more for its members and the community.among its goals were promoting literacy,empowering communities,developing leaders,transforming economic conditions,and improving life,health,and safety for local citizens,all through the teaching and application of the principles of the word of god.river of life kingdom ministries.business plan.for these purposes,its current location was unsuitable.it only had access to the warehouse for five to six hours a week,the facility was continually dirty and lacked heat and air conditioning,and,to top it off,it had to share the space with two other churches.
in the fall of,the church decided to purchase its own facility and focused its attention on the property at park avenue in the village of hazel crest,a suburb miles south of chicago with a population near.the property is located in the oldest part of the village called hazel crest proper,which is marred by vacant storefronts,houses,and underperforming public schools.this part of the village has been in serious decline since the.to the church,this neighborhood in economic decline presented a valuable opportunity to implement its ministry goals and to contribute to neighborhood revitalization through a grass roots,hands on approach among the activities planned to implement its goals were bible study for the residents,seminars,mentoring programs,tutorial services,and even a few small businesses to help spur the local economy 
by the time the church began negotiations with the property owner on the terms of the sale,the village had adopted a series of zoning ordinances and established a tax increment financing tif plan.the village objective was to provide an attractive commercial area that enhanced the regional image of hazel crest and,particularly,to revitalize the area near the metra train station.pursuant to this goal,hazel crest proper the b service business district under the village zoning ordinance was designated a tif district.this allowed the municipality to invest public funds in improvements to the area,including building new infrastructure and land acquisition.as the redevelopment kicked in,the additional tax revenue generated would then be used to repay the municipality.the zoning ordinance,which implemented the redevelopment plan,allowed general commercial and retail uses,gas stations,hotels,taverns,offices,and meeting halls to locate in the area as permitted uses.there is some indication,however,that the revitalization planned by the village is still a few years and a few million dollars away from realization 
the village zoning regulations prompted the church to include a contingency in the sales contract conditioning closing on its ability to obtain a special use permit.however,due to erroneous legal advice or mistaken reliance on an outdated ordinance,the church later waived this contingency and purchased the property in october.soon after,the church filed an application for special permission to use the property,which the village denied.the church also applied for a exception which the village board of trustees also denied.
on february,the church filed a complaint and motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to prevent the village from enforcing the zoning ordinance.the complaint alleged that the ordinance violated the first amendment,the equal protection clause,and the substantial burden and equal terms provisions of rluipa.the district court denied the temporary restraining order however,while the motion for preliminary injunction was still pending before the court,the village amended its ordinance to also exclude community centers,schools,meeting halls,art galleries,and recreational buildings,among other uses,from zone b.both parties appear to concede that the strategy for this amendment was to bring the zoning ordinance into compliance with rluipa.
the district court allowed the village to supplement the record with the amended ordinance,and it then denied the church motion for preliminary injunction it is from this order that the church now appeals.
ii.analysis 
a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy,one that should not be granted unless the movant,by a clear showing,carries the burden of persuasion.mazurek armstrong,d citation omitted.to obtain such relief,the moving party must first demonstrate that it has a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits,lacks an adequate remedy at law,and will suffer irreparable harm.see girl scouts of manitou council,girl scouts of,cir.the court must then balance,on a sliding scale,the irreparable harm to the moving party with the harm an injunction would cause to the opposing party.id.the greater the likelihood of success,the less harm the moving party needs to show to obtain an injunction,and vice versa.id.the court must also consider whether the public interest will be harmed sufficiently that the injunction should be denied.christian legal soc y walker,cir.we review the district court legal conclusions de novo,its findings of fact for clear error,and its balancing of harms for abuse of discretion.coronado valleyview pub.sch.dist.u,cir.
church is unlikely to succeed on the merits 
the first part of our analysis requires us to address the strength of the church suit.the church argues that the ordinance violates the equal terms provision of rluipa,which states no government shall impose or implement a land use regulation in a manner that treats a religious assembly or institution on less than equal terms with a assembly or institution.b.we review de novo the district court determination that the church is likely to succeed on the merits of its rluipa claim.see christian legal soc y,at.
the church claims that the village ordinance,even as amended,violates the equal terms provision because it allows assemblies to locate within the b district.relying on midrash sephardi,town of surfside,cir,the church interprets the term assembly to include gymnasiums,health clubs,salons,day care centers,and hotels,all of which are permitted uses under the village ordinance.the church argues that,because the ordinance allows these assemblies but excludes the church proposed use,the ordinance treats religious assemblies on less than equal terms with ones,thus violating rluipa.the village,on the other hand,argues that it cured any potential rluipa concerns after its amendment removed meeting halls and other institutions from the list of permissible uses.according to the village,hotels,commercial gyms,health clubs,and the other uses raised by the church can not be considered assemblies,even under midrash definition.the village also directs our attention to the third circuit approach in lighthouse institute for evangelism,city of long branch,which requires a plaintiff to identify a institution that is similarly situated in regards to the regulatory purposes of the regulation.cir.this approach,the village argues,is even more favorable to its position although it still believes it will prevail under either standard.we have not had the opportunity to discuss at length the contours of the equal terms provision,but we benefit from the third and eleventh circuits thoughtful discussion on the issue we analyze their holdings accordingly.
in midrash,the eleventh circuit held that a town ordinance that prevented a synagogue from relocating in the business district violated rluipa equal terms provision.the district in question was created to provide for retail,shopping and personal service needs of the town residents and tourists,but also permitted theaters,restaurants,private clubs,and lodge halls within its boundaries.id.at.using the ordinary or natural meaning of assembly,as defined by webster and black law dictionary,the court found that private clubs and lodges were also assemblies similarly situated to churches and synagogues.id.at.therefore,to exclude synagogues but permit private clubs was to treat a religious assembly on less than equal terms with a one.id.at.although the court found that the ordinance violated rluipa,its inquiry did not stop there.the court applied strict scrutiny,determining whether the ordinance was narrowly tailored to advance a compelling interest.id.relying on the supreme court decision in church of the lukumi babalu aye,city of hialeah,d,it determined that laws which were not neutral or generally applicable were subject to strict scrutiny.id.at.it then extended this principle to rluipa cases,stating 
rluipa equal terms provision codifies the smith lukumi line of precedent a zoning law is not neutral or generally applicable if it treats similarly situated secular and religious assemblies differently because such unequal treatment indicates the ordinance improperly targets the religious character of an assembly.thus a violation of b equal treatment provision,consistent with the analysis employed in lukumi,must undergo strict scrutiny.
the third circuit,on the other hand,adopted a slightly different approach.a church argued that a plaintiff alleging a violation of the equal terms provision need only show that the city regulation treats a assembly better than a religious assembly without regard to the objectives of the regulation.lighthouse,at.the court disagreed.it reasoned that congress intended to codify the existing free exercise clause jurisprudence,all of which considered regulations presumptively valid if they were neutral and of general applicability.id.in other words,facial differentiation between religious and institutions alone was insufficient to demonstrate that the ordinance was.only when the institutions had the same effect on the city objectives was the regulation discriminatory.the court also declined to incorporate strict scrutiny into the equal terms provision.section a of rluipa the substantial burden provision includes express language applying strict scrutiny to land regulations that impose a substantial burden on a person religious exercise.the absence of such language in the equal terms provision,according to the court,demonstrated congress intent not to include it.id.at.as a result,the third circuit held that if a regulation treats religious assemblies or institutions on less than equal terms with assemblies or institutions that are no less harmful to the governmental objectives in enacting the regulation,that regulation without more fails under rluipa.id.at.applying this interpretation,the court struck down the city ordinance.it found that the ordinance violated rluipa because nothing in the record explained how the excluded religious assemblies harmed the city objectives more so than the included assemblies.id.at.
the difference between both approaches likely compels a different result here.the third circuit interpretation makes it difficult for the church claim to survive.the assemblies the church identified commercial gymnasiums,health clubs,salons,day care centers,and hotels,assuming they are indeed assemblies,are all commercial entities that contribute to the business district in ways a church can not.midrash interpretation of the equal terms provision,adopted by the district court,significantly improves the church likelihood of success.it would only need to demonstrate that one of the permitted uses was an assembly to establish a rluipa violation,and,thus,require us to apply strict scrutiny.it is debatable whether a day care center,a hotel,or a gymnasium can be considered an assembly,but the church would have at least some chance to win on the merits.as a result,we must first determine whether the district court applied the correct standard in finding that the church rluipa claim had a slight likelihood of success.the important question here is the proper interpretation of less than equal.the statute does not state explicitly whether this language means religious and institutions must always be treated identically in regulations,or whether the regulations can differentiate between them for legitimate,reasons.
the third and eleventh circuits are in agreement,and the legislative history suggests that rluipa codified in september the existing free exercise clause jurisprudence.lighthouse,at citing cong.rec,july,senate sponsor statement sections b and enforce the free exercise clause rule against laws that burden religion and are not neutral and generally applicable.midrash,at.we find the third circuit reasoning persuasive because we believe it is more consistent with congress intent and with the case law interpreting the free exercise clause.
the supreme court has clearly stated that the right of free exercise of religion does not require us to invalidate neutral laws of general applicability.employment,of human res.of or.smith,d.laws that depart from this principle of neutrality are subject to strict scrutiny.id.there are two ways in which a law can discriminate against religious conduct.the first is facially.in church of the lukumi babalu aye,city of hialeah,for instance,the supreme court stated that a law lacks facial neutrality if it refers to a religious practice without a secular meaning discernible from the language or context,d emphasis added.in that case,the challenged ordinances prohibited the sacrifice of animals within the city limits,but exempted slaughtering defined as the killing of animals for food by licensed establishment s of animals specifically raised for food purposes.id.at.the plaintiff argued that the words sacrifice and ritual had strong religious connotations and that the use of those terms in the ordinances demonstrated a lack of facial neutrality.id.at.the court disagreed,holding that sacrifice and ritual had secular meanings,and that the ordinance defined them without reference to religious practices.id.at.
an ordinance also lacks neutrality if its object is to suppress religious practice.id.at.the court in lukumi found persuasive the fact that the santeria church rituals were almost the only conduct subject to the ordinances,the stated government interests could have been addressed with narrower regulations,and that statements from city officials indicated hostility towards the religion.id.at.this led the court to conclude that the object of the ordinances was to prohibit the church religious practice.since this demonstrated a lack of neutrality,the court applied strict scrutiny before finding that the law violated the free exercise clause of the first amendment.id.at.
we assume that congress,consistent with the free exercise cases,did not intend to invalidate neutral laws of general applicability.and the supreme court explained in lukumi,that a law is if it refers to a religious practice without a secu
