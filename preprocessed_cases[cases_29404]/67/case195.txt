this appeal arises from a dispute between plaintiffs henry torromeo and mdr corporation and defendant town of fremont,new hampshire over the town delay in issuing certain building permits for property owned by plaintiffs.plaintiffs sued in federal court under,claiming that the town delay constituted both a violation of the takings clause of the fifth amendment and a breach of the due process and equal protection guarantees of the fourteenth amendment the district court granted the town motion to dismiss under.b because the complaint was barred by the doctrine and res judicata.we affirm.
the case has a somewhat involved factual and procedural history.in the late,plaintiffs received approval from the fremont planning board for planned housing subdivisions.subsequently,however,the town enacted a growth control ordinance empowering the board to limit the number of building permits that it would issue for new residential housing.the board thereafter implemented such a limitation,which resulted in plaintiffs being denied the needed permits.
displeased,plaintiffs sued in new hampshire superior court,challenging the validity of the growth control ordinance and seeking an injunction compelling the town to issue the building permits.the court granted the injunction because the town had failed to satisfy a statutory prerequisite before adopting the ordinance.after the new hampshire supreme court affirmed that ruling,the town issued the permits.
plaintiffs then filed additional separate suits in the new hampshire superior court,seeking compensation for the temporary taking of their property during the period in which they were wrongfully denied the permits.their complaints referenced both the takings clause of the fifth amendment to the united states constitution and the analogous provision of the new hampshire constitution,part,article.in addition,the complaints cited united states supreme court authority interpreting the federal takings clause.the cases were consolidated.
the superior court ruled that plaintiffs were entitled to compensation to offset the losses from the permits.after a trial on damages,the court awarded mdr and torromeo.the town appealed to the new hampshire supreme court which reversed.see torromeo fremont.it reasoned that compensation is due for a temporary taking only where the losses are caused by a municipality enactment of an unconstitutional ordinance.id.at.because the growth control ordinance had not been held unconstitutional,but merely invalid due to the town failure to follow statutory enactment procedures,no compensation was due.id.plaintiffs petitioned for a writ of certiorari in the united states supreme court,claiming that the new hampshire supreme court opinion conflicted with the fifth amendment takings clause.the petition was denied.see,d.
after the judgment became final,plaintiffs filed the present action.their complaint claimed that the town failure to compensate them justly for a taking violated the fifth amendment.they also alleged a violation of their substantive due process rights on the ground that the town denial of the building permits was arbitrary and capricious,and a violation of their equal protection rights because the town treated them differently from other similarly situated property owners.
the district court dismissed the complaint on two grounds.it first concluded that the complaint had to be dismissed under the doctrine because the plaintiffs federal lawsuit was little more than a thinly disguised effort to reverse the new hampshire supreme court decision rejecting their claimed entitlement,under the fifth amendment,to the damages for the temporary taking of their real property.torromeo fremont,wl,at.the court alternatively held the complaint was res judicata because the fifth amendment claim was in fact adjudicated in the proceeding,and the due process and equal protection claims could have been adjudicated in that proceeding.see id.at.
we review the district court dismissal order de novo.see roth united states,cir.we will affirm only if the facts fail to establish the town liability under some actionable legal theory.see rodi new england sch.of law,cir.
after the district court dismissed plaintiffs complaint,the supreme court decided exxon mobil saudi basic indus,d,which substantially limited the reach of the doctrine.see federaci√≥n de maestros de junta de relaciones del trabajo de,cir describing the limitations placed on by exxon mobil.because we agree that plaintiffs fifth amendment claim is res judicata,we bypass the issue and proceed to the district court alternative ruling.
under federal law,a federal court must give to a judgment the same preclusive effect as would be given that judgment under the law of the state in which the judgment was entered.migra warren city sch.dist.bd.of,d.this principle applies to a action brought in federal court following a judgment.id.at.thus,the effect of the new hampshire court final judgment on plaintiffs federal action is determined by applying new hampshire res judicata law.
in new hampshire,the essence of the doctrine of res judicata is that a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive upon the parties in a subsequent litigation involving the same cause of action.in re juvenile.the doctrine precludes litigation in a later case of matters actually litigated,and matters that could have been litigated,in the earlier action.see brzica trustees of dartmouth.for res judicata to apply,three elements must be satisfied the parties must be the same or in privity with one another the same cause of action must be before the court in both instances and a final judgment on the merits must have been rendered in the first action.see id.cause of action is broadly defined to mean the right to recover,regardless of the theory of recovery.mcnair mcnair.
at first blush,this case appears to fall squarely within new hampshire res judicata rules.the parties to the federal action and the state actions were identical.the same cause of action was before the federal court as was before the state court because both suits sought compensation for harm caused by the town wrongful denial of the permits.and the new hampshire court entered final judgments on the merits of plaintiffs actions.
there is,however,a complication.in,the united states supreme court held that a takings claim under the fifth amendment is not ripe until the plaintiff has sought compensation through available state procedures.see williamson county reg l planning comm hamilton bank,d see also deniz guaynabo,cir.in,building on williamson county,the new hampshire supreme court held that federal takings and related federal claims raised in a proceeding,alongside claims for compensation,had to be dismissed without prejudice because they were not ripe until the claims were resolved.see blue jay realty trust franklin,
invoking blue jay realty,plaintiffs argue that res judicata does not bar their action because their federal claims were not litigated in the action and they were not required to raise these claims in the action because they were not ripe.see in re iannochino,cir res judicata does not apply where a claim could not have been raised in the first litigation see also restatement second of judgments c res judicata does not bar a claim for relief in a subsequent action where the claim was not raised in the initial action because of restrictions on the court authority to entertain multiple theories in a single action.
but plaintiffs argument fails because the federal takings claim was actually litigated to a final judgment on the merits in the state court.as noted above,plaintiffs complaints identified the takings clause of the fifth amendment to the united states constitution as a basis for the cause of action.the complaints also cited first english evangelical lutheran church los angeles county,d,a supreme court case interpreting the takings clause.in addition,after losing in the new hampshire courts,plaintiffs filed a writ of certiorari with the united states supreme court claiming that the new hampshire decision violated their rights under the federal takings clause.these filings dem
