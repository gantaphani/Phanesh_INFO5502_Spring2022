john hooper appeals the dismissal of his diversity action against his longtime real estate partner,david wolfe,and various individuals and entities affiliated with wolfe,for failure to join an entity known as ppm iii partnership,lp.hooper argues that because ppm iii was not a necessary and indispensable party under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,the district court erred in dismissing the complaint.balancing the four factors to be considered in determining whether ppm iii is an indispensable party under rule b,we reverse the district court dismissal of hooper action for failure to join ppm iii.because the district court did not consider whether all of ppm iii constituent partners could be brought before the court,we remand the case with instructions to consider the feasibility of joining all of ppm iii remaining partners as defendants.
john hooper and david wolfe had worked together in real estate since.hooper analyzed the value of commercial real estate and determined whether a given property should be purchased,while wolfe arranged the financing for the projects.wolfe is the sole shareholder of public properties management,ppm,a tennessee corporation.ppm,became the general partner of a number of tennessee limited partnerships sharing similar names ppm i partnership lp,ppm iii partnership lp,ppm iv partnership lp,ppm v partnership lp and ppm viii partnership lp associated with wolfe real estate dealings.wolfe and ppm,employed harold smith,dave dogan,and stephen smith to assist wolfe in his real estate dealings.
this dispute relates to dealings between hooper and wolfe over the purchase of property in pico rivera,california,in the.hooper alleges that wolfe agreed to obtain financing to purchase the pico rivera property if hooper determined it should be purchased,and that the profits from the transaction would be split between the two men.costs for obtaining the financing would be borne by wolfe,while the costs of conducting the due diligence required to analyze the property would be borne by hooper.however,this agreement was never implemented.hooper completed the due diligence work with the assistance of kenneth and michael jones the joneses and recommended that the property be purchased,but discovered that wolfe had purchased the pico rivera property for himself through ppm iii.wolfe,it turns out,created ppm,which was made a general partner to ppm iii,with wolfe as the sole limited partner of ppm iii.an associate of wolfe,lauren reager,financed the transaction.
upon discovering that wolfe had purchased the pico rivera property for himself,hooper sought his fifty percent interest in the property.wolfe refused and stated that unless hooper and the joneses split a forty percent interest,he would have reager foreclose on the loan to ppm iii,leaving hooper and his associates with nothing.hooper agreed to a less than fifty percent interest in ppm iii,ostensibly to protect his interests,and filed suit.thus,prior to hooper lawsuit,ppm iii had title to the pico rivera property,with ppm,as the general partner and wolfe,hooper,jones and jones as limited partners.the partnership agreement gave ppm,as general partner,exclusive and absolute authority to act on behalf of the partnership.
the equally confused procedural history of this case begins in the district of connecticut,where hooper sued wolfe to enforce the original understanding and alleged that wolfe and his associates,smith,dogan and smith,diverted funds from ppm iii to several other ppm entities,violating fiduciary duties owed to ppm iii and hooper.after the case was transferred to the western district of tennessee,hooper filed a second amended complaint,adding ppm iii and the joneses as defendants.the joneses were voluntarily dismissed without prejudice on march,shortly after the second amended complaint was filed.while the federal litigation was pending,hooper filed a derivative action in tennessee state court seeking on behalf of ppm iii to recover funds allegedly diverted by wolfe and his associates to other entities and to impose a constructive trust on ppm iii assets 
in,ppm iii sought approval from the court to sell the pico rivera property.ppm iii also suggested an absence of subject matter jurisdiction because plaintiff hooper,a connecticut citizen,was also a limited partner of defendant ppm iii,and a partnership shares the citizenship of its partners for diversity jurisdiction purposes.hooper thereafter voluntarily dismissed ppm iii without prejudice on january.after trips between the dockets of several district court and magistrate judges,in late the case wound up with district judge jon mccalla and magistrate judge james allen of the western district of tennessee.judge mccalla ordered the pico rivera property sold to a third party on december,leaving ppm iii with million in net proceeds from the sale,which were to remain in escrow while the litigation proceeded.in the spring of,hooper sought to amend his complaint,as many of the issues in the case were mooted by the sale of the property and the only remaining asset of ppm iii was the million held in the escrow account of wolfe attorney.the proposed third amended complaint included essentially the same claims as the second amended complaint and omitted ppm iii as a defendant to clear up any questions regarding jurisdiction.
the district court never ruled on hooper motion to amend his complaint.rather,the magistrate filed a report and recommendation that the second amended complaint be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the report and recommendation based this conclusion on a finding that,under federal rule of civil procedure,ppm iii was a necessary party which could not be joined without destroying diversity,and which was indispensable to the litigation,thus requiring dismissal of the action.specifically,the magistrate found that the following factors all pointed to the dismissal of the hooper action the absence of ppm iii and the joneses from the proceedings the inability to fashion relief to protect ppm iii the inability to resolve any interest that ppm iii has in the dispute and the availability of state court to settle the dispute.the district court,adopting the magistrate report and recommendation,held that ppm iii was a necessary and indispensable party and entered a final judgment dismissing the case on june,but stayed enforcement of the judgment pending the outcome of this appeal.
there are essentially three steps to determine whether dismissal is proper under rule b.although the first two steps are met here,the third is not and dismissal was therefore improper.a person or entity is only indispensable,within the meaning of rule,if it is necessary,its joinder can not be effected,and the court determines that it will dismiss the pending case rather than proceed in the case without the absentee.glancy taubman centers,cir quoting moore federal practice c,at.first,ppm iii is a necessary party.second,ppm iii can not be joined without destroying diversity.third,however,hooper suit can proceed despite the absence of ppm iii,and the case need not be dismissed because ppm iii is indispensable.glancy,at.
ppm iii is a necessary party under rule a 
first,the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining ppm iii was a necessary party under rule a.a district court finding that a party is necessary under rule a is reviewed for abuse of discretion.id.at.while the district court did not analyze in detail the question of whether ppm iii is a necessary party under rule a,and it is possible to come to a different conclusion if this court were reviewing the case de novo it can not be said that the district court abused its discretion in determining that ppm iii was a necessary party.under federal rule of civil procedure a,a person is necessary,and where feasible should be joined,if 
in the person absence complete relief can not be accorded among those already parties,or the person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in the person absence may i as a practical matter impair or impede the person ability to protect that interest or
