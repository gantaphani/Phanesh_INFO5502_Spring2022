before this court is an appeal from a decision by a divided national labor relations board nlrb involving handbilling by union members in the mall,owned and operated by sandusky mall company sandusky.
sandusky is a private,limited partnership that owns and operates sandusky mall mall,an enclosed mall in sandusky,ohio.the mall contains stores and a central concourse,which provides access to the stores,and within the concourse are places to sit and also space leased for booths.the mall manager is responsible for enforcing sandusky policy against handbilling and solicitation of mall customers responsible for the good will and successful marketing of the mall,the manager decides whether to lease space for temporary displays.permission for temporary use is granted in writing and may be gratis,as directed by the mall manager.
the mall driveways,however,are posted with signs which read soliciting and posting of bills prohibited.one of those signs is on the driveway in front of the sears store at one end of the mall,and the attivo location,now in controversy,is near sears and its mall entrance.the mall entrance was posted with no soliciting signs.
in november,intervenor northeast ohio district council of carpenters,united brotherhood of carpenters joiners of america,union learned that a mall tenant,attivo,hired a construction contractor,crawford construction crawford,to renovate its store.in november and december,the union distributed handbills urging mall customers not to patronize attivo because of its hiring of a contractor,which the union contended had undermined local wage standards the union handbillers were not employees of sandusky,attivo,or crawford.the union also threatened to handbill another mall tenant,officemax,to protest its hiring of a contractor.sandusky attorney notified the union representative on november,that any handbillers on mall property would be considered trespassers and would not be permitted to hand out such handbills.on december,the union again handbilled inside the mall near attivo entrance,and a mall security guard told the handbillers they were not permitted to handbill on the mall property and must leave.the handbillers left but returned the next day,and montevideo,the mall manager,again asked them to leave and delivered a letter from sandusky attorney.the union handbillers left shortly but returned on december,and refused to leave at the security guard request.when the mall manager called the perkins township police and the handbillers refused to obey the police orders,they were arrested for trespass under ohio.
the union then promptly filed an unfair labor practice charge against sandusky,and on january,the nlrb general counsel issued,and later amended,a complaint alleging that sandusky had violated a of the act,a.the parties agreed to waive a hearing before an administrative law judge alj and transfer the case to the board itself for a decision on stipulated facts.the board accepted the stipulated record and motion to transfer the case to the board for decision.nearly four years later,the board found that sandusky violated the act and issued its decision.sandusky filed a timely petition for review,and the board filed a for enforcement.this court granted the union motion to intervene in this controversy.
in addition to filing the complaint on january,the regional director of the nlrb notified sandusky by letter to cease the trespass prosecution against union representatives within seven days.very promptly sandusky informed the regional director and the clerk of the court in which the prosecution was pending that it would not take any further action in the trespass prosecution unless this case were resolved in its favor.later,the local court dismissed both trespass charges against the union representatives and,at their request,sealed the record without opposition by sandusky.
the specific issue before this court is whether sandusky may be compelled to permit union members to trespass on the mall property for the purpose of distributing handbills urging mall customers not to patronize employers.this issue is a difficult one,but it is not one of first impression.we addressed precisely that issue in cleveland real estate partners nlrb,cir.the sharp divide among members of the board in the case before us today indicates the board difficulty with this issue.
effect of cleveland real estate partners 
we are normally bound by the precedent established by a decision on a particular issue by a prior panel of our court.the board majority,at best,inferentially acknowledged its burden to persuade us to deny the efficacy of cleveland real estate partners by stating 
we are mindful that the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit,in which this case arises,has rejected the board interpretation of discrimination as used in babcock wilcox in cleveland real estate partners,the board adopted the administrative law judge finding that the employer discriminatorily prohibited nonemployee union representatives from distributing handbills directed at shoppers to discourage them from patronizing a nonunion retailer in the mall because it permitted nonlabor related handbilling and solicitations by others in the mall.the sixth circuit denied enforcement of the board order,holding that,discrimination as used in babcock wilcox,means favoring one union over another,or allowing information while barring similar information.we respectfully disagree with the sixth circuit conclusion and adhere to our view that an employer that denies a union access while regularly allowing nonunion organizations to solicit and distribute on its property unlawfully discriminates against union solicitation.

the discrimination to which the board refers is the discrimination exception to the general rule as explained by the supreme court in nlrb babcock wilcox.
a n employer may validly post his property against nonemployee distribution of union literature if reasonable efforts by the union through other available channels of communication will enable it to reach the employees with its message,and if the employer notice or order does not discriminate against the union by allowing other distribution.
in cleveland real estate partners we rejected the board contention about the meaning of this exception,stating 
the board understanding of babcock discrimination principle is by stores,where the board held that the occasional presence of muslims selling oils and incense,an occasional jehovah witness distribut ing the watchtower magazine,and on one occasion a local lions club solicit ation,demonstrated discriminatory enforcement of a rule when the employer denied access to a union.accord dow jones.we think the board has misinterpreted babcock.
babcock and its progeny,which weigh heavily in favor of private property rights,indicate that the court could not have meant to give the word discrimination the import the board has chosen to give it.to discriminate in the enforcement of a policy can not mean that an employer commits an unfair labor practice if it allows the girl scouts to sell cookies,but is shielded from the effect of the act if it prohibits them from doing so.guardian indus.nlrb,cir.although the court has never clarified the meaning of the term,and we have found no published court of appeals cases addressing the significance of discrimination in this context,we hold that the term discrimination as used in babcock means favoring one union over another,or allowing information while barring similar information.
although we are respectful of the board interpretation,we are not compelled to follow it when it rests on erroneous legal foundations.see lechmere,at.at.

the stores nlrb decision,above referred to and involving this same issue,was reversed by the fourth circuit at cir.the board majority acknowledged in of its opinion in this case that 
t he fourth circuit found that the few solicitations that occurred at the employer over stores in the past year and a half were only isolated and sporadic and did not establish disparate enforcement of the employer policy.in dicta,the court noted its doubt that,the babcock wilcox discrimination treatment exception applies to nonemployees who do not propose to engage in organizational activities and that an employer approval of limited charitable or civic distribution while excluding union distribution constitutes discrimination.
in addition to cleveland real estate partners and stores,the board majority in this case acknowledges that in guardian indus.nlrb,cir 
t he seventh circuit held that an employer had not unlawfully discriminated against union solicitation where the employer allowed only swap and shop notices to be posted on its bulletin board and refused to allow the posting of notice of union meetings as inconsistent with its policy.the court found that the board had failed to establish in what sense it might be discriminatory to distinguish between notes and meeting announcements.
the facts in cleveland real estate partners are very similar to those in the instant controversy.union handbillers campaigned in a private mall against a mall shop owner for employing nonunion workers.the handbillers were instructed to leave because of the mall rule.the mall owner threatened police action if the union handbillers did not desist.the union filed unfair labor practice charges against the mall and the board sustained the charges.we described the underlying nlrb decision in cleveland real estate partners 
the nlrb held that the handbilling in this case was protected activity under section of the act and that by excluding the handbilling by union representatives,but permitting solicitation and handbilling if various kinds by others such as the girl scouts,the knights of columbus,political candidates,and school children selling candy,the mall owner,through its managing agent,unlawfully discriminated against the union within the meaning of the rule announced in babcock.
at.we held in the appeal from the board decision that we review the board factual application and statutory construction under a substantial evidence standard,a deference that is warranted if the board conclusions are based upon a reasonably defensible construction of the act.id.citing emery realty,nlrb,cir.
cleveland real estate partners reversed the board after analyzing babcock and lechmere,nlrb,d,which also involved a controversy with respect to an organizational campaign by a union against a retail store in a shopping plaza owned by lechmere.union organizers began a handbilling campaign and lechmere,in accordance with its policy,prohibited this union activity.the board held lechmere guilty of unfair labor practice violations under a and a divided panel of the first circuit affirmed the board decision 
cleveland real estate partners interpreted lechmere in light of the supreme court earlier decision in babcock.
after reviewing its holding in babcock,the supreme court stated 
babcock teaching is straightforward simply does not protect nonemployee union organizers except in the rare case where the inaccessibility of employees makes ineffective the reasonable attempts by nonemployees to communicate with them through the usual channels.where reasonable alternative means of access exist,guarantees do not authorize trespasses by nonemployee organizers,even under reasonable regulations established by the board.
lechmere,at.at quoting babcock,at.at.
at.the supreme court in lechmere reversed the first circuit and declined to follow the board precedent in jean country,stating the general rule in this type of shopping center handbilling 
while babcock indicates that an employer may not always bar nonemployee union organizers from his property,his right to do so remains the general rule.to gain access,the union has the burden of showing that no other reasonable means of communicating its organizational message to the employees exists or that the employer access rules discriminate against union solicitation.that the burden imposed on the union is a heavy one is evidenced by the fact that the balance struck by the board and the courts under the babcock accommodation principle has rarely been in favor of trespassory organizational activity.
lechmere,at.quoting sears,roebuck san diego county dist.council of carpenters,d emphasis in original footnotes omitted.
lechmere concluded that we judge an agency later interpretation of the statute against our prior determination of the statute meaning.at.the lechmere court also noted a distinction of substance between the union activities of employees and nonemployees.id.citing babcock wilcox,at.in the latter situation,the board was not permitted to engage in the same balancing between an owner right to exclude from a shopping center and an employee right to engage in union activity.id.in sum,lechmere babcock rule that an employer may validly post his property against nonemployee distribution of union literature.id.at.quoting babcock wilcox,at.
cleveland real estate partners,relying on lechmere,cited the principles above set out.it also relied upon united food commercial workers,local nlrb.it was not discrimination with the meaning of babcock wilcox for cleveland real estate partners to enforce its general rule against the union nonemployees and at the same time occasionally to allow limited charitable activities in the mall deemed beneficial to the owner and the tenants.
an owner of private commercial property who permits a charitable organization to distribute information or conduct solicitations on its property simply does not implicate the policies of the nlra and does not,without more,render an employee guilty of an unfair labor practice when later it chooses to follow the general rule of validly post ing its property against nonemployee distribution of union literature.babcock,at.at.
ii.the board decision 
confronted with the firm policy of this court in cleveland real estate partners,supported by other circuit courts as well,the board concluded in the instant case that the solicitation by various organizations is sufficient proof of disparate treatment or discrimination within the meaning of the narrow babcock wilcox exception.sandusky mall.the board argued that its earlier seemingly inconsistent ruling in farm fresh,nlrb,relied upon by the dissenters,was distinguishable.the board conceded in that lloyd tanner,d,settled the question that a union had no first amendment right to use a privately owned shopping center premises for handbilling and other union purposes in the face of a general ban.
the board decision cites riesbeck food markets nlrb,nlrb,as supportive of its view that an employer reviewing and evaluating requests to solicit on its property by choosing between those deemed beneficial and those detrimental to the employer business was discriminatory conduct.riesbeck,however,the board conceded,was reversed by the fourth circuit at cir.a board dissenter accordingly found riesbeck to be consistent with his position.
on the question of the deference due the board decision and interpretation of the statute,the board cited nlrb webcor packaging,cir.we note that webcor does not involve the basic underlying issues in this case and in lechmere rather,it dealt with the statutory definition of a labor organization.webcor includes a separate opinion,and the majority simply held that the board definition is not unreasonable,and thus its decision on that question was enforceable.at.webcor also observed in a footnote that the supreme court has recently repeated its holding that we must accept the board reasonable construction of ambiguous terms in the nlra under chevron.id.at with reference therein also to the very recent case of holly farms nlrb,d.we see nothing in webcor that limits the essential holding in cleveland real estate partners in any way.the webcor footnote addressed the level of deference a reviewing court must afford the board in construing ambiguous terms of the nlra.webcor supports the proposition that we owe no deference to the board holding if it is not legally sound.see webcor,at distinguishing between interpretation of the nlra and interpretation of decisional precedent,saying t his is also not an instance in which the board has departed from the supreme
