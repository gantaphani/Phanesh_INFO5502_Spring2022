harris county,texas appeals the district court judgment against the county,arguing that the district court erred in holding that the county had unconstitutionally interfered with the property rights of simi investment company.the district court found that the county had unlawfully prevented simi from gaining access to the city street adjacent to its property in contravention of texas law.specifically,the district court held that the county had abused its governmental power and violated simi substantive due process rights by inventing and claiming ownership of a nonexistent by county park,which blocked simi lawful access to the street.for the following reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court,including the grant of attorneys fees however,we vacate and remand to determine the amount of those attorneys fees in a manner consistent with this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
this dispute centers around the real property the simi property owned by simi investment company,simi which is located in downtown houston in close proximity to the houston astrodome stadium more specifically,the simi property is situated adjacent to fannin street at the intersection of interstate loop loop and fannin street.simi sought from the city of houston city access to fannin street from the simi property,but was denied access by the city because harris county the county claimed an interest in an intervening sliver of land that runs alongside this property,separating it from fannin street.
this land dispute finds its origin in the early when the construction of the astrodome led to increased development in the area surrounding what is now the simi property.two of the major investors in the area were roy hofheinz and smith.hofheinz was a former harris county judge and had been the chair of the county governing board,the county commissioners court.hofheinz was also president of the houston sports association the hsa,which leased the astrodome from the county.owned property north of the simi property site,which was also located along the eastern side of fannin street.as a result,and the hsa had control of much of the property surrounding the astrodome.
in conjunction with building the astrodome,the county acquired for streets leading to the stadium.in,the county commissioners court requested the consent of the city to acquire one of those by extending the length of fannin street to loop.the city council approved the location and alignment of the proposed street,and the land was purchased from the trustees of the hermann hospital estate and conveyed to the county for this purpose.the hermann hospital estate consisted of a acre tract of land that was approximately feet wide and feet in length,running alongside the astrodome site.this was bounded on the west by the astrodome and surrounding grounds,and on the east by several privately owned properties including the property and what is now the simi property.
the deed granting the land to the county provided that the property was being purchased with the intention of extending fannin street with such extension to run in a direction along the eastern side of the property described above,with the remaining western portion of said property to be used for street purposes or included in a park and stadium site lying along the west side of said property.pursuant to this deed,the county commissioners court issued an order on december,stating that harris county is to move back the existing fences to the new right of way line.subsequently,fannin street was constructed as described in the deed on the eastern side of the conveyed property,and fences were erected directly abutting the simi property.
the original maps accompanying the county acquisition of the and describing the location and alignment of fannin street could not be found,and,thus are not a part of the record.the first document in the record is dated october,and was created when engineers for the county prepared a plat of the area depicting the land to be conveyed to the county for the.the plat showed the granted land directly abutting the simi property line.this plat,however,was not a survey and did not include the exact location of fannin street within the.
at some time after,this plat was altered to include the placement of fannin street and also,most relevant for this case,a strip of land set off from the eastern side of fannin street lying in between the street and the adjoining private properties.this by strip of is the county park now at issue.
as drawn in the revised plat,the fannin street runs,directly abutting the property.however,once past the southern boundary of the property line,the is shown to make a turn west for five feet,and then it continues south to the loop.the result is the creation of a strip of land that separates all of the property south of the property from fannin street,but leaves the property directly abutting the fannin street.no description or reason is apparent for this offset,nor why the offset begins just south of the property this plat also includes the words location questionable drawn to indicate the uncertain location of fannin street.there is no revised date on the altered plat.the county contends that this plat depicts the correct location of all relevant boundaries,with fannin street running within the original and a thin county park on the east side also running parallel to fannin street.
from this uncertain beginning,the county park has withstood several legal and administrative challenges to its existence and control.first,in,texaco,requested access to fannin street from property it owned on the corner of fannin and the loop.this request was submitted to the county commissioner and was then forwarded to the county engineer.for an unknown reason,the county engineer sought approval from hofheinz,as president of the hsa.hofheinz stated that the hsa was unalterably opposed to the access because the strip of land east of fannin was included in the original hsa lease of land for the astrodome site and,therefore,was under hsa control.this assertion was factually erroneous because hsa was never granted control of the land.however,hofheinz objection led the county to deny texaco access to fannin street.
similarly,in,property owners sought a mandatory injunction against the county,requesting that the fence abutting their properties be removed to grant access to fannin street.a judgment was affirmed by a texas court of appeals,which denied the property owners access across the county land.see lovett county of harris,dist,writ ref.the court found that the erection of the fence was not an unconstitutional taking under texas law because the intervening strip of land separating the property owners from fannin street had not been dedicated for street purposes.see id 
most recently,in,sterling mccall,the owner of mccall toyota,requested that he be allowed to keep a driveway that had been built on his property which provided the property with ingress and egress onto fannin street.this request was denied by the county commissioners court,and mccall was required to fence in the driveway to block access to fannin street.
the area designated as a park has also been subject to encumbrances that over its history have helped define its status and ownership.in,entex,a gas company,constructed a gas line running along the east side of fannin street.this gas line was buried inside the land now claimed as a park.the district court found that n o commissioner court order or other document can be found to show the county authorized an easement in the park to entex.in,the city of houston approved a plan and constructed an water line that crossed the park.again,the district court found no commissioners court order authorizing the easement across the park for the water line.finally,in,the metropolitan transit authority of harris county metro approved construction of a sidewalk on the park property,running alongside the simi property.no approval was sought from the county for an easement.
control of fannin street,itself,was ceded from the county to the city of houston in.in that year,the county removed fannin street from its road logs.
from to,simi began acquiring property along fannin street in,simi submitted to the city a request for driveway access from its property to fannin street.richard scott,the technical engineer of the department of public works and engineering for the city,responded that the city would be in a position to process the application,and likely approve it,but for the fact that the county has claimed an interest in the strip of land.simi then applied to the county for access.this request was denied based on the assertion that the county owned parkland located between fannin street and the simi property.
simi sued the county in state court.simi sought damages and injunctive relief pursuant to article,section of the texas constitution and the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution.in addition,simi sought a declaration that its land directly abutted the of fannin street.the county removed the suit to federal court.simi filed a motion to remand,stating that its federal takings claim was not ripe.the district court did not rule on this motion for remand.in federal court,simi added a substantive due process claim,alleging that the county denial of access to an adjoining arbitrarily and capriciously denied simi a property interest established under texas law.
the district court held two conferences during which the parties were required to submit all relevant documents and exhibits and to stipulate to the agreed facts.both parties then moved for partial summary judgment based on this established record 
on august,the district court issued an interlocutory judgment and an opinion on judgment solely on the issue of the existence of the park.the district court reserved deciding the issue of damages or attorneys fees.the court found in its interlocutory judgment that harris county had never established a park harris county had no interest in an intervening by strip east of fannin street and west of the simi property making illegal its interference with the owners relation to the city of houston and fannin street harris county had ceded to the c ity of houston all of its right,title,and interest in the feet of land conveyed to it by the hermann estate and t he city of houston fannin street right of way abuts directly and fully the west boundary of the simi property.
after the interlocutory judgment,two hearings were held on damages and attorneys fees.in addition,simi introduced supplemental evidence into the record involving the county reasons for denying property owners access to fannin street.the district court issued a final judgment on april,incorporating the interlocutory judgment and adding that the county was liable for in damages,in attorneys fees,and in expenses.on may,the district court issued supplemental findings that the county arbitrarily interfered with simi property rights the interference had no relation to a legitimate governmental interest the interference was an abuse of governmental power the county persisted in defending its claim to the park in bad faith and used the litigation to vex and oppress simi and the county deliberately violated simi rights under the united states constitution 
the county timely appeals.
ii.standard of review 
we review a grant of summary de novo,applying the same criteria used by the district court in the first instance.see norman apache,cir conkling turner,cir.summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c see also celotex catrett,d.
iii.subject matter jurisdiction 
we exercise plenary review of a district court subject matter jurisdiction.see rutherford harris county,cir counties dole,cir.
as a threshold matter,the county argues that the district court lacked federal subject matter jurisdiction to decide the case.we find that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction by reason of simi substantive due process claim.
in its opinion on judgment,the district court provided three grounds for its jurisdiction.first,the court found that t he facts pleaded state claims under the texas constitution to which no accommodative delay is due whatever the eventual fate of simi claim for compensation,simi is entitled to use this court authority to correct the county continuing interference with its land.see simi,d,citations omitted.second,the district court found that simi had stated claims against the county under the fourteenth amendment,the civil rights act of,and.see id.as these claims are ripe without exhaustion of state remedies,the court found proper jurisdiction.finally,the district court held that simi is entitled to seek declaratory relief under both texas and federal law.see id.
the county correctly argues that the state law claims,standing alone,do not provide federal jurisdiction.further,we agree that declaratory judgment act claims,without another basis for jurisdiction,can not support the district court jurisdiction.see lawson callahan,cir i t is well settled that the declaratory judgment act does not confer subject matter jurisdiction on a federal court where none otherwise exists.the county thus contends that the only potential federal claim available to simi is a takings claim under the fifth and fourteenth amendments,and that simi has conceded that such a claim is not ripe for review while we agree that the takings claim is not ripe for review,this argument does not dispose of simi suit because the substantive due process claim was properly before the district court.
in order to unpack the jurisdictional basis for the district court holding,we revisit our recent decision in john city of houston,cir,in which we held that substantive due process claims alleging deprivations of property are not necessarily subsumed under the takings clause.as this is precisely the issue raised by the county,we find john to be dispositive as to the question of jurisdiction.
john recognized that i ndividuals may look to several constitutional provisions for protection against state action that results in a deprivation of their property.id.at.one of those provisions is the substantive due process component of the fourteenth amendment which guarantees that individuals shall not be deprived of their property without due process of law.see const.amend.xiv,see also john,at substantive due process,by barring certain government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them,serves to prevent governmental power from being used for purposes of oppression.alterations in original citations and internal quotation marks omitted.another provision is the takings clause of the fifth amendment.see const.amend.v see also john,at samaad city of dallas,cir the takings clause of the fifth amendment directs that private property shall not be taken for public use,without just compensation.the supreme court has held that the clause applies to the states through the fourteenth amendment.citations omitted.in the instant case,once simi had its case removed to federal court,it explicitly pled a due process claim,recognizing that it did not have a takings claim 
nevertheless,the county argues that we must decide this case under the takings clause because w here a particular amendment provides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection against a particular sort of government behavior,that amendment,not the more generalized notion of substantive due process,must be the guide for analyzing these claims.albright oliver,d quoting graham connor,d.again,john controls our analysis.we take no issue with the principle inherent in the supreme court analysis however,in the instant case,we find a takings analysis does not exhaust simi constitutional claims.john found that under,a more explicit provision does not necessarily preempt due process protections,and that substantive due process claims can survive a related takings argument 
this does not mean,however,that the applicability of the more explicit provision due process protections.see county of sacramento lewis,d united states james daniel good real property,d we have rejected the view that the applicability of one constitutional amendment the guarantees of another.moreover,it is clear that a particular action may implicate more than one constitutional protection.see soldal cook county,d certain wrongs affect more than a single right and,accordingly,can implicate more than one of the constitution commands.where such multiple violations are alleged,we are not in the habit of identifying as a preliminary matter the claim dominant character.rather,we examine each constitutional provision in turn.thus,simply because an explicit provision applies does not mean that that provision makes inapplicable all substantive due process protections.see albright,at.souter,concurring suggesting that due process is reserved for otherwise homeless substantial claims.
john,at our limited holding in john is similarly limited here we find only that when a state interferes with property interests,a substantive due process claim may survive a takings analysis and,therefore,provide jurisdiction for a federal court.
as alleged,there exists illegitimate governmental conduct that has deprived simi of its property rights for the benefit of private interests.because simi submitted sufficient evidence to support its substantive due process claim based on an allegedly arbitrary and unlawful attempt to interfere with private property rights,we reject the county argument that the district court did not have federal subject matter jurisdiction.
iv.substantive due process 
the determination that the district court had jurisdiction to decide the federal question of substantive due process,however,does not resolve the merits of simi claim.our review of the county actions must be measured against the deferential rational basis test that governs substantive due process.see fm prop.operating city of austin,cir g overnment action comports with substantive due process if the action is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.whether this rational relation in fact exists is a question of law that we review de novo.hidden oaks city of austin,cir.
a violation of substantive due process,for example,occurs only when the government deprives someone of liberty or property or,to use the current jargon,only when the government works a deprivation of a constitutionally protected interest.brennan stewart,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also deblasio zoning bd.of adjustment,cir i n the context of land use regulation,that is,in situations where the governmental decision in question impinges upon a landowner use and enjoyment of property,a plaintiff states a substantive due process claim where he or she alleges that the decision limiting the intended land use was arbitrary or capricious.
substantive due process analysis is appropriate only in cases in which government arbitrarily abuses its power to deprive individuals of constitutionally protected rights.therefore,recognizing that reliance on substantive due process must be taken with the utmost care,collins city of harker heights,d,we emphasize the particularly odd factual situation in this case,and the length and degree of governmental abuse and,thus,limit our holding to the type of blatant governmental interference with property rights that is now before us.
a.the constitutional right at issue 
to prevail on a substantive due process claim,simi must first establish that it held a constitutionally protected property right to which the fourteenth amendment due process protection applies.see spuler pickar,cir citing baker mccollan,d see also hidden oaks,at in order to assert a violation of this amendment,one must at least demonstrate the deprivation of a protected property interest established through some independent source such as state law.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the nature of the property interest therefore must be determined by texas law.see spuler,at see also hidden oaks,at under this analysis,the hallmark of property is an individual entitlement grounded in state law,which can not be removed except for cause.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
under texas law,this first issue is resolved in simi favor.it is the settled rule in this state that an abutting property owner possesses an easement of access which is a property right that this easement is not limited to a right of access to the system of public roads and that diminishment in the value of property resulting from a loss of access constitutes damage.state heal,internal quotation marks omitted quoting dupuy city of waco,see also city of beaumont marks,it is well settled that abutting property owners have certain property rights in existing streets and highways in addition to their right in common with the general public to use them.generally,the most important of these private rights is the access to and from the highway or street.state meyer,lethu city of houston,dist,no pet.state northborough,dist,pet.denied.as the district court found,simi western boundary is the same as the eastern boundary they abut by definition.therefore,if simi is correct in its assertion that no park exists or has ever existed,its property unquestionably abuts the fannin street,and the county interference with this access is a violation of texas law 
b.the substantive due process violation 
satisfied that the county blockage of access implicates a constitutionally protected property right,we must ask next whether this denial is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.see fm,at.the question is only whether a rational relationship exists between the policy and a conceivable legitimate objective.if the question is at least debatable,there is no substantive due process violation.id.alteration in original citations omitted.even under this low threshold,we are unpersuaded that a rational basis exists to justify the county interference with simi property rights.
in brief,it is apparent from the record that the county can not demonstrate that a park ever existed in between fannin street and the simi property.further,we can ascertain no rational reason for the county to deny abutting owners access to the street when the city of houston now has complete jurisdiction over fannin street.most troubling,however,the record reflects what the district court found to be an illegitimate plan to benefit the private interests of whose properties were financially benefitted by the denial of access to the other properties abutting fannin street.as will be discussed in detail below,the evidence demonstrates that the county acted arbitrarily in inventing a park and,thus,acted without a rational basis in depriving simi of a constitutionally protected interest.
the dispositive question in this case is whether or not there ever was a park.the district court found that the county had never established a park.we agree.
first,the county has failed to provide any official documentation of the existence of a park.none of the five surveys included in the record shows any sign of a county park.the survey prepared by peyton associates for the city of houston shows an water main crossing fannin street without reference to an intervening county park.the survey prepared for the holly hall home for the retired,located north of the simi property does not show a park.the survey prepared by the south texas surveying associates shows simi property directly abutting fannin street.the survey prepared by pgal engineering for metro in order to install a sidewalk on the strip makes no mention of a county park.finally,in,karen rose engineering surveying completed a survey that shows the east line of the fannin street and the simi property line to be the same.all of the above surveys were signed and sealed by registered professional surveyors.
these surveys also support simi claim that the fannin street has always abutted the eastern properties,including the simi property.the district court found that the hermann hospital estate deed determined the proper boundaries of the.the deed provided that the fannin would run along the east side of the astrodome property with the remaining western portion of said property to be used for street purposes or included in a park and stadium site lying along the west side of said property.under this deed,no parkland was reserved on the east of fannin street,and the apparently was intended to extend to simi property line.no county commissioners order changed this initial understanding of the in fact,this understanding was confirmed when the county moved back the fences to the existing property line abutting what is now simi property.
in contrast,the sole descriptive evidence presented by the county was the altered version of the unsigned and unofficial plat.the altered version of the plat is of limited persuasive authority because it provides no information about the purpose or date of the alteration,and includes the language location questionable to denote the uncertain placement of fannin street.without some justification for why a setoff was created just south of the land,conveniently blocking all of the other property owners,we are compelled to find that this plat can not carry the burden of establishing the county park.
the county also relies on lovett county of harris,a texas court of civil appeals case that decided an earlier dispute about this strip of land.see dist,writ ref.as a procedural matter,we find that the county has waived this issue for purposes of res judicata as it inexplicably failed to raise this argument until six months after the district court interlocutory judgment and three years after the initial complaint however,as the case provides a discussion about the disputed land,we address its reasoning.
lovett involved a suit by landowners whose property overlapped some of the current simi property.these landowners sought a mandatory injunction against the county to remove a fence,which ran along the property line and separated the fannin street and their properties.see id.at.the court denied the request for an injunction finding that fannin street did not abut the landowners property a foot strip of land intervened between fannin street and the landowners property neither the deed nor the city of houston had dedicated the feet of land as being used for street purposes and there was no taking of land under article i,section of the texas constitution.see id.at.
this holding,while seemingly supportive of the county claim,fails to carry the argument.first,we note that the lovett court affirmed the lower court decision which,as the lovett court noted,did not include any findings of fact or conclusions of law second and more important for our purposes,no showing was made that any county park existed,or even that the county argued that a park existed on the land.all that lovett proves is that,as of,the county held ownership to the eastern part of fannin street,a conclusion with which all parties agree.third,the lovett decision supports the contention that the fannin street if not the street extended to the boundary of the simi property.as this is where the disputed fence was placed,it is apparent the county land abuts the simi property.finally,the state law takings holding is irrelevant to our analysis involving the existence of a substantive due process violation.
even accepting the factual findings of the lovett court,the issue left open is what happened to the foot strip once the county yielded jurisdiction over fannin street to the city of houston in.it is undisputed that fannin street was ceded to the city,but there is no record that in doing so,the county retained an interest in a remaining strip of land.once the city of houston took responsibility for the street and the accompanying traffic and maintenance responsibilities,we are hard pressed to find a reason for the county retention of five feet out of the original feet of land.
furthermore,the county claim that a park has always existed is belied by the fact that the park has not been treated as such by the county.city gas lines,water lines,and a sidewalk were all constructed on the park without receiving proper authorization or an easement from the county.as the district court found in its chronology 
the county and simi investment agree that the county can not sell or otherwise encumber its park land unless the encumbrance is approved by commissioners court order with public notice under a state statute.the county and simi investment agree that no commissioners court order can be found authorizing entex,houston,or metro to construct facilities on the property and further,that there is no evidence that the county complied with the statutory notice requirements to convey an interest in this property to entex,the city,or metro.
simi,d at.further,owners of other properties along fannin street have developed their land in a manner that demonstrates that no park exists.for example,the owners of the holly hall tract north of the simi property along fannin street developed their property with a foot setback from the street,pursuant to local ordinance.this foot setback would not have been necessary if a park intervened between the street and the property.
from the foregoing,we agree with the district court that harris county has no interest in an intervening by strip east of fannin street and west of knight main street addition the simi property and holly hall property,making illegal its interference with the owners relation to the city of houston and fannin street and harris county has ceded to the city of houston all of its right,title,and interest in the feet of land conveyed to it by the hermann estate.simi,d at.
measured against the rational basis test,a nonexistent park used by county officials to interfere with private property interests is clearly arbitrary,capricious,and violative of due process.while the rational basis standard is the least demanding test used by the courts to uphold governmental action,it is not toothless.berger city of mayfield heights,cir quoting mathews lucas,d.more damaging to the county argument,the only basis in the record to explain the county interference with access appears to be the district court impediment would benefit the privately held properties and the hsa.
the record clearly suggests that creation of a park worked to enhance the value of the properties as the district court found,interestingly,that ridiculously narrow park limits the access of only those property owners who would compete with the interests.simi,d at.proof of this influence began in when the county denied texaco the right of access to fannin street on the basis of hofheinz objection.furthermore,we note that the original request to gain access to the street was denied not because of the county own claim to the land or an assertion of a park,but because of hofheinz erroneous assertion that hsa owned the strip of land.
that the county acted to benefit solely private interests does not necessarily demonstrate a substantive due process violation.for substantive due process purposes,the true purpose of the policy,the actual purpose that may have motivated its proponents,assuming this can be known is irrelevant for rational basis analysis.fm,at.however,the county failed to put forth any alternative rational basis for the continued interference with private property rights certainly in,twenty years after the county had ceded control over fannin street to the city of houston,there was no rational basis for blocking access to the street.once jurisdiction shifted to the city,whatever interests in maintaining traffic control or other governmental responsibilities that could be hypothesized to justify interference with access to fannin street disappear.without a park and without a rational basis for impeding access,the county arguments fail to survive even a rational basis review.
we,therefore,affirm the district court findings that the county acted arbitrarily and without a legitimate governmental purpose.we hold that the invention of a park solely to deny private property holders lawful access to an abutting street is an abuse of governmental power,which on this peculiar factual foundation rises to the level of a substantive due process violation.having successfully pled a deprivation of a constitutional right under,simi is entitled to the relief granted by the district court.
attorneys fees 
it is undisputed that attorneys fees are provided under for litigants who successfully bring claims.see t he court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs.we review a district court award of attorneys fees for abuse of discretion,and its factual findings relating to the award of attorneys fees for clear error.freiler tangipahoa parish bd.of,cir.having found that simi has proven a successful claim predicated on substantive due process,we agree that simi is entitled to receive attorneys fees 
however,we find that the district court abused its discretion in awarding attorneys fees based on legal work not provided in furtherance of simi claim.while the record does not permit us to determine precisely what factors were controlling in the court determination of the fee,our reading of the record leads us to be concerned that simi state court legal fees which preceded its amended were included in the calculation.
this court has held that attorneys fees resulting from state court litigation that does not seek to enforce federal constitutional rights,but which does precede a successful suit,are not attorneys fees contemplated by.see brantley surles,cir.this conclusion necessarily follows from the purpose of,which is to enforce or other federal civil rights statutes.of course,where a state proceeding is a necessary preliminary action to the enforcement of a federal claim,these attorneys fees may be available in some circumstances,subject to the discretion of the district court.see redd lambert,cir see also barrow falck,cir section permits a court to shift to defendant only those legal fees incurred in proceedings to enforce a few listed federal statutes.when proceedings in state courts or agencies are part of the enforcement of,then time reasonably devoted to them is compensable.citing new york gaslight club,carey,d.
simi brought its initial suit in state court and did not allege a violation.without a demonstration that this state suit was part of the enforcement of the claim,legal fees relating to that litigation can not be recovered under.following brantley,we find that the state suit was not a part of the enforcement of,and therefore,attorneys fees relating to the state action are not recoverable.see brantley,at.
we are also concerned that the district court may have based its award on a record that includes billing reports of simi counsel dating back to,well before the state and federal lawsuits were initiated.these records,and the district judge assertion at the hearing on attorneys fees that counsel had worked on the case for six years,compels us to find that the district court may have awarded an incorrect amount of attorneys fees.further,the district court apparently calculated the attorneys fees with interest based on a time frame that may have included the state court proceedings.because we find that the district court abused its discretion in considering attorneys fees not related to the action,we vacate the original award and remand it for reconsideration.
having prevailed on appeal,simi is entitled to legal fees for the appeal.on remand,we also ask the district court to decide on a reasonable fee 
vi.conclusion 
for the above stated reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court in all respects,except for the award of attorneys fees,which we vacate and remand for further consideration consistent with this opinion.
we are guided through the curious history and development of this particular strip of land by the stipulated record of exhibits which was submitted by the parties and was adopted by the district court as the entire record.on august,the district court entered a conference memorandum which stated that the case would be resolved by analyzing the documentary evidence submitted.on september,the district court entered a second conference memorandum recording that the parties had stipulated to exhibits through and that the exhibits and other documents submitted would constitute the whole record.on august,the district court allowed simi to supplement the record with documents not previously turned over by the county.in addition,we rely on the chronology included as an addendum to the district court opinion.see simi investment.harris county,d,addendum to opinion.
the district court found that a fter exhaustive search by the county and simi,no later order of the commissioners court was found that modified in any way the alignment of the fannin street right of way described in the hermann deed and the commissioners order of december.presumably,the original location of the fence denotes the proper line.
from our review of the record,the measure is an apparent approximation that was adopted by the district court and has been accepted by both parties.
the result of the offset is that the properties are granted full access to fannin street,but all properties south of the land are denied access.
the reasoning of the lovett decision will be discussed in detail infra.
simi owns lots,and in block lots,and in block lots,and in block in knight main street addition.
reads in relevant part every person who,under color of any statute,ordinance,regulation,custom,or usage,of any state or territory or the district of columbia,subjects,or causes to be subjected,any citizen of the united states or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws,shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law,suit in equity,or other proper proceeding for redress.
the county raises a preliminary challenge to the entry of summary judgment based on this stipulated record.we find no merit in this challenge as it is well established that a district court may enter summary judgment after providing notice and instructing the parties to submit all relevant evidence.see celotex catrett,d d istrict courts are widely acknowledged to possess the power to enter summary judgments sua sponte,so long as the losing party was on notice that she had to come forward with all of her evidence.in conference,the district court asked the parties to submit all relevant documents and exhibits.it was from this evidentiary basis that the district court decided to grant the request for partial summary judgment.we find no error in these actions.
the county challenges these supplemental findings as not supported by the evidence.we disagree.from the extensive exhibits and documentary evidence submitted by both parties,the district court could well establish a basis for liability.in short,without proof that a county park ever existed,the county justification for interfering with simi access to fannin street fails,and becomes an arbitrary and capricious act.we,therefore,find no error in a damages award based on that liability,and find no error in the supplemental findings based on the district court review of the evidence.
the county appeals the final judgment issued on april.while not designated as such,we interpret this final judgment as a final decision on summary judgment resolving all issues in favor of simi.simi had initially moved for partial summary judgment requesting a declaration that the county was interfering with its property.the county for summary judgment on this issue.the district court interlocutory judgment resolved the partial summary judgment motion in simi favor.in its final judgment,the district court incorporated the interlocutory judgment into its order and resolved all outstanding issues.
as stated,simi opposed removal to federal court on the grounds that a ripe federal takings question was not presented for adjudication.see williamson county regional planning comm hamilton bank,d.
simi precise claim is that the county arbitrarily interfered with its property rights,not that the county sought to acquire or regulate the use of the property.simi argues that in the history of this strip of land,the county never tried to take the simi property in a constitutionally significant sense,but rather abused its power to frustrate simi rightful u
