devils lake is a large,freshwater lake in northeastern north dakota.the lake has no natural outlets,so its water level and size fluctuate considerably in response to changing climatic conditions.in the recent past,increased rainfall has slowly raised the water level and expanded the shores of the lake.the incremental expansion has swallowed whole towns,farms,and roads producing breathtaking results.the significant hydrological phenomenon at devils lake forms the backdrop for an equally momentous legal dispute concerning ownership of the lake itself.
the spirit lake tribe resides on land that abuts the lake.the tribe contends that an treaty gave it title to the lakebed,to be held in trust by the federal government.the tribe filed the present lawsuit in seeking to declare its rights to the lake,to enjoin multiple defendants from using the lake,and to recover damages for various wrongful uses of the lake.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of all defendants,and the tribe instituted the present appeal.we affirm the judgment of the district court with one exception.we vacate the portion of the summary judgment pertaining to the federal government,and remand the action to the district court to dismiss the government for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
we recounted the factual underpinnings of this action in an earlier appeal.devils lake sioux tribe state of,cir devils lake ii.a brief overview of the facts at this juncture will serve to frame our discussion.
in an treaty,ancestors of the tribe received vast lands in the dakotas and minnesota as a reward for their loyalty to the government during the sioux uprising of.article iv of that treaty established the fort totten reservation for the use of the tribe.
article iv described the northern boundary of the reservation as follows beginning at the most easterly point of devil lake thence along the waters of said lake to the most westerly point of the same the phrase thence along the waters has been interpreted by various parties at various points in time to refer to the northern shore of the lake,the southern shore of the lake,and even a variety of lines drawn across the middle of devils lake.the proper interpretation is critical.for example,if the boundary is the northern shore,then the reservation includes devils lake.conversely,if the southern shore forms the boundary,then the lake lies outside the reservation.see devils lake ii,at.
on june,the tribe filed this action to quiet title to devils lake.the tribe named the federal government,the state of north dakota,the garrison division conservancy district an arm of the state,and numerous private landowners as defendants.the tribe contends that the treaty established the northern shore of devils lake as the northern boundary of its reservation,and that the government has held title to devils lake in trust for the tribe for more than a century.at worst,the tribe argues,the treaty is ambiguous.the tribe points out that courts traditionally resolve ambiguities in treaties in favor of indian tribes.under either approach,the tribe asserts entitlement to devils lake.
the federal government disputes the tribe claim to the lake.the government claims that devils lake was not included in the treaty that formed the reservation.the government asserts that it continued to hold title to devils lake until,when it conveyed the lake to the state of north dakota at its statehood under the equal footing doctrine.see shively bowlby.explaining that the government cedes navigable waterways to states when they join the union.according to the government,the state held complete title to devils lake until.in,the state quitclaimed title to a portion of the lake to the government to permit construction of a massive public works project called the garrison diversion unit.
in,the district court granted the federal government motion for summary judgment.devils lake sioux tribe state of n.devils lake i.the district court held that the tribe had already resolved its claim to devils lake as part of a indian claims commission icc settlement.id.at.the tribe appealed,and we reversed the district court decision.devils lake ii,at.we discerned factual disputes regarding the precise issues resolved in the icc proceeding,and held that t he record does not support a summary judgment on a theory that the settlement disposes of the tribe alleged rights t his issue requires further development on the merits.id.at.
the parties returned to the district court.they spent several years attempting to settle the case,but settlement talks failed to bear fruit.in,the parties revived their case before the district court.after revival,court and counsel agreed to bifurcate proceedings.in the first phase,the federal government and the state would raise preliminary procedural and jurisdictional defenses.if the tribe prevailed,the parties would then try the case on the merits and resolve the question of ownership.
the district court entertained the defendants motions for summary judgment on the preliminary questions and heard extended argument.on january,the court issued a opinion granting summary judgment.the court held that the tribe suit against the federal government was.in addition,the court held that issue preclusion prevented the tribe from litigating the ownership of devils lake because the tribe could have raised that issue but did not in a icc suit.after dismissing the federal government,the court determined that the government was an indispensable party to the proceedings,and that the tribe suit against the state and the other defendants could not continue absent the government.see.b.accordingly,the court entered a final judgment adverse to the tribe.
the quiet title act of qta,stat,authorizes lawsuits against the federal government to adjudicate a disputed title to real property in which the united states claims an interest.a.congress intended the qta to provide the exclusive means by which adverse claimants could challenge the united states title to real property.block north dakota ex rel.bd.of sch.lands,d block i.the supreme court has held that the qta provides the only basis for an indian plaintiff quiet title action against the federal government.united states mottaz,d.
the tribe suit against the federal government relies upon the qta.we conclude,however,that qta relief is not available because the tribe failed to comply with the pertinent statute of limitations.
the qta contains a generous statute of limitations,which provides that an action shall be deemed to have accrued on the date the plaintiff or his predecessor in interest knew or should have known of the claim of the united states.g.because the qta waives the government sovereign immunity from suit,block i,at,a plaintiff must comply with the limitations period to effectuate that waiver.hence the qta statute of limitations acts as a jurisdictional bar unlike most statutes of limitations,which are affirmative defenses.see state of ex rel.bd.of sch.lands block,cir block ii.
the limitations period begins when a plaintiff knows or should know of the government adverse land claim.g.this standard does not require the government to provide explicit notice of its claim.the government claim need not be clear and unambiguous.block ii,at.knowledge of the claim full contours is not required.all that is necessary is a reasonable awareness that the government claims some interest adverse to the plaintiff.id.quoting knapp united states,cir.
further,the government interest need not amount to full legal title as long as the interest claimed is a cloud on title,or a reasonable claim with a substantial basis,it constitutes a claim for purposes of triggering the statute of limitations.richmond,fredericksburg potomac united states,cir.even invalid government claims trigger the qta limitations period.see id.simply put,the limitations period is triggered when a landowner has reason to know that the government claims some type of adverse interest in that land.see patterson buffalo river,cir.
the government argues that the tribe knew or should have known of its claim to devils lake by at least july,on that date,the federal government acquired more than acres of the lake from the state.the state deeded this sizeable chunk of devils lake to the government via quitclaim deed to assist the government in building the garrison diversion project.the project was managed by the federal bureau of reclamation,and was designed to divert water from the missouri river to irrigate arid lands,and stock municipal water supplies,in central and eastern north dakota.
the government land acquisition was widely reported by local media outlets,such as the devils lake journal and the benton county farmers press,and by larger organizations as well.the tribe apparently knew of the government land acquisition because a tribal resolution expressed concern about land ownership in view of the coming garrison diversion project.state app.the project itself was the single most important,visible public works project in north dakota in the last half of the century.the tribe could hardly have turned a blind eye to its major details.see generally in re garrison diversion conservancy,describing newspaper coverage of public hearings held in major cities in eastern north dakota to discuss the contract and deed between the state and the government.thus we have little doubt that the tribe was aware of the garrison diversion project generally,and the government acquisition of a portion of the lake specifically.
even if the tribe did not actually know that the government acquired title to a portion of the lake in,the tribe certainly should have known.as a matter of law,a quitclaim deed disgorging title to the united states places a landowner on notice and triggers the qta statute of limitations.state of cal.ex rel.state land comm yuba goldfields,cir.the quitclaim deed,coupled with evidence that the tribe likely knew about the extent of the garrison diversion project,convinces us that,in,the tribe knew or should have known,g,that the government claimed devils lake.
because the tribe learned of the federal government claim to devils lake in,the tribe was required to file a qta suit by to preserve the government waiver of sovereign immunity.the tribe actually filed its complaint in this action in june,so the action is ostensibly barred by the statute of limitations.
in an effort to forestall the operation of the statute of limitations,the tribe raises three.we discuss each in turn.
assuming that its qta claim accrued in,the tribe contends that the government abandoned its claim to devils lake in.the tribe believes that the government later reversed course in,when it reasserted its prior interest in the lake.the tribe says that the government claim was a new claim,which set in motion a new qta statute of limitations.thus the tribe argues that its lawsuit is timely because the operative clock began in.
we have little disagreement with the tribe presentation of the governing legal framework.like any private citizen or corporate entity,the government may abandon its interest in land.if the government clearly and unequivocally abandons its interest,a district court loses jurisdiction over a pending qta action.see e.we believe that the principle espoused in e applies,by analogy,to situations in which a plaintiff has not yet filed a qta suit though the limitations period has been triggered by adverse government conduct.in those situations,the government outright abandonment effectively removes the cloud on a plaintiff title and extinguishes his obligation to file a quiet title action within years.if the government later reasserts an adverse claim,the reasserted claim is properly regarded as a new claim and a new period begins in which a plaintiff may file his qta action against the government.see michel united states,cir per curiam.
applying these principles to the present case,the tribe argues that a memorandum authored by reid peyton chambers abandoned the government interest in devils lake.chambers served as the associate solicitor for the division of indian affairs within the department of the interior in.the tribe argument requires us to review the circumstances that gave rise to chambers memo in considerable detail.
as we have explained,see supra at,the state believes it acquired title to devils lake at statehood,in,under the equal footing doctrine.at some point in the,the north dakota attorney general sought to establish the exact amount of territory in devils lake that the state had acquired in.the north dakota attorney general requested an opinion on the matter from the interior department.
the north dakota attorney general request was assigned to the office of the solicitor.the solicitor office was and still is comprised of several divisions.each division bore responsibility for varying aspects of the department broad mandate over domestic matters.federal indian law gov t printing office.the solicitor apparently directed the north dakota attorney general request to a deputy in charge of one of the associate solicitor for the division of energy resources.
the associate solicitor for the division of energy resources recognized that the north dakota attorney general request implicated significant questions of tribal land ownership.accordingly,he asked for assistance from his counterpart,chambers,who then served as the associate solicitor for the division of indian affairs.on june,chambers responded.he addressed a reply memorandum to the associate solicitor for the division of energy resources in which he concluded that the state did not acquire devils lake in under the equal footing doctrine.chambers wrote,i am of the opinion that devils lake is wholly within the reservation boundaries and the united states holds title to the lakebed in trust for the devils lake sioux tribe.tribe app.
the tribe argues that chambers view represented the position of the government in.to prove the point,the tribe cites a memorandum from the solicitor of the interior department repudiating chambers conclusion.the memo advises the assistant attorney general of the united states that chambers memo should no longer be relied upon as stating the position of the interior department on the ownership of the lakebed.tribe app.in sum,the tribe posits that chambers memo abandoned the government claim to devils lake.
the tribe argument suffers from six distinct flaws.
in the first place,the government can not abandon property without congressional authorization.warren united states,rejecting a plaintiff qta claim as citing supreme court decisions.the property clause of the constitution invests congress with plenary power to dispose of real property belonging to the united states.see const.art.iv,cl.subordinate officers of the united states are without that power,save only as it has been conferred upon them by act of congress or is to be implied from other powers so granted.royal indemnity united states.citations omitted.
it is undisputed that congress never abandoned the government claim to devils lake.likewise,associate solicitor chambers was a subordinate officer,who lacked congressional authorization to abandon a government land claim.see op.sol,concluding that the associate solicitor for the division of indian affairs is not an officer of the united states in the constitutional sense art.ii,cl,because he is not appointed through the procedure of nomination by the president and confirmation by the senate.
our review of interior department policy confirms that chambers lacked the authority to bind the government.in,the governing regulations of the solicitor office strictly forbade associate solicitors from signing documents involving legal opinions of major importance.solicitor regulation a reproduced in aff.of terrance wiles,ex.g.section b excluded associate solicitors from conveying the government position respecting legal questions to persons outside the department of interior without first receiving approval from either the solicitor or the deputy solicitor.id.in addition,b of that same regulation required an associate solicitor to obtain the concurrence of another associate solicitor when the matter in issue concerned two divisions.see id.
these three regulations manifest chambers inability to declare unilaterally that his view was the position of the government.on a question of significant legal importance,such as the ownership of devils lake,chambers had no authority to sign off.in communications with persons outside the department involving the government position,chambers needed the approval of the solicitor or the deputy solicitor.nothing in the record demonstrates that the solicitor or deputy solicitor ever approved chambers conclusions or conveyed them to persons outside the interior department.finally,section b applied to chambers memo because it was addressed to the associate solicitor for the division of energy resources,the official who initially requested chambers assistance.chambers would have had to coordinate his views with those of the associate solicitor for the division of energy resources.
the tribe was almost surely aware of the limitations on chambers authority.chambers left his government post and formed his own law firm at the close of the ford administration.remarkably,as a private attorney,chambers discussed his memo with representatives of the tribe in washington in february.see aff.of carl mckay,mckay served as chairman of the tribe from to.at the meeting,chambers was accompanied by his law partner,marvin sonosky.the two met with tribal officials to discuss the meaning of the memo less than two years after chambers authored that memo because chambers is an accomplished attorney,we are confident that he understood the policies under which he operated while working in the solicitor office,and that he would have conveyed the extent of his limited authority to tribal leaders.of primary importance,the tribe would have learned these facts well within the qta statute of limitations.
these points present insurmountable hurdles to the tribe argument that chambers abandoned the government ownership of devils lake in.
even if we assume for the sake of the tribe argument that chambers possessed the authority to bind the government,chambers memo can not be interpreted as an exercise of that authority.chambers did not act in a manner that suggested he was establishing a position for the government,and thus we can not accept the tribe conclusion that chambers abandoned the government claim to devils lake in these circumstances.
in the main,federal agencies bind the government in two ways.agencies promulgate rules,subject to the provisions of the administrative procedure act.agencies also adjudicate individual controversies,usually taking testimony and receiving evidence in the fashion of our courts.the tribe has not attempted to argue that chambers memo was tantamount to agency or adjudication,nor could it reasonably maintain that position.
aside from making rules and adjudicating cases,federal agencies also issue an array of informal advice in opinion letters,manuals,enforcement guidelines,and so forth.unlike rules and adjudications,however,these informal agency pronouncements lack the force of law.christensen harris county,d.thus,even if chambers memo were likened to an opinion letter,the memo would not be law.in other words,the memo did not bind the government,nor establish the government position,as to the ownership of devils lake.
even if these types of informal agency pronouncements had legal force,the foregoing comparison between chambers memo and an informal opinion letter fails.the office of the solicitor within the interior department regularly issues opinion letters that are routinely published in the federal register.chambers memo bears no resemblance to such an opinion letter.chambers memo has not been published indeed,his memo was never formally issued to the parties whose land rights are affected by its conclusions.viewed on its own terms,chambers memo does not purport to establish a position binding the government.chambers phrased his conclusion that the tribe owned the lake as if it were his personal opinion,not the government position.had chambers intended to expound the position of the government,he would likely have said so,rather than phrasing his conclusions in the fashion of a personal opinion.these factors strongly suggest that chambers memo is undeserving of consideration as informal agency action 
because chambers memo was neither formal nor informal agency action in the senses we have described above,we conclude that chambers memo could not have established the government position in.our conclusion comports with common sense memoranda do not bind the government.aulston united states,cir disregarding internal memoranda in determining the position of the interior department.chambers memo quite simply lacked the legal force necessary to abandon the federal government prior claim to devils lake,serono,shalala,the views of fda staff do not bind the agency final decisionmaker.
irrespective of chambers authority to make government policy,the government never adopted chambers views.the record in the present case does not reveal what use,if any,the associate solicitor for the division of energy resources made of chambers memo.nor does the record disclose whether the associate solicitor for the division of energy resources even agreed with chambers views,or forwarded chambers conclusions to superiors in the interior department,or to the north dakota attorney general.the government never formally transmitted chambers memo to the tribe,though the tribe later obtained a copy through other channels.in short,the evidence in this case suggests that the government never took an affirmative act consistent with the conclusions in chambers memo.
just as the dog failure to bark revealed to sherlock holmes that there had never been a midnight intruder,see arthur conan doyle,the adventure of silver blaze,the strand magazine,december,at,the government failure to act emasculates the tribe argument that chambers memo had legal force.at oral argument,counsel for the government explained that the government would have notified the state of its change in legal position if it had agreed with chambers conclusions.as part of their agreement,the state and the government adopted an accounting procedure by which to compensate the government in the event the tribe was later deemed to own the lake.under the terms of that procedure,the government would be entitled to seek compensation from the state for losing the portion of devils lake it believed it had acquired in.see supp.agreement between the united states and the garrison diversion conservancy,attached as exhibit to decl.of darrell krull,devils lake ii,at.it is undisputed that the government never sought compensation from the state.we find it highly implausible that the government would not have remedied its loss of devils lake under the terms of its express agreement with the state.we therefore conclude,like holmes,that the government never changed its position,and never viewed chambers memo as abandoning its rights to devils lake.
the tribe also raises the specter of the doctrine,whose application we reject.
the tribe contends that we have already determined that chambers memo represented the government position.in the first appeal of this action,in,we asserted without explanation that chambers memo was an opinion that represented the views of the department of the interior.devils lake ii,at.our assertion in the opinion was,however,immaterial to the resolution of the only issue presented in that appeal,which addressed the effect of a icc settlement.we are not obliged to accept our previous asseverations because the doctrine does not extend to a prior opinion recitation of facts not material to the disposition of that appeal.see dedham water,cumberland farms dairy,cir.
the tribe also seeks to establish the government abandonment of devils lake in by reference to a memo.in,the solicitor office of the department of the interior informed the justice department that the june,memorandum of the associate solicitor,indian affairs,should no longer be relied upon as stating the position of this department on the ownership of the lakebed.tribe app.the tribe ventures that the author use of the words no longer proves that,between and,chambers memo had in fact been relied upon to state the government position devils lake we disagree.
as we have explained in considerable detail above,chambers memo did not abandon the government interest in devils lake.the tribe is therefore left to argue that,in repudiating the memo,the memo retroactively revived the force of the memo.the tribe says that the solicitor memo somehow altered the past,though it had never been reasonable to rely on chambers memo in the first place.the argument is plainly specious.the only reasonable interpretation of the memo is that the solicitor sought to avoid any misunderstanding that chambers memo might have created because it reached a wider audience than the solicitor regulations authorized.see solicitor regulation,supra,at.
as concerns the memo,the tribe is not entitled to the benefit of every favorable inference because,strictly speaking,we are not reviewing the propriety of summary judgment.our present inquiry is directed at the historical facts undergirding the exercise of the district court jurisdiction,in particular,whether the tribe filed its qta action within the governing statute of limitations.as to that jurisdictional inquiry,no presumptive truthfulness attaches to the plaintiff allegations,osborn united states,cir,and the tribe,not the government,bears the burden of establishing the existence of subject matter jurisdiction,see id.we do not mean to suggest that we are presently engaged in.the point is simply that we need not accept the force of the tribe less reasonable inference when a more reasonable explanation is readily available.
even if we credited all the tribe arguments and inferences about the and memos,we could not conclude as a legal matter that the qta statute of limitations stopped.as we explained above,the qta limitations period begins to accrue when a plaintiff has reason to know of a cloud on his title.see richmond,at.the inescapable corollary to this principle is that the qta limitations period does not stop when government action simply compounds a cloud on title.viewing the tribe position charitably,the and memos did no more than confirm the cloud that already existed on the tribe putative title to devils lake.
we therefore conclude that the government did not abandon its interest in devils lake,nor concede the tribe ownership thereof,in chambers memorandum.the tribe reliance upon chambers memo as a reflection of change in the government position was wholly unreasonable and legally untenable.as a consequence,the tribe qta limitations period did not stop in.
in its second,the tribe contends that the federal government has made different claims to different portions of devils lake at different points in time.the tribe therefore urges us not to treat the lake as an indivisible whole,but rather to apply multiple statutes of limitations to the respective portions of devils lake claimed at different times by the government.we rejected this very argument in block ii,and we likewise reject it in this case as well.
in block ii,we repudiated a analysis of a qta statute of limitations issue.we determined that when ownership of a disputed property would be resolved based on a single legal theory,notice of the government claim to one tract constituted notice as to other tracts.t he assertion by the united states of its claim to the specific tracts put the state on constructive notice of the united states claim to the remainder of the riverbed tracts.block ii,at.we expressed our view that the district court refusal to extend the scope of the actual notice of the united states claim to the specific tracts to constitute notice regarding its claim to all of its riparian riverbed interests constituted too narrow a view of the reach of g.id.at emphasis added.
the tribe complaint avers that the government holds title to all of devils lake in trust for the tribe this is an action brought by the devils lake sioux tribe to establish that it is the beneficial owner of the bed of devils lake.complaint.the parties dicker over the proper interpretation of a single sentence in an treaty.but all sides agree that this case presents the question of ownership of devils lake,not ownership of discrete tracts of devils lake.because a single legal dispute animates this case,block ii disposes of the tribe argument.block ii compels the conclusion that notice to the tribe in that the government acquired a sizeable portion of devils lake via quitclaim deed constructively informed the tribe of the government adverse claim to the entire lake.at.we reject out of hand the tribe feeble efforts to distinguish block ii.
finally,the tribe compares the present title dispute to private trust law.the tribe argues that it lacked notice of the government adverse interest in devils lake in because it presumed that the government,as trustee,was acting in its best interests.the tribe relies heavily upon loudner united states,in which we held that an indian beneficiary duty to discover claims against the government qua trustee was somewhat lessened,or diminished,because the beneficiary was entitled to rely upon the good faith and expertise of the government,cir.
loudner did not involve a qta claim,and,in our view,loudner does not apply to qta suits.we must construe the qta waiver of sovereign immunity strictly.see block i,at.obviously,the principle of strict construction applies with full force to the elements of g,timeliness and accrual.we believe that a strict construction of the qta is largely at odds with loudner rule that an indian plaintiff has a reduced responsibility to discover adverse government conduct.furthermore,we note that in mottaz,a qta action involving an indian plaintiff,the supreme court made no mention of,or allusion to,the sort of reduced responsibility rule the tribe advocates in the present case.at.because a strict reading of the qta would not entitle the tribe to benefit from loudner guidance,we find loudner to be an unreliable guide in this case.
we agree with the district court that the tribe exceeded the qta statute of limitations.we part company with the district court only so far as the form of relief is concerned.facing a claim,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of the government.we believe that the court entry of summary judgment was improper because the qta statute of limitations has a jurisdictional flavor.plainly put,a district court lacks power and authority to entertain a qta suit.the district court in this instance ought to have dismissed the government for lack of jurisdiction,rather than entering judgment in the government favor.
though we agree with the district court as to the ultimate resolution of the tribe claims against the government,we are obliged to vacate its judgment in part,and to remand the matter so that the court may properly dismiss the claims against the government for lack of jurisdiction.
there is no small difference between a dismissal and a summary judgment in this context.under the terms of the district court final judgment,the tribe claim to the lake has been litigated and lost on the merits.the government would own devils lake.by instructing the district court to dismiss the tribe complaint for lack of jurisdiction,however,the ownership of devils lake remains an open question.a dismissal pursuant to g does not quiet title to the property in the united states.the title dispute remains unresolved.nothing prevents the claimant from continuing to assert his title,in hope of inducing the united states to file its own quiet title suit,in which the matter would finally be put to rest on the merits.block i,at.the present controversy must await future legislative,or perhaps judicial,consideration.
we turn now to the tribe remaining claims against the state and various private parties who purport to own land along the shore of devils lake.
unlike its claim against the federal government,the tribe remaining claims do not falter for lack of jurisdiction.section of title provides an independent basis for federal jurisdiction over the tribe claims against the state and private landowners.that section provides that t he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions,brought by any indian tribe,wherein the matter in controversy arises under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.we believe that the tribe claims against the state and the private landowners arise under federal law.the tribe claims against the state derive from the interpretation of the treaty and the equal footing doctrine.the state believes that it owns the portion of devils lake that it did not deed to the federal government in.the claims against the private landowners derive from federal land patents that the government may,or may not,have been empowered to issue.hence establishes a jurisdictional foothold for the tribe claims against the state and the private landowners.
the district court dismissed the tribe claims against the state and the private landowners after concluding that the federal government was an indispensable party in whose absence the action should not be maintained.see.b.because the government was absent for jurisdictional reasons,the court dismissed the tribe suit due to its inability to join an indispensable party.see.h.
rule b authorizes a district court to exercise its equitable powers to dismiss an action if a party regarded as indispensable can not be joined.whether a person is indispensable,that is,whether a particular lawsuit must be dismissed in the absence of that person,can only be determined in the context of particular litigation.provident tradesmens bank trust patterson,d.we therefore review a district court decision to dismiss an action for failure to join an indispensable party under the highly deferential standard.united states ex rel.steele turn key gaming,cir.
the question posed in the present case is whether the government absence would render a judgment infirm,defective,or unfairly prejudicial in some fashion.we must emphasize,at the outset,that the federal government and the tribe possess the primary claims to devils lake in this litigation.neither the state nor the private landowners can be expected to articulate the government position on its behalf in its absence,so the prejudice to the government is obvious.if the tribe were to prevail,and gain title to devils lake,the government claim would be extinguished before it had ever raised its arguments on the merits.moreover,the district court could not possibly craft an effective judgment in favor of the tribe if the government would not be bound by that judgment due to its.
although a determination of indispensability in one case will seldom be completely dispositive in another our consideration of similar cases buttresses our view that the district court properly dismissed the tribe remaining claims.we note in particular two cases involving similar land claims brought by indians against the federal government.
in manypenny united states,enrolled members of the white earth band of chippewa sued the federal government including the department of interior and several of its employees,the state of minnesota and its agents,three minnesota counties,and an array of private landowners seeking to quiet title to several properties.cir.the district court dismissed the federal government because it had not waived its sovereign immunity.the court also dismissed the state after applying principles of eleventh amendment immunity.finally,in the absence of the federal government,the court dismissed the remaining counties and private landowners under rule b.id.at.on appeal,we affirmed the district court judgment that the members inability to join the federal government was fatal to the maintenance of their quiet title action against other parties.id.at.
another case presents a more striking analogy to the situation we face in the present case.in navajo tribe of indians state of,the navajo tribe sued the federal government,the state of new mexico,and various private landowners seeking to quiet title to thousands of acres allocated to the navajo tribe in a executive order,cir.a year after the executive order issued,the president issued a superseding executive order that appeared to revoke the grant.the navajo tribe challenged the validity of the superseding executive order in its lawsuit.the district court held that the federal government was immune from suit because the tribe claim fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the icc.the court then determined that the government was an indispensable party to the navajo tribe suit,and the court dismissed the remaining defendants under rule b.see id.at.on appeal,the tenth circuit affirmed,reasoning that the government is an indispensable party when its own interest in land is plainly adverse to the interests of an indian tribe.id.at.
manypenny and navajo tribe illustrate that when the government claims an interest in land that squarely conflicts with the interest of a tribe,the government presence in litigation is nearly always required to assure the proper and effective adjudication of the dispute.we find that rationale to be persuasive in this case.as we explained above,the government and the spirit lake tribe have articulated competing claims to devils lake.we therefore hold that the district court did not abuse its ample discretion in dismissing the tribe claims against the state and various private landowners due to its inability to join the federal government.
for the reasons expressed above,we vacate the portion of the district court judgment resolving the tribe claim against the united states.we remand the matter to enable the district court to dismiss the government as a defendant for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.in all other respects,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
this case has been in litigation for fifteen years.in,the district court rejected the tribe claims on the merits,ruling that the government had paid for the lakebed.devils lake i.we reversed,ruling that summary judgment was inappropriate since,as we stated,the facts of the instant case suggest that the parties may have deliberately excluded the lakebed from the settlement because they considered it part of the reservation.admitting such a possibility,it would be counterintuitive to conclude as a matter of law that the parties intended the settlement to prevent the tribe from asserting a subsequent claim to the lakebed.devils lake ii,cir.the opinions in devils lake i and devils lake ii assumed jurisdiction rested with the court to decide the merits.
since that time,the parties negotiated but have failed to reach a settlement.now,after fifteen years,the majority,in effect,states that there is no decision here,and the title of the devils lake lakebed remains in limbo.it tells the parties that the federal courts will not decide the title dispute.to me,it is analogous to two boxers who have fought for fifteen rounds only to hear the judges say we decline to decide who wins and we send the fighters to box in another ring.
i respectfully dissent from the majority opinion.the issue is when did the tribe know or when should it have known that the united states claimed the lakebed of devils lake.in my view,the tribe did not know and would not have known of the government adverse claim until,when the official position of the united states changed from its view that the tribe owned the lakebed to a view of no definite position on title to the lakebed.
we commented on the official position of the united states in devils lake ii,cir.this court determined that in the department of the interior issued an opinion,authored by an associate solicitor for indian affairs reid peyton chambers,which concluded that devils lake is wholly within the reservation boundaries and the united states holds title to the lakebed in trust for the tribe.id.at.the panel noted that the united states asserted this position in subsequent litigation,but ultimately abandoned it.id.at.the panel concluded that the government opinion was communicated to the tribe later in,but,in,the government withdrew support from its opinion.id.at.
