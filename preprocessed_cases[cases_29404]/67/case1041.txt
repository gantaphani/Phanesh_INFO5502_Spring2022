this case involves a dispute over land use between landowner dennis dubuc appellant and green oak township the township,where the land is located.this dispute has taken numerous forms,lasted many years,and involved multiple judicial decisions by various courts.in its present manifestation,the parties opposing appellant are green oak township,green oak township zoning board of appeals,dale brewer,raymond clevenger,and estate of michael vallie collectively,appellees.the first of these two companion cases,was filed by appellant in and claims that the township denial of his application for a lot split was in retaliation for his exercise of his first amendment rights,in violation of.appellant now appeals the judgment of the district court,which dismissed his complaint as barred by claim preclusion,denied his motion for interim attorney fees,denied his motion to file a second amended complaint,and denied his motion to reinstate his equal protection claim.in the second of the two companion cases,appellant argues that the district court erred in awarding appellees attorney fees pursuant to as the prevailing party in the suit below.for the reasons stated herein,we affirm the district court decision in the first case but reverse the district court award of attorney fees to appellees in the second companion case.
appellant owns approximately four acres of land,divided into two parcels,in the township.in october,appellant began construction on the northern parcel of a second storage building,but the township subsequently issued a order and denied a building permit because the structure violated a one hundred foot setback requirement for industrial buildings adjacent to residentially zoned areas.appellant then instituted an action in livingston county circuit court,hereinafter,dubuc i,seeking a variance from the setback requirement,and that action produced a consent judgment on may.this consent judgment resulted in the issuance of a building permit contingent upon appellant compliance with relevant building codes,local zoning ordinances,and a revised site plan.
appellant completed construction of this second building as well as a third building,and applied for certificates of use and occupancy for both.in february,the township denied these certificates after inspection and ordered appellant and his tenants to vacate the third building because it did not comply with fire and safety requirements and was not constructed in conformity with the approved site plan.the township denied certificates for the second building because it was not constructed in accordance with the consent judgment and violated various building and construction codes.appellant refused to vacate either building and filed a second suit in livingston county circuit court,hereinafter,dubuc ii,alleging violations of,the michigan constitution,and several state common law torts.defendants in that suit were green oak township,green oak township board,ron niece,and gordon appleton.at.as a result of two amendments to the complaint and motions seeking disqualification of the trial judge,there was not a status conference for this lawsuit until december.appellant and his counsel failed to appear at this status conference.appellant again failed to appear at a hearing on pending motions on december.as a result,the dubuc ii court sua sponte ordered appellant counsel to appear on december,and show cause why the case should not be dismissed and sanctions awarded to the defendants.after arguments from both parties at this show cause hearing,the court ordered appellant to pay sanctions of to the township and to the county and its attorneys within fifteen days or the case would be dismissed with prejudice.id.at.after appellant failed to pay the sanctions within this deadline and failed to object to the proposed order drafted by the defendants regarding the sanctions and a dismissal,the court dismissed dubuc ii with prejudice on march.
while dubuc ii was pending,appellant sought a building permit from the township to construct a building on the southern parcel of his land,and the township denied the permit because the approved site plan had expired and the building dimensions and work site did not conform with that site plan.appellant responded with a mandamus action in livingston county circuit court,hereinafter,dubuc iii,challenging the denial.the defendants filed a counterclaim seeking enforcement of the consent judgment in dubuc i,a contempt finding against appellant for failing to bring the two northern buildings up to code,and damages.the trial court denied appellant claim and granted summary judgment for the defendants on their counterclaim,concluding that appellant had no legal right to the issuance of a building permit and the township had no obligation to issue one.after his motion for reconsideration failed,appellant appealed and dubuc iii was consolidated with dubuc ii.the court of appeals affirmed both judgments in a per curiam order on june.
appellant filed another suit,hereinafter,dubuc iv,in livingston county circuit court,arising from work appellant completed on the roof of the second northern building in.the township had requested that appellant seek a building permit and submit engineered drawings for the work in april,but appellant refused and argued the work was only repair work.in november,appellant evicted one tenant of the second northern building and attempted to relocate four tenants from another building into that space.the township refused to issue certificates of occupancy for these tenants,citing appellant failure to conform to the city building codes.on december,the township wrote to appellant and described what would be required to obtain the certificates.appellant responded on december,stating that he believed he did not need to follow those procedures,and he filed dubuc iv on the next day,seeking a writ of mandamus compelling the issuance of certificates of use and occupancy.
in january,the township moved for and was granted an ex parte temporary restraining order forbidding appellant or those acting at his direction from doing any construction,alteration,or building work on the second northern building.after several hearings,this temporary restraining order was converted to a preliminary injunction on august.appellant motion to disqualify the trial judge was denied and that denial was affirmed on appeal.the dubuc iv court denied the request for mandamus in november,finding it frivolous,and found appellant in contempt of the consent judgment in dubuc i,the january temporary restraining order,and the august preliminary injunction.the court of appeals affirmed.see dubuc green oak township,et,wl.lexis,unpublished opinion.the michigan supreme court denied appellant motion for leave to appeal and his motion for reconsideration dubuc green oak township.additionally,the michigan supreme court granted the defendant motion for sanctions and remanded to the trial court for determination of the defendant actual expenses.id.
in,appellant sought approval to split his lot so he could sell it.appellant filed the first of the two companion suits at bar in may,alleging that the township denial of his application for a lot split was a taking without just compensation in violation of the fifth amendment.defendants originally were green oak township,green oak township zoning board,the township supervisor dale brewer,and the township attorney raymond clevenger.appellant claimed that the township had retaliated against him because of his previous state law suits and his complaint to the michigan construction code commission,which resulted in corrective action taken against the township and its zoning and building departments.according to appellant,appellees retaliation took the form of consistent denials or delays after he requested variances or permits.
in december,judge newblatt granted in part and denied in part appellees motion for summary judgment,finding the claim was not ripe for federal adjudication because appellant had not exhausted all state judicial remedies.see dubuc green oak township,et.judge newblatt also found that appellant had failed to state a claim for substantive due process violations,dismissing those claims.id.at.appellant remaining claims were that the township and its officials had violated his first amendment rights and,and the court specifically found that appellant had properly alleged the elements of a claim for municipal liability under that statute.id.at.judge newblatt rejected the township argument that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case because it would duplicate pending state action,because the state action involved refusal to grant appellant a certificate of occupancy,while the federal action involved refusal to allow the lot split.id.at.the court held that there would be no inconsistency in holding that the refusal to grant the certificate was justified while the refusal to split the lot was not.id.
appellant filed an amended complaint in february,alleging additional interference with the use of his property by the township building administrator,michael vallie vallie.after vallie passed away,his estate was substituted as defendant.in late,appellant filed a series of motions seeking injunctive relief.on november,judge newblatt granted an injunction in part,ordering the township to issue certificates of occupancy for appellant buildings,subject to appellant compliance with seven conditions.in this order,the judge credited the state administrator opinions over that of vallie because of vallie obvious animus and uncooperative attitude toward plaintiff.at.in january,judge newblatt denied all other pending motions for injunctive relief,dissolved the prior injunction he had issued,and forbade appellant from filing any further requests for injunctive relief as an improper form of collateral attack on the orders of livingston county circuit judge burress.
the parties filed for summary judgment in march.judge newblatt denied appellant motion for summary judgment,granted appellees motion for summary judgment as to dale brewer,and denied appellees remaining motions for summary judgment.dubuc green oak township,et.the court dismissed appellant claim based on the equal protection clause,claiming he was a class of one against whom the township selectively enforced its building codes in retaliation for the exercise of his first amendment right to sue.id.at citing futernick sumpter township,cir.judge newblatt also denied appellees motion on the issue of claim and issue preclusion.id.at.the court stated that its january order,which dismissed appellant request for injunctive relief as an attempt to collaterally attack various orders of the livingston county circuit court,was based on the fact that the issues of whether appellant was entitled to a certificate of occupancy,whether defendants acted within their authority,and whether the state court injunctions and sanctions were appropriate were state matters.id.whether appellees acted in retaliation of appellant exercise of his constitutionally protected rights,on the other hand,was the subject of this suit and was not addressed in the state court litigation.id.finally,the court specifically stated that appellant remaining claims arose under the first and fourteenth amendments for retaliation against him for exercising his first amendment rights.id.at.
the case was set for trial when judge newblatt retired from the bench in august.at a final conference,judge newblatt had ordered further submissions from the parties as to any legal defense that could be decided without trial.in response to this order,appellees again raised the issue of claim and issue preclusion,among others.in a memorandum concerning his retirement,judge newblatt suggested that the case be deferred until the state cases were resolved,so that issue and claim preclusion can be ruled upon rationally.at.
the case was transferred to judge borman on october.in september,the district court below,upon motion by appellees,stayed the proceedings pending the outcome of the state court litigation.once the stay was lifted,the district court considered appellant motion for interim attorney fees,appellant motion for leave to file a second amended complaint,appellees motion asserting legal defenses,and appellant motion to reinstate the equal protection claim.see dubuc green oak township,et,d.on august,judge borman denied all of appellant motions,granted appellees motion asserting legal defenses in part,and dismissed the complaint with prejudice as barred by claim preclusion by virtue of the state court dismissal with prejudice in dubuc ii.id.at.appellant filed a timely notice of appeal 
in september,appellees filed a motion for attorney fees pursuant to as the prevailing party in the suit.on february,the district court granted this motion.the district court awarded appellees in attorney fees on august.appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.

the purposes of claim preclusion are to relieve parties of the cost and vexation of multiple lawsuits,conserve judicial resources,prevent inconsistent decisions,encourage reliance on adjudication,and promote comity between the state and federal courts.allen mccurry,d.a federal court must give a state court judgment the same preclusive effect it would have in the courts of the rendering state.heyliger state university and community college system,cir.as such,the preclusive effect of previous state court judgments in this case is governed by michigan law on preclusion.
before addressing the substance of the claim preclusion issue,we must address the application of the michigan court rules mcr,specifically rule a.there was an amendment to mcr a in,and then another in.the current version of the rule states in a pleading that states a claim against an opposing party,the pleader must join every claim that the pleader has against that opposing party at the time of serving the pleading,if it arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the action and does not require for its adjudication the presence of third parties over whom the court can not acquire jurisdiction.mcr a.the version in existence before also required a pleading against a party to state every claim that the pleader had against that party arising out of the same transaction or occurrence.see staff comment,mcr.this version,however,contained a waiver rule in subsection a,providing that failure of a defendant to object to of all claims in the first action constituted waiver of this compulsory joinder rule.id.the version in existence between and,which applies to this case,maintained the waiver rule,but added the following language this rule does not affect collateral estoppel or the prohibition against relitigation of a claim under a different theory.see mcr a.in other words,the rule was changed in so that a defendant was not precluded from arguing collateral estoppel in a second suit,even if she failed to object to of that claim in the first suit.
appellant argues that,under michigan law,appellees waived any claim preclusion argument by failing to object to of claims in dubuc ii.given the amendment,this argument is only valid if the language exempting collateral estoppel or the prohibition against relitigation of a claim under a different theory does not include claim preclusion,the basis of the district court ruling below there is no evidence that appellant raised this procedural argument at the district court level before the case was dismissed for claim preclusion,even though appellees had asserted claim preclusion in their affirmative defenses and on a motion for summary judgment.
issue preclusion is generally referred to as collateral estoppel,whereas claim preclusion is encompassed by res judicata see black law dictionary at,ed.the plain language of mcr a suggests that the exemption to the waiver rule was meant to cover collateral estoppel issue preclusion and res judicata claim preclusion,or the relitigation of a claim under a different theory.appellant,however,cites the staff comment to the amendment,which states that the waiver rule was removed in order to facilitate the operation of the common law doctrine of res judicata.staff comment to amendment,mcr.this language can be read to suggest that the exception to the waiver rule had helped facilitate collateral estoppel,but had not worked to facilitate res judicata.in the author commentary to the version,however,it was pointed out that the waiver rule itself was meant to apply only to joinder of claims,not theories.author commentary to rule,mcr.thus,one must raise all theories in support of a given claim in a given action or lose them.a different result would put any defendant in an untenable position either he or she would have to object to non joinder of,suggest further theories of recovery to the suffer successive suits on the same claim or cause of action,as long as different theories were alleged.id.this commentary explains the language of the rule,or the prohibition against relitigation of a claim under a different theory.in this case,appellees argument is that appellant is trying to raise the same claim now as in dubuc ii,only under a different theory.in order to better understand this michigan court rule,we turn to michigan case law which specifically applies mcr or broadly discusses the doctrine of res judicata in michigan 
appellant cites rogers colonial savings loan,which upheld the finding that a defendant waived the right to argue res judicata by not raising in the first trial.see ross onyx oil gas.this case is inapplicable,however,because it was decided under the version of the rule,which did not contain the language excepting collateral estoppel.see kelley heppler,wl,at.may,unpublished opinion.nevertheless,it contains some enlightening discussion of the initial purpose behind the rule.the court notes that it was meant to codify existing rules against splitting causes of action.id.at.the court then noted that the rule which at that time had the waiver provision but not the exception had no impact on res judicata as to claims actually litigated,and also no impact on the doctrine of collateral estoppel id.at.thus,before the amendment,the michigan supreme court had held that the waiver provision did not affect collateral estoppel.the fact that the amendment specifically excepts not only collateral estoppel but also the relitigation of a claim under a different theory suggests it was meant to apply to claim preclusion as well as issue preclusion.
another applicable case is jones state farm mutual automobile ins,in which the court discussed mcr in a footnote.the court ultimately applied kentucky court rules,but a michigan appellate court reading of michigan court rules is nevertheless enlightening.the footnote states in addition,even if we were to apply michigan rule to this matter,plaintiff argument would fail.mcr a provides that the waiver rule does not affect collateral estoppel or the prohibition against relitigation of a claim under a different theory.because we have already held that plaintiff michigan action is a claim under a different theory,mcr a would not prevent defendant from raising the defense that plaintiff has split his cause of action.id.at.the holding of the jones court was that the claim was barred by res judicata,not by collateral estoppel.id.at.thus,a michigan court discussing the same version of mcr applicable to this case found that the waiver provision did not apply to either collateral estoppel or res judicata.
this view is reinforced by the michigan court of appeals in kelley heppler,which also involved application of rule before the amendment.wl.may,unpublished opinion.the court specifically rejected the plaintiff argument that the defendant was barred from asserting res judicata not collateral estoppel because he had failed to object to.id.at.finally,the court called plaintiff reliance on rogers misplaced because that case applied an outdated rule which did not contain the language.id.
applying the version of the rule,the court in purification systems,mastan company also offered some helpful analysis.in determining whether res judicata again,not collateral estoppel applied,the court noted that the plaintiff was to blame for not joining the claim in the previous suit and the defendant was to blame for not objecting to in the previous suit.id.at.nevertheless,the court held that res judicata would bar the second suit,despite the failure to object to,because the only alternative for the defendant is in effect to plead plaintiff case for it.id.thus,michigan courts have even been willing to overlook a defendant failure to object to when it is apparent that res judicata should apply.see crawford chabot,finding plaintiff claim barred by res judicata without addressing whether the defendant objected to or not.
finally,this reading of mcr is consistent with the repeated assertion by michigan courts that they employ broad application of claim preclusion.see coniglio wyoming valley fire ins,noting that michigan strictly enforces the rule of justice against splitting causes of action in order to prevent vexation and expense to a defendant bergeron busch,michigan has adopted a broad application of res judicata that bars claims arising out of the same transaction that plaintiff could have brought but did not.eyde charter township of meridian,stating that the michigan supreme court has adopted the broad definition of res judicata baker golematis,moreover,the law favors the combination of related claims in one action and penalizes the failure to join all claims arising out of the same transaction or occurrence.mcr does not bar appellees from asserting claim preclusion in this case.
the district court dismissed the complaint,finding that the state court decision in dubuc ii barred this action under claim preclusion.dubuc green oak township,et,d.prior to this dismissal,the one surviving claim of appellant was that appellees violated by retaliating against him for prior exercises of his first amendment rights to speak to the press and to petition the courts.the district court found that in dubuc ii dubuc green oak township,ron niece,gordon appleton,and dale brewer,appellant second amended complaint alleged a violation of,in that appellees denied appellant procedural and substantive due process of law and equal protection of the laws in violation of the fifth and fourteenth amendments by blocking appellant attempts to develop his land.the six other counts alleged violations of the michigan constitution and various state laws based on the same conduct.as noted,this case was dismissed when appellant failed to pay sanctions issued for failing to appear at a status conference and hearing.
in michigan,claim preclusion has the following elements the first action must have resulted in a decision on the merits the issues must have been resolved in the first action,either because they were actually litigated or because they might have been raised in the first action through reasonable diligence of the parties and both actions must be between the same parties,or their privies.sloan city of madison heights.see katt dykhouse,cir.this court agrees with the district court application of the first element of the michigan preclusion test a dismissal with prejudice for failure to comply with a court order amounts to an adjudication on the merits.wilson newspapers.b.
next,applying the second element for preclusion in michigan,the district court found that the claims in this complaint could and should have been raised in dubuc ii.see perry croucher,wl at cir,unpublished opinion holding that the issue with claim preclusion is not whether the court heard this claim,the issue is whether the court could have heard the claim.the essence of appellant claim,according to the district court,is that from to the township and its officials continually retaliated against him for speaking to the press and petitioning the courts for redress.this retaliation consistently related to the development of his property,whether it be denial of a certificate for occupancy or refusal to allow a lot split.the test in michigan is whether the same facts or evidence are essential to the maintenance of the two actions,not a comparison of the grounds for relief.jones state farm mutual automobile insur.that the same facts are present in the state and federal cases here is evidenced by the fact that appellant has continually updated his complaints in both the state and federal courts to allege new instances of this action.thus,the major issue in the case at bar is at what point allegations give rise to new claims that could not have been raised in the earlier proceeding.
the district court emphasized that a plaintiff should move to include new claims that he becomes aware of in the course of discovery for a lawsuit,or risk having the doctrine of claim preclusion apply to the omitted claim.dubuc,d at citing cox tennessee valley,wl at cir,unpublished opinion.according to the district court,appellant could have added the claim to his claims in dubuc ii.the fact that dubuc ii involved certificates of occupancy while the federal suit involved a,the court continued,is not a crucial difference because otherwise appellant would have to be allowed to file a new suit after each episode in what he claims is an ongoing effort to retaliate against him.to allow so many suits,the district court held,would defeat the core policy underlying the doctrine of claim preclusion.see crawford chabot,holding that res judicata applied to subsequent conduct that is part and parcel of the earlier incidents forming the basis of plaintiff complaint.how the appellees retaliatory animus manifested itself is not the crucial element of appellant claim rather,it is the retaliatory animus itself.thus,the district court held,this action involved claims that could have been raised in dubuc ii.
appellant agrees that there is a recurring issue of alleged wrongdoing permeating both of these suits,but argues that this federal lawsuit is based on later misconduct and a different set of facts than dubuc ii.this is not a case where there were merely later consequences,appellant continues,but one in which there were new facts and events.as authority,appellant cites ditmore michalik,which involved a land dispute in which the court rejected the defendant argument that a case involved the same legal issue of whether neighbors had any legal rights to a parcel of land,because the earlier court did not clearly adjudicate that issue.the court held that it would not bar the second action because it was unclear why the earlier court had held as it did.id.in this case,it is quite clear why the dubuc ii court held as it to pay sanctions for absences from court proceedings.in plaza investment abel,the court held that a tenant,who had previously received damages for breach of a covenant to repair,was not barred from bringing a second suit seeking damages suffered from a continuing breach since the last recovery.here,appellant is not seeking damages that have occurred since another suit in which he received damages,because he has not received damages in a previous suit.in fact,the alleged damages from denial of the occurred,and this suit was filed,before dubuc ii was finally adjudicated.thus,appellant was in a different situation than the tenant in plaza because he could have added these claims to his complaint in dubuc ii.
appellant also cites putnam city of cookeville,which involved first amendment claims by the publisher of a tabloid and web page against a city refusing to allow him access to certain records.cir.the defendants argued that an earlier suit between the same parties,in which defendants motion for summary judgment was granted,acted to preclude the subsequent suit.the court rejected this claim because the factual circumstances and events differed,and because summary judgment in the earlier suit was actually not granted until after it had been granted in the second suit.id.at.in contrast,dubuc ii had been finally adjudicated before appellant complaint in this case was dismissed.other cases cited by appellant are similarly distinguishable.see said rouge steel,remanding the case because it was unclear whether the claim should be barred by res judicata.
appellant cites several cases employing a continuing violation theory to allow in evidence that would otherwise be.see united air lines,evans,d involving a claim of continuing violation of title vii in order to avoid the statute of limitations hull cuyahoga valley joint vocational school district,cir holding that proof of a continuing violation of civil rights can overcome a motion for summary judgment because some of the actions alleged would be black law enforcement officers city of akron,cir holding that the statute of limitations did not bar a plaintiff from offering proof of a pattern and practice of discrimination.appellant asserts that this continuing violation theory should be extended to allow a claim to survive claim preclusion.the only case that lends any credence to this theory is herendeen michigan state police,d.herendeen,however,merely stands for the proposition that evidence that might have been used in a prior lawsuit is not barred by claim preclusion from being used in a subsequent suit raising a new claim.id.at.in this case,the district court found that appellant entire claim,not just some of the evidence,was barred by claim preclusion.
even if there were some alleged new facts that arose after the filing of dubuc ii,it does not preclude application of res judicata.the key issue is whether appellant could have amended his complaint in dubuc ii to include these new manifestations of alleged retaliation.appellant,in fact,tried to add a first amendment claim in dubuc ii,but the motion was never ruled on because the case was dismissed with prejudice.dubuc green oak township,et,at.june,unpublished opinion.at.when judge burress on january,assessed costs against appellant for failing to appear at scheduled court appearances,he specifically set a hearing for january,in order to determine the parties remaining pending motions.at.the case was then dismissed on march.there is no record that there ever was a hearing on the pending motions,but presumably any hearing was delayed until appellant paid the sanctions.since appellant never did pay the sanctions,his case was dismissed with prejudice this effort by appellant to try to add a first amendment claim in dubuc ii demonstrates that the same essential facts were the basis of both claims appellant was just labeling them with different causes of action.in other words,appellant could have raised his first amendment claims in dubuc ii.the fact that he tried and never was able to do so does not provide support for his being able to reraise this claim in federal court.see maiden rozwood,wl at cir.may,unpublished opinion rejecting the plaintiff claim that res judicata should not apply to her claim because she had sought to amend her complaint in the case to add the claim but the motion was denied.but see martin deuchler,holding that the denial of a motion to amend is entitled to res judicata when it is based on futility,but implying that denial of a motion to amend for other reasons should be treated differently.the state suit was dismissed on the merits based on appellant actions in court,and appellees should not be punished just because the case was dismissed before the motion to add another claim could be ruled on.more importantly,the present suit was filed before appellant knew that dubuc ii would be dismissed and before he knew that his motion to add a first amendment claim in dubuc ii would not be ruled on.appellant was seeking to raise this same issue in collateral courts at the same time.
this analysis,of course,should not be read to preclude the victim of ongoing retaliation from filing multiple suits.if retaliation persists after the victim prevails in an initial suit,or even if the victim does not prevail,then res judicata would not affect access to the courts.when the alleged additional manifestation of retaliatory animus occurs before adjudication on the merits of the initial suit,however,the victim is obliged to amend his or her initial complaint to add these new allegations.see cox tennessee valley authority,wl at cir,unpublished opinion holding that,when a plaintiff becomes aware of additional facts or theories in the process of discovery,she should move to amend her complaint or face claim preclusion in subsequent suits.sherman ludington,wl at cir.july,unpublished opinion holding that federal res judicata applied to a claim,which the plaintiff had unsuccessfully attempted to add by amending his complaint in the previous suit,because plaintiff possessed the facts and evidence and had the opportunity to litigate the claims at an earlier date nathan rowan,cir citing cromwell county of sac.nevertheless,the doctrine of res judicata necessarily applies to all matters,including new or different legal theories against the same parties,that might have been offered in the prior action.dart dart,holding that res judicata bars not only claims already litigated,but every claim arising from the same transaction that the parties,exercising reasonable diligence,could have raised but did not.the doctrine of res judicata would become meaningless if a party could continue to relitigate the same the defendant was acting in retaliation of the plaintiff exercise of constitutional merely positing a few additional facts that occurred after the initial suit.see crawford chabot.when,as here,it is obvious that the alleged ongoing retaliation is actually the defendant continuing on the same course of conduct,which has previously been found by a court to be proper,a subsequent court must conclude that the plaintiff is simply trying to relitigate the same claim.
appellant also argues that the purpose of claim preclusion is the early disposition of a lawsuit,so the fact that appellee waited five years before arguing claim preclusion means it was untimely.see bodenhamer architectural research.the wait,however,was because of amendments and motions by appellant,as well as the retirement of a judge,and not stall tactics by appellees.additionally,the argument was first raised in march,in appellees answer and affirmative defenses.at.
finally,applying the last element of the michigan preclusion test,the district court held that the same parties were involved in both suits.the plaintiff in both suits was dennis dubuc.thus,the party against whom claim preclusion is being asserted was present in both suits.the defendants in dubuc ii were the township,ron niece niece,gordon appleton appleton,and dale brewer brewer.the first and fourth are in this case and the second and third are not involved in this case.the two in this case not present in dubuc ii are raymond clevenger clevenger and the estate of michael vallie vallie.appellant argues that,even if the municipality has claim preclusion,individuals sued in their individual capacities do not.see perry croucher,wl at cir,unpublished opinion.
vallie is the successor in office to appleton,both of whom were sued for their alleged malfeasance in office by mistreating appellant.this created sufficient privity between vallie and appleton.see crawford chabot.in dubuc iv,appellant sued vallie in his individual and official capacity,and clevenger was later named as a defendant as well.dubuc green oak township,et,wl.lexis,unpublished opinion.at.thus,strict claim preclusion does not apply to vallie or clevenger in their individual capacity only.however,appellant has not presented sufficient evidence that actions in their capacity by either party would raise a colorable claim.the court should not allow appellant to continue this repetitive litigation simply by finding some municipal official that has not yet been sued,and trying to blame what he claims was systemic group mistreatment of him on that one person individually.
judge newblatt dismissed appellant claim that his right to equal protection of the laws was violated because he was singled out for strict application of the zoning and building he was a class of one.appellant relies on village of willowbrook olech,d,to argue that his equal protection theory has now been endorsed by the supreme court.the district court found that appellant might well be entitled to reinstatement of the claim,but that claim preclusion applied equally to that claim.dubuc green oak township,et,d.in fact,claim preclusion applies with even greater force,because an equal protection claim was actually pled in dubuc ii,at least as a violation of michigan constitution.see dubuc green oak township,et,at.june,unpublished opinion.at.
the supreme court did accept the theory espoused by appellant in village of willowbrook our cases have recognized successful equal protection claims brought by a class of one,where the plaintiff alleges that she has been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment,d.the viability of this issue rises and falls with resolution of the first issue.since this court has determined that claim preclusion applies to the first amendment claim,we find that claim preclusion also applies to the equal protection claim.thus,the district court did not err in denying the motion for reinstatement as futile.
appellant seeks leave to file a second amended complaint to add events occurring between the time of the first amended complaint and august,when the permanent certificates of occupancy were issued,and to add township officials as defendants.a party must have leave or consent of the court in order to amend his complaint after a responsive pleading has been filed.a.leave is freely given,but courts may deny leave to amend when the amendment would be futile or cause undue delay which would result in unfair prejudice to the defendant.foman davis,d brooks celeste,cir.the longer the delay,the less prejudice the opposing party will be required to show.phelps mcclellan,cir.
the district court found that the delay was substantial,because appellant admits that the last date of any dispute with the township was august,more than a year before this action was stayed by the district court.appellant does not argue that the information only recently came to his attention,nor offer any other excuse for the delay.the district court also found that allowing the amended complaint would prejudice appellees,because the case was ready for trial before judge newblatt retired,and had since only been delayed to await the outcome of the state court proceedings.adding new claims and defendants would significantly delay resolution of the dispute.phelps,at.such an amendment would also require the defendants to expend significant additional resources,because the new defendants would have to familiarize themselves with the long record in this case,and all defendants would have to conduct discovery related to the events alleged in the amendment.thus,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant a second amendment to his complaint.
appellant seeks interim attorney fees based on judge newblatt preliminary injunction issued in november.section provides that a judge may award attorney fees to the prevailing party in a action.there are situations where an interlocutory fee award may be made before final judgmen
