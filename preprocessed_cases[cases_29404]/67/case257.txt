these appeals represent yet another chapter in a seemingly interminable intrafamilial dispute that has run a litigatory gauntlet stretching from puerto rico to new jersey.see,goya foods,cir goya foods,unanue,cir,cert.denied,d in re unanue casal,cir,cir goya foods,d goya foods.goya foods,in re,goya foods,in re,in re,unanue casal unanue casal,in re settlement of accounts of unanue,in re settlement of accounts of unanue.law div.this chapter arises out of a matched set of interlocutory orders entered by the district court with a view toward barring the transfer of certain assets held in the name of the wife of a judgment debtor including a lavish park avenue cooperative apartment.despite their knowledge of these court orders,the management,park corporation,and ira leon in a sale of the apartment.acting on the petition of the original plaintiff,goya foods,the district court found the appellants in contempt,and awarded substantial monetary sanctions.the appellants ask us to overturn or,at least,to modify this award.
the outcome of these appeals hinges primarily upon a complex issue of first impression as to whether goya failure to comply strictly with the requirements for perfecting orders prohibiting the alienation of property resulted in the expiration of those orders upon the court subsequent entry of judgment in the underlying case and,therefore,left the appellants free to consummate the challenged transaction.this close question has been well briefed and argued on both sides by able counsel.we conclude that,notwithstanding goya failure to satisfy the literal requirements of rule of the puerto rico rules of civil procedure,the relevant orders remained legally binding upon the appellants,given their actual knowledge of the prohibition.largely on that basis,we affirm the district court contempt findings against the appellants.we find no fault with the court choice of a monetary sanction,but we conclude that the court misapprehended the relationship of prejudgment interest to that award.consequently,we vacate the separate award of prejudgment interest and remand for reconsideration of the amount of the monetary sanction.
background 
in setting the stage,we draw heavily upon our previous distillation of the relevant facts.see goya foods,unanue,at.we add details only where necessary.
goya was founded by charles unanue father in.the company prospered.charles served as a goya executive from the late until,when internecine warfare led to his ouster.this,in turn,prompted litigation involving goya,charles,charles father,and other relatives.pursuant to settlements reached in and,charles received more than in exchange,he surrendered his ownership interest in goya and agreed that he would neither contest his father will nor file any claims against his father estate.the settlement agreements further provided that if any signatory wrongfully sued another signatory,the transgressor would be liable for liquidated damages equal to twice the victor litigation expenses.
charles father died in.eleven years later,charles claimed that he was entitled to an inheritance from his parents estates including certain goya shares that his father had placed in trust.the trustees resisted the claim and sought a judgment in a new jersey state court barring charles from maintaining any action against either the trust or his parents estates.after protracted litigation,the new jersey court enforced the settlement agreement,enjoined charles from pressing further claims of entitlement,and entered judgment for goya,pursuant to the liquidated damages clause,for approximately.in re unanue,no.ch.div unpublished opinion.
in the midst of this odyssey,charles repaired to puerto rico and filed a petition for personal bankruptcy.from that point forward,the battle continued in both new jersey and puerto rico.among other initiatives,goya filed an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court in which it contended that charles was concealing assets by placing them in the names of various straws including his wife,liliane unanue.
eventually,the bankruptcy court dismissed charles insolvency petition without granting him a discharge.in re,slip op.at.with the shield of bankruptcy shattered and a state court judgment in hand,goya mounted a new offensive.it sued charles and liliane unanue in puerto rico federal district court,asserting that charles was the beneficial owner of various assets held in liliane name,and,therefore,that it was entitled to reach and apply those assets to satisfy the new jersey judgment.to ensure against dissipation of the assets,goya moved for the imposition of provisional remedies.
the district court granted the motion on november,and issued an ex parte order prohibiting the alienation of various properties held in liliane name.pertinently,the order encompassed a cooperative apartment located at park avenue in new york city the apartment.in a companion order,the court barred any transfer or other alienation of the cooperative shares memorializing liliane interest in the apartment goya then transmitted copies of the district court orders to both park the cooperative housing association that owned the building and wallack management the building managing agent.
almost two years later,the district court resolved the underlying litigation,holding,inter alia,that charles was the beneficial owner of the cooperative shares and the apartment,and entering judgment to that effect.goya foods.at.although the ruling ordinarily would have cleared the way for goya to levy against the apartment,the court stayed execution pending appellate review.id.at.in february,goya informed both wallack management and park of the district court decision and requested that it be notified before any disposition was made of the unanues interest in the apartment.
that same month,wallack management informed liliane that she was in default of her obligation to make mandatory maintenance payments to the cooperative,and that park would terminate her interest and take possession of the apartment unless she cured the default.adverting to this threat,liliane asked the district court for permission to sell the apartment,and her attorney informed wallack management that she had filed such a motion.the court did not rule upon the request,but,rather,ordered counsel to meet and discuss possible solutions to the dilemma.
in may,liliane agreed to sell the apartment to rennert for.prior to the closing,rennert attorneys discovered that goya had neglected either to record a cautionary notice of lis pendens in the manhattan land records or to file a uniform commercial code ucc statement anent the cooperative shares.concluding that the november orders had lapsed when the district court entered judgment in november of,rennert counsel advised him that no effective judicial restraint precluded liliane from conveying clear title to the apartment 
the bylaws of the cooperative required park approval of any transfer of shares.after consultation with counsel,park board ratified the proposed sale of liliane shares and,effectively,of the apartment,on condition that rennert indemnify it for all loss,cost,or damage including litigation expenses resulting from any challenge to the sale.rennert agreed to hold both wallack management and park harmless,and the transaction proceeded.
the closing took place in june of.from the purchase price,wallack management,acting as liliane broker,received a commission.liliane net proceeds well in excess of were wired to a swiss bank account.the final version of the sales agreement included a confidentiality clause.
goya did not learn of the transaction until october of.it immediately brought the matter to the district court attention.the court directed charles and liliane to appear personally and show cause why they should not be adjudged in contempt for violating the november orders.when neither defendant appeared at the appointed record suggests that both charles and liliane sought sanctuary court held them in contempt,issued warrants for their arrest,and dissolved the preexisting stay thus allowing execution of the outstanding judgment.days later,we affirmed the district court original judgment.we upheld,inter alia,the finding that several properties held in liliane name including the apartment and the cooperative shares were in actuality owned by charles.goya foods,unanue,at.
goya next petitioned the district court to hold wallack management,park,and rennert in civil contempt for defying the november orders.the court directed the appellants to show cause why they should not be so cited.the appellants made a proffer but,following goya and a hearing,the district court determined that all three appellants had violated the november orders by participating in the purchase of the apartment and the cooperative shares despite their actual knowledge of those orders.goya foods,d at.accordingly,the court adjudged the appellants in civil contempt,and held them jointly and severally liable to goya for the purchase price id.at.although the appellants filed a notice of appeal,rennert,acting pursuant to a court order,deposited the sum of in the registry of the district court presumably in lieu of a supersedeas bond.after some further skirmishing not relevant here,the court embellished the original award with prejudgment interest.goya foods,civ,unpublished opinion.a second appeal followed.we consolidated the two appeals for briefing and oral argument.
our analysis is divided into three parts.we start by grappling with the thorny issue of whether the unperfected november orders survived the entry of judgment in november.next,we address the other aspects of the district court finding of contempt.finally,we review the assessment of a monetary sanction and the award of prejudgment interest.
ii.the november orders 
the crux of these appeals is whether the november orders precluding the transfer of the apartment and the cooperative shares were legally effective against the appellants when rennert acquired the assets in june of.our starting point is the acknowledged power of a federal district court to issue orders providing for seizure of property for the purpose of securing satisfaction of the judgment ultimately to be entered in the action.by its terms,that rule allows a federal court to borrow provisional remedies created by state law.for this purpose,puerto rico is deemed the functional equivalent of a state,hmg prop.investors,parque indus.rio canas,cir.
following this paradigm,the court below made use of rule of the puerto rico rules of civil procedure,laws ann.app.iii.in pertinent part,that rule empowers a court,on an ex parte application,to issue provisional remedies that it deems necessary to secure satisfaction of an anticipated judgment.id.such remedies include an order of attachment or of prohibition to alienate.id.the rule then provides,however,that 
the attachment and prohibition to alienate real property shall be effected by recording them with the registry of property and notifying the defendant.in case of personal property,the order shall be carried out by depositing the personal property in question in court or with the person designated by it under the claimant responsibility.
the appellants appear to concede,at least tacitly,that the district court intended the november orders to secure goya potential recovery against charles unanue,and that those orders constituted legally binding restraints while goya case against charles and his ostensible straws including liliane was pending in the district court.the appellants maintain,however,that when the court entered final judgment in that case in november of their view,the stay of execution and the ensuing appeal make no provisional remedies envisioned by those orders lapsed because goya had not perfected them as required by rule.
this argument derives from the language of rule.focusing on the drafters use of the word shall,the appellants posit that the rule recordation and seizure requirements are obligatory.since the remedies granted by the district court the apartment and the cooperative shares were provisional and goya never properly perfected them it neither recorded the prohibition against alienation of the apartment nor ensured that the cooperative shares were physically seized and delivered to the court or some other properly designated custodian,the appellants argue that those remedies expired upon the entry of judgment and,thus,were no longer in effect some seven months later when rennert acquired the assets.
distilled to bare essence,we must determine the effect of goya failure to comply with the recordation and seizure requirements of rule prior to the district court entry of judgment.in the first instance,this is an abstract legal question.consequently,we afford de novo review.mccarthy azure,cir liberty mut.ins.comm l union ins,cir.
the district court held that strict compliance with the recordation and seizure requirements of rule was not necessary in every situation.goya foods,d at.at first blush,that holding squares with the core principle that undergirded our decision in hmg property investors.there,we noted that the supreme court of puerto rico has construed rule expansively 
rule of the rules of civil procedure confers upon the court sufficient flexibility to issue the measures which it deems necessary or convenient,according to the circumstances of the case,to secure the effectiveness of the judgments.its only limitation is that the measure be reasonable and adequate to the essential purpose of the same,which is to guarantee the effectiveness of the judgment which in due time may be rendered.this flexibility,so necessary for the administration of justice,is the greatest virtue of rule,virtue which we should promote and preserve instead of mystifying it with technical concepts and requirements.
at quoting rich super.as this passage evinces,and as we concluded in hmg property investors,flexibility is the hallmark of rule.
this emphasis on flexibility is important in considering how rule recordation and seizure requirements are intended to operate.at bottom,those requirements serve to protect the interests of innocent third parties,potential acquirers who come upon the scene unaware that property standing in a defendant name is subject to a priority lien.the recordation and seizure requirements enable such a third party,in the exercise of due diligence,to learn about attachments,restrictions on alienation,and other impediments to the passage of marketable title.see,laws.ann.explaining that one of the purposes of the puerto rico registry of property is to facilitate the recordation of judicial opinions which may affect the legal capacity of the owners of record.
we think it follows that if the raison of the recordation and seizure requirements is to furnish notice that specific property is subject to a restriction,the receipt of actual notice by a particular third party about the existence of that restriction satisfies the rule function as to that party.indeed,insisting upon strict compliance with the recordation and seizure requirements as to a third party possessing such knowledge would plunge the courts into the very vortex that the supreme court of puerto rico has endeavored to avoid.see rich,at warning against mystifying rule with technical concepts and requirements.
in this spirit,the puerto rico courts have demonstrated their readiness to look to the facts and circumstances of each case,as opposed to requiring unblinking,lockstep compliance with the recordation and seizure requirements of rule.the decision in freeman superior court,is a good example.there,corporate shareholders aspired to block a real estate transaction on the ground that the defendant was not authorized to act on the corporation behalf.id.at.they obtained an interlocutory order forbidding the parties to the transaction from consummating it and served the order on the affected parties.in an ensuing challenge,the supreme court of puerto rico construed the order as a prohibition against alienation and concluded that it had become effective as to the parties in interest at the moment that it was served upon them,notwithstanding the plaintiffs failure to record it.id.at.that order effectively and firmly secured the effectiveness of any judgment that thereafter might be entered in the plaintiffs favor.id.at.
the decision in suarez superior court,is cut from the same cloth.there,the trial court granted the plaintiff motion to freeze the defendant bank account.id.at.the plaintiff served the defendant with notice of the freeze order,but neither seized the account nor deposited the passbook into the registry of the court.id.at.on certiorari review,the supreme court of puerto rico determined that the order was of the nature of a prohibition to alienate under rule and upheld it as against the defendant who had actual notice.id.at.
freeman and suarez share three salient similarities.in each case,the movant the party procuring the prohibitory order failed to comply with rule recordation or seizure requirements.yet in each case,the movant timely apprised the complaining party of the provisional remedy.and,finally,in each case the supreme court of puerto rico overlooked the lack of strict compliance with the requirements of rule because the complaining party had received actual notice of the prohibition in a timeous fashion.
given these precedents,we decline to insist upon strict compliance here.as said,the underlying purpose of rule recordation and seizure requirements is to provide the present appellants plainly knew of the november orders well before they closed the transaction consequently,there is no reason why the failure to record the prohibition against alienation should blunt the legal force of the court orders the appellants.
the appellants attempt to convince us otherwise by reference to a pair of puerto rico cases in the first such case,stargus properties superior court,the trial court entered a standstill order effectuating the prohibition to dispose of,or any condemnation proceeding over the property object of this litigation.id.at.the defendants nonetheless sold a particular piece of property arguably affected by the order.even though the defendants claimed not to have known about the standstill order and the plaintiff could provide no proof of service,the trial court found them in contempt.id.at.
the puerto rico supreme court vacated the finding,concluding that the standstill order had not been entered or processed according to the provisions of rule of the rules of civil procedure.id.at.in so holding,the court enumerated the order myriad defects,including the fact that it had been issued sua sponte that it completely failed to describe any specific properties that the plaintiffs had neglected to record the order in the registry of property and that,in all events,the plaintiffs had not posted a proper bond.id.at.these combined infirmities were so severe that it is difficult,if not impossible,to argue that the court attached decretory significance to the failure to record,standing alone.we conclude,therefore,that stargus is sui generis,and that the decision does not stand for the broad proposition that the puerto rico supreme court always insists upon strict compliance with the recordation and seizure requirements of rule.
the appellants second case,cooperativa central flores,involved an attachment of commercial goods owned by a merchant defendant.pursuant to the trial court order,a marshal inventoried the goods in the defendant shop and designated a depository.id.at.the court subsequently ordered the goods sold at public auction.id.at.the supreme court of puerto rico halted the sale and voided the attachment on the ground that the goods were not in custodia legis and,therefore,not properly seized because the marshal lacked the authority to designate a depository.id.at.whatever flores may teach as to how attachments of fungible goods must be matter on which we take no do not read the decision as mandating,without exception,strict compliance with rule.indeed,it seems safe to conclude that the puerto rico supreme court subsequent decision in suarez,plainly relaxing rule technical seizure requirements,at,trumps the appellants proposed reading of flores.
to sum up,stargus and flores can not bear the weight that the appellants pile upon them.the case law teaches that strict compliance with the recordation and seizure requirements of rule is not essential in every case.nor do we discern any other colorable argument supporting the appellants position that the provisional remedies expired upon the district court entry of judgment.while interlocutory orders sometimes may merge into a judgment,john insulation,addison,cir,it is unreasonable to assume that any such merger occurred here.after all,timely appeals ensued,and the district court specifically stayed the execution of the judgment pending the completion of those appeals goya foods.at.in a practical sense,the judgment rendered by the district court was not final until the availability of appeal was exhausted.griffith kentucky,d.
that ends this aspect of the matter.we reject the appellants call for a mechanical construction of rule in favor of a flexible construction that recognizes the practicalities and the equities of individual situations.following that path,we hold that a failure to comply with the recordation seizure requirements of rule,without more,does not render a court order containing a prohibition against alienation invalid as to a third party with actual notice of the terms of that restraint.given the idiosyncratic circumstances of this the appellants patent knowledge of the november orders and goya lack of a route for fulfilling rule recordation and seizure requirements we conclude that,even after the entry of judgment,the november orders continued to safeguard goya contingent interest in charles assets as to persons having actual knowledge of those orders,and that the apartment and the cooperative shares remained subject to those orders when the appellants participated in the june transaction.
iii.civil contempt 
we next address whether the district court findings of civil contempt were properly grounded.this assessment employs multiple standards of review.we scrutinize the lower court factfinding for clear error.project kemp,cir.withal,we evaluate its ultimate finding on contempt for abuse of discretion,approaching that inquiry flexibly,with due regard for the circumstances.langton johnston,cir.in performing that tamisage,we remain mindful that an error of law is the functional equivalent of an abuse of discretion.in re grand jury subpoena,cir.
the fact that the appellants were not parties to goya suit against the unanues does not inoculate them against charges of civil contempt.nonparties may be liable for civil contempt notwithstanding their nonparty status.see microsystems software,scandinavia online ab,cir merriam webster dictionary,cir.the critical datum is whether the nonparty was in active concert or participation with the party specifically enjoined.microsystems,at.to satisfy that criterion,the nonparty must be legally identified with that defendant,or,at least,deemed to have aided and abetted that defendant in the enjoined conduct.id.
here,the district court rested its contempt finding upon an aiding and abetting theory.the legal underpinning of such a theory is impeccable it has long been recognized that a nonparty may be held in civil contempt if,and to the extent that,he knowingly aids or abets an enjoined party in transgressing a court order.see,gemco latinoamérica,seiko time,cir.the question,then,reduces to whether the district court deployment of the theory finds sufficient footing in the record.
there are two elements essential to invocation of this theory.the first is state of mind a nonparty must know of the judicial decree,and nonetheless act in defiance of it.the second is legal identification the challenged action must be taken for the benefit of,or to assist,a party subject to the decree.here,both elements are foregone conclusions.
it can not be gainsaid that each of the appellants had actual knowledge of the november orders.see supra note.this constitutes a solid foundation for the district court finding that the appellants possessed the requisite state of mind to trigger civil contempt liability.
the appellants attempt to confess and avoid.they admit knowledge of the november orders,but asseverate that they lacked the requisite state of mind because they honestly believed that those orders had lapsed.this asseveration is unpersuasive.
when a legitimate question exists as to the scope or effectiveness of a court order,those who know of the decree,yet act unilaterally,assume the risk of mistaken judgments.see infusaid intermedics infusaid,cir emphasizing that a party who harbors doubt about the lawfulness of a proposed course of action always can ask the district court for guidance.adhering to this principle,the appellants could have asked the district court for clarification as to the enduring vitality of the november orders,but they eschewed that course.they chose instead to rely on their own judgment as to whether the orders remained in effect.in so doing,the appellants acted at their peril.see mccomb jacksonville paper.
the identification element is similarly.liliane unanue was a party to the underlying action and,thus,a person subject to the november orders.the record here permits no reasonable conclusion but that the appellants aided and abetted liliane violation of those orders.after all,each of the three appellants played an essential role in consummating the forbidden transaction.wallack management offered the apartment for sale,located a purchaser,and shepherded the transaction to its climax.park facilitated the sale by placing its imprimatur on the transfer of the apartment and the cooperative shares.rennert purchased the apartment and the shares from liliane,and executed an indemnity agreement in order to induce others to approve the transaction.in view of these actions,we must uphold the district court finding that each of the appellants knowingly aided and abetted a party liliane unanue defiance of the november orders.
given the foregoing,the conclusion seems inescapable that the appellants are susceptible to liability for civil contempt.the appellants nonetheless attempt to refute this conclusion,protesting that they acted throughout in good faith.the district court gave this protestation short shrift,and so do we.
the law is firmly established in this circuit that good faith is not a defense to civil contempt.star fin,aastar mortgage,cir accord mccomb,at.an act does not cease to be a violation of a law and of a decree merely because it may have been done innocently.the appellants fail to advance any sound reason why this rule should not apply to nonparties.for our part,we perceive no principled basis for allowing nonparties but not parties to invoke a defense.we hold,therefore,that nonparties are not entitled to raise a defense in a civil contempt proceeding.
in a related vein,the appellants note that a contempt finding will not lie unless the putative contemnor violates a court order that is clear and unambiguous.kemp,at.starting from this premise,the appellants contend that the uncertainty surrounding the effectiveness of the november orders prevents goya from fulfilling this requirement.their contention is wide of the mark.
the test is whether the putative contemnor is able to ascertain from the four corners of the order precisely what acts are forbidden.gilday dubois,cir citation omitted.focusing the test within the four corners of a document limits the inquiry to an examination of that document text,united states anderson,cir.thus,the clear and unambiguous standard applies to the language of the relevant court order,not to its effectiveness.see star fin,at concentrating on the unequivocal language of the relevant order.this is as it should be.were we to honor the appellants cobbling together a plausible legal argument about the effectiveness of an order renders the order unclear or ambiguous for contempt would contradict our precedents emphasizing that the clear and unambiguous inquiry is limited to the four corners of the order itself.consequently,we reject the appellants attempt to widen the lens of this inquiry to include uncertainties about the legal efficacy of the november orders apart from those that might be inherent in the language of the orders.
turning to the language of the orders,it is difficult to imagine how the november orders could have been worded in a clearer,more unambiguous way.those ukases plainly forbade not only the unanues but also their agents,employees,and all persons acting in concert with them from alienating or in any way assigning,transferring,selling,or otherwise disposing or encumbering the apartment,including the cooperative shares associated therewith.this language leaves no room for doubt as to what the court intended.
the last piece of the puzzle is the requirement that the moving party establish by clear and convincing evidence that the putative contemnor violated the relevant court order.kemp,at langton,at.here,the appellants left behind an extensive paper trail memorializing the events leading up to the transfer of the apartment and the shares,and that documentary array constitutes overwhelming proof that they knowingly participated in a transaction expressly prohibited by the november orders.
the appellants do not seriously question this conclusion,but,rather,insist that the lower court was obliged to hold an evidentiary hearing before it could find,by clear and convincing evidence,that the appellants had abridged the november orders.this insistence is misplaced.in conjunction with the order,goya introduced documentary evidence that established what the appellants knew,when they knew it,and the nature of the various actions that they took the appellants failed to contradict this evidence.the record,therefore,disclosed no genuine issue of material fact as to the appellants roles.given that void,an evidentiary hearing would have been a waste of time.see parole,cir explaining that a party has a right to an evidentiary hearing in a civil contempt proceeding only if,and to the extent that,genuine issues of material fact exist.
that ends our discussion of the liability issue.for the reasons elucidated above,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding the appellants in civil contempt.
iv.contempt sanctions 
the court below initiated the civil contempt proceeding under its inherent power.see shillitani united states,d.its authority to assess a sanction for contempt derives from the same source.roadway express,piper,d.a trial court has wide discretion in its choice of sanctions.ray eyster in re orthopedic bone screw prods.liab.litig,cir.once the trial court has chosen a particular sanction,appellate review is for abuse of discretion.eeoc local of sheet metal workers int l ass n,cir hosp.trust bank howard communications,cir.when money is the sanction of choice,the abuse of discretion standard pertains not only to the trial court selection of the sanction but also to its quantification of the award.rolex watch,crowley,cir eck dodge chem.in re power recovery,cir.
federal courts are empowered to issue civil contempt sanctions to protect the due and orderly administration of justice and maintain the authority and dignity of the court.roadway express,at.in a civil contempt proceeding,a monetary sanction,assessed for the purpose of compensating the complainant for losses sustained by reason of the contemnor acts,is within the universe of permissible sanctions.see united states united mine workers.thus,relief is a commonplace sanction for civil contempt.so too are normal embellishments such as attorneys fees and costs.merriam,at.
the amount of an award of relief,like the amount of any monetary sanction that is remedial in nature,can not be plucked out of thin air.the amount of such a sanction must be established by competent evidence,and must bear a reasonable relationship to the actual losses sustained by the injured party.united mine workers,at.
in this case,the lower court crafted a sanction with the evident purpose of compensating the complainant for losses sustained in consequence of the contemnors violation of the november court orders.to be specific,the court assessed a compensatory sanction in the amount of the price paid for the apartment,and then tacked on roughly in prejudgment interest.as we explain below,the peculiar path that the court took in arriving at the latter figure needlessly complicated the matter.
we take first things first.the appellants argument that the base amount assessed was inherently speculative,or grossly excessive,or both,is without merit.we rejected a similar argument in gemco latinoamérica,a case in which a nonparty bank had helped to arrange payments that violated an outstanding attachment.at.the district court held the bank in civil contempt and imposed a sanction in the form of money damages.id.we affirmed both the court choice of a monetary sanction and its use of the funds that had been diverted as a measure of the amount.id.at.in reaching this result,we explained that the bank facilitative role made it responsible for the full effect of the dissipated funds.id.at.that precedent is instructive here.
goya held a valid judgment against charles unanue,and the district court had determined,in a decision since affirmed by this court,that the judgment could be partially enforced by levying against the apartment and the cooperative shares.goya opportunity to execute against those assets was frustrated by the surreptitious sale and the subsequent transfer of the lion share of the proceeds to a swiss bank account.the appellants each played a facilitative role in consummating that forbidden transaction.under the circumstances,the value of the vanished assets,as reflected by the purchase price actually paid in the contumacious transaction,strikes us as an equitable yardstick for measuring goya loss.see id.at,calculating damages for contemnor illegal seizure of store inventory based upon purchase price offered by a willing buyer engine specialties,bombardier,cir basing monetary contempt sanction upon contemnor actual sales.we hold,therefore,that the district court acted well within the realm of its discretion in awarding goya the base sum of.
this leaves the question of prejudgment interest.if the purpose of remedial contempt sanctions is to make an aggrieved party whole,then it follows that a court should be able to fashion sanctions that take into account not only the actual loss stemming from the contumacious conduct but also the time value of any associated deprivation of funds.accordingly,we hold that prejudgment interest,as a theoretical matter,is an acceptable component of a remedial sanction for civil contempt.see generally mccomb,at.the measure of the court power in civil contempt proceedings is determined by the requirements of full remedial relief.
despite this holding,the award of prejudgment interest,as rendered in the case at bar,is problematic.the court opted to apply puerto rico prejudgment interest rule,laws ann.app.iii,b,lock,stock,and barrel to determine whether prejudgment interest should be granted,and if so,in what amount.in charting this course,the court seems to have lost sight of the fact that it was operating under the aegis of its inherent power,and instead approached the sanctions issue as if it were issuing an award of damages in,say,a tort action.
the genesis of this decision is not clear.we note,however,that the original action was brought by goya under the court diversity jurisdiction.see a.we think it likely,therefore,that the district court relied upon precedents teaching that,in diversity cases,state law determines whether and how much interest should be awarded.fratus republic ins,cir see also comm l union ins.walbrook ins,cir stating that a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction ordinarily should apply the law that a local court sitting in the forum state would deem controlling in respect to prejudgment interest.
the difficulty is that the fratus rule is inapposite here.given that the district court convened the contempt proceeding under its inherent power,the court was free to award prejudgment interest as part and parcel of the contempt sanction,or to decline to do so,as a matter of federal law.the puerto rico rule simply was not controlling 
the beacon by which we must steer is the supreme court decision in chambers nasco,d.there,the district court,sitting in diversity jurisdiction,invoked its inherent power and assessed attorneys fees as a sanction for conduct during the litigation.id.at.before the supreme court,the sanctioned party contended that the trial judge was not free to order the payment of attorneys fees as a sanction for conduct unless applicable state law recognized such a praxis.the court rejected this contention,explaining that since the trial judge based the fee award on the sanctioned party conduct during the course of the litigation,the use of federal law as the source of authority for the award did not contravene the erie principle.id.at.citing erie tompkins.extrapolating from chambers,we hold that when a federal district court sits in diversity jurisdiction,its inherent power to impose monetary sanctions for contumacious conduct during the course of litigation is not circumscribed by the forum state law regarding the imposition of sanctions.accord people by abrams terry,cir.we see no reason why this principle should not apply ex proprio vigore to prejudgment interest when such an award is imposed as part of a civil contempt sanction in a federal district court.
based on the foregoing,we decline the parties joint invitation to confront the difficult,nuanced question of whether the facts of record here bring this case within the confines of rule b.rather,we strike the district court award of prejudgment interest under that rule.but we do not stop there.although the district court employed the wrong vehicle en route to an award of prejudgment interest,it plainly intended to afford relief by taking into account,to some extent,the time value of money.under the circumstances,and in fairness to the parties,we think that the court is entitled to reconsider the question of remedies in light of our holding.
we view the district court options as broad.on the one hand,it may decide to leave well enough alone is,after all,a substantial amount of money.on the other hand,it may decide that the equities counsel in favor of some increase in the base award to compensate goya for the time value of the vanished purchase price.the parties have not briefed these issues,and we believe that it should be open to them and to the lower court,on remand,to explore such potential modifications to the judgment,fdic consol.mortgage fin,cir remanding issue neither briefed nor argued on appeal for further consideration.
conclusion 
we need go no further.for the reasons stated,we affirm the judgment in part,vacate it in part,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.as to those anticipated proceedings,we intimate no view of either the propriety or the wisdom of any particular outcome.
affirmed in part,vacated in part,and remanded.costs are taxed in favor of the appellee.
a cooperative apartment is one that is owned by a corporation the cooperative.the ownership interest in the apartment is held and conveyed in the form of shares in the corporation known as cooperative shares.a shareholder right to occupy the particular apartment that he or she owns derives from a proprietary lease entered into between the corporation qua landlord and the shareholder qua tenant.
this conclusion was not.the attorney originally retained by liliane bowed out of the transaction based on his belief that the proposed sale would,if consummated,violate the november orders.
the district court also stated that it would grant attorneys fees to goya,see goya foods,d at,but the record on appeal contains no indication that a fee award has eventuated.in all events,these appeals do not raise any issues anent attorneys fees.
in december,goya sent via certified mail copies of the november orders,accompanied by an explanation of the legal context surrounding them,to park and wallack management.while no such mailing was directed to did not know of his existence until well after he had acquired the has acknowledged that he too received copies of the orders sometime in or early.to cinch matters,the district court found that each of the appellants received timely notice of its decision holding that charles was the beneficial owner of the cooperative shares and,thus,of the apartment,goya fo
