capital tax corporation capital tax is an illinois company that purchases distressed real estate properties and resells them for profit.at a cook county scavenger sale in october,capital tax successfully bid on tax certificates to a derelict paint factory on the south side of chicago.capital tax claims that it then entered into an agreement to sell the property to a man named mervyn dukatt.pursuant to this alleged contract,capital tax exercised its option on the tax deed and delivered possession of the property to dukatt.capital tax retained legal title to the property,however,as security for the remainder of the purchase price.dukatt never made another payment,leaving capital tax with title to an unwanted property.
both the chicago department of the environment cdoe and the environmental protection agency epa were called to the old paint factory after receiving complaints that toxic paint products were leaking out of the factory into nearby streets and sewers.the inspections revealed thousands of rusty and leaking barrels containing hazardous waste.the epa ordered capital tax to dispose of the waste but capital tax refused the epa cleaned up the site itself.the government then brought this suit under section a of the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act of cercla for the response costs it incurred.see a.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the government on both liability and damages.capital tax now appeals,raising two basic arguments.first,it claims that it is not liable under cercla because it is not the owner of the facility.second,even if it is liable,capital tax claims that it is only responsible for the cleanup of the parcels it owned.
the hazardous waste site facility at issue in the present case is an old paint manufacturing facility located at south green street in chicago,illinois.for many years,this facility was operated by the national lacquer and paint company,which produced paint products and stored the chemicals and materials used to produce them.this facility,which we call the national lacquer site,consists of four buildings,two buildings and two yards it is situated on one acre of land in a mixed industrial,commercial and residential area of chicago.although the site is now divided into seven parcels parcels,and,it was historically operated as a single plant when viewed on a map,the seven rectangular parcels are stacked neatly on top of one another.each parcel is connected to the others by a fire door or passageway,and several of the parcels share common yards.
in december,william lerch and steven pedi,through their newly created company,national lacquer company national lacquer,purchased the assets of the old national lacquer and paint company.from to,national lacquer reclaimed paint,manufactured paints and coatings,and performed furniture stripping operations at the site.the company used a number of different hazardous materials,which were stored all over the site it is undisputed that hazardous materials leaked or were spilled onto the ground throughout this period.in january,for example,the cdoe inspected the site and found hundreds of rusty,damaged and leaking pails,cans and jars.not only were these paint products spilling onto the floor,rainwater from a leaky roof mixed with the paint and flowed across the floor into drains and sewers and eventually into the street.
by,national lacquer had fallen behind on its property taxes,and cook county made five of the seven parcels available for sale pedi retained title to parcels and.at tax scavenger sales,potential buyers bid on the delinquent taxes,and the winning bidder receives a tax certificate for the property.if the original owner fails to redeem the delinquent taxes within a statutory period,the tax sale bidder then has the right to petition for a tax deed to the property.tax certificates do not pass title they are similar to an option to later obtain title if the certificate holder chooses to exercise that option.representatives of capital tax visited the national lacquer site before the scavenger sale and conducted a limited inspection.while they were not able to enter the property,it was apparent to them that the property was a former paint factory.capital tax then successfully bid on the tax certificates.
after purchasing the tax certificates but before obtaining the tax deeds,capital tax claims that it struck a deal with dukatt in which capital tax agreed to obtain the tax deeds to the property and to convey them to dukatt in exchange for about.no written agreement was ever made.because capital tax did not typically obtain the tax deeds until they had a buyer,dukatt gave capital tax a check ostensibly as partial payment for the property.on october,capital tax obtained tax deeds for four of the parcels.on february,it obtained a tax deed for the fifth parcel.capital tax also obtained an order of eviction to secure possession of the site from its previous owner,lerch after that,capital tax had very little to do with the property.
dukatt,however,was frequently at the site.he had the keys to the property and the office.capital tax deferred to him on all matters regarding the site.dukatt hired workers who,over the course of two or three weeks,cut up and removed the paint machines that had been in the garage.they also prepared and replaced an overhead door and knocked down two walls.this work allegedly cost dukatt.in april,the cdoe responded to a call concerning a spill of hazardous materials at the site.it discovered that paint containers had recently been moved from parcel to parcel trails of spilled product traced the movement of these substances.it is unclear whether it was dukatt,lerch or perhaps a third party who moved the containers.the cdoe,however,noted that capital tax had made little effort to secure the site and it issued capital tax a notice of violation for allowing a spill of hazardous substances due to container movement at the site.on july,the cdoe officially requested that capital tax clean up the site.capital tax refused.it later explained that it did care about the site because it considered it to be dukatt problem.
the cdoe referred the matter to the epa.on july,the epa conducted its own inspection of the site.the epa found more than containers of various sizes,including gallon drums,storage tanks,cylindrical mixing tanks,vats,buckets,compressed gas cylinders,laboratory jars and of which contained hazardous substances.many of the containers were unsealed,leaking or otherwise deteriorating.the epa also found evidence of trespassing on the site.on august,the epa issued a unilateral administrative order uao demanding that capital tax clean its five parcels.capital tax did not comply.so,on october,the epa removed the hazardous materials itself.the epa also cleaned manholes and pits,excavated the top foot of storage yard soil,backfilled and planted the storage yard with grass.it sealed the tanks and pressure washed interior floors and walls to remove potential contamination.
the government then filed suit against capital tax,pedi and lerch under cercla to recover the costs of the cleanup.the government also sought civil penalties,see b,and punitive damages,see c,against capital tax for failing to comply with the uaos.capital tax denied that it was liable under cercla,raising the security interest exemption under a and an innocent landowner defense under b.on april,the government moved for partial summary judgment on liability,which the district court granted.on august,the government moved for summary judgment on damages,which the district court also granted,finding capital tax jointly and severally liable to the government for in response costs.it also assessed civil penalties in the amount of.
the first major issue here is capital tax liability under a of cercla for the response costs incurred by the government in the cleanup of the national lacquer site.under a,the government may order potentially responsible parties to clean up hazardous waste sites.further,under a,the government is authorized to conduct its own cleanups of hazardous waste sites using the hazardous waste superfund.the government can then bring an action under a to recover damages from potentially responsible parties.see a.in either case,the polluter pays.united states burlington northern,santa fe ry,cir.
to establish liability under a,the government must show that the site in question is a facility as defined in the the defendant is a responsible party under a a release or a threatened release of a hazardous substance has occurred and the release or threatened release has caused the plaintiff to incur response costs.chem.lefton iron metal,cir.capital tax concedes three of these elements the only element in issue here is the second element whether capital tax is a responsible party under a.
cercla is strict liability statute.see nutrasweet eng g,cir.liability is imposed when a party is found to have a statutorily defined connection with the facility that connection makes the party responsible regardless of causation.see united states hercules,cir.section a lists four different categories of potentially responsible parties.see a.the only category in issue here is specified by a,which makes the current owner and operator of a facility liable for cleanup costs.see a.the government has not claimed in this court that capital tax operated the facility in any way.thus,the government argument is that capital tax is liable for response costs simply because it is the current owner of the facility.a.
there is very little we can glean from the statute about the meaning of ownership.cercla defines owner as any person owning a facility.a.the circularity in the statutory language suggests that the statutory terms have their ordinary meanings rather than unusual or technical meanings.sidney arst pipefitters welfare educ.fund,cir.the generality of the term of the term owner also suggests that congress intended us to turn to common law analogies.edward hines lumber vulcan materials,cir.congress did state,however,that the definition of owner does not include a person who,without participating in the management of a facility,holds indicia of ownership primarily to protect his security interest in the vessel or facility.a emphasis added.a security interest is a right under a mortgage,deed of trust,assignment,judgment lien,pledge,security agreement,factoring agreement,or lease and any other right accruing to a person to secure the repayment of money,the performance of a duty,or any other obligation by a nonaffiliated person.g vi.this has become known as the security interest exclusion,and the party seeking to assert it bears the burden of establishing it.see monarch tile,city of florence,cir.
the government claims that capital tax is the owner under a because it holds legal title to five of the seven parcels at the national lacquer site.capital tax does not dispute that it has legal title to those parcels and thus holds indicia of ownership.capital tax contends,however,that it sold the parcels to dukatt.according to capital tax,it only holds legal title to the property as security for the balance of the purchase price under the contract.see a.the district court rejected this argument.it emphasized that capital tax had not taken the title in order to secure a loan.indeed,as the district court noted,capital tax had never loaned money to dukatt,not pedi and not lerch.because capital tax was not a lender,the district court reasoned,its interest in the property was not a security interest.
we agree with the district court that capital tax argument is sometimes confusing.but the basic legal principle underlying capital tax equitable ownership passed from capital tax to dukatt when the land sale contract was a long history at common law.the rule in the vast majority of jurisdictions is that on entering into a contract for the purchase of land,the purchaser is the owner in equity of the land,and the seller holds legal title as security for payment of the purchase price.richard lord,williston on contracts ed.echoing this rule,we have held in the bankruptcy context that an installment land sales contract is merely a security agreement where the vendor holds legal title in trust solely as security for the payment of the purchase price.in re streets beard farm partnership,cir applying illinois law.perhaps capital tax constant reference to the security interest exception has caused some confusion here,for capital tax is not a typical creditor capital tax argument would be more easily understood if it simply argued that it is the former owner of the the current thus not liable under a.this,of course,is a classic equitable conversion argument.although there might be some merit in the district court conclusion that capital tax is not a secured creditor,we think the more appropriate methodology under the particular facts presented here is to address the issue under the ownership provision of a.
the central question here is what role,if any,the doctrine of equitable conversion plays in the definition of ownership under cercla.as we have already explained,the statute gives little concrete guidance on the issue.congress intended courts,in defining a,to draw analogies to common law,see edward hines,at,and to the ordinary meaning of the term ownership,see sidney arst,at.it is notable that two courts of appeals have held that public or companies that hold legal title to property in order to secure the recoupment of development costs are not owners under cercla.see monarch tile,at in re bergsoe,at.more specifically,a number of district courts have applied the doctrine of equitable conversion in cercla cases,both under a ownership provision and under the security interest exclusion.see,united states union,d.reade,d.united states wedzeb,snediker devs.evans.thus,it is difficult to dismiss capital tax argument out of hand.
so we must determine whether,in applying the doctrine of equitable conversion in the cercla context,we should attempt to fashion our own federal rule or look to applicable illinois law as the federal standard.see united states kimbell foods,d.there is no need to escalate the scope of the inquiry by attempting to apply a federal common law here instead,we merely look to state law for guidance in interpreting the statute.of course,federal law,as a formal matter,ultimately governs the definition of ownership under a.id.at,d.but this case presents a particularly strong case for the employment of relevant state law as the proper guide to the federal standard.redwing carriers,saraland apartments,cir adopting state partnership law as the federal standard to determine ownership under cercla.property relations have historically been governed by state law.see,butner united states,d oregon ex rel.state land board corvallis sand gravel,d.when congress instructed courts to look to the traditional,meaning of ownership in interpreting cercla,it was certainly aware of this history.and congress gave no indication that it intended to take a new course.united states bestfoods,d nothing in cercla purports to reject this bedrock principle of corporate law,and against this venerable backdrop,the congressional silence is audible.the understanding that state law governs property and the expectations built around that understanding strongly suggest that the federal standard should be rooted in an adoption of state property law.this conclusion is bolstered by the fact that there is no practical alternative to this approach.to invent out of whole cloth a distinctly federal law of property would be inappropriate,if not impossible 
the illinois doctrine of equitable conversion provides that a valid land sale agreement transfers equitable title to the purchaser.see shay penrose.thus,when the owner enters into a valid and enforceable contract for the sale of realty,the seller continues to hold legal title,but in trust for the buyer the buyer becomes the equitable owner and holds the purchase money in trust for the seller.in re estate of martinek,d.but t he doctrine of equitable conversion does not apply where equitable considerations intervene or where the parties intend otherwise.eade brownlee.in addition,in order to invoke the doctrine of equitable conversion,the party must show that a valid and enforceable contract has bee
