backgrounda.
in september of,marvin tyrer purchased residential property in the city of south beloit,illinois.the house on this property had been built in the early,prior to the enactment of city ordinances regulating minimum lot size,setbacks and minimum flood plain elevation requirements.although the house did not comply with these regulations,it was deemed by the city to be a legally nonconforming structure because it had been built lawfully prior to the passage of the ordinances.
the city zoning ordinances provide that,if a legally nonconforming structure is damaged,destroyed or substantially changed,it no longer is exempted from current zoning laws.under these circumstances,the owner must apply for a variance.shortly before tyrer purchased the property,its previous owner had applied for and received a variance in order to remodel and add onto the house.
when tyrer purchased the property in september,no work had begun on these projects.in the spring of,with the intent of carrying out the previous owner building plans,tyrer obtained the required building permits and commenced construction.after installing the walls,footings and foundation for the addition,tyrer was informed that,to be in compliance with city ordinances,he needed to obtain additional fill for the purpose of covering the footings above the frost line.tyrer complied with this request.in november,however,a building inspector discovered that the additional fill was causing excess onto neighbors property and that tyrer had exceeded the scope of his work permit.
the city clerk issued a cease and desist order in november.tyrer protested the order,but he ultimately was forced to halt construction.the city then issued a notice of demolition on january,pursuant to ilcs.
on january,the parties met at city hall and attempted to resolve their dispute.at this meeting,tyrer presented building plans that he claimed would resolve the problem and bring the house into compliance with city ordinances.the city disputed this claim.its architect opined that his proposed plans would not eliminate the excess drainage on neighboring properties and that,instead,the entire structure had to be torn down and the fill removed.the zoning board of appeals ultimately rejected tyrer plans,as well as his subsequent petition for a variance.
state court proceedings 
in april,tyrer filed suit against the city of south beloit in the circuit court of winnebago county,illinois.he alleged that the cease and desist order and the demolition order had deprived him of a property interest without due process of law he also sought to enjoin the city from demolishing or further interfering with the use of his property.he amended his complaint in september to add a second count,alleging that the city actions constituted a regulatory or temporary taking of his property that warranted just compensation under the fifth and fourteenth amendments.the city filed an answer as well as a counterclaim in which it sought authorization to demolish the house.
in may,the city filed a motion for summary judgment.it contended that no work had been done on the house since the beginning of the dispute between the city and tyrer,and that from the fill now was draining into the yards of neighbors.in the city view,because the house was in a dangerous condition,demolition was proper according to ilcs.the city also submitted,however,that,if tyrer would agree to remove the fill,it would permit him to continue with construction even though the project exceeded the scope of the original permit.tyrer did not acknowledge this offer,but he instead filed his own motion for summary judgment on his fifth and fourteenth amendment claims.
on may,the state trial court denied tyrer motion for summary judgment on the takings claim and granted the city summary judgment on its demolition counterclaim.the court determined that the structure had lost its legal nonconforming status and that it did not meet city building requirements.it invited tyrer to submit a plan for demolition and noted that,if he did not,it would enter an order for the city allowing demolition.tyrer did not submit such a plan and,on august,the court issued a final order authorizing demolition.before the entry of the august order,however,the city already had demolished the house.
tyrer appealed the judgment of the state trial court.he challenged both the trial court demolition order and its denial of summary judgment on his takings claim.noting that tyrer had failed to file a motion to stay the demolition,the illinois appellate court held that tyrer challenge to the demolition order was moot because the house already had been destroyed therefore,effective relief was precluded.the court remarked,however,that the demolition raises other legal issues,which may be presented by another proceeding.
the state appellate court also affirmed the denial of summary judgment on tyrer takings claim.it held that there was a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether tyrer architectural plans,as presented to the city council,would have resolved the alleged problem and complied with the defendant zoning ordinances.the court remanded for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.
after the case was remanded to the trial court,discovery proceeded.tyrer amended his complaint,adding a third count alleging that the actions of the city and its council members had deprived him of the use of his property from the date of the cease and desist order in violation of the fifth amendment takings clause and of the illinois constitution.this new count also added as defendants the city council members in their individual capacities.
federal court proceedings 
in august,tyrer filed an action against the city in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois.there,he alleged that the city demolition of his house lacked legal authorization and violated the fifth and fourteenth amendments due process clauses.he named both the city and the individual city council members as defendants.
in october,the city filed a motion asking that the district court abstain from further proceedings according to the colorado river abstention doctrine.see colorado river water conservation dist.united states,d.the district court first determined that the state and federal cases were parallel,noting that both cases arose out of substantially the same set of facts,and the legal issues were substantially the same.the court then considered whether the case involved the requisite exceptional circumstances necessary for a federal court to decline to exercise its jurisdiction.noting that the state proceedings had been ongoing for more than four years at that point,that the plaintiff could effectively litigate his claims in state court,and that allowing both suits to proceed concurrently would promote piecemeal and duplicative litigation,the district court concluded that a stay was appropriate in this case.therefore,the district court stayed the federal proceedings pending final disposition of the state court action.
tyrer appealed the district court stay order.in tyrer i,we affirmed the decision of the district court.we noted that the two suits,though not stating identical claims,were parallel they involved the same parties,the same factual situation,the same evidence and very similar cl
