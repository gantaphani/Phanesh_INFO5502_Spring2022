this appeal presents the latest phase of the litigation over racial discrimination in public housing in chicago that bears dorothy gautreaux name.see gautreaux chicago housing auth.cha.gautreaux i finding the cha liable for racial discrimination in policy and tenant assignment gautreaux cha.gautreaux ii entering remedial order.it concerns the district court decision to grant attorneys fees to the plaintiffs attorneys for work they did between august,and july.the cha,which is responsible for the fees,argues that this court should reverse that order.it starts from the premise that the proceedings before the district court ought to be treated as litigation.when seen in that light,the cha continues,the proceedings did not result in the kind of victory for plaintiffs that would make them prevailing parties entitled to fees.in the alternative,the cha urges us to find that even if plaintiffs are entitled to some fees,the district court abused its discretion in the award it granted.we conclude that even if the link between these proceedings and earlier parts of the case is broken,the plaintiffs nonetheless prevailed,and the district court did not abuse its discretion with this fee award.we therefore affirm.
for present purposes,all that is necessary is a summary of the history of the case.more than four decades ago,dorothy gautreaux and other tenants who lived in public housing projects,along with applicants for public housing,sued the cha,claiming that its policies with respect to the selection of sites for public housing and for assignment of tenants were racially discriminatory.the plaintiffs prevailed,see gautreaux i,supra,and the district court entered a remedial decree that was designed to ban racially discriminatory site selection and tenant assignment policies and to undo the harm that had already occurred.see gautreaux ii,supra.central to the remedial decree was the requirement that for every unit built in an area where the population was more than limited areas,the cha had to construct three housing units in an area where the population was less than general area.see gautreaux ii.at.the ratio was later modified to.see gautreaux cha,cir.the gautreaux ii remedial order also limited new construction of public apartments that had more than three floors and required changes to tenant assignment practices.gautreaux ii.at.the order did not,however,require the construction of any new housing.
the cha reacted to gautreaux ii by instituting a virtual moratorium on the construction of new housing that lasted years.at the plaintiffs behest,in the district court appointed daniel levin and the habitat company as a receiver for the development of all new housing for the cha.see gautreaux pierce,order of.this indeed prompted some change the receiver built a number of public housing units,which were scattered throughout the general area.in the,in part because of the availability of federal funds through the hope vi program an acronym for homeownership and opportunity for people everywhere,see,repealed by,title v,a,stat,the cha developed plans to overhaul its public housing stock.
this culminated in with the cha announcement of the plan for transformation the plan,which the cha optimistically describes as a blueprint for positive change.the plan outlines how the cha proposes to replace all of chicago public housing projects with lower density developments.see summary.html last visited june.as cha executive director,terry peterson,explains,the centerpiece of the plan is the creation of new,communities on the sites and in the neighborhoods where cha ha s demolished the old these developments will allow public housing families to live in the same kind of housing and the same kind of neighborhoods as other chicagoans.
in deciding where to locate new construction that will benefit from hope vi funds and be subject to the plan,the cha has used the locations of the old projects almost exclusively.these were the same locations that were branded as racially isolated in gautreaux i.they fell within the limited areas,in which new construction was restricted by gautreaux ii.see gautreaux cha,at.in addition,some of the developments contemplated by the plan are buildings in which public housing units are located above the third floor.to avoid the gautreaux ii restrictions when spending federal dollars,the cha asked the district court in to clarify the judgment order and read it as not governing the use of hope vi funds.the court declined to do so instead,it concluded that any construction of public housing in cook county must conform to the judgment order locational requirements.gautreaux cha,d.other construction under the plan similarly has continued to operate within the restrictions of gautreaux ii remedial order.
the result of the continued application of the remedial order to this new construction was,as terry peterson attested,that t he gautreaux case presented a major obstacle to the plan for transformation u nless the judgment order was modified,the cha could not proceed with the plan.what the cha has had to do,in essence,is to negotiate new building plans with plaintiffs,whenever the plan would require something inconsistent with gautreaux ii.the plaintiffs have been cooperative.beginning with the redevelopment of the henry horner housing project on the city near west side in,the plaintiffs repeatedly have joined the cha in requests for waivers from the district court of various restrictions in its remedial decree,so that construction of replacement public housing units can go forward.
in these joint motions,the gautreaux plaintiffs have never conceded that the limits in the decree are no longer relevant.rather,they have taken a approach to waiver requests.for example,in proposing the waiver of gautreaux ii conditions for the horner redevelopment,plaintiffs asked the court to relax the site restrictions because they believed that a proposed redevelopment on and around the site offered the prospect of better housing conditions for plaintiff families in the near term as well as the possibility of racial integration in the future.after the horner redevelopment,plaintiffs have continued to join the cha in asking the district court to waive the remedial conditions,but only for redevelopment projects that present the right conditions and only with particular restrictions negotiated by the parties.
the agreed order arrived at by the parties to allow the horner revitalization to proceed in provided the model for much of what has occurred over the last decade,including the august,to july,period in which the attorneys fees at issue were accumulated.during those two years,the district court entered five orders,each of which was agreed to by the parties.the first four were,according to peterson,examples of the kind of orders that cha has sought from the gautreaux plaintiffs so that it could proceed with the plan.an order entered on september,waived the restrictions on units above the third story of any structure in four buildings and fourteen that were part of the redevelopment of the cabrini extension north housing project.an august,order modified gautreaux ii directives with respect to the tenant assignment plan,giving priority for housing in units to individuals and families displaced from their public housing units by the plan those units formerly had been earmarked for cha transfer and families.the september,order allowed the building of new housing on the sites of the former ida wells,darrow,and madden park projects in the north neighborhood.the december,order allowed the expansion of the horner revitalization area and the construction of an additional units of housing.it also modified the height restriction and released gautreaux funds to be used in the construction.finally,the order of march,revised the official list of cook county limited area census tracts.see gautreaux ii.at.
over the years,the gautreaux plaintiffs attorneys have requested attorneys fees on a number of occasions for their ongoing work on the case.since the judgment,the court has awarded fees on four occasions for the period from to,it awarded for hours of work for the period from through,it awarded million for the period from october,to september,it awarded and for the period between september,and july,plaintiffs attorneys received.
the present fee petition requested compensation for work done between august,and july.the district court concluded that the attorneys were entitled to in fees and in related expenses.in making this award,the district court reasoned that 
t he proceedings and related work for which fees are presently sought are not clearly separable from the original judgment order t his case involves work and proceedings that are all part of one active equitable case,in which compliance has always been at issue,and modifications and clarifications of the original judgment order must continuously be made to account for changing conditions and circumstances.
in addressing the reasonableness of the fees,the court found that the fees requested were comparable to the two prior agreed orders involving plaintiffs fees.it also found that the plaintiffs attorneys had appropriately eliminated certain duplicative expenses and had shown that the tasks they performed were within the scope of the consent decree and consistent with the earlier fee orders.finally,the court was satisfied that the proposed market rates were reasonable.as a result,it granted the requested fees and costs.
we begin by noting that,although this fee order may appear to be,since it is merely one in a line of similar such orders and nothing in the present record purports to be a final termination of the litigation,appellate jurisdiction is secure.it qualifies as a collateral order that is final for purposes of,because it finally determines the fee question for the period at issue.see cohen beneficial indus.loan.see also gautreaux cha,cir.our observation in alliance to end repression chicago,cir,is equally apt here another reason for allowing an immediate appeal is that a decree might never be dissolved,so that to treat fee awards as interlocutory might defer appeal to the end of time.id.at.nothing in sole wyner,d,casts doubt on these rules.sole dealt only with the question whether a party who had won a preliminary injunction but who had ultimately lost on the merits could be a prevailing party for purposes of fees.the court concluded that it could not,noting at the end of its opinion that it was expressing no view on the question whether,in the absence of a final decision on the merits of a claim for permanent injunctive relief,fees might sometimes be permissible.here,of course,the gautreaux plaintiffs did win permanent injunctive relief,albeit relief that has been modified from time to time,and the court order finally resolved the fee question for the defined period.we thus proceed to the merits of the appeal.
in general,we review a district court decision to award attorneys fees for abuse of discretion.king.state bd.of elections,cir.as the supreme court pointed out in cooter gell hartmarx,d,however,a district court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.id.at.our review of the underlying legal issues is de novo.see dupuy samuels,cir.here,we must decide whether the gautreaux plaintiffs still qualify as prevailing parties for purposes of,the statute that authorizes fees for successful civil rights plaintiffs.
under the traditional american rule,parties to a lawsuit bear their own costs.sole.at citing alyeska pipeline service wilderness society,d.in actions brought under,however,the court,in its discretion,may allow a prevailing party,other than the united states,a reasonable attorney fee as part of its costs.the district court concluded that,once again,the plaintiffs were prevailing parties entitled to attorneys fees.in its challenge to that finding,the cha argues that the supreme court decision in buckhannon bd.and care home,west virginia dep t of health and human,d,as well as this court ruling in alliance to end repression chicago,supra,require a ruling in its favor.
we agree with the cha that the supreme court decision in buckhannon throws some light on the issue before us,even though it does not directly control the outcome here,for it was a case in which no remedial order ever was entered by the district court.nonetheless,buckhannon reshaped litigation over attorneys fee awards.the narrow question before the court was whether the definition of prevailing party in included a plaintiff whose lawsuit was a catalyst that achieved the desired result because it brought about a voluntary change in the defendant conduct.at.the court concluded that this was not enough.instead,to be considered a prevailing party under a plaintiff needs to win a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties a defendant voluntary change in conduct,although perhaps accomplishing what the plaintiff sought to achieve by the lawsuit,lacks the necessary judicial imprimatur on the change.at.either an enforceable judgment on the merits or a settlement agreement enforced through a consent decree may qualify as the necessary change.following this logic,we have held that cases in which the terms of the settlement were incorporated into the dismissal order and the order was signed by the court rather than the parties,or the order provided that the court would retain jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the settlement,have a sufficient judicial imprimatur to entitle the plaintiff to status.petersen gibson,cir see also lagrange school dist,cir.
alliance applied buckhannon to postjudgment proceedings,where the underlying case resulted in the entry of an equitable decree.there,a consent decree limited the ability of the chicago police department to engage in surveillance of allegedly subversive activities.plaintiffs attorneys had asked for fees for legal services rendered in two failed proceedings for contempt,as well as an unsuccessful defense of the consent decree which wound up being modified.see at.this court overturned the district court fee award,rejecting plaintiffs argument that their initial victory in the litigation was enough to make them the prevailing party for the life of the decree.id.at.
alliance necessarily also rejected the argument that proceedings are inevitably part of only one active,equitable case.at least in the circumstances of alliance,we concluded instead that the particular proceedings before us had to be evaluated as litigation.we relied in part on buckhannon in coming to that conclusion.normally,postjudgment litigation in a complex equitable proceeding is better viewed as largely from the underlying case.this distinguishes efforts from unsuccessful motions made en route to the successful conclusion of a lawsuit,which can be compensated as indispensable inputs in a successful conclusion of litigation.at.in cases like alliance,the postjudgment proceedings,coming as they did so many years after the consent decree went into effect,are clearly separable from the proceeding that led up to the entry of the decree.id.
the district court here thought that it was enough that the proceedings for which the plaintiffs sought fees were not clearly separable from the original judgment order.after alliance,that strikes us as too lenient a standard.in any event,here as in alliance so many years have passed and so many modifications have been made to the decree,we conclude that we must look at the time period for which fees are being sought roughly through,as we noted earlier as freestanding litigation.the question before us is whether the gautreaux plaintiffs were correctly characterized as prevailing parties for that set of proceedings.
in arguing that the plaintiffs are not entitled to be regarded as having won anything notable,the cha focuses on the transformation of its relationship with the plaintiffs from one of opposition to one of cooperation.unlike the earlier periods for which the plaintiffs received fees,when the cha was actively fighting them,it now depicts the parties as essentially all on the same team.if this were actually the case,there would be a serious question whether any case or controversy remains to be decided.given our conclusion below that it is not,however,our jurisdiction is not threatened on this basis.
as the cha tells the story,whereas it once was obdurate,it now has scrupulously honored the terms of the judgment order and diligently sought modification of the judgment order so it could properly proceed with the plan although the cha can not make the legal claim that it is in the same position as the defendants in alliance,it makes the same claim rhetorically,casting the plaintiffs as defenders of an obsolete consent decree that serves almost no function.the cha submits that gautreaux plaintiffs only role was to simply acquiesce in getting out of the way.implicitly,the cha is saying that anything plaintiffs do to allow the cha to implement the plan can not amount to plaintiffs success on the merits.
the glaring difficulty for the cha,of course,is that it is not in the same position as the defendant chicago police in alliance,for it remains bound by the district court gautreaux ii remedial order.in alliance,the court found that by the time modification was sought,t he decree in its original form had accomplished its purpose and had become obsolete.alliance,at.here,in contrast,the cha motion to clarify the decree to reflect the changed circumstances was rejected.there has been no modification of the injunction and no showing as of the time the district court ruled here that the public housing system has been desegregated enough to warrant dissolution or modification of the decree.importantly,the cha has never requested such dissolution,even though it did seek clarification of the judgment in.this court has already commented on the fact that this option remains open to the cha.see gautreaux cha,at if cha is displeased with the injunction,the receivership order,or the recent district court orders flowing from them,then it should seek to modify or terminate any or all of them.as things stand now,we are not at liberty to treat the injunction as though it no longer exists.
gautreaux ii is still in effect,and the court five joint orders between august and july were shaped by the remedial decree.the cha makes two errors in arguing that the gautreaux plaintiffs gained nothing from any of the orders related to the limited area revitalization.the first mistake is the confusion of means and mistake that is apparent in the cha characterization of plaintiffs waiver of some of the dictates of gautreaux ii remedial order as relinquishing their own victory.what plaintiffs have sought all along is the desegregation of public housing in chicago.the gautreaux ii remedial order was nothing more than the means by which the district court believed,in,that such desegregation could be effected.the fact that the plaintiffs agreed to give up certain restrictions and that the court agreed to allow cha to fulfill its obligations through other means does not amount to a white flag from the plaintiffs.
instead,as the district court has recognized ever since it granted the first limited waiver of gautreaux ii restrictions for the horner revitalization in,opinions about how to desegregate public housing have changed over the plus years since the judgment.in addressing the proposed horner revitalization order,the court remarked that the proposal addresses a century view of the city of chicago and its housing problem as opposed to the view that was properly the view at the time of the filing of the gautreaux litigation.the court waivers of particular parts of the remedial decree rest on its being cognizant that the principal remedial purpose of the orders previously entered in these consolidated cases has been and is to provide plaintiff class families with desegregated housing opportunities.gautreaux cha,order of.in accordance with this goal,waivers have been entered under certain circumstances and for particular geographic areas.the court has allowed housing to be built in limited areas only upon a sufficient showing of revitalizing circumstances such that a responsible forecast of economic integration,with a longer term possibility of racial desegregation,could be made.gautreaux cha,order of june.these waivers have been agreed to because,in plaintiffs opinion,they offer a better chance of achieving what the gautreaux suit has always in public would rigid insistence on the provisions of the gautreaux ii decree.
the cha second error is in failing to recognize that the gautreaux plaintiffs,through their limited waivers of specific portions of the remedial decree,have achieved success on the merits.the cha admits that the agreed orders are the product of negotiation.for example,in one motion to the district court,the cha described the effect of the remedial decree on their building of housing under the plan in the past the cha has been forced to negotiate with plaintiff counsel for approval of developments,such as horner and lakefront,that were funded in whole or in part with gautreaux development money.as a result,the cha sic ends up with an agreed order to present to the court,but not the program that it would have created without having to negotiate with plaintiff counsel.emphasis added.in,cha further described the negotiation of agreed orders 
it the waiver process that is the most intrusive h ere how it goes in reality cha needs to get a waiver from the court to do a hope vi program.that means the court will ask us to negotiate with polikoff,as plaintiffs representative 
polikoff will begin the negotiating by first examining what neighborhood it is we focusing on next,what buildings do we want to demolish next what buildings do we want to rehabilitate next,where are we going to build the replacement housing and then it going to go all the way down to tenant selection and then to all of the other miscellaneous things that were brought to the attention of the court 
so the negotiation that would be required by the court,and properly so,would bring the plaintiffs into the whole program.it very intrusive 
t hey are going to want to negotiate from the beginning,and in order to get an agreed waiver we would have to negotiate.
now when the cha negotiates and they agree on a waiver and they bring it to you,they not happy with that order.that what they been able to negotiate.that not what they wanted,it not what they hoped for,but it was what there were able to negotiate.
plaintiffs could not say it any better themselves.the cha has had to change its position in order to win plaintiffs approval of the waiver orders,and that change in position is embodied in judicial orders.the success on the merits that plaintiffs achieved through the agreed orders is most evident in the december,order.the court concluded in this order that it should allow building of more new housing in the horner revitalization area because there has been a sufficient showing of revitalizing circumstances such that a responsible forecast of economic integration,with a longer term possibility of racial desegregation could be made moreover,the order conferred numerous benefits and powers on the plaintiffs it gave them control over the initial location and configuration of the units in which gautreaux families would be housed above the third floor it fixed the maximum number of units of public housing it fixed the maximum ratio of public to nonpublic units that could be built in the designated area public housing it required equal distribution of the public units throughout the complex it required annual written reports to be provided by the cha to plaintiffs and it permitted the plaintiffs to allocate some of the moneys from the set aside decree in a companion case gautreaux weaver,c to the building of the new housing.
the order of september,reflects the same attention to the plaintiffs demands.that order rests on a similar conclusion about the possibility of creating viable and desegregated housing opportunities for cha plaintiff families in the area in which the restrictions were being waived.the order specified the number of units to be built in each of four and buildings.for example,the order waived the height restriction in the renaissance north building,which was to be built at west north avenue and was to have units,
