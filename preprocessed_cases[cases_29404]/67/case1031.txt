stewart is a national title insurance underwriter headquartered in texas.on or about october,stewart entered into a title insurance underwriting agreement with cailu,whereby cailu became an agent of stewart.
subsequently,stewart became aware of problems with cailu mortgage payoffs.on two occasions,chase manhattan mortgage corporation received checks that were returned for insufficient funds.although this problem was corrected,stewart continued to investigate and determined that cailu escrow account was short approximately.subsequently,other cailu checks were returned for insufficient funds.
stewart filed suit against cailu,the sares,and johnson in the circuit court of eaton county,michigan,alleging breach of the title insurance underwriting agreement,breach of statutory fiduciary duty and the michigan insurance code,embezzlement and defalcation,conversion,and commingling of funds.see stewart title guaranty cailu title,eaton county circuit court.northland initially agreed to provide the insureds with a defense,subject to a full reservation of rights.then,in april,northland filed the instant declaratory action in the united states district court for the western district of michigan seeking to determine its obligations under its policy with cailu.two months after this action was filed in district court,stewart filed an amended complaint in the state court action.the amended complaint repeated the allegations asserted in the original complaint and added a claim of negligence.
cailu and the sares did not file an answer to northland complaint,and an entry of default was filed on june.on september,northland moved for summary judgment on its complaint for declaratory judgment.on november,johnson was dismissed as a party without prejudice by stipulation.stewart opposed northland motion for summary judgment.on november,stewart filed a motion to dismiss or in the alternative to stay the case.on february,the district court granted northland motion for summary judgment and denied stewart motion.on february,the district court entered a declaratory judgment in favor of northland,holding that the policy issued to cailu did not provide coverage for the conduct of the insureds,and that northland had no duty to defend the insureds in the state court action or to indemnify the insureds for any judgment or settlement against them in that action.on march,stewart filed a motion for reconsideration of the order granting summary judgment to northland,and the district court denied the motion for reconsideration on april.stewart timely perfected an appeal to this court.
discussion 
incorporation by reference 
in its final brief,stewart presents us with three issues for review,but it actually briefs only the third issue.for its first issue,stewart purports to incorporate by reference a motion for reconsideration filed with the district court and found in the joint appendix for its second issue,stewart would incorporate three different documents it filed with the district court.
stewart,in other words,invites us to unearth its arguments lodged here and there in the joint appendix,leaving it to us to skip over repetitive material,to recognize and disregard any arguments that are now irrelevant,and to harmonize the arguments in the various documents.stewart also attempts by this incorporation maneuver to add pages to the page brief it filed with this court.for the reasons we shall explain,we hold that stewart has failed to brief its first two issues,and therefore it has waived its argument on these issues.see united states elder,cir i t is a settled appellate rule that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,are deemed waived.quoting united states zannino,cir.
the incorporation by reference of arguments made at various stages of the proceeding in the district court does not comply with the federal rules of appellate procedure.see fed.a instructing that a component of the brief is the argument,which must contain the appellant contentions and the reasons for them,with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.emphasis added cir.a the purpose of the appendix is to assist the judges in reviewing the briefs and in preparing for oral argument by providing to them those parts of the record necessary for effective understanding of the issues raised in the briefs.emphasis added cir.f e except where they have independent relevance,memoranda of law filed in the proceedings below shall not be included in the joint appendix.this practice has been disallowed by this circuit,albeit in an unpublished opinion,see snyder united states,cir snyder attempt to merely incorporate his district court claims by reference does not serve as an appellate argument,and by the vast majority of the other circuits,see desilva dileonardi,cir petitioners direct us to a document filed in the district court,but we have not read it because adoption by reference amounts to a increase in the length of the appellate brief.even when a litigant has unused space,incorporation is a pointless imposition on the court time.a brief must make all arguments accessible to the judges,rather than ask them to play archaeologist with the record.citation omitted gaines tabb ici explosives,usa,cir toney gammon,cir gilday callahan,cir cray communications,novatel computer,cir yohey collins,cir phillip mayo clinic,cir see also charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure,at ed noting that where there are multiple appellants or appellees,a party may incorporate another brief by reference,but this does not allow adoption by reference of the briefs filed in the district court,a practice that has been strongly and rightly condemned.footnotes omitted.
of particular concern in this case are the word and line limitations found in fed.a,which limit the principal brief to pages,words,or lines of text.see also cir.b establishing that certain documents that must be included in the brief are not to be included in the calculation of page limitations,but including no omission for arguments that are incorporated by reference.stewart,at the end of its final brief,certifies that the foregoing brief complies with fed.a a and is under the page limitation,and assures us that t he actual word count is.both of these assertions are incorrect the page count clearly omits the incorporated documents,since the brief along with the incorporation is pages long,and a word count of is reasonable for a page brief roughly words per page,but not for one that is pages.indeed,if one assumes that the word average is maintained through the incorporated documents,stewart word count is well above the permitted number.
for all of the foregoing reasons,we join the many circuits that have explicitly disallowed the incorporation by reference into appellate briefs of documents and pleadings filed in the district court.further,we have no hesitancy in applying our holding in the case before us.the federal rules of appellate procedure,the commentaries,and the published law of other circuits are sufficiently clear to put stewart on notice that it could not properly incorporate into its appellate brief the materials filed in the district court.
motion for reconsideration 
exercise of jurisdiction under declaratory judgment act 
the declaratory judgment act provides that a court may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration.a.the district court exercise of discretion under this act is reviewed for abuse of discretion.scottsdale ins.roumph,cir.in assessing the district court discretion,this court generally considers five factors 
whether the judgment would settle the controversy whether the declaratory judgment action would serve a useful purpose in clarifying the legal relations at issue whether the declaratory remedy is being used merely for the purpose of procedural fencing or to provide an arena for a race for res judicata whether the use of a declaratory action would increase the friction between our federal and state courts and improperly encroach on state jurisdiction and whether there is an alternative remedy that is better or more effective.
the district court addressed these five factors in its opinion.after considering these factors,the district court determined that a declaratory judgment in this case would serve a useful purpose in clarifying and settling the legal relations in issue to the extent that they arise from northland policy.the court noted that northland was not a party to the state action and would not be bound by that court determination,and that northland should not be forced to wait for an answer until after the state action was completed.
in this case,all five of the factors weigh in favor of exercising jurisdiction.considering the first and second factors,while the declaratory judgment would not end the dispute between cailu and stewart,it would settle the controversy regarding the scope of insurance coverage issued by northland to cailu,and whether northland had a duty to defend the insureds.a prompt declaration of policy coverage would surely serve a useful purpose in clarifying the legal relations at issue.scottsdale,at.further,a declaratory remedy is not being used here merely for procedural fencing or to help win a race for res judicata.id.as the district court noted,the c ircumstances suggest that northland filed this action only after it became apparent that its insureds had no colorable claim to coverage or a defense.if northland in fact had no duty to indemnify its insured or to defend them in the state action,then it should not be forced to participate in that action.because northland was not a party in the state court proceedings,it would not have been bound by the state court determination.
in determining whether the exercise of declaratory judgment jurisdiction would increase the friction between the federal and state courts,the fourth factor articulated in scottsdale,three factors are considered whether the underlying factual issues are important to an informed resolution of the case whether the state trial court is in a better position to evaluate those factual issues than is the federal court and whether there is a close nexus between the underlying factual and legal issues and state law public policy,or whether federal common or statutory law dictates a resolution of the declaratory action.scottsdale ins.roumph,d,aff,cir.
northland was not a party to the state court action,and neither the scope of insurance coverage nor the obligation to defend was before the state court.thus,a decision by the district court on these issues would not offend principles of comity.the district court was fully capable of determining the nature of the coverage provided by the contract of insurance,and this determination did not have to await the resolution of factual issues in the state action.the resolution of the declaratory judgment action is not governed by federal common or statutory law,but rather by state contract law.however,no state law or policy would be frustrated by the district court exercise of jurisdiction,which would require the application of michigan law.the district court exercise of jurisdiction would not create friction between the state and federal courts.
in regard to scottsdale fifth factor,stewart argues that northland could have intervened in the state court action.however,intervening in the state court action would not necessarily have provided a better or more effective alternative remedy.northland chose for reasons of its own to have its dispute settled in federal court rather than state court.
the district court properly considered the relevant factors in deciding to exercise its jurisdiction to issue a declaratory judgment.we can not say that the district court did not employ the sound exercise of its discretion under these circumstances.see wilton seven falls,d.
the policy 
generally,we review the denial of a motion to reconsider for an abuse of discretion.gencorp,am.int l underwriters,cir.however,when a rule e motion seeks reconsideration of a grant of summary judgment,we conduct a de novo review using the same legal standard employed by the district court.smith wal mart stores,cir columbia gas transmission,limited,cir.
the district court review of the insurance contract at issue is governed by the michigan law of contract interpretation.where a contract meaning is ambiguous,a jury should determine its meaning.wise marsac.however,w here the language of a writing is not ambiguous,its construction is a question of law for the court and it is error to submit the matter to the jury.gray,ford motor.a contract is considered ambiguous if the words may reasonably be understood in different ways.raska farm bureau mut.ins.of.as a general rule,where terms having a definite legal meaning are used in a written contract,the parties to the contract are presumed to have intended such terms to have their proper legal meaning,absent a contrary intention appearing in the instrument.conagra,farmers state bank,quoting nationwide mut.fire ins.detroit edison.
if a fair reading of the entire contract of insurance leads one to understand that there is coverage under particular circumstances and another fair reading of it leads one to understand there is no coverage under the same circumstances,the contract is ambiguous and should be construed against its drafter and in favor of coverage.
yet if a contract,however inartfully worded or clumsily arranged,fairly admits of but one interpretation it may not be said to be ambiguous or,indeed,fatally unclear.
