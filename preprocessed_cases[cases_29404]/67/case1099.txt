we have consolidated for decision two cases presenting the recurring issue of the rights of religious organizations to avoid having to comply with local regulations.analysis requires threading our way through a maze of statutory and constitutional provisions and we begin there,which is to say with the religious land use and institutionalized persons act of rluipa,et,illinois religious freedom restoration act,ilcs et,and the constitution free exercise,establishment,and due process clauses.
the federal act provides that a government regulation that imposes a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a religious assembly or institution is unlawful unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.a.the act also provides that no government shall impose or implement a land use regulation in a manner that treats a religious assembly or institution on less than equal terms with a nonreligious assembly or institution,b,or that discriminates against any assembly or institution on the basis of religion or religious denomination,b.the illinois law,ilcs,is,so far as relates to this case,materially identical to section a of the federal law,diggs snyder,d,john united church of christ city of chicago,cir,and so it need not be discussed separately.
the city of chicago,the defendant in world outreach suit,argues that the federal act exceeds congress authority under section of the fourteenth amendment the enforcement clause citing city of boerne flores,d.but the act happens also to be based on congress power to regulate commerce.a b see westchester day school village of mamaroneck,cir.so the city shifts grounds,and argues that world outreach complaint contains no hint that the application of the zoning ordinance here affected interstate commerce.in fact the complaint alleges that the city prevented world outreach from renting rooms to refugees from hurricane katrina,and if the allegation is correct the city does not contest it,the city interfered with a shipment of persons across states lines,which is a form of interstate commerce,heart of atlanta motel,united states,d united states soderna,cir united states cargo service stations,and cir.
but we do not mean to concede the city contention that section a can not also be grounded in the authority granted congress by the enforcement clause.as we explained in saints constantine helen greek orthodox church city of new berlin,cir,that section of the act codifies sherbert verner,d,which boerne flores reaffirmed insofar as sherbert holds that a state that has a system for granting individual exemptions from a general rule must have a compelling reason to deny a religious group an exemption that is sought on the basis of hardship or,in the language of the present act,of a substantial burden on religious exercise.at.sherbert was an interpretation of the constitution,and so the creation of a federal judicial remedy for conduct contrary to its doctrine is an uncontroversial use of section.see also lighthouse institute for evangelism,city of long branch,and cir guru nanak sikh society of yuba city county of sutter,cir midrash sephardi,town of surfside,cir.another constitutional basis of the religious land use and institutionalized persons act is the constitution spending clause.the act creates a remedy for cases in which the substantial burden is imposed in a program or activity that receives federal financial assistance,even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability.a a.but it does not appear to be applicable to this case.
if we right that section a of rluipa codifies sherbert verner,there is much point to a plaintiff adding a claim under alleging a violation of the free exercise clause as made applicable to state or local governmental action by the supreme court interpretation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.there are,it is true,other types of violation of the clause.if a state or local government deliberately discriminated against a religious organization or against religion in general,it would be violating the free exercise clause even if the burden that the discrimination imposed on the plaintiff was not substantial within the meaning of rluipa.lighthouse institute for evangelism,city of long branch,supra,at tenafly eruv ass n,borough of tenafly,cir brown borough of mahaffey,cir.and if it were discriminating in favor of a religious organization or religion in general,it would also be violating the establishment clause.kerr farrey,cir commack kosher meats,weiss,cir.discrimination by an official body can always be attacked as a violation of the equal protection that would usually add nothing,when the discrimination was alleged to be based on religion,to a claim under the religion clauses of the first amendment.locke davey,d john united church of christ city of chicago,supra,at eulitt ex rel.eulitt maine of education,cir.but since discrimination against or in favor of a religious organization on religious grounds is expressly prohibited by section b of rluipa,quoted earlier,we can not see any point in a plaintiff pitching a religious discrimination claim on any provision of the constitution,rather than just on the statute.koger bryan,cir borzych frank,cir.
having cleared some underbrush,we turn to the first of our two cases,the suit by world outreach and its director,but her claim need not be discussed separately.the district court dismissed the suit for failure to state a claim,so we take the facts as true for purposes of deciding the appeal.
the world outreach conference center is a christian sect that operates a community center in a poor area on chicago south side called roseland.world outreach mission,according to its home page,visited,is 
to fulfill the great commission go ye into all the world,and preach the gospel to every creature.our goal will be to prepare the neighborhood and surrounding community for the coming of jesus christ and to establish his kingdom here on earth love will be our badge of honor and we will be empowered with the holy spirit to live and care for the needy in our community on a personal,one on one basis.we will train,equip and empower the youth in our commuity sic.our goal is to give generous assistance and relief to the needy and suffering in our neighborhood and surrounding community and donate to other organizations that share the same objectives.
the community center consists of a single building,which world outreach bought from the ymca in july.the building is not a church as such.the premises mainly contain recreational and living facilities,but there is also space for religious services,and there is no doubt that even the recreational and other nonreligious services provided at the community center are integral to the world outreach religious mission,just as the rehabilitation centers operated by the salvation army are integral to the salvation army religious mission.salvation army department of community affairs,cir see schleicher salvation army,cir fifth presbyterian church city of new york,cir.souls are saved just in church buildings.
world outreach wanted to operate the center just the way the ymca had done for the previous years without any hindrance from the chicago zoning authorities.in particular,like the ymca,it wanted to rent the building apartments as units.the ymca had done that without ever having been told by the city to obtain a special use permit.for the ymca use of the building had been what is called a legal nonconforming use.if a particular land use is begun at a time when the use conformed to the existing zoning regulations,and the zoning regulations are later changed to forbid such use,the user can continue his no longer conforming use without a special use permit.see chicago zoning ordinance,bainter village of algonquin,d,illinois life ins.city of chicago,shrewsbury edgemere associates lp board of appeals.the nonconforming status runs with the land and is not affected by changes of tenancy,ownership,or management.chicago zoning ordinance.
