titanic,rmst,as of the submerged wreck of the titanic and the artifacts salvaged from it,challenges the district court orders of september,and october.these orders were entered after the court discovered rmst plans to sell some of the artifacts and confirmed that the court earlier orders prohibiting the sale of artifacts were proper and were necessary when entered.rmst contends that,because in it was granted absolute title to all the artifacts it retrieved,the district court can not now restrict its right,as owner of the artifacts,to sell them at its discretion.
finding that rmst arguments are grounded on a fundamental misunderstanding of its role as,we reject its arguments and affirm the orders of the district court.
in,a joint expedition discovered the wreck of the titanic in the north atlantic ocean in international waters.two years later,titanic ventures,a limited partnership,explored the wreck,bringing up approximately artifacts.thereafter,it sold its interests in the salvage operations and the artifacts to rmst.
in,rmst commenced this in rem action against the titanic to become its.in its complaint,rmst requested,among other things,that,under the law of finds,it be declared the true,sole and exclusive owner of any items salvaged from the wreck or,alternatively,that,under salvage law,it be awarded a liberal salvage award as may be determined by this court.acting under principles of salvage law and consistent with the inchoate lien that rmst obtained as salvor,the district court exercised in rem jurisdiction and issued a warrant directing the united states marshal to arrest the wreck and all artifacts already salvaged and yet to be salvaged.simultaneously,it ordered that rmst be substituted for the marshal as the custodian of the wreck,the wreck site,and the artifacts.notice of the proceedings was duly published.following a claim made by an insurance company and settlement of that claim,the court approved the settlement and issued an order,dated june,declaring rmst.in its order,the court stated 
the court finds and orders that titanic,is the of the wreck and that titanic,is the true,sole and exclusive owner of any items salvaged from the wreck of the defendant vessel in the past and,so long as titanic,remains,items salvaged in the future,and is entitled to all salvage rights 
during the course of the hearing leading to this order,the district court confirmed its understanding that it was rmst intention to display these artifacts and to try to get its money back out of admissions to the display rather than selling them off.counsel for rmst affirmed that understanding and explained further that the process of going forward with the exhibition of the artifacts and not sell ing them continues and that is the position of the salvors in this case,that the artifacts and the artifacts will not be sold,but rather will be exhibited.
two years after entry of the june order appointing rmst,john joslyn filed a motion in this action requesting that the district court rescind its june order naming rmst because rmst had failed to salvage the titanic diligently and lacked the financial capacity to undertake future salvage operations.the district court rejected joslyn claims and denied his motion.but in doing so,it ordered rmst to make more frequent reports to the court about its salvage efforts.titanic,wrecked abandoned vessel,the titanic.in addition,the district court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting joslyn,as well as anyone else,from visiting the site of the wreck and from photographing it.titanic,wrecked abandoned vessel,wl.the court reasoned that because rmst was not selling artifacts like traditional salvors,it must be given the rights to other means of obtaining income.id.at.
in,when a british virgin islands corporation headquartered on the isle of man,great britain,began marketing to the public an expedition to visit the titanic wreck,which it called operation titanic,rmst filed a motion for a more specific injunction to prevent that corporation as well as its principals and customers from visiting and photographing the wreck site.the district court issued an expanded injunction,enjoining that corporation,as well as its principals and a named passenger,from visiting a yet more generously defined site in the north atlantic and from photographing the wreck.titanic,wrecked abandoned vessel,d.the court reasoned that because rmst was not selling the artifacts,it needed a stream of income,and the exclusive photographic and visitation rights would help insure this income.id.at.we reversed that order,concluding that it was beyond the power of the district court and inconsistent with salvage law to confer those rights neither prohibition is justified by the law of salvage or allowed by the law of free navigation on the high seas.titanic,haver,cir.rmst maintains that this refusal to give it exclusive visitation and photographic rights has had a substantial adverse impact on its income stream and has impaired its ability to finance further salvage operations.
rmst has continued to conduct salvage operations and to display the artifacts recovered in order to obtain income.in november,the management of rmst changed,and the new management articulated a new business plan designed to maximize shareholder value while still protecting the archeological and historical value of the wreck.while the financial strategy of rmst previous management had focused on generating earnings through the exhibition of artifacts,rmst new management expanded this strategic plan to include the possible disposition of artifacts to increase revenues and thereby to maintain its status as.but these plans were undeveloped,and during a hearing in march,the new president of rmst testified before the district court that rmst had no plans to sell any portion of the collection.
several months later,however,it came to the attention of the court that there ha d been a change in management in titanic,and that there was a concern held by some persons and organizations that titanic,was considering disposal of some artifacts recovered.in response to this information,the district court issued an order sua sponte,dated july,directing rmst not to sell or otherwise dispose of any artifacts or any object recovered from the wreck site and further that it must continue to treat and preserve any such artifacts and objects recovered from the wreck site.in its order,the court noted that t his court has continued titanic,as of the wreck of the titanic from year to year on the understanding that titanic,would treat and preserve all artifacts recovered and would exhibit them to the public and would not sell or dispose of any of said artifacts.
in its periodic report to the court several weeks later,rmst acknowledged the court july order,stating,rmst notes that since it had never sold any artifacts or objects recovered from the titanic without first advising the court sales of coal and encumbrance of coins and currencies,and since it had advised the court earlier in its july,periodic report that it would not cut into the wreck,the only new effect of the july order was the prohibition on detaching any part of the wreck.consistent with this position,rmst did not appeal the district court july order prohibiting the sale or dispersion of the artifacts.
in april,rmst sought a clarification of the july order to permit it to sell the coal it had recovered from the wreck.during the hearing on this issue,rmst broached,for the first time,plans to form a new foundation which might explore the acquisition of the artifact collections at some time in the future.rmst counsel explained that the desire on the part of rmst to explore transfer raise d some questions with the july order,which had confirmed the prohibition against selling any artifacts.on the issue of whether selling rmst had already the court orders,counsel explained that coal recovered from the site was always treated as organic matter,rather than artifacts,and that rmst had always felt free to sell coal.after the court invited rmst to submit a clarifying order authorizing the sale of coal,the court reiterated its position about selling artifacts 
you have to remember now that during the whole time that titanic has worked with the court,they have always taken the position that they are not going to sell any artifacts,that their purpose in getting them is to get them,preserve them,and put them on display.
counsel for rmst confirmed the court understanding,stating,that is exactly what has been represented to the court.the company has never taken the position that it wanted to sell the artifacts.in accordance with the hearing,the district court signed an order dated april,modifying the july,order to reflect the fact that the salvor remains free to sell or encumber any coal that it has recovered or that it might recover in the future from the titanic wreck site.again,rmst did not appeal this modification of the july order.
beginning in july,rmst gently leaked idea to form a foundation became concrete,and rmst submitted a supplemental report to the court,describing the formation of the titanic foundation,and the foundation interest in purchasing the artifacts from rmst.upon receiving the report,the district court issued an order,again sua sponte,dated july,reiterating that rmst could not convey in any manner any of the titanic artifacts until the court had held a full hearing.
that hearing was held on september.the court then learned in detail about the formation of the titanic foundation and noted that the principals of rmst and the titanic foundation were the same people,observing so it is really a one man show is that not right the court noted that this might create irreconcilable conflicts of interest with respect to the principals duties to both the public corporation and the nonprofit foundation.counsel for rmst explained that the foundation would be able to solicit charitable contributions which then could be used to purchase the artifacts.counsel justified the need for the foundation in part by our decision in haver,in which we denied rmst exclusive rights to visit the site and to photograph the wreck.at.at the hearing,the district court did not reject the notion that the collection of artifacts as a than possibly be sold pursuant to an acceptable plan,approved by the court.but counsel then explained a practical difficulty in having to obtain the court approval of any such transfer of artifacts.as counsel explained,approval puts the company in a very awkward position in dealing with those who want to acquire collections,in that you have to say to them,well,do your due diligence,you go out and get your appraisal,you do everything else that you have to do,and then we as a company will do the things that we have to do so it requires opinions,various things that have to be done for due diligence,and then to the potential acquirer,we will come to the court and ask for approval of that.after the court explained the difficulty in foregoing approval,it stated that,t here is no sense in the court or your taking the time to decide some abstract question.if you have got some sort of an agreement or deal worked out,submit that to the court,and the court will say whether or not it approves it.following the hearing and apparently out of concern over the possibility that artifacts might be sold,the district court entered another order,dated september,stating 
the court finds after the september,hearing that its previous orders entered in this case,designed to prevent sales of individual artifacts recovered from the wreck of titanic,were proper and were necessary when entered.
two weeks later,rmst appealed that order.and after rmst appealed the september order,the district court entered another order dated october,amending the september order,essentially explaining its position,as well as earlier orders.in its explanation,the court indicated that it first learned in april of the possibility that rmst might convey the collection and recognized that circumstances change and it becomes necessary to change plans and approaches.the court invited further motions on the disposition of artifacts.rmst appealed this october,order as well.
because there was no party in opposition to represent the district court position,this court asked the university of virginia school of law appellate litigation clinic to file an amicus brief to serve as the answering brief.the clinic did so ably,and we have considered the arguments of both rmst and its counsel as well as counsel from the clinic.
the amicus appropriately raises the question of whether we have jurisdiction to review the september and october,orders.rmst has asserted jurisdiction under a authorizing appeals of interlocutory orders granting,continuing,modifying,refusing or dissolving injunctions,or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions and a authorizing appeals of interlocutory decrees determining the rights and liabilities of the parties to admiralty cases.
the amicus argues that rmst can not appeal under a because rmst consented earlier to the same order of july,see haitian refugee ctr.civiletti,cir no factual or legal change has occurred to justify appealing an ongoing injunction which rmst did not earlier appeal,see sec suter,cir and the district court left open alternative avenues of relief,inviting rmst to submit a formal motion for approval of any new deal.also challenging jurisdiction under a,the amicus argues that congress limited interlocutory review in admiralty cases to interlocutory decrees that determine rights and liabilities,and it did not grant a right to appeal every interim order.see pickle char lee seafood,cir evergreen int l usa standard warehouse,cir.
we agree with the amicus that if rmst is appealing orders under a that simply clarify or interpret earlier orders that it failed to appeal,its appeal rights would be forfeited by its failure to appeal the earlier orders.see,major orthopedic equip,cir holding that court lacked jurisdiction on appeal from injunction because the order was simply an interpretation of an earlier order.this principle is based on the notion that the more recent appealed orders add nothing in substance to earlier orders left unappealed.if either of the appealed orders,on the other hand,modifies the substance of an earlier order or extends its duration,the new order is appealable under a.see,pickle,at finding appealable an order that denied a party request for modification of an injunction sierra club marsh,cir noting that an order that extends or prolongs the restraint imposed by an earlier order is appealable.similarly,if the factual and legal circumstances applicable to an earlier order change,the substantive effect of a restated injunction may cause it to become appealable.see,suter,at suggesting that changes in fact of law since the injunction entry may justify an appeal.
the question of jurisdiction in this case is a close one which rmst could have made easier by filing in the district court a motion to vacate or modify the july,injunction,based on the new factual developments.although rmst filed no such motion,it advances a persuasive argument that the periodic reports and hearings prior to the orders appealed in this case provide support for a position that the circumstances had changed and that,therefore,the september and october,orders,which were aimed at the new circumstances,had a new substantive effect.
as rmst accurately points out,the april periodic report indicated that two organizations had expressed interest in purchasing some or all of the titanic artifacts,the titanic foundation and the museums and galleries of northern ireland.to acquire information about the possible arrangements,the court conducted a hearing on september,where witnesses testified about the details of a potential artifact sale to those entities.after hearing testimony about these new developments,the district court,sua sponte,issued the september and october,orders from which rmst appealed.
rmst suggests that not only did the september and october,orders focus on the new developments,but in substance they also extended the scope of the earlier injunctions to cover new circumstances.it argues that the district court itself observed that the court had earlier only prohibited the sale of individual artifacts but had never enjoined the sale of the artifacts as a collection.with its september and october orders,the court was enjoining any sale of the artifacts as a group.
we believe that the new developments that preceded the september and october orders were sufficiently material as to justify rmst challenge to the renewed injunctions entered following the hearing on september.while the court may not have explicitly expanded its earlier injunctions,it acknowledged that the earlier injunctions were designed to prevent sales of individual artifacts and that it would consider a modification of them if the modification was designed to keep the recovered and artifacts together as a group.the court also acknowledged that circumstances change and it becomes necessary to change plans and approaches.
moreover,this case presents the rare circumstance that might render a later review of these interlocutory orders impossible.it is unclear how long the in rem action will continue because it is unclear how long salvage will continue.it could be years depending on rmst capacity,will,and diligent performance of salvage services.because no final termination of these proceedings is currently in sight,rmst could be left without a remedy for challenging the two orders entered in light of the new developments.
accordingly,in the peculiar circumstances before us,we conclude that we have jurisdiction under a.we need not,therefore,reach the question of whether this case presents a decree appealable under a.
on the merits,rmst,relying heavily on language taken from the district court june,order appointing rmst,directs our focus to the district court declaration in that order that rmst is the true,sole and exclusive owner of any items salvaged from the wreck of the defendant vessel in the past and,so long as rmst remains,items salvaged in the future,and is entitled to all salvage rights.emphasis added.rmst maintains that,for several reasons,this language confirms that it became the absolute owner of the artifacts,free and clear,as they were retrieved from the titanic and,therefore,that it is entitled to sell them,notwithstanding its earlier expressions to the court of an intent not to sell them.
specifically,rmst argues first that there were no contingencies or exceptions to the district court in specie award.second,rmst maintains that the maritime law does not permit a district court to impose such restrictions on disposition of artifacts,awarded in specie,for some perceived public benefit.these restrictions equate to a taking of private property.third,rmst asserts that the district court had no justification for converting statements by rmst regarding a business plan into a binding restriction upon disposition of items recovered from the wreck.fourth,rmst observes that the district court speaks only through its orders and not through its opinions,whether oral or written,and its june order contains no restrictions on disposition.fifth,rmst argues that the doctrine of judicial estoppel is inapplicable to its statements of intent about not selling the artifacts because it never made misleading statements to the court in order to obtain any benefit.and finally,rmst contends that the restrictions are substantively inappropriate in view of the public policy behind salvage law,arguing that the restrictions against resale of the artifacts actually inhibit incentives to perform salvage operations and that rmst,as a publicly traded company,has an obligation to maximize shareholder value,which should be considered.indeed,the adverse effects of the district court orders on the continuing financial viability of rmst runs throughout rmst arguments that the court acted illegally and inappropriately.
before addressing rmst specific arguments,it is necessary to set forth the relevant fundamental principles of salvage law and to recognize the significance of this case as an in rem proceeding instituted under the salvage law to enforce rmst inchoate lien for a salvage reward.
a salvor in admiralty is one who voluntarily saves life or property at sea.because of the dangers of the sea and the mutual interest of seamen and seafaring nations to traverse the sea notwithstanding its dangers,the law of admiralty for almost years has uniformly held that those who voluntarily come to the assistance of fellow seamen in distress and perform salvage are entitled to be rewarded.haver,at see generally martin norris,benedict on admiralty ed.as chief justice marshall eloquently explained,this is a policy for seamen,not landlubbers 
if the property of an individual on land be exposed to the greatest peril,and be saved by the voluntary exertions of any person whatever if valuable goods be rescued from a house in flames,at the imminent hazard of life by the salvor,no remuneration in the shape of salvage is allowed.the act is highly meritorious,and the service is as great as if rendered at sea.yet the claim for salvage could not,perhaps,be supported.it is certainly not made.let precisely the same service,at precisely the same hazard,be rendered at sea,and a very ample award will be bestowed in the courts of justice.
mason v.the ship blaireau,cranch.by saving property at sea,salvors do not become the property owner rather,they save it for the owners and become entitled to a reward from the owner or from his property.haver,at the amethyst,cas,stating that a salvor stands as a voluntary agent and thus is bound to act for the interest of the owner as well as his own.the reward provides an incentive for rendering salvage service at sea,and courts of admiralty have long enforced claims to this award against owners.mason,cranch at allowing a very ample compensation for those services,one very much exceeding the mere risk encountered,and labour employed in effecting them.as one court early explained 
salvage,it is true,is not a question of compensation pro opera et labore.it rises to a higher dignity.it takes its source in a deeper policy.it combines with private merit and individual sacrifices larger considerations of the public good,of commercial liberality,and of international justice.it offers,a premium,by way of honorary award,for prompt and ready assistance to human sufferings for a bold and fearless intrepidity and for that affecting chivalry,which forgets itself in an anxiety to save property,as well as life.

the principal method of enforcing a salvor award is through the recognition of a salvor lien in the property saved.the sabine.explaining that a salvage lien ordinarily affords the best mode of securing the payment of a salvor claims haver,at.this maritime lien arises from the moment salvage service is performed,united states zp chandon,cir,and,as with any other lien,secures the payment of the salvage award.such liens are a temporary encumbrance of the property saved,lasting only until payment of a salvage award can be made.the everosa,cir.

if the owner appears and pays the salvage reward determined by the court,the lien is discharged and the owner takes the property clear of the salvage lien.ferrous financial servs.arctic producer,permitting judicial sale to go forward because owner was in default and could not obtain bond to release arrested ship.on the other hand,if the owner does not appear,then the case continues as an in rem action,and the court determines the award,sells the property,and,from the proceeds,pays the salvor,supp.e c.any remainder from the sale is remitted to the owner.if the owner is no longer living,the court presumably pays the excess to the owner heirs,and,if there are no heirs,to the state according to its escheat law.
if the sale of the salvaged property yields too little to satisfy the salvor lien for a reward,then all of the proceeds from the sale of the salvaged property are paid to the salvor.courts have held that an award can not exceed the value of the property itself.even if it does,though,in an in rem proceeding,there certainly can not be a deficiency judgment against the owner because the action is against the property and any judgment therefore is limited to the value of the property.see allseas maritime,mimosa,cir the salvage award is therefore limited by the value of the property saved after all of the appropriate factors are taken into account lambros seaplane base,v.the batory,cir concluding that where owner did not appear to claim a salvaged seaplane,the owner could not be held personally liable to the salvor.if it becomes apparent to the court that the proceeds of any sale would clearly be inadequate to pay the salvor its full reward,then the court might,as a matter of discretion,award the salvor title to the property in lieu of the proceeds of sale,thus saving the costs of sale.the salvor does not have a direct right,however,to title in the property.see platoro unidentified remains,cir we can not find a case where the salvage award was expressed in terms of the res rather than in dollars chance certain artifacts found salvaged from the nashville,declining to accept the in specie award as a valid award in a salvage action,aff cir.rather,the salvor has only a lien on the property which may,upon execution or foreclosure and in the discretion of the court,be satisfied by the court conveying title to the salvor after the court determines that the appropriate amount of award can not be satisfied by a sale of the property.haver,at.
thus,hypothetically,if rmst were to recover an artifact valued at million we know,for instance,that paintings have at times sold for more and the court were to determine that the appropriate salvage award was million,the court could not give the property to rmst in satisfaction of its salvage lien because the lien exists only to the extent of million.the court instead would have to sell the property and remit to rmst million from the proceeds.on the other hand,if rmst were to recover an artifact valued at million a historic vase,for example and the court were to determine,again,that the appropriate salvage award was million,a sale would be useless.in lieu of a sale to foreclose the salvage lien,the court could simply convey title in the million vase to rmst,essentially providing rmst what is analogous to a deed in lieu of foreclosure.
once the lien is executed and the salvor as lienholder is paid its reward,whether in money or in kind,the reward becomes the property of the salvor to do with what it wants.point landing alabama dry dock shipbuilding,cir the judicial sale cuts off the rights of all.the title from the marshal is good against the world.
it is critical to note that under salvage law,the salvor receives a lien in the property,not title to the property,and as long as the case remains a salvage case,the lienholder can not assert a right to title even though he may end up with title following execution or foreclosure of the lien.see,the akaba burg,cir when articles are lost at sea the title of the owner in them remains see also adams unione mediterranea di sicurta,cir explaining that the owner of the salvaged goods does not lose title even though the property may become the subject of salvage services,because,through the lien,the salvor obtains only a right of possession in the property and not ownership or title to the salved property quoting benedict on admiralty treasure salvors,at although the law of salvage grants the salvor a right to possession of the property,the salvage of a vessel or goods at sea,even when the goods have been abandoned,does not divest the original owner of title or grant ownership rights to the salvor continental ins.v.the clayton hardtop skiff,cir the salvor has the right to salvage but he does not achieve ownership of the vessel by salving it chance.at stating that even though a vessel is abandoned without the hope of recovery or return,the title of the vessel remains in her owner and t he salvor of property has a right to an award or a lien against the property,aff cir hener united states,explaining that salvage law grants the salvor only a superior right of possession,and not title,until a court has passed on title and the salvage fee citing the akaba,cir the port hunter,stating the salvors have a claim paramount to all others and the control to enforce the claim,b ut their interest in the goods did not amount to ownership th e right is merely a lien,a right to retain the goods till the salvage be paid quoting whitwell wells,pick,the carl schurz,cas,stating that the salvor is,to all intents and purposes,a joint owner of the property along with the original owner the amethyst,cas.at the finder of property,left derelict at sea,does not acquire the dominion or the absolute property in what is found.he acquires the right of possession only,with a title to a reasonable reward for his services.
this principle,while firm in the salvage law,does not mean that a salvage case could not be converted into a finds case.see platoro,at noting that salvage awards can be made by award of title to the res under the law of finds treasure salvors,unidentified wrecked abandoned sailing vessel,cir recognizing that title to lost ships can be divested from the owner under the law of finds.under finds law,title to abandoned property vests in the person who reduces that property to his or her possession.id.at.before such a conversion is made,however,the prerequisites for divesting title under the law of finds must be satisfied.see,discovery group atl.mut.ins,cir requiring clear and convincing evidence of abandonment before the law of finds is applied.
turning to the specifics in the case before us,rmst,as salvor,obtained an inchoate lien in the artifacts upon performing salvage service in connection with the titanic,and it became entitled to enforce that lien through the in rem proceeding which is now pending before the district court.it did not,however,obtain a lien in any property that it merely discovered discovery alone does not amount to salvage service,although it can lead to salvage service.the sabine.setting out three requirements for a salvage award existence of a marine peril,voluntary action by the salvor,and successful salvage.when rmst performed salvage service,the district court exercised constructive in rem jurisdiction over the wreck and declared rmst the sole of the titanic.haver,at.and through that order,the court gave rmst the exclusive right to salvage artifacts from the titanic and to obtain a reward through enforcement of its salvor lien in the artifacts.if and when rmst abandons its role as salvor or the court dispossesses rmst of that role,the unsalvaged wreck will remain as any other unsalvaged wreck at the bottom of the sea,subject to salvage service by others.
many of these basic principles of salvage and lien law have been overlooked by rmst in its arguments.in addition to claiming title as a,it has,for example,also extensively argued that the district court should have taken into account rmst financial viability.but this issue has no relevance to whether rmst is entitled to enforce its salvage lien against the artifacts that it salvaged.when rmst voluntarily salvaged with profit in became entitled only to a reward,enforceable against the property.the camanche,wall.allowing recovery even by those salvors whose business it is to be always ready and at command whenever assistance is required bureau wijsmuller united states,cir.rmst is not entitled to a guarantee that it remain in business as a viable company to conduct salvage services.surely if rmst abandoned its efforts,others would take over.in this case,other potential salvors have unsuccessfully petitioned the district court to do
