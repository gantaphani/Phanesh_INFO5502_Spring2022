this case involves a challenge to the general management plan that the national park service issued for isle royale national park on august.the plaintiffs,the isle royale boaters association and a number of individual boaters and other visitors to isle royale,argue that by removing certain docks and altering trail access and shelter facilities at other docks,the park service general management plan will significantly limit the boaters access to the island and contravene the intent of congress when it made isle royale a national wilderness area in.we conclude that the addition,removal,and relocation of docks proposed in the general management plan is within the discretion granted by the wilderness act and the national park service organic act.thus we affirm the district court decision granting summary judgment to the defendants.
background 
isle royale national park consists of a series of islands in the northern reaches of lake superior.the main island is about miles long and nine miles wide it is surrounded by about four hundred smaller islands.it has been a national park since,and it was designated as a national wilderness area in.the park approximately visitors each year arrive by ferry,seaplane,and private boat to hike,camp,and enjoy the park waters.the park has miles of trails,many campgrounds,and one overnight lodge.although the park is closed to visitors from october through,its residents include moose,timber wolves,snowshoe hares,and beavers,as well as about seventy rare plant species.
in,the national park service formally began the process that would ultimately lead to a general management plan gmp to take the place of the master plan that had governed the park since.the gmp would serve to guide future use of resources and facilities,to clarify research and resource management needs and priorities,and to address changing levels of park visitation and use.joint appendix at gmp at.general management plans usually provide guidance over a fifteen to period.following a series of public forums and newsletters,a draft of the gmp was distributed in march of.after a further period of public comment,the park service issued the final version on august.
among other concerns,the gmp sought to address visitors complaints regarding noise levels within the park.the gmp noted that although isle royale receives fewer visitors than many national parks,it has a high number of overnight visitors,and w ith isle royale density of backcountry use,differing preferences and expectations are especially evident.at gmp at.some visitors complain that their wilderness experiences are being compromised by visual intrusions and noise from park developments,jets and other aircraft,boats,and the behavior and activities of other visitors,such as having loud parties and playing stereos.at gmp at.because isle royale designation as a wilderness area carries with it certain expectations for visitors,such as solitude and quiet,at gmp at,the gmp aimed to separate motorized and nonmotorized uses in some areas,at gmp at.
as part of an effort to separate nonmotorized uses of the park from motorized uses of the park,the final gmp included a number of changes that would affect motorized boat users access to the park.prior to the gmp,the park had twenty docks on lake superior.under the gmp,the park would eliminate some docks,relocate others,and build some new docks,so that the park would ultimately offer docks.however,although the changes would result in an aggregate increase in the number of docks,and although boaters would still be able to access all areas of the park,albeit with perhaps a longer hike from a relocated dock,the changes would in some ways limit boaters access to shelters and trails.under the gmp,the park service would eliminate the docks at three mile,which gave boaters access to eight shelters,at duncan bay,which offered two shelters,and at siskiwit bay,which gave boaters direct access to the island trail system.the dock at mccargoe cove,which offered six shelters and was directly on the trail system,would be moved approximately one mile toward the mouth of the cove,so that boaters could reach the main trail system and the shelters only by a spur trail.similarly,the gmp calls for the park service to remove access to the main trail system from the dock at chippewa harbor by eliminating the indian portage trail that connected them.boaters could still reach the main trail system via other docks.
the three docks that the gmp would eliminate entirely would be replaced with five new docks.however,unlike the three previous docks,which were all located on the main island,four of the five new docks would be on surrounding islands with no access to the main island.these four docks would be at johns island,washington island,wright island,and crystal cove of the four,none of the sites would have shelters immediately,but historical structures at washington island and crystal cove would be adapted for such use.the fifth new dock would be at fisherman home.the fisherman home dock would offer no access to the main trail system,but the site has historical structures that would be considered for conversion to shelters.nonshelter camping would be available at all five sites.
finally,the gmp calls for the park service to replace a dock at hay bay.the gmp does not call for rebuilding the dock at huginnin cove,which was damaged by weather in the.
the isle royale boaters association irba and five individual plaintiffs filed suit in federal district court on august.according to their first amended complaint,the plaintiffs include an association representing more than six hundred members who regularly visit isle royale and boat in its waters,four individuals who frequently visit isle royale in their boats,and one individual who regularly visits the island to canoe,hike,and fish.the plaintiffs alleged that the park service gmp and the process undertaken to adopt it violated the wilderness act public law,which is the act designating isle royale as a wilderness area and which the parties refer to as the isle royale wilderness act the organic act that established the national park service the national environmental policy act and the administrative procedure act.
on june,the district court denied the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and granted the defendants motion for summary judgment.the park service proposed plan was not arbitrary or capricious,the district court ruled,because the wilderness act gave the secretary the authority to regulate boat use in wilderness areas such as isle royale.moreover,the court reasoned,the gmp would result in a net increase of docks,raising the total from twenty to,and would still permit those using motorboats to reach the park shelters and trails by hiking,kayaking,and canoeing,just as other island visitors did.because the isle royale wilderness act contemplates the continued maintenance of docks at the park,but not the continued maintenance and existence to perpetuity of every dock currently at the park,at,and because the park service decisions regarding the docks were not arbitrary or capricious under the wilderness act and the isle royale wilderness act,the court would not intervene.the court also rejected the plaintiffs organic act and national environmental policy act arguments,as well as the plaintiffs arguments that the gmp violated the rehabilitation act and the ada,none of which allegations the plaintiffs press on appeal.
the plaintiffs timely appealed,and we have jurisdiction under.we review de novo the district court decision awarding summary judgment to the defendants and apply the standard of review appropriate to a review of the agency action in question.community first bank credit union,cir.under chevron natural resources defense council,d,we first determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,id.at.if it has not,we ask whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute,id.at.section a of the administrative procedure act permits us to set aside the agency determination only if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law a s
