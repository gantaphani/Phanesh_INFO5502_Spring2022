this case presents the question whether certain housing code and property tax inspections of the exterior of a house within the curtilage in a remote rural setting constitute a search within the meaning of the fourth amendment.balancing a number of factors regarding the widgrens reasonable expectation of privacy,we hold that the intrusions at issue are not fourth amendment searches,and we affirm the district court judgment in favor of the defendants on the parties for summary judgment.
factual background 
plaintiff kenneth widgren,solely owns twenty acres of largely undeveloped land in maple grove township,michigan densely populated trees,hills and thick overgrowth cover much of the grounds.in may or june of,widgren,began construction of a house in the middle of his rectangularly shaped lot and the structure later that year.by the spring of,the area immediately surrounding the house was cleared,routinely mowed and a clear line marked the perimeter of the mowed portion.the cleared area,which was not enclosed by a fence,contained a fire pit,pruned trees and a picnic table,but no other noticeable landscaping or improvements.
over one thousand feet of dirt driveway wind through swampy and thick terrain,a row of pine trees and a rye field,and connect the house to puustinen road,the sole public access to the widgren property.at the mouth of the driveway stands a metal gate,twenty feet long by three feet high,that displays multiple no trespassing signs,one of which warns federal officers of the irs,hew,hud,environmental,health,and other unconstitutional agencies as well as all local members of planning zoning boards of a per person land use fee.the house,which also stores various personal belongings of the son of widgren,kenneth widgren,can be plainly seen only from two vantage points outside the the adjoining parcel to the south and from the air.
the widgrens did not obtain a building permit for the construction of the house.in the spring of,defendants louis lenz,the zoning administrator of maple grove township,and wayne beldo,the township tax assessor,entered the property a total of three times to confirm the zoning violation,to post a civil infraction on the front door of the house,and to conduct a tax assessment through observation of the exterior of the house.once the widgrens learned of the three visits,each of which is discussed below in more detail,the father and son brought suit in the district court for the western district of michigan,alleging various violations of federal and state law.both the widgrens and the defendants moved for partial summary judgment on the fourth amendment claims filed pursuant to.relying on the open fields doctrine,the district court granted the defendants motion and held that no fourth amendment violation occurred.the district court then denied the widgrens motion,and,with only state law claims remaining,dismissed the state law claims without prejudice pursuant to c.

applicable general principles 
the fourth amendment provides that t he right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses,papers,and effects,against unreasonable searches and seizures,shall not be violated,and that no warrants shall issue,but upon probable cause const.amend.iv emphasis added.the fourth amendment protections hinge on the occurrence of a search,a legal term of art whose history is riddled with complexity.see kyllo united states,d discussing when a search is not a search.a search is defined in terms of a person reasonable expectation of privacy and is analyzed under a test first penned in katz united states,d has the individual manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the object of the challenged search and is society willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable california ciraolo,d.
the second prong of the katz test generally addresses two considerations.the first focuses on what a person had an expectation of privacy in,for example,a home,office,phone booth or airplane.dow chemical united states,cir,aff,d emphasis in original see also oliver united states,d noting our societal understanding that certain areas deserve the most scrupulous protection from government invasion united states white,d harlan,dissenting assessing the individual sense of security wayne lafave,search and seizure a treatise on the fourth amendment d ed.this inquiry centers on whether the human relationships that normally exist at the place inspected are based on intimacy,confidentiality,trust or solitude and hence give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy.dow chemical,at.

other relevant factors in applying katz second prong include the intention of the framers of the fourth amendment and the uses to which the individual has put a location.oliver,at.
while applying these considerations to katz second prong to determine whether society is willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable,the supreme court has drawn some bright line rules concerning the home,the curtilage,and open fields.these three doctrines converge in this case and are all discussed below.
application of principles 
the widgrens claim that the defendants conducted three separate searches in violation of the fourth amendment.we address each instance individually.
the initial inspection 
while driving on sedlar road in late march of,lenz,the township zoning administrator,apparently observed a reflection from the roof or window of the widgrens house.unsure what he had seen but confident that no land use permit had been issued for a house there,lenz parked on puustinen road and advanced up the widgrens driveway past the metal gate and no trespassing signs until he came within feet of the house,which,for the first time,was clearly visible.not having entered the cleared area,lenz returned to the township offices to confirm that no land use permit had been issued for the widgren property.he then promptly informed widgren,by letter of the violation of the township zoning ordinance.
lenz observations here,occurring in the open fields,did not constitute a fourth amendment search.no reasonable expectation of privacy exists in open fields.oliver,at.the term open fields is somewhat of a misnomer in that a n open field need be neither open nor a field and may include any unoccupied or undeveloped area outside of the curtilage.id.at.t here is no constitutional difference between police observations conducted while in a public place and while standing in the open fields.united states dunn,d.moreover,i n the case of open fields,the general rights of property protected by the common law of trespass have little or no relevance to the applicability of the fourth amendment.oliver,at.the presence of no trespassing signs,furthermore,does not transform the open fields into an area where an expectation of privacy is necessarily reasonable.see id.at.
in dunn,relying on the open fields doctrine,the supreme court declined to equate much more intrusive government conduct than that involved here with a fourth amendment violation 
it follows that no constitutional violation occurred here when the officers crossed over respondent perimeter fence,and over several similarly constructed interior fences,prior to stopping at the locked front gate of the barn t he officers never entered the barn,nor did they enter any other structure on respondent premises.once at their vantage point,they merely stood,outside the curtilage of the house and in the open fields upon which the barn was constructed,and peered into the barn open front.and,standing as they were in the open fields,the constitution did not forbid them to observe the phenylacetone laboratory located in respondent barn here,the officers use of the beam of a flashlight,directed through the essentially open front of respondent barn,did not transform their observations into an unreasonable search within the meaning of the fourth amendment.
dunn,at.accordingly,lenz conduct in his initial visit to the widgren property,while perhaps a trespass,was not a search under the fourth amendment.
the second inspection 
lenz revisited the widgren property several weeks later,on april,to post a civil infraction on the front door of the house this intrusion was not a fourth amendment search because,under any definition,no search of any kind occurred.a search generally implies looking over or through for the purpose of finding something.kyllo,at.quoting noah webster,an american dictionary of the english language ed.according to one court,a search may occur even where the officer was not intentionally looking for something,so long as the objective effect of his actions infringed a reasonable expectation of privacy.united states maple,quoting bond united states,d.
in city of aspen,cir,the tenth circuit addressed a situation similar to the case at bar and found no fourth amendment violation.the plaintiff in that case obtained a building permit for home renovations but subsequently failed to comply with related documentation requirements.the building inspector then issued a stop work order.after noting ongoing construction at the site,the inspector informed the plaintiff that all work had to stop.when his directions went unheeded,he and his supervisor entered the plaintiff home to notify the workers of the stop work order.the plaintiff brought an action pursuant to alleging that the defendants actions violated the fourth amendment.the tenth circuit rejected the plaintiff claim 
t here does not appear to be any search or seizure,thus no violation of the fourth amendment.for purposes of this appeal we assume lyman himself pushed open the door to the premises and stepped into the entryway without any proper consent.lyman was not on the premises to inspect for a violation of the building code he and the inspector had already seen what they considered violations of the stop work order,from outside the premises.it seems clear lyman did not intend to make any arrest on the premises to issue a citation,of course,is not to make an arrest thus,lyman did not enter plaintiff home for either a search or a seizure lyman had a right to approach plaintiff home to talk to her when he observed from the street workers violating the stop work order lyman intrusion was minimal,even if he was more than one foot inside the entryway.it is clear he was not there to inspect or to take into physical custody any person or property.in these circumstances,we hold there was no fourth amendment violation.
at internal citations omitted.
in the instant situation as in,objectively speaking,nothing was looked for and nothing was found,except the existence of a structure.lenz merely posted a citation in his capacity as the township zoning administrator and did not seek to discover incriminating evidence.moreover,the intrusion here was even more minimal than in because lenz never set foot in the house.in his second visit to the widgren property,lenz,therefore,did not conduct a fourth amendment search.
the curtilage inspection 
the intrusion of beldo,the township assessor,presents a more difficult question.around the time of lenz initial visit,he told beldo about the house.beldo examined township records to confirm the lack of a land use permit and may have reviewed an aerial photograph that appeared to depict the house.beldo then drove along puustinen road to the widgren property.upon reading the no trespassing signs,he drove onto the neighboring property to the south and exited his truck.while still on the neighboring property,he observed the widgren house.he then walked onto the widgren property towards the plainly visible house where no one appeared to be home.he observed the house exterior,measured it by counting the foundation cement blocks,and took a photograph of the house.while ascertaining its dimensions,beldo entered the cleared area but came no closer than four to six feet from the house and did not look into or enter the house.after conducting his assessment,he promptly left and sent widgren,a letter informing him of the assessment.
pursuant to our above discussion of dunn and the initial visit of lenz,beldo observations of the house exterior from the neighboring property and from the open fields within the widgren property for tax assessment purposes are not fourth amendment searches.a closer question,however,is whether beldo observation of the house that occurred within the cleared area constitute a fourth amendment search.the parties dispute whether any curtilage existed around the house,and,accordingly,whether beldo entered curtilage.the widgrens point to the modest improvements to the land surrounding the house,while the defendants claim that the cleared area is simply too undeveloped to constitute curtilage.
in united states dunn,d,the supreme court described the contours of the fourth amendment protections in curtilage,the area immediately surrounding a home that harbors the intimate activity associated with the sanctity of a man home and the privacies of life.dunn,at.quoting oliver,at.the dunn court established four factors for determining whether an area is a home curtilage 
the proximity of the area claimed to be curtilage to the home,whether the area is included within an enclosure surrounding the home,the nature of the uses to which the area is put,and the steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observation by people passing by.
applying these factors to the facts taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,we conclude that the cleared area immediately surrounding the house constituted curtilage.first,the area at issue here lay within immediate proximity to the house,only four to six feet away,unlike the area in dunn that was located sixty yards from the house.second,although the area was not within an enclosure,a clear line marked the mowed portion from the surrounding area that had not been cleared.third,the cleared area had apparently been used for the activities and privacies of domestic life manifested by the presence of a picnic table,a fire pit,and pruned trees.see dunn,at.fourth,the widgrens maintained a metal gate and no trespassing signs to protect the area from observation by people passing by although these measures may not have been enough in a more urban environment,erecting a fence likely would have added little privacy in this remote rural location.
our analysis does not end with a finding of curtilage.the supreme court has concluded that the fourth amendment does not absolutely bar all government encroachment upon the curtilage 
that the area is within the curtilage does not itself bar all police observation.the fourth amendment protection of the home has never been extended to require law enforcement officers to shield their eyes when passing by a home on public thoroughfares.nor does the mere fact that an individual has taken measures to restrict some views of his activities preclude an officer observations from a public vantage point where he has a right to be and which renders the activities clearly visible.
california ciraolo,d.
in addition,as noted above,a fourth amendment search occurs only where a reasonable expectation of privacy exists under katz two part test.first,we assume without deciding that the widgrens had a subjective expectation of privacy in the observation of their house exterior from within the curtilage for tax assessment purposes.second,we now address whether this expectation was one society recognizes as reasonable.to do so,we examine both what justice harlan called the individual sense of security,united states white,d harlan,dissenting,and the government intrusion at issue.
here,the sense of security or what a person had an expectation of pri
