it has become commonplace to observe that the world is getting smaller and that boundary lines between one country and the next have become blurred,if not nonexistent.yet those boundary lines still exist,and one of their more important functions is to allocate litigation among the several national court systems.this can be tricky,if a business relationship that has flowed seamlessly from one country to another goes sour.we have just such a case.gerardo coco,an italian businessman who had dealings with hyatt international corporation.hyatt in chicago concerning a property in italy,is fighting hyatt effort now to hale him into the courts to resolve some disputes that have arisen.his challenge to that attempt prevailed in the district court,but we conclude that the case should not have been dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction,and we therefore remand for further proceedings.
coco is a director and employee of holdings,limited,and of italia,collectively.holdings,limited,is a business organized under the laws of england with its principal place of business in london italia,is a business organized under the laws of italy,with its principal place of business in milan.
through the entities,coco enters into ventures for the development of real estate in the hospitality industry.he provides a full range of services as a developer,investor,broker,or even contractor for hotel properties.it was in these capacities that he was approached in by the english entity newpenny,limited newpenny,which had an option to purchase a real estate parcel suitable for a hotel in downtown milan.newpenny asked coco to facilitate its development of the parcel by finding investors willing to commit resources to the project.thinking he might find an interested party in hyatt,coco sent a fax to michael evanoff,hyatt vice president of development,at hyatt chicago headquarters.evanoff,apparently intrigued by the opportunity,responded positively,and later he met with coco to discuss the incipient project over dinner in london.at that time,coco unequivocally stated that he was acting merely as an agent of newpenny,and accordingly was not seeking a commission or broker fee from hyatt.evanoff confirmed hyatt interest in a possible deal.
flurries of faxes and phone calls between milan and chicago followed,and coco even visited evanoff at hyatt chicago headquarters on one occasion in connection with the proposed deal.the parties initial discussions contemplated an agreement whereby hyatt would own of the equity in the project,and coco and newpenny would own.but despite these promising efforts,that agreement fell apart,and on july,hyatt went ahead solo in the development of what will soon open as the park hyatt milan.at that point,coco the picture and claimed that hyatt owed him a broker fee for the work that he performed that ultimately led to hyatt project.hyatt took the opposite position,claiming that coco had expressly disclaimed any right to such a fee.
coco responded with two arguments.first,he referred to a supposed promise that hyatt made to him during one of the final meetings in milan,when hyatt expressed its desire to undertake the development without any assistance.this promise,he claimed,was backed by a later recommendation that he be provided a per key finders fee,as is supposedly customary,at least overseas.he further argued that hyatt could not have finalized this deal but for coco involvement,and he was accordingly entitled to some remuneration for his efforts.he attempted to reconcile this position with his earlier disclaimer of any right to a fee by asserting that the arrangement was effective only so long as there was some understanding between the parties that a partnership would ultimately be formed once hyatt took off on its own,he said,his status was transformed into that of a de facto broker.
more correspondence flowed between chicago and milan,and coco threatened to sue hyatt in milan for the fee he was owed.after a few such threats,hyatt filed an action under in the northern district of illinois seeking a declaratory judgment that it had no obligation to pay coco and his entities any fee or commission in connection with the hotel development.shortly thereafter,coco filed the threatened suit in the civil court of milan seeking payment for his services.
while pursuing the currently pending italian litigation,coco and moved to dismiss the illinois litigation on three grounds lack of personal jurisdiction,forum non conveniens,and the impropriety of a declaratory judgment in this matter.the district court agreed with the defendants on the first point,finding that even though coco had sufficient contacts with illinois throughout the partnership part of the deal,the transaction out of which he was asking for the fee was a separate event that took place entirely outside of illinois.pursuant to the transaction of business provision of the illinois statute,the district court dismissed the action for lack of personal jurisdiction.
impropriety of declaratory judgment 
because coco argument concerning the propriety of hyatt effort to obtain a declaratory judgment potentially implicates the district court jurisdiction,we choose to address it first recognizing that the option is ours,under ruhrgas ag marathon oil,d.the question,in short,is whether hyatt is impermissibly seeking an advisory opinion about its obligation to pay fees to coco.if it is,then we would have to dismiss the suit for lack of a proper article iii case or controversy.if not,or at a minimum if the record requires further development on this point,dismissal on that ground would be premature.
declaratory judgment actions serve an important role in our legal system insofar as they permit prompt settlement of actual controversies and establish the legal rights and obligations that will govern the parties relationship in the future.see edwin borchard,declaratory judgments.on the other hand,there is no doubt that the declaratory judgment mechanism can be abused.as we commented in hoover wagner,cir,d eclaratory relief is discretionary in a strong sense,but that is probably because it is often used to seize the forum from the natural plaintiff.id.at citations and emphasis omitted.in this case,the natural plaintiff is coco it is he who claims a right to a fee from hyatt,and hyatt that claims it has no such obligation.furthermore,hyatt action does not fit particularly well within the usual declaratory judgment pattern,under which the natural defendant wants to proceed with a business,the production of it is impeded because of a lack of clarity as to its legal rights,fearing something like a possible patent infringement suit.see charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure,ed.it is hard to see what harm hyatt would have suffered by waiting for coco to sue,other than the normal uncertainty a defendant experiences while the statute of limitations is running and there is a possibility of a later obligation to pay money damages.early resolution of a threat of litigation,in a friendly forum,is no doubt of value to a potential defendant,but the statute requires an actual controversy.that is easily seen in the patent example cited above,because the natural defendant is prevented from engaging in some conduct that the law does not aim to discourage as long as its patent rights are unclear.
indeed,it is not just that requires an actual controversy.as we have already noted,a declaratory action,like any other action,must satisfy article iii,which allows federal courts to act only in the event of actual cases and controversies.see maryland cas.pacific coal oil.the declaratory judgment plaintiff must be able to show that the feared lawsuit from the other party is immediate and real,rather than merely speculative.lake carriers ass macmullan,d norfolk southern ry.guthrie,cir.hyatt evidence on these points was thin,at least until coco proved its prediction right by filing his italian action.until it sued coco in the northern district of illinois,it was possible that coco repeated threats to sue hyatt in italy were no different from those of many other disgruntled.if anything,coco delay in instituting his threatened suit suggests that the prospect of litigation was unclear.on the other hand,because the district court did not reach this question,we may not have all the relevant facts.we do not know,for example,whether under italian law a broker has any kind of lien on the property or other powers to disrupt the business of hyatt new hotel in milan.if that were the case,then hyatt action bears a closer resemblance to other declaratory judgment suits in which the declaration of rights is a bona fide necessity for the natural judgment plaintiff to carry on with its business.
furthermore,the record may show that coco threats to sue had reached such a concrete point that hyatt legitimately needed a declaration of its rights and other legal relations in order to go forward with the project in question.if there was a potential oral agreement between itself and coco,the scope and terms of any such agreement could have an immediate effect on hyatt.of course the threat of suit,however immediate,is not by itself sufficient for the invocation of the federal power to issue a declaratory judgment as other courts have noted,the declaratory judgment act is not a tactical device whereby a party who would be a defendant in a coercive action may choose to be a plaintiff by winning the proverbial race to the courthouse.terra nova,acer latin.
the existence of these questions is enough for present purposes to allow us to conclude that dismissal at this time for lack of an article iii controversy would be premature.if coco had not sued,it would have been appropriate on remand to look into this question further.at this point,however,the matter has become somewhat academic,even though it remains true that later events can not control the propriety of the district court jurisdiction o nly the actions of the declaratory defendant known to the declaratory plaintiff at the time the action is commenced can be considered in determining whether such a threat exists.norfolk southern ry,at.see also trippe american power conversion,cir.we leave the question of any further exploration of this subject to the discretion of the district court.
personal jurisdiction

a federal court sitting in diversity must rely on the law of personal jurisdiction that governs the courts of general jurisdiction in the state where the court is sitting.dehmlow austin fireworks,cir.in this case,the law to which the district court correctly turned was that of illinois.even though the case is governed by state law,the method of service,in contrast,will be governed by fed.civ.rule e in turn allows use of the methods authorized by the law of the state in which the district court is located,while other parts of rule provide federally sanctioned alternatives.as we had occasion to observe in united rope,seatriumph marine,cir,a federal court borrowing a state jurisdictional statute may acquire personal jurisdiction only to the extent that the state law authorizes service of process.
illinois,like virtually every other state,authorizes service of process both on defendants to our or foreign defendants meaning both those from other states and those like coco from foreign countries.see ilcs.the question is whether any applicable limitations exist to make service on coco and his two companies improper.those limits might be found within the illinois statute itself,or,if the illinois statute goes beyond the scope authorized by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution,those limits might be constitutional in nature.we look first to the state statute,and then to the constitution.
the supreme court has adopted the labels first proposed in the academic literature that distinguish between general jurisdiction and specific jurisdiction.see helicopteros nacionales de colombia hall,nn.citing arthur von mehren and donald trautman,jurisdiction to adjudicate a suggested analysis,harv.revv.see also perkins benguet consol.mining.
general jurisdiction is proper only when the defendant has continuous and systematic contacts with the state in question if such contacts exist,the court may exercise personal jurisdiction over the defendant even in cases that do not arise out of and are not related to the defendant forum contacts.but as hyatt has not asserted that illinois can exercise general jurisdiction over the defendants,we consider only the propriety of specific jurisdiction,a more limited assertion of state power,in which personal jurisdiction exists for controversies that arise out of or are related to the defendant forum contacts.see steel warehouse of wisconsin,leach,cir.
illinois statute 
some statutes contain a list of permitted grounds of jurisdiction,into which a particular case must fit,while other statutes simply authorize the state courts to assert personal jurisdiction on any basis not forbidden by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.until,illinois statute was of the former type.in,however,the law was amended to add a new subsection c which reads as follows a court may also exercise jurisdiction on any other basis apart from those enumerated in subsections a and b now or hereafter permitted by the illinois constitution and the constitution of the united states.ilcs c see central states,southeast and southwest areas pension fund reimer express world,cir.hyatt argues that this addition in effect makes the enumerated grounds of jurisdiction superfluous,and leaves for us only the question whether the proposed assertion of jurisdiction would violate either the illinois constitution or the constitution.coco disagrees,claiming that the provision does not apply.
the district court agreed with coco and eschewed reliance on the instead,the court looked to a,which authorizes jurisdiction based upon t he transaction of any business within this state to see if coco could be reached that way.insofar as the enumerated sections are concerned,hyatt does not claim that the court should have consulted a different part of the law.under this provision,the district court found that coco acts in illinois were not sufficient to warrant the exercise of jurisdiction.it reached this conclusion by limiting its consideration of contacts to those related to coco actions after the partnership deal fell apart.only then,the court reasoned,did coco alleged brokerage arise.as coco had no contacts with illinois during that phase of his dealings with hyatt,specific jurisdiction could not be established.
the question before us is whether the district court properly interpreted.if,as coco and the district court thought,the provision of the statute covers only situations not already addressed in the enumerated sections,or if the is not available when a more specific section appears to cover the conduct at issue,then we would need to consider whether the court correctly evaluated the transaction of business that occurred here.if,on the other hand,the applies whether or not an enumerated section also seems pertinent,we can move directly to the illinois and federal constitutional analysis.
while we appreciate the logic of the district court conclusion,this court has already concluded that the illinois statute now permits its courts to exercise jurisdiction on any basis permitted by the illinois and united states constitutions.central states,at.the language of c precludes the narrower approach it would make no sense to refer to exercising jurisdiction also on any other basis,if subsecti
