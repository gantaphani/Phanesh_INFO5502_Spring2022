the gaps i mean,no one has seen them made or heard them made,but at spring we find them there 
in the spring of,a gap opened in one wall of a water canal in marseilles,illinois,causing the wall to collapse partially.this incident gave birth to a dispute between marseilles land and water company the canal company and marseilles hydro power llc the power company that lawsuit has already made one trip to this court.see marseilles hydro power,llc marseilles land and water,cir.the parties are fighting over who has the right to receive rents for the water running through the canal and who was responsible for keeping the wall in good repair.along the way,they have argued over land deeds,obligations to provide subjacent support,and certain indentures governing the rights and duties associated with the canal.three other parties have been swept into the fray.
four years into the dispute,the power company filed an eminent domain action in which it sought to condemn all of the canal company rights in the canal,in the water,in the surrounding land,and under the indentures.claims,crossclaims,and crossclaims were thrown into the hopper.the original and eminent domain cases became so entangled that the district court accidentally,but understandably,entered a partial judgment in one case under the wrong docket number.eventually,the court reached a final judgment in the eminent domain case,and it certified partial final judgments for two parts of the original case under.b the net result is the consolidated appeals now before us.we affirm the judgments of the district court.
the procedural history of this case was first called long and complex back in december.marseilles hydro power marseilles land water,llc,wl,dist.lexis.since then,matters have gotten worse.we summarize the high points for the convenience of the reader.
in,the canal company received a charter from the illinois general assembly to build a dam on the illinois river in marseilles.in,the canal company entered into an agreement with eugene chubbuck,the owner of a building next to the river,to supply water and maintain the canals in return for monthly rents in specified amounts the indentures.when illinois power succeeded chubbuck in and began to use the building for providing electrical power,the agreement was amended indentures.the power plant was decommissioned in or and was conveyed to the power company in soon thereafter,the power company also acquired the interests in the indentures.noting that the canal had fallen into disrepair,the power company ceased paying rents to the canal company in early.
this decision prompted the first,more complex lawsuit,to which we refer in this opinion as the original case c.in february,the power company sued the canal company for failing to keep the canals in good repair and slander of title.but s omething there is that does love a wall,that wants it down.the retaining wall collapsed in april,not long after the power company allowed the water to drain from the north race one of the two major parts to the canal.
in march,after the trip to this court noted earlier,in which we vacated an injunction that authorized the power company to enter upon the canal company property to repair the wall,the original case continued.the canal company counterclaimed for trespass and negligence and asserted claims against illinois power,field container field,and international paper.according to the canal company,illinois power is responsible for the collapse of the wall,because its power lines and guywires put too much tension on the structure.field and international paper were liable,it claimed,based on their alleged ownership of the wall,which was supposedly reflected in deeds of sale in and the deeds,and their failure to maintain it.in august,the court dismissed international paper from the lawsuit.
right after international paper left the picture,the power company received a license from the federal energy regulatory commission to recommission the power plant.this prompted it to file a second suit in february,to which we refer as the eminent domain case c,in which it sought to take the canal by eminent domain under the power granted to it by.
both the power company and the canal company had filed for summary judgment in the original case before the eminent domain action began.in may,the district court ruled on some of those motions,concluding that the power company was a under the indentures and holding in its favor on several other issues related to the indentures.the summary judgment did not resolve the entire dispute,however,and some of the motions lingered.
in june,the canal company threatened to open the head gates to the river and flood the north race,which had been dry since.the power company secured a temporary restraining order in the eminent domain suit against such an action,but the canal company defied the order and literally opened the floodgates.this prompted field to file a counterclaim against the canal company for trespass in the original case.
the eminent domain case was resolved first,when the court entered final judgment in the power company favor in january.it awarded all of the requested land and rights to the power company and set compensation for the taking at.the canal company appeal from that judgment,is one of the three now before us.
in october,the claims against field and illinois power in the original case were dismissed as untimely under the statute of limitations for property damage.unfortunately,the court accidentally entered that order under the docket number assigned to the eminent domain case,c.the district court also resolved the questions of who owned the retaining wall and who was responsible for certain obligations under the indentures in favor of field and illinois power and against the canal company.by may,the court had corrected the mistaken docket entry and recorded its decision in the proper place that is,c.at that point,however,it mistakenly cited b in its effort to certify these rulings for immediate appeal.the canal company filed the second appeal before us,in order to challenge the court decision that the statute of limitations barred its claims against field and illinois power.it filed yet a third appeal,from the district court resolution of the issues of ownership of the retaining wall,naming field and international paper as appellees,and obligations under the indentures,naming the power company as appellee.
in april,the parties agreed to dismiss field from the original case voluntarily.this left the original litigants,the power company and the canal company,and two of the appellees,illinois power and international paper.another defendant,north american hydro,is party to some claims that have not been finally adjudicated,and is not before this court.
before reaching the other issues,a jurisdictional question looms is appellate jurisdiction proper over the appeals from orders entered in the original case in attempting to certify the cases we have docketed as and as ready for immediate appeal,the district court cited b,which is for a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion.neither of the cases fits that standard,because both also purport to be from a final judgment and deal with issues of fact as well as issues of law.further,the district court did not state the appropriate reasons in writing in its order.id.finally,no one asked this court to accept the appeals,either within the requisite ten days given by b or otherwise.one thing,therefore,is certain these are not,and can not be,proper interlocutory appeals.
looking beyond the labels,however,we can see that the district court made the findings necessary to direct entry of a final judgment as to one or more,but fewer than all,claims or parties.see.b.first,it resolved particular claims,which we describe in more detail below.second,in keeping with the requirement of rule b to make an express determination that there is no just reason for delay,the court prepared final judgment forms in which it explicitly made that finding.the district court orders were,as the version of rule b required,entered on the docket.we are satisfied that the mention of b was a slip of the pen,and that in substance we have the certifications required by rule b.
that finding,however,raises a second question were the orders in question eligible for treatment under rule b assuming that counsel correctly represented that all claims concerning international paper and illinois power have been resolved in the district court,the answer is yes,because the rule authorizes certification when everything having to do with a particular party is wrapped up.if any loose ends remain with one or the other company,certification is still appropriate if certain claims have finally been resolved.that requires a somewhat more complex inquiry.if an examination of the record reveals that the claims on appeal are too similar to the issues remaining in the district court,then we would have to conclude that there was no partial final judgment of the sort contemplated by the rule.in such a case,we would have no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.see itofca,megatrans logistics,cir.when a district court invokes rule b,we have an independent obligation to ensure that its decision on a given claim is indeed a final one.see general electric,d.we must also decide whether the district court abused its discretion in determining that there was no just reason for delay.indiana harbor belt american cyanamid,cir.both questions involve consideration of the factual relation between the issues that have been resolved and those that remain.id.at quoting,at.noting that the standard of review for the separateness inquiry was left ambiguous.
there are no rules for determining whether two claims are separate for rule b purposes,but we find some guidance in amalgamated meat cutters butcher workmen thompson farms,cir.at a minimum,claims can not be separate unless separate recovery is possible on each hence,mere variations of legal theory do not constitute separate claims nor are claims so closely related that they would fall afoul of the rule against splitting claims if brought separately id.this inquiry involves comparing the issues at stake in the appealed claims and those remaining in the district court,american cyanamid,at,and determining whether there is a significant factual overlap,automatic liquid packaging,dominik,cir.in the course of this examination,we bear in mind that the rule defines a class of final judgments,suitable for appeal under.the scope of rule b must therefore be confined to situations where one of multiple claims is fully spare the court of appeals from having to keep relearning the facts of a case on successive appeals.american cyanamid,at quotation omitted.i f there are different facts and of course different issues consideration of the appeals piecemeal rather than all at once will not involve a duplication in the efforts required of the judges to prepare for argument in,and to decide,each appeal.jack walters sons morton,cir.even if two claims arise from the same event or occurrence,they may be separable for rule b purposes if they rely on entirely different legal entitlements yielding separate recoveries,rather than different legal theories aimed at the same recovery.
although,in the case before us,many of the claims on appeal and some still pending in the district court stem from the same collapse of the retaining wall in april issues raised in each part of the case are legally distinct and involve different facts.the case as a whole includes the following claims,all brought by the canal company a set arising under property law,based on the removal of lateral support by the draining of the north race,filed against the power company and north american hydro,both still in the district court claims in tort against illinois power,which have been resolved and are now on appeal and a pair of claims against field and international paper based on an interpretation of a deed,which have been finally resolved and are the subject of one of these appeals.
the last of those three is easiest to recognize as fully separable from the rest of the case.that part of the original litigation raised the question whether the and deeds did or did not convey the offending wall.the set of tort claims against illinois power are also factually and legally distinguishable from those alleged against the power company and north american hydro.the canal company complaint against illinois power ultimately concerns the guywires that illinois power attached to the retaining wall and a light pole that supposedly caused subsidence behind the retaining wall.the district court found these claims barred by the statute of limitations it did not reach the merits.the issues at stake in the inquiry into timeliness bear little or no relation to the causation inquiries needed to assess the claims against the power company and north american hydro,even though they arise from the same injury.compare fitigues,varat enterprises.separating review of an arbitration award from the rest of a contract dispute because the issues involved in the former were confined by statute.
even if we look behind the statute of limitations to the underlying factual overlaps,see minority police officers south bend,cir,the claims against illinois power and those against the power company and north american hydro arise from different sets of facts occurring in different periods invoking different legal regimes.the claims against illinois power arise from the allegedly negligent construction of improvements in and.the claims against the power company and north american hydro all relate to the draining or,as the parties call it,dewatering of the north race in,because this action allegedly destroyed the lateral support for the wall a question of property law.the periods covered by the two claims also differ considerably.while there will be some overlapping historical facts,a panel hearing an appeal from a final decision on the claims still pending before the district court group above will not have to rehash the same issues as we have had to investigate for this appeal.we conclude,therefore,that the ownership and tort claims now before us in and are sufficiently distinct from the remainder of the case that the use of rule b is appropriate.
from here the rest of the inquiry falls into place.the district court did not abuse its discretion in certifying that there was no just reason for delay under rule b.we thus turn to the merits in both the eminent domain appeal,and the two rule b appeals.
eminent domain 
the eminent domain case can be broken down into three parts whether the taking was necessary as specified in the statute,whether the scope was proper,and whether the court assessed compensation appropriately.as this judgment was entered after a full trial to the court,we review any findings of fact for clear error only,see.a,and we give de novo review to the court legal rulings.
under the federal power act,a ferc licensee may exercise the right of eminent domain w hen it can not acquire by contract or pledges the right to use or damage the lands or property of others necessary to the construction,maintenance,or operation of any dam,reservoir,diversion structure,or the works appurtenant or accessory thereto id.absolute inability to acquire the property is not required the statute contemplates merely the failure of a bona fide effort to acquire the rights through contract.see wilson union light power,cir.
the power company acquired its ferc license in november.although it did have some rights under the to use water flowing through the canal for generating contended that those rights were rendered effectively useless by the bad repair of the canal.it also alleged that the canal company failed to uphold its side of the indentures when it did not repair the canal or the collapsed retaining wall.this stubbornness,the power company claimed,made condemnation necessary.the canal company,for its part,disagreed,arguing that the power company never really engaged in any sincere negotiation,instead offering pittances as compensation in order,the canal company accused,to steal its assets.intending to demonstrate how wrong the power company was about the usability of the canals,the canal company violated a temporary restraining order in june of by flooding the north race.
the district court found that the canal was not in working order a finding that was not shaken by the unauthorized flooding.marseilles hydro power,llc marseilles land water,docket,wl,dist.lexis,june.although it is possible that the flooding might have created some evidence that the canal was useable,in the end the district court was entitled to place more weight on the light the act of flooding shed on the canal company unwillingness to negotiate,and thus the need for eminent domain.the flooding is indicative of a party who will accept a bargain only on its terms.this perception is fortified by the canal company own denied filing with ferc,which stated that the property,including the canals,wa s not available to the power company on a volitional basis.see order on reh g,ferc.this statement makes it clear that no amicable resolution was forthcoming.further,the existence of the original suit was premised on the power company efforts to exercise its right under the indentures to force the canal company to repair the canals.the canal company decision to resist that demand even through a lawsuit indicates an unwillingness to perform.there was no clear error in the district court factual finding that the use of eminent domain was reasonably necessary whether or not the canal was actually completely unusable,because the use of the canals could not be acquired from the canal company by contract or pledges.
the district court has already analyzed why each portion of the property to be condemned was necessary for the operation of the power plant.see marseilles hydro power,llc marseilles land water,docket,wl,dist.lexis.the fact that the court did not give the power company everything it wanted reflects the care it gave to this question.we do not need to rehearse its findings in detail here,for nothing was presented to us that would indicate any clear error.
the canal company argues instead that the power company should take none of the rights appurtenant to the property,only the real estate itself,because it asked only for rights related to streets and alleys abutting the property.this could be true only if one reads the eminent domain complaint selectively.paragraph a asks for f ull and clear fee simple title to the premises,including all improvements thereon and all interests therein and rights incident thereto of every kind and nature paragraph b reinforces the broad sweep of paragraph a by separately asking for the rights to the abutting streets and alleyways.
the canal company next asserts that some lesser property right would suffice,such as a license to use the water or an easement.on the facts found by the district court,this argument can not prevail.part of the court determination was that the power company had demonstrated its need for a acquisition of the property a lesser interest would not do.based on this record,we find no clear error in that decision.
compensation 
most of the dispute here is about the proper method for valuation of the rights and properties at stake.the canal company argues that the court improperly excluded evidence from its expert,david moody.this court reviews the question whether the district court properly interpreted.de novo,and its ultimate decision to admit or exclude for abuse of discretion.see united states allen,cir.
we do not need to review the question whether moody testimony should have been admitted or not because,if there was error at all,we are satisfied that it would be harmless.in a trial to the court as this was,the district judge is entitled to weigh the testimony,even if admitted,at his or her discretion.here,the judge would not have abused his discretion if he had admitted the testimony and then had weighed it lightly.the court laid out the reasons why it found each of the parties experts to be more or less credible.see marseilles hydro power,wl,dist.lexis at.it then analyzed the value of each section of the property and came up with a number much higher than what the power company offered,but lower than the canal company demand.id.at,dist.lexis at at.far from an abuse of discretion,this was a reasonable approach to take in the face of widely varying estimates.
furthermore,the district court recognized a limitation on value that the canal company did not the indentures limit the value of the water rights.the canal company can not get a higher price for the water without breaking the contract.thus,any valuation that presumed free use of the water would be inherently flawed,as the judge recognized.see id.at,dist.lexis at at.to the extent that somebody else could extract a higher value from the water,that would suggest that the highest and best use of the property is not what the canal company was proposing.compensation in eminent domain cases is only for the value lost to the owner,not the benefit gained by the condemnor.united states miller.describing compensation as no more than indemnity for the landowner loss.the value of the taking could not be measured by how the property might be used by a hypothetical third party it is only the value of what was lost to the condemnee.that value,in turn,was limited by the terms of the indentures.in short,we conclude that the district court findings with respect to the necessity,scope,and valuation of the taking were not clearly erroneous.
statute of limitations 
the second appeal before us,is from the dismissal of field and illinois power from the suit on statute of limitations grounds.we review this decision de novo.jones ge,cir.because field has been dismissed from the suit by consent,this issue is moot with respect to it.we will consider the statute of limitations only as it bears on the injury allegedly caused by illinois power.
the parties dispute which statute of limitations should apply.the power company argues for illinois statute of limitations governing damage arising from negligent construction of improvements,ilcs a the canal company would prefer the general limitations period on property damage,ilcs.a number of consequences flow from the choice of statute.the statute contains an explicit clause stating that the clock starts when the injured party knew or should reasonably have known of the injury.ilcs a.it also contains a statute of repose.ilcs b.the statute,in contrast,does not have either provision,and the cause of action has been held to accrue on the date of injury.bank trust rockford.
as we noted earlier,the canal company claims against illinois power arise from guywires that illinois power attached to the retaining wall in and a light pole it installed in.the former applied pressure to the retaining wall,while the latter accidentally broke a drainpipe,thereby allowing rainwater to wash away the soil behind the wall,causing subsidence.in either case,the injury was caused by construction of an improvement.where two statutes of limitations might apply,illinois courts instruct that we should apply the more specific one.see commonwealth edison walsh constr,d,construing as an exception to the general statute of limitations for property damage in.the district court found that the shorter statute of limitations applies here,and we agree.
because the statute applies,so does the discovery rule written into it.the district court found that a letter from the power company to the canal company in june marked the date of notice.the canal company objects that the letter,written by a lawyer,was inadmissible hearsay.that is incorrect it is not hearsay if it is used only to show notice.see.c and advisory cmte.notes if the significance of an offered statement lies solely in the fact that it was made,no issue is raised as to the truth of anything asserted,and the statement is not hearsay.at the latest,therefore,the clock began to run in june of.that clock expired in,well before illinois power was joined as a defendant.
we need not consider the question whether the harm alleged was a continuing injury or a continuing tort,nor the rather strong arguments for an earlier date of accrual.at the latest,the suit should have been brought by june,and it was not.the claims again
