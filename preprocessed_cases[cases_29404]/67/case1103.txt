in this case,we consider whether condominium owners can sue their condo association under the fair housing act fha,et,for alleged religious and racial discrimination that took place after the owners bought their condo unit.we highlight the word after because based on a prior opinion from this court,halprin prairie single family homes of dearborn park ass n,cir,the district court concluded that condo owners could rely on the fha to safeguard their rights from any discrimination.we took this case to the full court to consider this important question.upon careful review of the fha and our prior opinion in halprin,we conclude that in some circumstances homeowners have an fha cause of action for discrimination that occurred after they moved in.on the facts of this case,we conclude that lynne,helen,and nathan bloch have offered enough evidence to allow a trier of fact to decide whether they suffered intentional discrimination at the hands of the shoreline towers condo association and its president edward frischholz.we therefore reverse the summary judgment granted against the blochs.
i.the mezuzah dispute 
at the center of this case is a little rectangular box,about six inches tall,one inch wide,and one inch deep,which houses a small scroll of parchment inscribed with passages from the torah,the holiest of texts in judaism the scroll is called a mezuzah or in the plural form,mezuzot or mezuzoh.though small in size,the mezuzah is a central aspect of the jewish religious jews believe they are commanded by god to affix mezuzot on the exterior doorposts of their dwelling specifically,on the right doorpost when facing into the home,of the way down from the top of the doorway,within about three inches of the doorway opening.many jews touch and kiss the mezuzah and pray when entering a home with a mezuzah on the doorpost 
the blochs,residents of three units in the shoreline towers condominium building,are jewish.as residents,the blochs are subject to the rules and regulations enacted by the condo association board of managers.for approximately three decades,the blochs displayed mezuzot on the doorposts outside of their condo units without objection.
in,the association rules and regulations committee enacted a set of rules to govern certain activities taking place outside the units in the common hallways.lynne chaired that committee at that time and voted in favor of the rules.the hallway rules,as they have come to be called,stated 
mats,boots,shoes,carts or objects of any sort are prohibited outside unit entrance doors.
signs or name plates must not be placed on unit doors.
pets must not be left unattended in the hall.hallways should not be used as runs.
no alterations to the common area hallways are allowed.
no playing with or riding of bicycles,tricycles,roller blades,is allowed.
we most concerned with hallway rule.from the rules enactment until,the association did not remove mezuzot or any other object affixed to the outside of unit doors or doorposts,with the exception of a few pictures,depicting a swastika,a marijuana plant,and the playboy bunny.instead,the association ordinarily relied on rule to remove clutter from the hallways.
in may,the association began renovating the building hallways and repainted the walls and doors.the association asked residents to remove everything from their doors to prepare for the work.the blochs obliged and took down their mezuzot.when the work was finished,they put their mezuzot back up.but then,without notice to the blochs,the association began removing and confiscating the mezuzot.the association said that mezuzot on doorposts violated hallway rule,because objects of any sort included mezuzot.it included more than that,though,as the association also confiscated crucifixes,wreaths,christmas ornaments,political posters,and chicago bears pennants.
the blochs voiced their concerns to the association and provided the association with information explaining the religious significance of the mezuzah.for example,a letter from the chicago rabbinical council explained that jewish law requires mezuzot to be displayed on the exterior doorpost,rather than indoors.another letter explained that observant jews could not live in a place that prohibited them from affixing mezuzot to their doorposts.but the blochs received no relief from frischholz or the association.though frischholz knew as early as that removing mezuzot would be a problem for lynne bloch,he made no effort to stop the staff from repeatedly tearing them down.instead,he accused lynne of being a racist,called her a liar,encouraged other tenants to vote against her to the association board of managers,and told her that if she did like the way the rules were enforced,she should get out.he also admitted in his deposition that,when lynne was on the board,he held board events on friday evenings,despite knowing that lynne could not attend due to her religious obligations.when asked about whether he was aware of those obligations,he answered affirmatively,stating,she perfectly able.she decides not to she says that she ca attend after sunset,because it is shavus sic.he was well aware of lynne fidelity to judaic religious practices.
as for the board,it rejected a formal proposal by the blochs to change the rules.the association went on to warn the blochs that they would be fined if they continued to display their mezuzot.so for over a year,each time the blochs put their mezuzot back up,the association took them down.we also know that the mezuzah of at least one other jew,debra gassman,was removed pursuant to the reinterpretation of rule.
the mezuzah removals persisted even during the funeral of marvin bloch,lynne husband and helen and nathan father,despite the blochs request that the mezuzot be left up for the shivah,the jewish period of mourning frischholz had agreed to allow the mezuzah to stay up during shivah.the association also provided a coat rack and a card table,both of which were placed in the hall outside the blochs condo unit.a jug of water was placed on the table so visitors could wash their hands when returning from the cemetery.upon their return from the burial,though,the blochs and their guests,including a rabbi,were shocked to find the doorpost empty once again.the blochs were humiliated having to explain to the rabbi why,on the day of the funeral,their mezuzah was not on the doorpost.the coat rack and the table,however,were still sitting in the hallway.the blochs reaffixed the mezuzah after retrieving it from the management office.but on three more occasions during the shivah,the blochs were interrupted in their mourning as they confronted the shoreline towers maintenance staff who came to again take down their mezuzah.of course,we do vouch for the veracity of these facts and the inferences that can be drawn from them,but we must accept the facts as true and construe reasonable inferences in the blochs favor at this stage in the proceedings.
on september,the blochs filed this lawsuit,seeking an injunction and damages for distress,humiliation,and embarrassment.a magistrate judge entered an order prohibiting the defendants from removing the blochs mezuzot,consistent with a rule change the board of managers was considering.shortly thereafter,the board ratified the change,which created an exception to hallway rule for religious objects.in the coming months,the city of chicago would amend its code to proscribe in condos and rental properties restrictions on affixing religious signs or symbols to doorposts.see,municipal code,h.soon thereafter,the illinois legislature followed suit.see ilcs h.these legislative changes mooted the blochs claim for an injunction,but their claim for damages remains alive.
ii.the proceedings leading to rehearing en banc 
the blochs sought relief on both federal and state grounds.on the federal side,the blochs asserted three theories based on the fha,a,b,and and one on the civil rights act.the district court,however,granted summary judgment for the defendants on each federal theory.the court concluded that our decision in halprin precluded fha claims under a and b for discrimination that occurred while the blochs owned their condo unit,because halprin said the fha prohibited discrimination only at the time of sale.the district court also found that the record failed to show that the defendants harbored any discriminatory animus based on religion or race toward the blochs.since and require proof of discriminatory intent,the court found these claims meritless as well.finally,without any federal claims left,the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the blochs claims.
the blochs appealed to this court and the panel affirmed over a dissent.bloch frischholz,cir.the majority agreed with the district court that the blochs failed to present sufficient evidence of intentional discrimination to survive summary judgment.in the majority view,the hallway rules were neutrally adopted and enforced,so the blochs merely sought a religious accommodation.id.at.though the fha permits accommodations for disabilities,it is silent as to religious accommodations.id.because we can not create what congress left out,the majority concluded the blochs discrimination claims must fail,regardless of the theory.id.
the dissent,on the other hand,did see a request for accommodation but rather a straightforward claim for intentional discrimination.id.at wood,dissenting.the dissent examined the statute and found that the blochs could maintain a claim for discrimination under the fha halprin left enough room for the blochs to rely on a and b.id.at.concluding that the fha could give the blochs a cause of action,the dissent went on to argue that,based on the record,it does.the dissent contended that the majority prematurely characterized the blochs claim as one for an exception to the supposedly neutral hallway rules.whether hallway rule reached mezuzot at all,the dissent argued,was a disputed material issue of fact.moreover,the dissent found that the blochs marshaled sufficient facts to show that the association reinterpretation of the hallway rule in to include mezuzot was intentionally discriminatory.in other words,though hallway rule text was facially neutral,the record contained evidence that the defendants enforcement of it was done with discriminatory animus,allowing the blochs to proceed to trial.id.at.
iii.the fair housing act 
this case presents essentially two questions.first,under which federal theories,if any,can the blochs seek relief we focus exclusively on the three fha provisions to determine whether any of them supports a claim for discrimination second,did the blochs offer sufficient evidence of discrimination to proceed to trial on one or more of their federal theories 
we begin with the fha.the blochs argue they can sustain independent claims under all three provisions,a,b,and.the defendants,by contrast,contend that none of these statutes provides the blochs an avenue for relief because the fha,with respect to condo owners,is addressed only to discrimination that takes place in the sale of housing.they assert that the fha protections are left on the doorstep as owners enter their new homes.we examine each of the three theories in turn.
section a makes it unlawful t o refuse to sell or rent after the making of a bona fide offer,or to refuse to negotiate for the sale or rental of,or otherwise make unavailable or deny,a dwelling to any person because of race,color,religion,sex,familial status,or national origin.the issue is whether this text prohibits any form of discrimination after the buyer or renter signs on the dotted line.we recognize that the plaintiffs in this case are owners rather than renters,but there is no reason that there would be a distinction under the relevant provisions of the fha.our opinion in halprin left little room for a discrimination claim.halprin also involved allegations of harassment members of the homeowners association allegedly graffitied and vandalized the plaintiff property and thwarted the plaintiff attempts to investigate this conduct.at.this harassment did not give rise to an fha claim,we concluded in halprin,because the fha by and large concerned only access to housing.id.at emphasis in original.
nonetheless,halprin noted that a s a purely semantic matter the statutory language might be stretched far enough to reach a case of constructive eviction.id.that statutory language is the otherwise make unavailable or deny part,which is not tethered to the words sale or rental that constrain the other two a clauses.availability of housing is at the heart of a.section a is designed to ensure that no one is denied the right to live where they choose for discriminatory reasons.southend neighborhood improvement ass county of clair,cir.there could be situations where a person is denied that right after he or she moves in.prohibiting discrimination at the point of sale or rental but not at the moment of eviction would only go halfway toward ensuring availability of housing.a landlord would be required to rent to an but then,the day after he moves in,could change all the locks and put up signs that said,no blacks allowed.that clearly could not be what congress had in mind when it sought to create truly integrated and balanced living patterns.trafficante metro.life ins,d quotation omitted.so we agree with halprin that a may reach discriminatory conduct that makes a dwelling unavailable to the owner or tenant,somewhat like a constructive eviction.see evans tubbe,cir.unit a concluding that defendant depriving access to property on account of race arguably violated a.
the question here is whether the defendants have made the blochs units unavailable because of their religion or their race.proving constructive eviction is a tall order,but it the best analogy the blochs give to support their argument.ordinarily,the plaintiff in such a case must show her residence is unfit for occupancy,often to the point that she is compelled to leave.black law dictionary ed.plaintiffs must show more than a mere diminution in property values,see southend neighborhood,at cox city of dallas,cir,more than just that their properties would be less desirable to a certain group,see tenafly eruv ass tenafly,cir.even in halprin,the allegations of the defendants blatantly discriminatory acts,including spraying the plaintiff yard with harmful chemicals,were insufficient to give rise to a a claim.availability,not simply habitability,is the right that a protects.see southend neighborhood,at section a does not protect the intangible interests in the property raised by the plaintiffs sic allegations.jersey heights neighborhood ass glendening,cir rejecting plaintiff claim that selection of site for new highway construction violated a because plaintiff failed to allege that anyone has for discriminatory reasons been evicted from his home or denied the right to purchase or rent housing clifton terrace,united techs,a lack of elevator service is a matter of habitability,not availability,and does not fall within the terms of these subsections.
still,despite the analogy to constructive eviction,nothing in a suggests that unavailability refers only to the physical condition of the premises.c ourts have construed the phrase otherwise make unavailable or deny in subsection a to encompass mortgage redlining,insurance redlining,racial steering,exclusionary zoning decisions,and other actions by individuals or governmental units which directly affect the availability of housing to minorities.southend neighborhood,at citing cases.in other words,the defendant need not burn the plaintiff house down for the plaintiff to have an fha claim.a defendant can engage in practices tantamount to redlining that make a plaintiff dwelling unavailable.
the blochs argue that the defendants reinterpretation of hallway rule rendered shoreline towers unavailable to them and other observant jews because their religion requires that they be able to affix mezuzot to their doorposts.letters from the mezuzah division of chicago mitzvah campaigns,the rabbinical council of chicago,and the decalogue society of lawyers state that jewish law requires observant jews to place mezuzot on the exterior of their entrance doorposts.one went so far as to explain that,a jew who is not permitted to affix mezuzohs as aforesaid to all of the doorposts of his dwelling would therefore be required by jewish law not to live there.we think this evidence is sufficient to establish a dispute about whether shoreline towers was unavailable to observant jews.
but was it ever unavailable to the blochs though our interpretation of unavailability under the fha is undoubtedly a matter of federal law,an analogy to the common law property concept of constructive eviction is useful.the defendants argue that the blochs were never evicted,actually or constructively,because they never vacated the premises.the defendants point is.to establish a claim for constructive eviction,a tenant need not move out the minute the landlord conduct begins to render the dwelling this case,when the defendants began enforcing the hallway rule to take down the blochs mezuzot.tenants have a reasonable time to vacate the premises.auto.supply,see also shaker,med.techs.group,d.nonetheless,it is that constructive eviction requires surrender of possession by the tenant,infinity broad.of prudential ins.of,cir citing cases restatement second of landlord tenant,cmt.e auto.supply,at,shaker,at jmb props.urban paolucci,d,sigsbee swathwood,see also black law dictionary,supra,at.if the tenant fails to vacate within a reasonable time,she waives her claim for constructive eviction.auto.supply,at,jmb props.urban,at dell armi builders,johnston,d.
we recognize that the analogy to constructive eviction is imperfect.section a concerns making a dwelling unavailable,not constructive eviction per se.still,the blochs never moved out.though the blochs compare their plight to constructive eviction,they give no reason why they failed to vacate.instead,they stayed put and resisted by repeatedly replacing their mezuzot the defendants allegedly discriminatory enforcement of hallway rule for over a year before a court enjoined the rule enforcement and the association amended the rules.whether unavailability means that a plaintiff must,in every case,vacate the premises to have a a claim is an issue we refrain from reaching but based on these facts,we see no possibility that a reasonable jury could conclude that the defendants conduct rendered shoreline towers unavailable to the blochs,which is what a requires.see infinity,at holding that district court correctly declined to render an advisory opinion where plaintiff sued for constructive eviction but had not yet vacated premises shaker,at delay to find new location deemed unreasonable auto.supply,at,delay after loss of heat deemed unreasonable sigsbee,at delay deemed unreasonable.section a does not contemplate attempted constructive eviction.
the panel dissent raised one other possibility for the hallway rule restricted not only the blochs ability to live in their unit but also their ability to sell to other observant jews.to borrow the words from the dissent,hallway rule operates exactly as a redlining rule does with respect to the ability of the owner to sell to observant jews.no such person could buy a unit at shoreline towers.the association might as well hang a sign outside saying,no observant jews allowed.bloch,at wood,dissenting.such a sign would undoubtedly violate a hence,so would the hallway rule.however,the blochs never made this argument to the district court,and moreover,offered no evidence that they intended to sell their units and that the rule enforcement stifled their efforts.as such,we conclude that the blochs can not proceed under a 
turning to the second of the three fha theories,b makes it unlawful t o discriminate against any person in the terms,conditions,or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling,or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith,because of race,color,religion,sex,familial status,or national origin.again,our task is to determine whether this provision proscribes the sort of discrimination alleged in this case.subsection b language is broad,mirroring title vii,which we have held reaches both discrimination.see kyles guardian sec,cir courts have recognized that title viii is the functional equivalent of title vii,and so the provisions of these two statutes are given like construction and application.internal citations omitted dicenso cisneros,cir w e recognize a hostile housing environment cause of action under the fha,and begin our analysis with the more familiar title vii standard.nonetheless,halprin found the scope of this provision more limited than title vii,at,and the defendants rely on halprin to argue that the fha does not reach any claims of discrimination.we read halprin more narrowly,however,and see two possibilities for relief in this case,only the latter of which is viable for the blochs.
like subsection a,constructive eviction is an option under b as well.as we recognized in halprin,the right to inhabit the premises is a privilege of sale.at.deprivation of that right by making the premises uninhabitable violates b.see cox,at section b may encompass the claim of a current owner or renter for actual or constructive eviction.however,as we just discussed,the blochs have no constructive eviction claim.so this b avenue is closed to them.
but the privilege to inhabit the condo is not the only aspect of b that this case implicates.the blochs alleged discrimination by their condo association,an entity by which the blochs agreed to be governed when they bought their units.this agreement,though contemplating future,governance by the association,was nonetheless a term or condition of sale that brings this case within b see cox,at section b may encompass the claim of a current owner or renter for attempted and unsuccessful discrimination relating to the initial sale or rental.lundy,cir w hen a landlord imposes on white tenants the condition that they may lease his apartment only if they agree not to receive blacks as guests,the landlord has discriminated against the tenants in the terms,conditions and privileges of rental on the grounds of race.
shoreline towers operates under a common plan or declaration that sets forth the rights,easements,privileges,and restrictions subject to which condo owners take their units upon purchase.unit owners must,for instance,pay their share of the expenses of administration,maintenance,and repair of the building common elements.the declaration also establishes a board of managers,elected by the unit owners,to oversee the administration of the building the declaration vests the board with the authority to carry out this duty.for example,the board can cause certain repairs to the common elements to be performed at a unit owner expense.the board may also adopt and enforce rules and regulations that it deem s advisable for the maintenance,administration,management,operation,use,conservation and beautification of the property,and for the health comfort,safety and general welfare of the unit owners and occupants of the property.so,upon purchasing their units,the blochs agreed to be bound by the enactments of the board of managers,both present and future.
this contractual connection between the blochs and the board distinguishes this case from halprin.halprin made it clear that b is not broad enough to provide a blanket privilege to be free from all discrimination from any source.plaintiffs generally can not sue under for isolated acts of discrimination by other private property owners.neither the fha text nor its legislative history indicates an intent to make quarrels between neighbors a routine basis for federal litigation.at.as deplorable as it might have been,the defendants alleged conduct in halprin was not linked to any of the terms,conditions,or privileges that accompanied or were related to the plaintiffs purchase of their property.but that what b requires.
here,however,the blochs agreement to subject their rights to the restrictions imposed by the board was a condition of the blochs purchase the board power to restrict unit owners rights flows from the terms of the sale.and the blochs alleged that the board discriminated against them in wielding that power.consequently,because the blochs purchased dwellings subject to the condition that the condo association can enact rules that restrict the buyer rights in the future,b prohibits the association from discriminating against the blochs through its enforcement of the rules,even facially neutral rules.
allowing certain claims for discrimination to proceed under b is also consistent,as the panel dissent observed,with regulations adopted by hud,the agency responsible for implementing the fha.the hud regulations explain that b protections extend to prohibit l imiting the use of privileges,services or facilities associated with a dwelling because of race or religion of an owner,tenant or a person associated with him or her.b emphasis added.though a rote application of chevron deference might be inconsistent with the judicially enforceable nature of the fha private right of action,see adams fruit barrett,d naacp am.family mut.ins,cir,the supreme court has nonetheless recognized that hud views about the meaning of the fha are entitled to great weight,trafficante,at.see also naacp,at it would be weird to say that title viii applies on judicial review of administrative actions but not when the litigation begins in district court.accordingly,if the blochs produced sufficient evidence of discrimination,we conclude that b could support the blochs claim.
the blochs third and final fha theory arises under,which makes it unlawful to coerce,intimidate,threaten,or interfere with any person in the exercise or enjoyment of,or on account of his having exercised or enjoyed,or on account of his having aided or encouraged any other person in the exercise or enjoyment of,any right granted or protected by section,or of this title.the blochs argue that supports a discrimination claim independent of any allowed under.interference with the enjoyment of fair housing rights,they argue,encompasses a broader swath of conduct than an outright deprivation of those rights.supporting the blochs position is a hud regulation,c,which prohibits t hreatening,intimidating or interfering with persons in their enjoyment of a dwelling because of the race or religion of such persons,or of visitors or associates of such persons.interference with the enjoyment of a dwelling could only occur.see lake county highway dep t,cir.
whether a violation of can exist without a violation of or any other fha provision is a question we have routinely reserved.see hous.ctr.greater suburban bd.of realtors,cir citing metro.hous.dev.vill.of arlington heights,cir.courts are split on the issue.compare frazier rominger,cir,and reule sherwood valley i council of,wl,at.oct,with united states koch,d,and stackhouse desitter.in some instances,we have held that the circumstances of the case make and violation of one necessarily means a violation of the other.see arlington heights,at sections and violated if defendant refusal to rezone was done with discriminatory intent or had discriminatory effect.here,however,that need not be the case.we know that the association enforcement of the hallway rule did not constructively evict the blochs in violation of a or b.but that does not foreclose the possibility that the defendants interfered with the blochs enjoyment of their rights or coerced or intimidated the blochs on account of their having exercised those rights.to hold otherwise would make entirely duplicative of the other fha provisions though its language is unique in the fha,would have no independent meaning.but when the legislature uses certain language in one part of the statute and different language in another,the court assumes different meanings were intended.sosa,d quoting singer,statutes and statutory construction,ed.coercion,intimidation,threats,or interference with or on account of a person exercise of his or her rights can be distinct from outright violations of.for instance,if a landlord rents to a white tenant but then threatens to evict him upon learning that he is married to a black woman,the landlord has plainly violated,whether he actually evicts the tenant or not.that and might overlap in some circumstances is neither unusual nor unfortunate.see united states naftalin,d quotation omitted naacp,at.
despite the fact that a claim might stand on its own,halprin seems to cut the legs out from under it in a case like this.because covers conduct,halprin goes,is likewise limited to interference with rights.at.but,as we discussed above,even halprin recognized that might not be constrained to purely discrimination.sections a and b prohibit discriminatory evictions.eviction,actual or constructive,can only occur after the sale or rental is complete.therefore,interference with certain rights protected by that prohibit discriminatory also occur.we recognize this interpretation effectively overrules halprin as far as is concerned.but in light of our view that prohibits discriminatory evictions,it follows that attempted discriminatory evictions can violate prohibition against interference with rights.though requires that the plaintiffs dwelling be made truly unavailable,or that defendants deprived plaintiffs of their privilege to inhabit their dwelling,the text of is not so limited.we agree with the blochs and the united states,appearing as amicus in this case that reaches a broader range of conduct.a claim for coercion,intimidation,threats,and interference with or on account of plaintiff rights does not require that the plaintiff actually vacate the premises.
we find this construction of consistent with congress intent in enacting the fha the reach of the proposed law was to replace the ghettos by truly integrated and balanced living patterns.trafficante,at.internal quotation omitted.requiring the blochs to vacate their homes before they can sue undoubtedly stifles that purpose.moreover,our view is consistent with hud interpretation of.hud regulations prohibit interfering with persons in their enjoyment of a dwelling because of the race or religion of such persons.c emphasis added.as we noted before,a rote chevron analysis might be inappropriate in this context,see adams fruit,at,but we still must give hud interpretations of the fha great weight,trafficante,at.naacp,at.hud regulations confirm that can,in appropriate circumstances,apply to discrimination that does not result in eviction.
so the question in this case becomes whether the defendants coerced,intimidated,threatened,or interfered with the blochs exercise or enjoyment of their right to inhabit their condo units because of their race or religion.to prevail on a claim,a plaintiff must show that she is a protected individual under the fha,she was engaged in the exercise or enjoyment of her fair housing rights,the defendants coerced,threatened,intimidated,or interfered with the plaintiff on account of her protected activity under the fha,and the defendants were motivated by an intent to discriminate,at.interference is more than a quarrel among neighbors or an isolated act of discrimination,but rather is a pattern of harassment,invidiously motivated.halprin,at dicenso,at honce vigil,cir.
discriminatory intent is the pivotal element in this case.the blochs clearly meet the first two elements they are jewish and they lived in the condo units they purchased at shoreline towers.the defendants also engaged in a pattern of conduct,repeatedly ripping down the blochs mezuzot for over a year time.this conduct would constitute interference if it was invidiously is,if it was intentionally discriminatory.thus,like their b claim for discrimination in the terms or conditions of sale and their claim,if the blochs produced sufficient evidence of discrimination,they can proceed under for interference with their rights.
iv.intentional discrimination 
whether the blochs demonstrated a triable issue as to discrimination is the central question that divided the panel of this court that previously considered this case.not seeing any evidence of discriminatory animus,the panel majority viewed the blochs claim as one seeking a religious exception to a neutral rule of general applicability because the hallway rules applied to all objects,not just mezuzot.bloch,at.under the supreme court reasoning in employment division smith,d,the association failure to grant a mezuzah exception is not tantamount to intentiona
