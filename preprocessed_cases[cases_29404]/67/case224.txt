stanley and eunice kozikowski appeal from the district court order granting toll brothers,toll motion to dismiss,converted by the court into a motion for summary judgment.the kozikowskis challenge the district court finding that the statute of limitations began to run on their claims in the court finding that the kozikowskis failed to establish equitable estoppel and the court decision not to permit mandatory discovery to the kozikowskis prior to considering toll motion to dismiss,which the court had converted to a motion for summary judgment.we affirm the district court,but on different grounds as to the kozikowskis deceit claims.
background 
on june,the kozikowskis entered into a purchase and sale agreement with franklin chase limited partnership the contract called for the purchase of a luxury home to be constructed in franklin,massachusetts for.the sale agreement provided the buyer with a insured limited warranty against structural defects.on july,toll applied for a building permit from the town of franklin.following issuance of the permit,toll commenced construction of the home.on december,after five months of construction,the town issued a certificate of occupancy confirming that the home was fit for occupancy.five days later,the closing took place and franklin chase transferred title to the kozikowskis.the kozikowskis and franklin chase also signed a separate agreement in response to the kozikowskis complaints about certain construction deficiencies and deviations from the model of the home.in this separate agreement,franklin chase,as the seller,agreed to construct and install,at no further cost,various extra items in the home.in exchange,the kozikowskis agreed that any and all construction deficiencies,including but not limited to those deficiencies which have been brought to the seller attention,are forgiven and that any corrective action to be taken will be the buyer responsibility,and released the seller from any and all obligations to cause further corrective action to be taken therein.the release explicitly stated,however,that franklin chase obligations under the limited warranty would remain in effect.the final purchase price was.
over the next several years,the kozikowskis complaints about the home continued.on september,the kozikowskis and franklin chase entered into yet another agreement under which franklin chase paid the kozikowskis with the understanding that the kozikowskis would use the money to repair chimney and fireplace problems.in turn,the kozikowskis released both franklin chase and toll from all claims relating to the home fireplace and chimneys.
in november,the kozikowskis filed a complaint with the town of franklin alleging a number of problems in the home construction.in february,allan fraser,then the town building commissioner,inspected the property and found thirteen building code violations,including problems with the home foundation,air circulation system,and certain parts of the home construction.fraser ordered toll to submit a written proposal for specific corrective action to address the problems as well as a specific time schedule for accomplishing the work.fraser communicated with both the kozikowskis and toll with regard to this set of building code violations.through its engineering consultant,toll submitted proposals to correct the violations.fraser approved the proposals but wrote to the kozikowskis that it was beyond his authority to determine whether toll would actually follow through with the remedial work and that it is really between you folks and toll to work out mutually acceptable times and access for completion of these items.
though toll did resolve some of the kozikowskis complaints unrelated to the building code violations,it failed to take care of the specific code violations that fraser had identified.in,the kozikowskis threatened to file a formal complaint and contact the media in response to toll failure to resolve their problems.nothing immediately came of those threats.later that year,toll donated two thousand feet of paving to the town,calling it an attempt to help the town with its increasing responsibilities due to residential development.in a report to the town council,however,the town administrator stated that toll made the donation to resolve some problems with the building inspection department.there was no public indication that the donation had anything to do with the kozikowkis complaints.
the situation with the kozikowskis home remained largely unresolved despite repeated demands by the kozikowskis.in august,they offered to release toll from all claims in exchange for an room off the back of the house.on august,in an apparent response to a written complaint that the kozikowskis had filed,robert toll,chairman and ceo of toll,wrote to the kozikowskis that he had passed their letter on to senior management and assured them that they would be treated fairly.on september,however,william gilligan,toll,responded to the kozikowskis release offer and stated that toll would neither build the room nor undertak e any additional corrective measures because of the december,release agreement.
in january,after members of the kozikowski family experienced various illnesses,the bay state gas company inspected the home,found high carbon dioxide levels,and advised the family not to use the fireplaces or any other unit.the kozikowskis contacted gilligan,who despite his previous letter,suggested that the kozikowskis schedule an appointment to inspect the problem and that if the problem was toll responsibility,we will correct it.
in july,a second inspection of the home by the town building commissioner,now matthias mulvey,revealed eighteen building code violations,many of them identical to the violations found in.the commissioner sent a letter to toll advising them of the violations.subsequently,the norfolk county district attorney brought a criminal complaint against toll,which was ultimately dismissed.on april,the kozikowskis demanded relief from toll under massachusetts consumer protection laws.settlement talks failed and the kozikowskis commenced suit against toll in superior court for common law deceit,deceit as a violation of.ch,breach of express warranty,and breach of express warranty in violation of.ch.
following removal of the case to federal court,toll moved to dismiss the complaint as.on september,the district court held a hearing on toll motion to dismiss and converted the motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment.both parties agreed that such a conversion was appropriate,but the kozikowskis requested the opportunity to conduct additional discovery to develop an equitable estoppel argument.the district court gave the kozikowskis the next sixty days to conduct three depositions concerning their equitable estoppel claim and further instructed that,on the basis of these three depositions,they could supplement the record but solely on the issue of equitable estoppel.after receiving several extensions,the kozikowskis provided the district court with a supplemental brief as well as various exhibits and one deposition,that of matthias mulvey.the court thereafter granted summary judgment in favor of toll after ruling that all of the kozikowskis claims began accruing no later than and were therefore barred by applicable statutes of limitations.see d at.the court also rejected the kozikowskis equitable estoppel argument.see id.at.
ii.discussion 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.cadle hayes,cir.
statute of repose 
although the district court decision did not address the applicability of the statute of repose,toll raised the issue both in its motion to dismiss and here on appeal.toll argues for affirmance pursuant to the statute of repose for claims involving construction and improvement to real property.ch,see also nett bellucci,cir federal courts sitting in diversity jurisdiction apply massachusetts statute of repose,which is deemed substantive rather than procedural.we agree that applies to the kozikowskis two deceit claims and hence affirm their dismissal on that basis.provides in pertinent part 
actions of tort for damages arising out of any deficiency or neglect in the design,planning,construction or general administration of an improvement to real property in no event shall be commenced more than six years after the earlier of the dates of the opening of the improvement to use or substantial completion of the improvement and the taking of possession for occupancy by the owner.
ch.the deadline set forth in operates without regard to when a plaintiff discovers any injury allegedly caused by tortious activity by the architect or contractor at issue.see klein catalano.it serves the well recognized public purpose of protecting those engaged in the construction industry from defending claims brought against them long after evidence has dissipated and strikes a reasonable balance between the public right to a remedy and the need to place an outer limit on the tort liability of those involved in construction.id.at.
the kozikowskis common law and statutory deceit claims sound in tort and arise out of the design and construction of the home.in both claims,the kozikowskis allege that toll misrepresented that their home was constructed in compliance with state and municipal building codes and was safe and fit for occupancy.the deceit claim specifically alleges that toll knowingly concealed and failed to inform the kozikowskis of the building code defects.
the kozikowskis argue that their deceit claim under ch.is not barred by the statute of repose,because,as in sullivan iantosca,the alleged violation occurred in the sale of the house.the massachusetts supreme judicial court in sullivan reasoned that grants protection to designers,planners,builders,and the like but not to people who sell real estate.id.at.the kozikowskis allege that toll acted as both builder and seller of the property,and claim that,as the seller of the property,toll violated ch.by concealing known defects in the home.accordingly,the kozikowskis contend,their chapter deceit claim should not be barred by the statute of repose.
in this transaction,toll was the builder of the home.franklin chase is denoted as the seller in the sale agreement,the december,release,and the resulting deed of the property.toll itself is nowhere mentioned in any of these crucial instruments.it is,however,specifically listed as the applicant in the building permit and certificate of occupancy as one would expect.importantly,the kozikowskis made no effort below to pierce the corporate veil between franklin chase and toll,or otherwise prove that toll was the seller of the home.
accordingly,we assess whether the statute of repose began to run for the deceit claims against toll solely in its capacity as the builder of the house and not as seller.toll argues that the opening of the improvement to use took place on december,when the town issued the certificate of occupancy after inspecting the home.five days later,substantial completion of the improvement and the taking of possession for occupancy by the owner occurred at the sale closing and title transfer,immediately after which the kozikowkis moved into the home.the massachusetts supreme judicial court has ruled that the statute of repose begins to run when a certificate of occupancy is issued and the owners move into the home.see aldrich add.
we agree.according to,toll was therefore subject to tort liability in connection with its construction of the home only until,at the latest,december.the deceit claims,filed in november,since they arise solely out of toll actions as builder,and not seller,are hence by the statute of repose.
statutes of limitation 
the district court held that all of the kozikowskis claims,both for breach of warranty and deceit,were.because we dispose of the kozikowskis two deceit claims as barred by the statute of repose,see supra,we examine the massachusetts statutes of limitation applicable only to the breach of express warranty claims see,pitts aerolite spe,federal courts sitting in diversity jurisdiction apply state statutes of limitation.
under chapter,unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.ch,a.the kozikowskis argue that toll alleged breach of warranty constitutes an unfair or deceptive act covered by chapter.the statute of limitations for claims is four years from the accrual date.ch.the statute of limitations for common law breach of warranty claims is six years.ch.breach of warranty actions start accruing when the plaintiff knew or reasonably should have known of the breach.see anthony pier four,crandall dry dock eng rs.in both breach claims,the kozikowskis allege that toll breached its express warranty that the home would comply with the state building code.the district court held that both claims,at the latest,started accruing in,when the kozikowskis were notified by the town of their home thirteen building code violations,and were hence.
the kozikowskis contend that the applicable statutes of limitation did not begin to run until july,when mulvey inspected the home.they claim that until then,they did not know or have reason to know that the home had such major structural defects as to mean it could not be occupied.the building code violations cited in the inspection by fraser,they contend,were just minor and did not point to major defects in the home construction.
as an initial matter,the kozikowskis argue this issue for the first time here on appeal hence,we deem it waived.see sierra fria donald evans,cir noting appellant waived argument for the first time on appeal by failing to present it below fed.deposit ins,cir except in horrendous cases where a gross miscarriage of justice would occur,this court will not consider an argument presented for the first time on appeal internal citations omitted.toll,in its august,reply memorandum in support of defendant motion to dismiss,warned,defendant toll submits this reply memorandum to address plaintiffs misplaced reliance on the doctrine of equitable estoppel.indeed,plaintiffs devote nearly the entirety of their opposition to this doctrine,and,in so doing,tacitly concede that absent its application,all of their claims are barred by the applicable statutes of limitations.the kozikowskis supplemental brief in opposition to defendant motion to dismiss continued to fail to challenge toll position that the claims began accruing in or earlier.in turn,the district court stated,the kozikowskis have not disputed that the statutes of limitations began to run on their claims in.rather,they have responded to toll invocation of the statutes of limitations on their four claims by invoking the doctrine of equitable estoppel.d at.
even if the kozikowskis had not waived their challenge of the accrual date and were we to assume the issue was forfeit and subject to plain error review,there was no plain error.the record shows that the kozikowskis were put on notice of construction and structural defects in their home as far back as the year of their purchase.in,as evidenced by the december release,the kozikowskis complained about alleged construction deficiencies even before moving into the house.in their letter to the town administrator,they complained about outright mistreatments by toll and outlined a long list of alleged building deficiencies which included numerous unresolved,partially resolved,and inadequately resolved construction problems.in the same letter,the kozikowskis went so far as to suggest that criminal charges for fraud and misrepresentation should be brought against toll.in fraser letter to toll notifying the company of the building code violations,it was made clear that the kozikowskis were aware of the violations explicitly referenced in the letter moreover,fraser sent a copy of this letter to the kozikowskis themselves.their claim that fraser report contained just minor problems with the home is disingenuous and incorrect.mulvey report on which they base their argument sets forth many of the same in fireplace and insulation systems among fraser listed after his inspection.the record is replete with explicit and implicit acknowledgments by the kozikowskis that they knew or learned about al
