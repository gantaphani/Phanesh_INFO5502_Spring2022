on april,keokuk junction railway company kjry filed with the surface transportation board the stb a feeder line application under the staggers rail act of,by this application,kjry sought a court order mandating the sale of a rail line owned by toledo,peoria western railway.after extensive litigation on the subject,the stb granted this application,having found that kjry had met the statutory requirements it set the line net liquidation value,which is composed of the salvage value of the line track and other materials plus the value of land owned in fee by,at.subsequently filed a petition for reconsideration,which the stb granted in part and denied in part.specifically,the stb found error in its previous valuation analysis and revised the value of the line upward to.
subsequently filed a petition in this court seeking review of the order of the stb it contends that the stb erroneously calculated the constitutional minimum value of the line.according to,the stb should have valued the track and other materials using current market prices of steel rather than a average.in addition,submits that the stb should have considered rebuttal evidence from,which called into question the validity of the analysis performed by kjry experts.further,according to,the stb should have compensated for the value of tax credits for which it would be eligible over the next three years under the american jobs creation act of.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we deny petition for review.
backgrounda.facts 
for a number of years,has operated a rail line in west central illinois,which runs from its junction with kjry near la harpe,illinois,to its junction with union pacific railroad company at hollis,illinois la line or line.in december,sold its right to operate this line and the majority of its rail materials to sf l railway,sf l for approximately million.the sale was challenged and,finding that sf l purpose was to abandon and salvage the line,the stb revoked sf l authority to acquire the line and directed that retake possession.see sf l railway,operation,peoria railway.between la harpe peoria,illinois,stb finance docket.
subsequently,on april,kjry filed a feeder line application under seeking the forced sale of the line.kjry claimed in its application that clearly and persistently refused to make the necessary efforts to provide adequate service to shippers who transport traffic on the line,at,and that kjry purchase of the line would improve significantly service on the line,see id.at.it offered to purchase the line with or without the mapleton spur,a connecting segment of the line at milepost that runs through an industrial park.the application calculated the constitutional minimum value of the line according to its net liquidation value nlv,which is defined by its net salvage value nsv plus its land value.see b.kjry estimated the nlv of the line to be,a sum comprised of for track and other materials and for its real estate.with regard to salvage value,kjry relied on the description of assets prepared by in a previous effort to sell the western segment of the line,applied current market prices and subtracted the estimated cost of removal.with regard to land valuation,kjry noted in its application that it lacked information about real estate holdings necessary to perform an accurate land valuation.according to kjry,it had filed discovery requests for copies of deeds,valuation maps and real estate records refused these requests,contending that the documents were publicly available.in the absence of this information,kjry estimated the value of land at,premised on the assumption that held marketable title to of the total of that its parent company,railamerica,owned in fee the remainder of the land 
kjry april application was found to be deficient by the stb.see keokuk junction railway line of toledo,peoria railway.between la harpe hollis,stb docket,wl may.in pertinent part,the stb rejected kjry claim that the line did not have a going concern value gcv it found that,because the mapleton spur has the ability to continue to earn profit,requiring the sale of this portion of the line to kjry mandated compensation for income earned from its operation.id.at holding that kjry offer to accord trackage rights over the spur is neither the equivalent of,nor a reasonable substitute for,an actual gcv estimate the stb offered kjry an opportunity to perform a gcv estimate and file it with the stb along with supporting data.accordingly,kjry amended its application on june,it calculated the gcv of the line,assuming exclusive service over the spur by kjry,to be.to arrive at this sum,kjry used operating data from most recent data available to showed that earned appropriately in shipments moving to and from the mapleton spur.kjry subtracted from this number estimated operating expenses of,yielding an annual income from the spur of.this in turn produced a gcv of.see.
alternatively,kjry proposed the following kjry will purchase all of the line,except the mapleton spur,and then allow to retain sole access at the mapleton spur kjry will grant access over the line between hollis and the mapleton spur at no trackage rights charge.id.at.under this scenario,according to kjry,would be entitled to the nlv of the line not including the spur,which it calculated as the spur is the only portion of the line with a gcv 
filed its response to kjry application on october.in pertinent part,challenged kjry calculations of the line constitutional minimum value.urged the stb to treat the eastern and western portions of the line as two easily severable properties,apply ing the nlv to the western end and the gcv to the eastern end,which includes the mapleton spur.at.under this approach,according to,the line should be valued at.in the alternative,assuming that it would be compensated only for its liquid,materials and real w submitted that kjry erred in calculating the salvage value of the track and materials because it relied upon old track charts.id.at.expert,mark garvin,instead based his analysis on recent records of assets,dividing the materials into three categories relay steel reroll steel and scrap.he then compared the quantities of each with current market prices and subtracted removal costs.he calculated the western portion of the line nsv to be.according to,kjry also erred in valuing real estate.presented the real estate analysis of todd cecil,its vice president of real estate,who estimated that owned acres of land.cecil valued this land as an assembled corridor,assuming that the property would be purchased for use as a rail line he divided the land into parcels for the purpose of comparing them to the price of sale for properties in the area,and then added an e nhancement f actor to reflect the value of the land as a,assembled corridor to the purchaser.id.at.in all,cecil estimated that real estate was worth.this produced an nlv of.
kjry filed a reply to response on november,in which it withdrew its offer to purchase the mapleton spur.see at kjry remains willing to purchase just the line,from hollis to la harpe,without the mapleton spur,and to grant access from hollis to the point of connection with the mapleton spur without a trackage rights charge so that could continue to serve the shippers on the mapleton spur.with its reply,kjry also included the real estate analysis of brian mooty mooty analyzed approximately deeds to determine the type of ownership interest conveyed based on the language contained in each of the deeds.see,ex at.he concluded,on the basis of this language,that owned acres in fee and that the remainder of the deeds did not convey to marketable title but rather only an easement over the land.see also,ex at noting,for example,that some of the deeds contained the qualifying language,occupied and used by the railway,and that interest in this type of land ceases when the easement ownership interest ceases internal quotation marks omitted see also.
kjry also presented with its reply the valuation analysis of independent real estate appraiser arlen higgs.see,ex.higgs estimated that the acres of land allegedly owned in fee by were worth a total of.according to kjry,expert,improperly valued the land as a corridor,rather than as individual parcels,contrary to stb precedent this added to to the value of the right of way on the supposition that the property has value as a rail corridor.at.by contrast,higgs compared the land to the sale of abandoned rail right s of way in illinois,the type of property he claimed to be most similar to rail line.id.at noting that this type of land typically is sold at a to discount from the value of adjacent property because of the size,shape and limited number of potential buyers.averaging the price of sale of six comparable properties over a period,higgs projected a value of per acre in all,kjry proposed that the line without the mapleton spur has a nlv of,ex at.
filed no to kjry reply,although it supplemented the record in march,and again in november,with evidence that market prices of steel had increased,thus increasing the line net salvage value.
stb proceedings 
october decision 
the stb granted kjry feeder line application on october.it found that kjry had demonstrated that sale was proper under c.section c sets forth five conditions that must be fulfilled for forced sale of a rail line to be appropriate 
a that the rail carrier operating such line refuses within a reasonable time to make the necessary efforts to provide adequate service to shippers who transport traffic over such line 
b that the transportation over such line is inadequate for the majority of shippers who transport traffic over such line 
c that the sale of such line will not have a significantly adverse financial effect on the rail carrier operating such line 
d that the sale of such line will not have an adverse effect on the overall operational performance of the rail carrier operating such line and 
e that the sale of such line will be likely to result in improved railroad transportation for shippers that transport traffic over such line.
the stb found that kjry ha d satisfied each of the five statutory criteria.petitioner,at.specifically,it determined that had refused to provide adequate service over the line since february,when it reacquired the la harpe line pursuant to the stb order.id.at.contrary to claim that it was ready and able to provide such service but had not received service requests,the stb found that had actively discouraged use of the l ine by,among other things,refusing to provide rate quotes to shippers who wanted to move over the line and setting shipping rates prohibitively high.id.at summarizing the experiences of shippers seeking to move over line see also c a.the stb next found that,as a result of these practices,transportation over the line was inadequate and that its sale would improve rail transportation for shippers.petitioner,at,see also c b,e.it rejected the claim that forced sale would have a negative material effect on finances or its operations.see petitioner,at noting that would continue to operate the only profitable portion of the mapleton that had not provided service over the line for so long that it was unreasonable to suggest that the l ine sale could have a significant adverse operational effect on see also c c d.lastly,the stb found that kjry was financially responsible and could cover line expenses for at least three years.petitioner,at see also c d 
the stb then calculated the constitutional minimum value of the rail line.see b defining constitutional minimum value as not less than the net liquidation value of such line or the going concern value of such line,whichever is greater.kjry and agreed that the line constitutional minimum value should be defined by its net liquidation value,or nlv.because would retain ownership of the mapleton spur and because kjry had agreed to provide with trackage rights over portions of the line,the part of the line being acquired by kjry did not have a gcv.
the stb determined that the nlv of the line was.as mentioned previously,nlv is comprised of two calculations the net salvage value of the rail,ties and other track materials and the value of the land.the stb began with salvage value,which consists of the total value of the materials minus the cost of removal.the stb accepted in large part calculations,which utilized current track charts,recent price quotes,and a physical inspection of the l ine it contrasted these calculations with kjry valuation,which was based on older data,averages,and estimates.petitioner,at.according to the stb,the western segment of rail line contains miles of rail and the eastern segment contains miles of rail.
the stb,however,rejected both parties valuation of this material.in their initial applications,the parties differed widely in their estimates of the current price of relay,reroll and scrap metals.further,after the record had closed,both parties attempted to submit revised valuations asserted that the price of steel had increased significantly since october kjry responded that prices had dropped.the stb concluded that the parties divergent positions demonstrated the recent volatility in the scrap iron and steel and reroll markets.id.at.in light of the time that ha d elapsed since this case was filed,the stb held,it would not be appropriate to select a single date for the purpose of pegging a price for these commodities.id.instead,citing a number of cases in which it had averaged prices over multiple months in the course of valuing a rail line,the stb average d the price of scrap over the time period involved,beginning in april,the date that kjry feeder line application first was filed,and concluding in july,the last month of available data the stb accepted estimate of removal costs and set the total nsv at.
the stb then turned to land value.it adopted the recommendations of kjry on the question of acreage owned by.mooty,according to the board,is in illinois real estate law cecil,by comparison,is not even an illinois attorney.further,while cecil merely estimated that owned approximately half of the land and that its parent company,railamerica,owned the other half,mooty carefully examined the language of over deeds in the course of concluding that owned only acres in fee and that the remainder of the deeds merely granted an easement over the land.the stb concurred with mooty that the cited language in those deeds compelled the finding that owned acres of land.id.at.
the stb valued this land using kjry estimates as well.it held that cecil analysis improperly sought to combine into an nlv analysis both the nlv and gcv methodologies,was contrary to the statutory distinction between the two methodologies,and was inconsistent with court precedent.id.at also finding that the continuous corridor approach unfairly inflat ed the value of the properties.the stb instead adopted higgs valuation analysis,finding more appropriate his comparison to six sales of abandoned rail in illinois over the past years.id.at.the stb valued the acres owned in fee by at,resulting in a nlv of.the parties were given days to close the sale of the rail line.
february decision 
on november,filed a petition to reconsider the stb prior decision in pertinent part,contended that the stb erred in accepting and relying on mooty real estate analysis because it was not timely submitted in kjry opening brief,therefore depriving of an opportunity to reply to that evidence,at the stb erred in preferring higgs land valuation analysis over cecil estimates the stb failed to follow its own precedent in averaging the price of steel rather than valuing the steel at its market price as of november,id.at and new legislation,the american jobs creation act of,entitled to compensation for certain tax credits petition for reconsideration was accompanied by a new real estate analysis,which was authored by jeffrey gray and scott borstein of wildman,harrold,allen dixon,llp.gray and borstein,claimed,critiqued mooty methodology and conclusions and therefore their analysis would help the stb in fulfill ing its mandate of determining the nlv of the l ine.at.kjry subsequently filed a motion to strike this evidence,contending that gray and borstein had not relied on new evidence that was unavailable at the time that filed its comments on october.at.
motion for reconsideration was granted in part and denied in part in a decision dated february.in pertinent part,the stb granted kjry motion to strike gray and borstein land title analysis because it did not rely upon newly available evidence but instead was based entirely on evidence that was available at the time filed its comments 
seeks to rely upon an entirely new valuation,submitted for the first time in its petition for reconsideration.attempt to submit an entirely new land title analysis that would relitigate its ownership of the underlying real estate is inappropriate here,as could have submitted this evidence much earlier.
petitioner,at.
the stb took note of argument that the burden of proof is on the applicant to establish,in its,the value of the rail line,including its real estate,and that kjry land valuation was not presented until rebuttal.id.at.the stb found,however,that was not deprived of an opportunity to respond to mooty valuation of the land it would have permitted to respond by way of a reply to the reply.id.at.further,the stb held,objection to the admission of mooty real estate analysis was not preserved adequately,the stb explained,waited more than a year to address mooty analysis,even though it could have petitioned the stb to file a reply to the reply or to supplement the record with a new land valuation before a final decision was issued.id.accordingly,the stb granted kjry motion to strike gray and borstein valuation and the accompanying verified statements,as well as the portions of legal argument relating to those documents.
turning to contention that use of a monthly composite average to calculate net salvage value was inappropriate,the stb held that when litigation is lengthy,as here,c ommodity prices are likely to fluctuate widely.id.at.it is appropriate when such fluctuations occur,the stb concluded,to average commodity prices over the length of the proceeding to protect sellers from dramatic price reductions and buyers from dramatic price increases.id.
nevertheless,the stb adjusted the purchase price upward,finding the price of reroll steel to be higher than previously calculated.in its october decision,the stb had afforded an opportunity to supplement the record with monthly composite data on unit prices of reroll steel availed itself of this opportunity.the stb found this evidence to be unreliable and instead chose to rely upon data submitted by kjry.according to this data,reroll steel was worth per ton,increasing the line nsv by and yielding a total nsv of.
in addition,the stb found that it erred in preferring higgs appraisal methodology over the methodology employed by cecil in valuing the land owned by.the stb agreed with that higgs comparison of the rail line to six abandoned properties sold over fifteen years was not sufficiently representative six properties was too few,fifteen years was too long,and the parcels were too far from property to reflect adequately the value of line.by contrast,the stb found cecil appraisal to be more consistent with precedent and more credible than kjry analysis.id.at.it therefore recalculated the value of the acres owned in fee by using cecil valuation of this price resulted in a total land value of and a nlv of.
the stb last considered contention that it was entitled to compensation for tax credits under the american jobs creation act,for planned future investment in maintaining the rail line.claimed that it planned to make in qualified investments yearly,and,with regard to the la line,would be eligible for a tax credit of in,and,totaling for the period.the stb,however,held that the nlv of a rail methodology that the parties had agreed should be used to value only physical assets of a line,excluding benefits of ownership such as tax credits.petitioner,at noting that tax credits do not add value to assets that are being liquidated.t ax credits more likely would be a consideration in calculating gcv.id.even if this were not the case,the stb continued,had failed to demonstrate that it would qualify for the tax credits under.to receive maximum credit under the statute,to which claimed it was entitled,would have to invest per mile on a basis,totaling in qualified investments over the course of three years.given that already had permitted the line to fall into disrepair,the stb concluded that it was speculative at best whether would actually spend the funds necessary.id.
timely filed a petition for judicial review of the stb decision,naming the united states and the stb as defendants.see a.on april,kjry motioned to intervene as of right the motion was granted by this court on may.
discussion 
challenges the stb decision on three grounds.first,it contests the stb methodology in valuing the rail line net salvage value it contends that,instead of applying a monthly average,the stb should have valued the salvage material at current market prices.second,submits that the stb erroneously permitted kjry to submit mooty real estate appraisal with its reply brief even if this valuation was properly submitted to the stb,continues,the stb should have afforded an opportunity to respond to this new evidence and to submit the updated land valuation analysis performed by gray and borstein.third,challenges the stb determination that tax credits should not be taken into account in calculating a rail line nlv.we address each claim in turn.
valuation of scrap steel 
first contends that the stb methodology in pricing its scrap steel is contrary to the general rule that a property owner is entitled to the fair market value of its property as of the date of the taking.petitioner br.at emphasis in original.because the stb methodology departs from prior agency precedent without proper explanation,urges us to find the stb valuation of the line arbitrary and capricious.id.at 
we afford substantial deference to the stb interpretation of the statutes and regulations it administers,including.although section c explicitly sets forth a number of prerequisites to approval of the sale of a rail line,the statute largely is silent with respect to valuation section b specifies that the constitutional minimum value of a line is not less than the net liquidation value of such line or the going concern value of such line,whichever is greater,id.b,but it does not speak to what constitutes,or the factors that affect,the calculation of the line going concern or net liquidation value.when a statute is found to be either silent or ambiguous,the court must uphold the agency interpretation if it is based on a permissible construction of the statute.courts generally defer to agency expertise when interpreting vague or incomplete statutes.johnson apfel,cir quoting chevron,natural res.def.council,d.
as a result,our review of the stb valuation of a rail line constitutional minimum value is narrow.see decatur county comm rs surface transp,cir.we give considerable weight and due deference to the stb interpretation of b unless its statutory construction is plainly unreasonable.ventures,surface transp,cir internal quotation marks omitted first alteration in original see also decatur county comm rs,at.moreover,we shall not set aside the stb factual findings unless they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law contrary to constitutional right,power,privilege,or immunity in excess of statutory jurisdiction or unsupported by substantial evidence a e see also caddo antoine little missouri united states,cir holding that,to overturn the stb valuation of a rail line,there must be compelling indications that the stb interpretation is incorrect missouri pac,the court has only limited scope to review the substantive validity of the stb decision we must affirm unless that decision is arbitrary and capricious,exceeds the stb authority,or diverges without explanation from agency precedent.internal quotation marks omitted ventures,at noting that this standard of review generally requires affirmance of the stb valuation decisions.a decision is not arbitrary or capricious when it is possible to offer a reasoned,explanation for a particular outcome.ventures,at see highway j citizens group mineta,cir holding that,i f an agency considers the proper factors and makes a factual determination that a particular result is compelled,that decision implicates substantial agency expertise and is entitled to deference 
in this case,the methodology employed by the stb in calculating the net salvage value of rail line was reasonable,and not arbitrary or capricious or otherwise not in accordance with the law.the stb found that prices for steel had been extremely volatile over the course of the proceedings.consequently,it concluded that calculating the statutory constitutional minimum value of the line by averaging the price of steel from april to july,as opposed to applying the market price of steel on the date of final sale,more accurately reflected the line probable value on the open market than did the artificially inflated market price of steel as of november.that decision was justified by the stb careful consideration of a number of factors,most notably the price of steel the evidence submitted by the parties prior to the stb final decision indicates that the steel market was unstable while stb proceedings were ongoing,marked by significant price shifts within short periods of time.see petition for reconsideration,setting forth the market value of scrap and reroll steel over the course of seven months,from april to november kjry reply to reroll value evidence,see also,ex.our role is not to reweigh this evidence,but to determine whether the stb conclusions regarding market fluctuation are supported by substantial evidence the stb conclusion finds such support in the revised valuations submitted by the parties after the record had closed and in the updated data submitted by the parties with respect to the petition for reconsideration.see howard young med,shalala,cir we are not permitted to reweigh the evidence or to substitute our own judgment for that of the administrative agency.see also coal traffic league surface transp,upholding the stb determination even when evidence to the contrary was substantial because evidence supporting the board conclusion also was substantial.
we take note of argument that kirby forest industries,united states,d,requires valuation of property at the time of the taking,id.at,which,in turn,was defined by the court as the date of payment of the condemnation award,id.at.see also petitioner br.at.in kirby forest,the supreme court addressed when a taking of property by use of the procedure provided in should be deemed to occur for purposes of valuing the land.kirby forest,at.just compensation,the supreme court held,means in most cases the fair market value of the property on the date it is appropriated.id.at.in the context of proceedings,it concluded,the date on which the property is appropriated is the date on which the united states tenders payment to the owner of the land.id.at.
relying on this analysis,contends that the date of taking in this case was on or about february,and that the stb was required to calculate the value of the line according to market conditions on that date,however,did not cite kirby forest before the stb and,in fact,urged the stb to calculate the market price of steel as of november,the date of the stb valuation decision,not as of february,the date that the sale of line to kjry became final.see petition for reconsideration,at urging the stb to value the track and materials at market value as of november,the date nearest the service of the stb october decision and the date on which g arvin would voluntarily sell the scrap steel.therefore has waived this argument.see ester principi,cir holding that arguments not made before the administrative agency are subsequently waived before the courts citing united states tucker truck lines.
even if we were to reach the merits of argument,we would find it lacking.kirby forest involved a factual scenario that is not analogous to the present case.the supreme court went to great lengths to distinguish the facts presented in kirby forest from similar scenarios unaffected by its holding it even noted that n one of the discussion in this opinion is intended to modify either the manner in which the standard is interpreted and applied or the test for determining when the standard must be supplanted by other formulae.kirby forest,at.specifically,it recognized that there are two scenarios in which j ust compensation does not mean the fair market value of the property on the date it is appropriated.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.other measures of just compensation,the court explained,are employed when market value is too difficult to find,or when its application would result in a manifest injustice to owner or public.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted second alteration in original.although the stb did not address kirby forest specifically,its rationale mirrors the supreme court analysis in effect,the stb determined that,in this case,market value was too difficult to ascertain and would be more fair to the parties.specifically,the stb reasonably determined that,because of unusual market volatility,a traditional just compensation model was not appropriate.market fluctuation over the course of proceedings made it too difficult to pinpoint the fair market value of materials.id.moreover,the inflated prices of steel on the date of final sale and on the date of appropriation meant that market value on those dates,according to the stb,did not represent the fair market value of assets and would result in manifest injustice to the purchaser,kjry.id.the price of steel almost had doubled between april,the date that the feeder line application was filed,and november,the date of final decision the stb therefore determined that it was appropriate to supplant the standard with another formula,one that averaged steel prices over a period.see petitioner,at holding that protect s sellers from dramatic price reductions and buyers from dramatic price increases.given the stb careful consideration of the matter of just compensation,we can not agree that the supreme court decision in kirby forest renders the stb methodology in this case arbitrary and capricious.
also submits that the stb methodology is inconsistent with agency precedent.see,csx transport,laporte,porter starke counties,indiana,stb docket no,wl april,hereinafter laporte.in laporte,the town of north judson town submitted an offer of financial assistance ofa,see,to purchase a portion of a rail line owned by csx transportation.because the parties were unable to reach agreement on the sale of the line,the town requested that the stb set the terms of sale.see e.csx proposed a purchase price that was higher than the price it had suggested in prior negotiations and alleged that the price of scrap steel had risen steeply.the town filed a motion to strike the evidence offered by csx to demonstrate the increased value of the line,claiming that csx wrongfully withheld this information until late in the proceedings.see laporte,wl,at.the stb held that,although it generally 
disfavors a party later introduction of evidence that could have been presented in its initial pleading particularly in ofa proceedings where the statutory time frames are short,the recent sharp increase in the price of scrap steel warrants consideration of the new evidence in light of the stb duty to set a purchase price for the line that is no lower than the constitutional minimum value.
the stb analysis in laporte does not constrain its choice of methodology in pricing line in the present case.ofa statutory time frames are short and the proceedings transpire rapidly,the regulations in laporte set a deadline on the submission of offers of financial assistance and on the submission of a request for the stb to establish the terms of sale after the parties fail to reach agreement,see.as a result,market data submitted by parties in ofa proceedings,including the parties in laporte,is largely contemporaneous with the market conditions that existed both at the commencement of the litigation and at the time of final decision.by contrast,when litigation is more lengthy,it is likely that there will be a significant market shift in the price of steel between the date that proceedings are commenced and the date of final sale or taking as occurred in the present case.such a shift renders the selection of a date on which to price the steel arbitrary and makes a reasonable alternative to traditional valuation schemes.under similar circumstances,in fact,the stb has averaged prices to account for market fluctuations during feeder line proceedings.see,chicago transp.between ringwood,illinois geneva,wisconsin,wl averaging prices for salvage over a period,finding that current market prices exaggerate d the value of the reusable rail involved chicago transp.between marshalltown powerville cedar falls junction between hicks and marshall,tama,grundy blackhawk counties,iowa,wl,at stb,the railroad replies that it used the most recent average of scrap prices actually received,a procedure accepted in numerous other abandonment cases it has presented a reasonable estimate for the value of its rail,supported by adequate justification of its methodology.gs roofing,at affirming the stb use of averages,rather than data,due to the lack of information and noting that,although this practice was not preferable,it also could not be considered arbitrary or capricious.in fact,the stb has noted that u se of a average to determine nlv for track is accepted methodology.chicago transp.between steamboat rock hampton in hardin franklin counties,iowa,stb docket no,wl,at 
in sum,because of unpredictable market conditions during the course of this litigation and the unpredictability of the date of final sale,and because this approach is consistent with both supreme court and agency precedent,we conclude that the stb methodology was not arbitrary or capricious.
tax credits 
next contends that the stb erred in refusing to consider the value of tax credits under the american jobs creation act of,in its determination of the line constitutional minimum value.the american jobs creation act permits a railroad to take a credit equal to percent of the qualified railroad track maintenance expenditures paid or incurred by an eligible taxpayer during the taxable year,not to exceed 
multiplied by the sum of the number of miles of railroad track owned or leased by the eligible taxpayer as of the close of the taxable year,and the number of miles of railroad track assigned for purposes of this subsection to the eligible taxpayer by a class ii or class iii railroad which owns or leases such railroad track as of the close of the taxable year.
a,b.according to,its anticipated future investment in its rail line would entitle it to approximately in tax credits over a amount it contends should be taken into account in determining the line constitutional minimum value 
the stb held that tax credits should not be considered in calculating the constitutional minimum value of the line under,both because tax credits are assets of the line,and therefore not part of the line liquidated value,and because the stb found that it was speculative at best whether would actually spend the funds necessary to entitle it or its corporate parent to a tax credit,much less the maximum tax credit.petitioner,at.as discussed previously,we shall reverse the stb legal interpretation of a statute it is charged with administering only if it is arbitrary and other words,if there are compelling indications that the stb interpretation is incorrect.caddo antoine little missouri,at internal quotation marks omitted.we review the stb factual finding that did not plan to invest necessary funds in the line for substantial evidence.cross dep t of,we do not substitute our judgment for that of the board as to the weight of the evidence or the inferences to be drawn therefrom.
the stb did not err in refusing to consider future tax credits available under in calculating the net liquidation value of rail line.tax credits may be a proper consideration in calculating a line going concern value,under which the line will continue to operate in a profitable manner.however,when there is no evidence of a higher going concern value for continued rail use,the stb calculates a line constitutional minimum value by evaluating its net liquidation value,the property highest and best nonrail use.new york cent.lines,berkshire county,stb docket no,wl,at april.in that scenario,the stb is to calculate the sale price on the basis of what the seller would have realized from the sale of the assets had the line in fact been abandoned,the track materials salvaged and the land sold.iowa terminal.
does not dispute that,but for the feeder line application,it would have abandoned the la line,selling its track and rail materials for scrap.the line,with the exception of the mapleton spur,which will retain,no longer earns a profit and therefore has no going concern value therefore,should be compensated only for the the nonrail market value of its assets.id.quoting chicago transp.united states,cir alteration in original.assets are not an appropriate consideration in this calculation the purpose of section would be frustrated if the commission were required to consider the value of the line to the offeror as part of an operating railway rather than the price the seller would have received from the sale of the line for nonrail uses.id.quoting chicago transp,at first alteration in original.
as a result,savings realized from tax credits are not part of the line net liquidation value.as the circuit explained in iowa terminal railroad 
petitioner argues,on appeal,that it is at least entitled to the benefit of the tax savings it would have realized had it been able to deduct the value of the as a charitable gift in its income tax returns.such a position stretches the statute too far.subsection f c requires the stb to determine the fair market value of an asset to a nonrail purchaser,not its value to the vendor.
id.at internal citations omitted.in sum,because the parties agree that the line constitutional minimum value should be calculated using a net liquidation formula rather than a going concern formula,and because does not contest that the line highest and best nonrail use requires sale of the land and salvage of the track and materials,we simply can not understand why it would be appropriate to compensate for prospective tax credits,which assume,and indeed require,continued operation of the line.
moreover,even if tax credits were an appropriate consideration in calculating a line nlv,they are not an appropriate consideration in this case.apparently concedes that it does not plan to invest over half a million dollars per year in maintaining the miles of track that it owns or leases as part of the la line,the sum necessary to render it eligible for in tax credits over the period.it instead contends that it is entitled to tax credits for maintenance it expects to perform elsewhere on its system.according to,it planned to invest on the miles it owns or leases per year,entitling it to a yearly tax credit of,of which is attributable to railroad track owned or leased as part of the la line.but only evidence on this subject relates exclusively to what maintenance budget is there is no evidence that actually has invested,or would invest,the sum claimed on maintaining its rail lines.
nor is there evidence that planned to keep the la line long enough to accrue the relevant tax credits.the sum of tax credits claimed by that would retain and invest in the line for three years.but previously attempted to sell the line as salvage to sf l,and even its chief engineer,mark garvin,stated that,given high steel prices,if permitted by the have abandoned the line and sold the track and materials for scrap.see petition for reconsideration,at noting that november,is the date closest to when g arvin would have voluntarily sold the line for scrap steel.
we therefore reject the claim that the stb should have compensated for the value of tax credits to which allegedly was entitled under.
land title analysis 
contends that the stb erred in permitting kjry to submit mooty real estate appraisal for the first time on rebuttal.further submits that,because kjry was permitted to submit mooty analysis in an untimely fashion,the stb was required to offer an opportunity to rebut mooty methodology and conclusions.according to,the stb therefore erred in excluding gray and borstein land title analysis,submitted by with its petition for reconsideration.
argument that the stb erred in permitting kjry to submit a new real estate analysis along with its reply brief has not been preserved properly for our review.at no time prior to the stb october decision did object to kjry submissions instead waited to raise the argument until the stb had issued an unfavorable decision.although is correct that the rules do not permit the filing of a reply to a reply,see c,it could have filed a motion to strike mooty appraisal or petitioned the stb to respond to that appraisal.we therefore deem the argument waived.see ester,at 
we also can not accept argument that the stb erred in excluding gray and borstein land title analysis,which was offered by along with its november petition for reconsideration.the stb held that this evidence was untimely filed and,because it was not based on newly available evidence,did not warrant reconsideration of its prior decision.petitioner,at.we review the stb denial of a petition for reconsideration for abuse of discretion.see friends of the trail,surface transp,cir.
the stb did not abuse its discretion in refusing to consider gray and borstein land title analysis.as an initial matter,contrary to contention,the stb is not constitutionally required to consider all evidence submitted prior to the date of taking,when that evidence is offered in an untimely fashion.see petitioner br.at maintaining that the stb must consider all evidence on the topic of the line constitutional value,even if it cause s inconvenience to the board.title of the united states code at requires the stb to grant reconsideration of an action only when there is material error,new evidence,or substantially changed circumstances.c.as the stb has explained previously 
t he board generally does not consider new issues raised for the first time on reconsideration where those issues could have and should have been presented in the earlier stages of the proceeding.moreover,the term new evidence refers to evidence that was not reasonably available to the party when the record was developed,and not simply newly raised.nothing in the statute or the stb regulations obliges the agency to rethink its decisions whenever a party wishes to try out a new theory or finds new information at a late stage in the process.and if a party were free to reshape its case,so long as it did so within days after a decision,the administrative process might never end.the agency is not expected to behave like penelope,unraveling each day work to start the web again the next day.

does not contend that the gray and borstein land title analysis constitutes evidence that could not have been foreseen or planned for at the time of the original proceeding.id.gray and borstein relied on the same,real estate maps and other valuation mooty had cited in his appraisal and that were submitted with real estate appraisal authored by cecil and filed in a timely manner.obviously,these documents were reasonably available to the party when the record was developed,texas mun.power agency,wl,at indeed,these documents were part of the record long before the record closed and the stb issued its final decision.moreover,there is no valid reason why did not employ gray and borstein to perform a land title analysis while preparing its materials for its response brief,or,if not then,after kjry submitted mooty analysis but before the record closed.because evidence that was reasonably available to the parties before the proceeding is not new evidence for purposes of,and because gray and borstein land title analysis raised before the stb the same substance as had and could have been raised earlier,we believe that the stb did not abuse its discretion in granting kjry motion to strike this evidence.friends of sierra,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
conclusion 
for the reasons set forth in the foregoing opinion,we deny petition for review of the stb order.
congress abolished the interstate commerce commission in and created in its place the stb.see except as otherwise provided in the icc termination act of,or the amendments made thereby,the surface transportation board shall perform all functions that,immediately before january,were functions of the interstate commerce commission.the stb is an independent agency administratively affiliated with the department of transportation it has an exclusively set of responsibilities.
title requires the stb to order the sale of a rail line when it has been abandoned or not adequately served by its owner if the buyer is found to be financially responsible and various other statutory requirements are met.b.under b,the seller is entitled to the constitutional minimum value of the rail line,which the statute defines as not less than the net liquidation value of such line or the going concern value of such line,whichever is greater.id.b.
kjry did not calculate in its april application the going concern value gcv of the line.it submitted that the only portion of the line profitable to was the mapleton spur,and that,because kjry had offered the opportunity to retain the economic benefit of operating the mapleton segment by according trackage rights over that portion of line,would continue to earn profit from the spur and therefore should not be compensated for any economic benefit derived from its current operation.at.
the stb also requested from kjry additional evidence of financial responsibility to purchase and operate the entire line,and more detailed operating plans and pro forma financial statements.keokuk junction railway line of toledo,peoria railway.between la harpe hollis,stb docket,wl,at may.the kjry amended its application to include these materials on june.see at.
on july,the stb accepted kjry application for filing,subject to compliance with environmental reporting requirements.
kjry noted in its reply that,prior to the filing of response,it had no access to relevant documents,including deeds only after receiving copies of these documents,which were attached to cecil real estate analysis,could it hire an attorney to analyze their language and to provide a comprehensive assessment of real estate interests.
kjry took issue with a portion of mooty analysis.specifically,on the basis of a second real estate appraisal authored by its general counsel,kjry urged the stb to find that owned only acres of marketable property,instead of the acres proposed by mooty.the stb rejected this suggestion.
kjry also challenged in its reply brief the valuation of track and other rail materials performed by expert.by using costs at which it purchases materials for comparison,rather than costs at which materials are sold,kjry submitted,garvin gives his valuation a to boost.ordinarily,purchasers of rail materials must allow a to margin to cover expenses such as materials handling,inventory carrying,and profit.at also noting that garvin improperly treated grade crossing facilities and bridges as salvageable material and understated the cost of removal.instead,kjry urged the stb to value the track and materials at wholesale prices,ex at.
the stb findings on these matters have not been challenged by on appeal.
the stb did the same for the price of reroll steel,but it based its calculations on the unit values submitted by in its original valuation charts.it provided with days to supplement the record with monthly composite average unit prices of reroll.
