plaintiffs appellants lacano investments,llc,nowell avenue development,and ava eads,allege that they hold land patents that were issued by the federal government many years before alaska entered the union.the patents give title to certain streambeds in alaska.in and,the alaska department of natural resources determined that the waterways above these streambeds were navigable in,the year alaska was admitted to the union,and remain navigable.under the submerged lands act of,all land beneath such waterways belongs to the state of alaska.see u.a i t is determined and declared to be in the public interest that title to and ownership of the lands beneath navigable waters within the boundaries of the respective states are,subject to the provisions hereof,recognized,confirmed,established,and vested in and assigned to the respective states act to provide for the admission of the state of alaska into the union,stat,m t he submerged lands act of shall be applicable to the state of alaska and the said state shall have the same rights as do existing states thereunder.the department sent letters to plaintiffs with the navigability determinations and its conclusion that the streambeds are.
according to plaintiffs,alaska determination that the waterways have been navigable since does not disturb the title to the land that was granted to them by the federal patents.plaintiffs sued the alaska officials who made the navigability determinations in federal court.plaintiffs allege that they retain title to the disputed lands because,under the submerged lands act,streambeds that had already been patented by the federal government were not granted to alaska upon its statehood.see f t he term lands beneath navigable waters that belongs to the states does not include the beds of streams in lands if such streams were not meandered in connection with the public survey of such lands under the laws of the united states and if the title to the beds of such streams was lawfully patented or conveyed by the united states.plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that the navigability determinations,and thus the conclusions that the streambeds were,violated f,as well as an injunction prohibiting defendants from claiming title to the lands beneath the waterways.
the state officials moved to dismiss the complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b,for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the district court agreed,and dismissed the action with prejudice.
plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.we review a district court decision to grant a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo.colony cove,llc city of carson,cir.we review the district court denial of leave to amend for abuse of discretion.airs aromatics,llc opinion victoria secret stores brand,cir.we have jurisdiction under,and affirm.
the state officials moved to dismiss the complaint.the jurisdictional attack in their motion was facial,which means that the state officials assert that the allegations contained in the complaint are insufficient on their face to invoke federal jurisdiction,but the officials do not dispute the truth of the allegations.safe air for everyone meyer,cir.in this facial attack,we must accept all of the factual allegations in the complaint as true.wolfe strankman,cir.
plaintiffs argue that because we must accept all of their factual allegations as true,we must reverse the district court,insofar as the complaint alleges that the lands are by definition not submerged,lands under federal law.in other words,plaintiffs argue that because we accept the allegations in the complaint as true,at this stage of the litigation we must conclude that alaska has no interest in the lands under plaintiffs complaint,which means that it was error to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
while we do accept all of the factual allegations in the complaint as true,we do not accept legal conclusions in the complaint as true,even if cast in the form of factual allegations.doe holy see,cir citation omitted.plaintiffs complaint does not include factual allegations that the streambeds are privately owned under the submerged lands act.instead,the complaint contains only legal conclusions to that effect t he alaska statehood act delineates the terms under which statehood was granted and thus plaintiffs lands are exempted from the submerged lands act plaintiff lacano is the fee simple owner of record plaintiff nowell is the fee simple owner of record plaintiff eads is the fee simple owner.
further,we also may look beyond the complaint and consider extrinsic evidence.warren fox family worldwide,cir.attached to the complaint are the letters sent by the department of natural resources,upon which the complaint relies to explain the basis of plaintiffs action.those letters demonstrate alaska claim of ownership to the disputed properties.
thus,plaintiffs can not avoid a motion to dismiss under rule b merely because they asserted in their complaint that alaska does not own the streambeds.see,mohegan tribe and nation orange,cir dismissing a complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction despite accepting the factual allegations contained in the complaint as true where the complaint asserted that the plaintiffs,rather than the state of new york,held title to disputed lands.
we next consider whether state sovereign immunity bars plaintiffs action.the eleventh amendment bars federal courts from hearing certain suit s filed by individual citizens against a state without the consent of the state.const.amend.xi see generally hans louisiana.but that amendment does not bar actions when citizens seek only injunctive or prospective relief against state officials who would have to implement a state law that is allegedly inconsistent with federal law.see generally ex parte young.the ex parte young doctrine is founded on the legal fiction that acting in violation of the constitution or federal law brings a state officer into conflict with the superior authority of the constitution,and he is in that case stripped of his official or representative character and is subjected in his person to the consequences of his individual conduct.cardenas anzai,cir internal quotation marks omitted citing young,at.not all actions that solely seek prospective relief against state officials fall within the young exception,however.see idaho coeur tribe of idaho.
