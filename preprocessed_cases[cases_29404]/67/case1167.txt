this diversity case concerns the lease and administration of a residential healthcare facility in lexington,kentucky the appellant,omega healthcare investors,brought suit against alleging,among other things,breach of contract.the parties filed for summary judgment,and the district court granted summary judgment in favor of.omega appeals.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings.
in,omega predecessor in interest entered into a lease with robert petrie for certain property,referred to in the lease as the lexington campus but referred to by the parties during this litigation as the excepticon facility excepticon the property was a healthcare facility designed to house and care for patients with developmental disabilities.in the accepted language of the time,this was referred to as an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded.
because omega,a real estate investment trust,could not operate a medical facility,the lease envisioned that omega would rent the facility to petrie and that petrie would acquire the necessary licenses to run the facility.however the actual management of excepticon was to be performed by a third.to that end,petrie and simultaneously entered a second contract,referred to as the management agreement.the lease between omega and petrie and the management agreement between petrie and each make reference to the other document.
for about eight years,the three parties happily coexisted,omega as the lessor of the property,petrie as the lessee of the property,and managing the property.but in the environment began to change when purchased all of the petrie rights and obligations under the management agreement and the lease from the petrie estate.at this point there were only two owned the property and leased it to,who became both the lessee and also the manager of operations in the facility.
over the course of and,began a process of working with the commonwealth of kentucky to move the patients out of the excepticon facility and into care.however,kentucky would not be able to pay to manage the treatment for the former residents of excepticon as long as excepticon was still open and certified to provide care for the developmentally disabled patients.by shutting the doors to excepticon,kentucky would be able to apply for federal funding for the residents to move into community care under a program called a conversion waiver,a waiver that would not be available if excepticon was still operating.
then did the following three things it sought and received an order from the district court to prevent omega from reclaiming possession of the property at the natural termination of the petrie lease it helped the residents of excepticon move into care arranged by and once the patients were removed it closed the.with those preconditions met,kentucky was able to rescind its certificate of need for an,and federal funding for care was approved.when omega regained possession of excepticon from,it had no patients,no employees,and was no longer certified for use as an in kentucky.
omega brought suit.over objection,the district court gave omega leave to file a third amended complaint on july.this complaint contained five counts.during the spring and summer of,the parties filed for summary judgment.omega moved for summary judgment on counts i and moved for summary judgment on counts i,ii,iv,and on december,the district court entered judgment granting motion for summary judgment on count v and denying omega motion for the same 
for two more years,the parties argued about the remaining four counts.by december,the parties had reached a settlement agreement on those four counts,and the district court entered an order dismissing all remaining claims and making the judgment on count v a final and appealable order.omega appeals the order granting summary judgment to on count 
there is no disagreement that excepticon was very nearly and when assumed the obligations of the lessee in.by the time returned the premises to omega at the end of,the facility was empty.at the heart of this dispute is a disagreement about whether owed any duty to run excepticon in a particular manner during the years and,and if so whether it breached those obligations.because the complaint and omega motion for summary judgment alleged that behavior violated both the lease agreement and the management agreement,we will consider them separately.at some points the consideration of one necessarily implies consideration of the other.
ii.analysis 
we review an appeal of summary judgment de novo.lee keith,cir.on summary judgment,a party is entitled to judgment if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.we view all facts and draw all inferences in the light most favorable to the party.tanner jupiter realty,cir.
in its motion for summary judgment,omega clarified exactly how it believes that breached its two contracts.it alleged that many of the acts that took in conjunction with the commonwealth of kentucky in and constituted breaches of the management agreement that was originally signed by and petrie.omega also alleged that those same actions violated paragraph of the lease.it further alleged that had breached paragraphs and of the lease,independent of any breach of the management agreement.finally,omega noted that under the lease,if the court believed that the management agreement had been terminated that such termination was a further violation of lease paragraph.
for reasons that are unclear,has contended for several years now that the third amended complaint only alleged a breach of the management agreement,and said nothing about the lease.there is simply no way that this argument can be squared with the plain language of the complaint.for example,paragraph of the complaint reads,in its entirety refused to surrender control and operation of the lexington facility at the termination of the lease,and continued to operate the facility in violation of the lease surrender provisions from the termination of the lease through december.likewise,paragraph reads defendant conduct in refusing to surrender the leased facility at the termination of the petrie lease agreement constituted a breach of that written contract.paragraph reads defendant conduct constituted multiple breaches of the petrie lease and the defendant guaranteed management agreement.how it could be possible to read these three paragraphs as dealing exclusively with the management agreement defies explanation.
a federal complaint requires only a short and plain statement of the claim.a.a plaintiff in federal court need do no more than narrate a grievance simply and directly,so that the defendant knows what he has been accused of.doe smith,cir.this defendant was on notice that count v pleaded not only a breach of the management agreement but also of the lease agreement.repeatedly denying this fact does not change reality.is entitled to take issue with questions of fact and law as presented by omega in its motion,but is not entitled to pretend,ipse dixit,that entire portions of the complaint and entire pages of the plaintiff memorandum supporting its motion for summary judgment simply do not exist.we will consider each alleged breach of the two contracts in turn.
breach of the management agreement itself 
the terms of the management agreement that omega believes were breached can be summarized as follows the contract required that the manager of the property would maintain and operate the facility in compliance with the standards for state licensure sufficient to maintain a license as an facility and not do or permit to be done any act or thing which is incompatible with its operation as an facility.management agreement ii d,ii h.additionally,it was a goal that the manager seek to maintain appropriate and adequate relationships with referral sources sufficient to maintain occupancy.before considering the evidence to support these allegations,we must as did the district court consider legal argument that the management agreement had ceased to exist when bought out petrie and became both the lessee and the manager.we agree that the management agreement ceased to exist on january.
the management agreement on its face is a contract between petrie and.the first question faced by the district court and by this court is whether acquisition of petrie rights and obligations under the management agreement made that agreement void.we conclude that it did.
the principle involved here was summarized in the restatement of contracts where a person subject to a contractual duty,or to a duty to make compensation,acquires the correlative right in the same capacity in which he owes the duty,the duty is discharged.the comments and examples clarify.a legal duty can not be owed by a person to himself acting in the same capacity.restatement first of contracts cmt.a.a owes b.a is b next of kin,and b dying without a will a inherits all of b property.a duty to b is discharged.restatement first of contracts ill.
although the kentucky case law on the topic is scant,it supports the view that kentucky follows the restatement.cites to allin shadburne,dana,for the proposition that a party can not contract with itself.although that case had not been mentioned in the courts of kentucky since,see united loan deposit bank bitzer,we can find no authority to suggest that this does not remain the law of contract in the commonwealth of kentucky.we agree that under kentucky contract law the management agreement was nullified when bought petrie interest in and therefore could not have been breached.
omega makes two on appeal.omega claims that it was an intended beneficiary to that contract and that the two contracts were actually a single contract and therefore is not the only party on both sides of the management agreement.because omega did not raise either of these arguments in the district court they have been forfeited for the purposes of this appeal.coker trans world airlines,cir.
breach of paragraph of the lease 
omega argued in the district court and properly preserved for appeal its contention that the terms of the management agreement were also incorporated into the lease.see pl.mem.supp.summ.however,the lease agreement made clear that the terms and provisions of the management agreement were a part of the lease with omega,and the breach of any of those terms and provisions would constitute a breach of the lease.we agree with omega.
under kentucky law,a contract can incorporate terms by reference to outside sources.bartelt aviation,dry lake coal,w hen a signature is placed after clear language has expressed the incorporation of other terms and conditions by reference,it is a logical inference that the signer agrees to be bound by everything incorporated.
paragraph of the lease reads,lessor approves the entry by lessee simultaneously with the execution of this lease,into a management agreement herein the management agreement of even date a true and correct copy of which is attached hereto as exhibit made a part hereof.lessee agrees that it will not consent to any modification or amendment of the management agreement without the prior written approval of the lessor.lease emphasis added.omega argues that this paragraph was sufficient to incorporate the management agreement into the lease.
paragraph of the lease is unambiguous,and the interpretation of unambiguous contract provisions is a question of law.first bank trust firstar info.servs,cir.the only sensible way to interpret paragraph is that the parties to the lease omega and petrie intended that the specific provisions of the management agreement were a part of the basis of their operation of the facility in a particular manner was necessary to protect the interests of the parties to the lease.this view is supported by reading lease paragraph in conjunction with lease paragraph.see cantrell supply,liberty mut.ins,any contract or agreement must be construed as a whole,giving effect to all parts and every word in it if possible.internal citation and quotations omitted.not only was any change to the facility management subject to omega approval,any lapse of the management agreement constituted breach of the lease by petrie.we are convinced that the terms of the lease are clear and that the contract incorporates the provisions of the management agreement into the lease.
of course,in its role as manager of excepticon,could not be bound by a contract between omega and petrie.but on january,also became the lessee of the facility,and was bound by the obligations that petrie had agreed to in the lease,just as agrees it assumed petrie obligation to pay rent to omega.as acknowledges in its brief,by january,there was no longer a manager of excepticon there was only a lessor and lessee,as the lessee,accepted the terms of the lease.
however,submits that omega consented to the sale of the petrie assets to.omega admissions in a separate pleading before a kentucky administrative agency support the view that omega consented to the substitution of parties to the two contracts,but provides nothing to suggest that omega consented to any alteration of the terms under which the facility would be managed.the lessee of the facility,first petrie and then,agreed to manage the facility in accordance with certain standards.those were memorialized in the management agreement between petrie and,but we conclude that as incorporated terms they were also binding on petrie as lessee and later as lessee under the separate lease.whatever effect substituting the parties had on the management agreement,there is no indication that the incorporated terms of the lease were changed thereby.
the only remaining question for this court is whether the legal demise of the management agreement prevents the incorporated terms from being effective as part of the separate lease agreement.we are forced to look as far back as in kentucky to find an answer to that question.in torian hibbs,the court held that parties to a contract could properly incorporate the terms of a previous expired and unenforceable contract into a different contract.finding nothing to suggest that this is not the case today,we believe that under kentucky law the terms of the management agreement,not having been modified by the parties to the lease,remained binding on the lessor and lessee despite the legal lapse of the separate management agreement.
the facts,even when viewed in the light most favorable to,are sufficient to establish that breached the terms incorporated into paragraph of the lease the affidavits and depositions that accompanied omega motion for summary judgment established the facts that follow.sometime after assumed petrie obligations under the lease in,approached kentucky about moving patients from the excepticon facility into the community.this is corroborated not only by depositions of kentucky officials but also by admissions of officers.see morse dep.at geary dep.at.in fact,had drawn up a plan for how it would close excepticon and convert the certified need for the beds into care for those patients.see kelley dep.at.kentucky officials informed that any funding for care would be conditioned on closing excepticon.see morse dep.at.informed kentucky that it was in a position to permanently close excepticon.see boyd dep.at.although the parties have now quibbled for years over whether eviction is the proper description,officials from kentucky confirm that the residents of excepticon were not given the choice to remain in excepticon even though they eventually left of their own free will,having been informed that the facility was closing.see boyd dep.at.kentucky informed that the process of shifting the patients from excepticon to the community would result in the revocation of excepticon license to continue operating as an.see morse dep.at.general counsel admitted that closing the facility was incompatible with its continued operation as an.see waskey dep.at.at the time that the patients were being moved from excepticon,there was a waiting list for beds in in kentucky.see boyd dep.at.
there are no material facts in dispute.over the course of two years,initiated a plan to move the patients from excepticon into the community.approached kentucky and offered to close excepticon.as patients were placed into the community,did nothing to bring new patients into the facility off the waiting list.knew that its actions were incompatible with excepticon continued operation as an and incompatible with excepticon continued licensure as an.actions as lessee were in violation of the terms incorporated into the lease by paragraph.barring success on affirmative defense of a public policy exception see part below,omega is entitled to judgment as a matter of law for breach of the incorporated terms of paragraph of the lease.
breach of paragraph of the lease 
omega argued in its motion for summary judgment that breached paragraph of the petrie lease,entitled alterations.it reads,in relevant part,that the l essee shall not make any alterations or additions to the demised premises without lessor prior approval.the definition of the demised premises is provided in paragraph as 
assets,rights,interests and other properties owned by the lessor and relating to the facility including c appurtenances all tenements,hereditaments,rights,privileges,interests,easements and appurtenances belonging or in any wise pertaining to the parcel the improvements 
omega argues that impaired omega rights,privileges,and interests during the term of the lease by destroying or impairing the medicaid certificate of need con for the slots at the excepticon.omega argues that those impairments constitute an alteration of the demised premises in violation of paragraph.
because omega is a real estate investment trust,and not a medical service provider,argues that the con could not possibly have been among the rights,privileges,or interests that ran as part of the demised property.rescare argument is supported by the fact that the lessees and managers of excepticon have been the ones who applied for and received the various licenses and cons throughout the term of this lease.in fact,it was the operators and managers exclusively who had ever acquired any right or privilege to operate the facility under a con.since this was not part of the premises that omega predecessor had demised to petrie,its absence upon lease termination could not be an alteration of the premises.the cons and any other right to operate the facility were simply never leased from omega to petrie and their absence does not violate paragraph of the lease.
breach of paragraph of the lease 
paragraph of the lease is extensive,occupying more than two pages of the original contract.it is entitled surrender obligations upon expiration or termination.while much of the boilerplate in the paragraph is inconsequential to this case,omega alleged in its motion for summary judgment that there are four specific clauses in paragraph that had breached.paragraph a required that the lessee shall upon the termination date well and truly surrender and deliver the demised premises into the possession and use of the lessor without fraud or delay.paragraph c required that upon surrendering the premises the lessee must warrant that t here is no outstanding written notice of default,cancellation or termination in connection with any instrument or document which could be construed,directly or indirectly,to bind or in any way affect lessor or lessor assigns after the termination hereof.paragraph d required that the lessee shall use its best efforts to persuade such personnel of the facilities as lessor may designate to become employees of lessor or lessor assigns after the expiration or termination of the term hereof.finally,paragraph f required that the lessee must allow the lessor to use the lessee medicaid provider number for a short period after surrendering the premises until the lessor acquired its own provider numbers so that it could continue to bill medicaid during the transition period.
there is no doubt that did not initially surrender the demised premises as required by paragraph a.the parties agreed to an order,entered by the district court on october,that allowed to remain in possession of the premises until december.because omega agreed to allow to remain in possession,such possession can not of itself be grounds for a claim for breach of paragraph.ann.west permitting the parties to expressly contract for holdover beyond the day that a lease terminates.but the district court order also put a limit on what could do during this holdover period.by agreement of both parties,paragraph of the october order required that shall not use its holdover position to impair omega ability to continue to operate excepticon as a medicaid funded facility.
reading paragraph of the agreed order in conjunction with the provisions of paragraph of the lease,which clearly required to deliver the premises in such a condition as to be ready to continue operation as an,we conclude that the actions taken between september and december,constituted a breach of paragraph of the lease.was under an obligation to turn over the premises at the end of august.if it had done so,it would have given omega a partially occupied and staffed that was still licensed.admittedly,as we held above,was already in breach by august.but had surrendered the premises omega would have been allowed to look for a new operator to take over the management of the facility.omega and negotiated an extension to that lease turnover date on the explicit were consistent with the parties intentions expressed in paragraph of the the facility would still be capable of being operated as a facility when the eventual occurred.
the facility that surrendered was anything but capable of being used as such.we note that the undisputed facts above that put in breach of the incorporated management terms apply equally here.the occupants were gone,the staff was gone,and the commonwealth was pulling the plug on its certification.although the parties differ in their characterization of how the residents were says they all left of their own will,omega says they were parties agree that took affirmative steps to place the residents elsewhere and made no efforts to replace them.the parties also agree that had been negotiating with kentucky before the period to arrange for care,and that the funding of care and eventual profits therefrom would depend on the permanent closure of the excepticon facility.it is also clear that both parties are in agreement that it was during this holdover period that the coup de grâce was delivered to excepticon when its last patient left or was evicted and the commonwealth was free to decertify the facility.on the basis of these actions alone,omega is entitled to summary judgment on the issue of liability for breach of paragraph of the lease.
breach of paragraph of the lease 
finally,omega alleged in its motion for summary judgment that any lapse of the management agreement would constitute a separate breach of paragraph of the lease.pl.mot.supp.summ.the lease also makes the termination of the management agreement a breach of the lease,for which would be liable pursuant to its obligations under the lease terms.omega specifically pointed the court to lease paragraph,entitled default,termination which reads in relevant part,the parties hereto agree that notwithstanding any other provision of this lease,the term default as used in the lease will also include i the termination,either voluntary or involuntary,of the management agreement or ii the occurrence of an event of default by either party to the management agreement.
has based much of its appeal on the correct theory that its purchase of the petrie interests on january,resulted in the termination of the management agreement as a standalone contract.but did not respond in the district court to omega argument that the termination of the management agreement would also put it in breach of the lease.defense to the argument on appeal is to assert once again that omega never made that argument below.appellee br.they are incorrect having failed to identify any law or facts that would preclude this interpretation of paragraph,we find that the lessee petrie and as his succes
