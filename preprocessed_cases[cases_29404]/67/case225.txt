national railroad passenger corporation amtrak appeals from just compensation awards by the district court in connection with the condemnation of two parcels of land in providence,rhode island formerly owned by capital properties,cpi.in addition to challenging the monetary awards,amtrak contends that the district court erred by allowing cpi to call amtrak retained expert appraiser and examine him as a hostile witness during cpi.finding no merit in any of appellants arguments,we affirm the district court awards.
background 
in,the state of rhode island and city of providence adopted the capital center plan,a major effort to redevelop the city central business district.one of the primary aims of the plan was for amtrak,which owned and operated a railroad station in providence,to relocate the mainline railroad tracks serving the city,thereby enabling a considerable expansion of downtown providence with the creation of several parcels of waterfront property.a large tract of land encompassing the mainline railroad tracks and adjacent properties was designated as parcel in the plan.parcel contains three subparcels parcels,and.this appeal concerns the damages awarded to cpi following amtrak condemnation of and pursuant to its eminent domain power.
parcel is the railroad corridor that runs northerly from the providence railroad station to the smith street overpass.it consists of approximately square feet or somewhat less than two acres.in order to facilitate the capital center plan,it was necessary for amtrak and other property owners to make certain transfers with respect to.in,providence and worcester company p w,cpi predecessor in interest,conveyed what is now parcel to amtrak.in the same deed,p w acquired air rights beginning at a horizontal plane thirty feet above the top of the highest rail of the rail tracks,as well as subsurface rights in to lay foundations and erect support systems so that p w could build structures above the tracks.in,amtrak granted cpi,now having succeeded p w through merger,further air rights above the railroad tracks in time beginning at nineteen feet and three inches above the railroad addition to subsurface rights similar to those conveyed in the deed collectively,the air rights.at the same time,in an effort to further clarify its remaining interest in,amtrak reserved unto itself the railroad right of way in so that it could reconstruct and relocate its tracks consistent with the overall development of the capital center plan.
parcel,which consists of approximately square feet,is an adjacent strip of land to the railroad right of way and lies between parcel and gaspee street.parcel,also adjacent to the railroad right of way,lies between and the moshassuck river.by far the largest of the three subparcels,it covers approximately square feet or almost six and a half acres.by a deed dated july,cpi acquired both and from the rhode island port authority and economic development corporation edc.
both condemnation actions emanated from a prior action for trespass and ejectment brought by cpi against amtrak seeking the removal of structures erected by amtrak along the railroad corridor that encroached into the granted air rights and parcel.during the pendency of the trespass action,amtrak erected poles required for its rail service through the railroad corridor.in april,cpi amended its complaint demanding that amtrak lower or remove the poles entirely and eliminate other encroaching structures.cpi moved for a preliminary injunction in june.on july,shortly before the preliminary injunction hearing,amtrak condemned certain temporary easements in the air rights for a period of three years,thereby mooting cpi pending motion for ejectment.amtrak also deposited into the registry of the court as its estimate of the fair market value of the temporary taking of the air rights.cpi answered amtrak complaint for the temporary taking and also claimed severance damages to parcel.
on may,near the end of the temporary taking period,amtrak permanently condemned both the air rights and parcel,depositing an additional into the registry of the court as its initial estimate of the fair market value of the permanent taking.
on amtrak motion,the district court consolidated the two condemnation actions and then conducted a bench trial over a period in november.at trial,both amtrak and cpi presented evidence of the fair market value of the temporary and permanent takings through expert testimony.amtrak relied on william coyle,an expert appraiser,while cpi relied on both coyle and mark bates,another appraiser.coyle and bates agreed that the highest and best use of and the air rights was for mixed residential,office,and support retail purposes.they also agreed that would only be developed in conjunction with,a conclusion that followed from the capital center design and development regulations which provided that parcel shall not be developed unless parcel is developed.capital center commission ccc regulations,as amended.finally,the two experts agreed as to the fee values of both parcels.
the district court concluded that the value of the temporary taking of the air rights was cpi suffered severance damages to in the amount of during the temporary taking the fair market value of the permanent taking of the air rights as of may,was and the fair market value of as of may,was.

amtrak appeal boils down to two contentions that restrictions placed on by the july,deed as well as local regulations render legally impermissible the highest and best use adopted by the district court for and the air rights and that past problems with developing the properties render the adopted highest and best use economically infeasible.because neither argument has merit,we find no clear error in the district court awards.
both experts testified that the highest and best use of was for apartments,offices,or retail,and that there would be demand for these uses in the future.in addition,alex krieger,a harvard professor of urban planning called by amtrak as an expert testified that based on his experience with the capital center commission,he agreed that this was the best and highest use for the property.based on this highest and best use for,the district court awarded damages for the permanent taking of and severance damages to during the temporary taking of.
amtrak contends that because of use restrictions imposed by the edc in the deed to cpi,had no permissible use until.the deed contains a restrictive covenant which provides that the parcel may be used only for,or in connection with,the construction and operation of a parking garage containing not less than parking spaces,all or a portion of which will be located over all or a portion of the railroad corridor in addition,amtrak points to capital center commission regulations governing the parcels,which specifically forbid the construction of a parking garage on,see ccc regulations,and establish that parcel shall
