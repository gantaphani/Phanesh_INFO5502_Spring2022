defendant imc mortgage company imc appeals from decisions of the bankruptcy appellate panel rejecting imc attempt to obtain a recovery lien on certain property case and refusing to assert jurisdiction over an appeal from the bankruptcy court because it was not timely filed case.the debtors mortgage had been avoided,and imc,the assignee mortgage company,asserted as a defense that it was entitled to a lien on the property under two provisions of the bankruptcy code that permit certain creditors to obtain liens on property that a debtor has recovered.first,imc sought a lien under e,and after that request was denied,it sought,through a motion for reconsideration,a lien under a different provision,b.the bankruptcy court denied the motion for reconsideration as well.the bankruptcy appellate panel bap affirmed the trial court ruling on the denial of a lien under e and,with respect to the b defense,concluded that imc had not amended its notice of appeal to address the denial of the motion for reconsideration within the time limits of the bankruptcy rules.accordingly,the bap declined to exercise jurisdiction over that claim.
because imc was not entitled to assert the defenses and did not timely appeal the b decision to the bap,we affirm in both cases.
background 
on march,debtors linda jane burns and gerald dale burns executed a promissory note payable to defendant alternative mortgage source,ams in the amount of,and executed a mortgage deed giving ams a mortgage interest in their residence.ams immediately assigned its interest to imc mortgage company imc.in september of that year,the debtors filed for bankruptcy,and on january,the trustee filed this adversary proceeding in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of ohio.
according to the complaint,the trustee sought a declaration that,pursuant to a,the trustee interest in the property was superior to ams interest in the property.the trustee alleged that the mortgage deed had been signed by only one witness and thus did not conform with ohio law.the bankruptcy court credited the debtors testimony that although the deed itself was notarized and had signatures from two witnesses,only one witness had been present at the signing,and the court accordingly concluded that the second witness signature and the notarization must have been added subsequently.the bankruptcy court concluded that because the mortgage was not executed in accordance with ohio law,the trustee could set aside the mortgage under a,which permits a trustee to avoid any transfer that would be voidable by a bona fide purchaser under state law.
imc then asserted its defense that notwithstanding the avoidance,e entitled imc to a lien on the property.section provides for trustees to recover certain transferred properties and for protection to certain creditors from that recovery.specifically,a allows a trustee who avoids a transfer under a to recover the interest that was transferred,and e provides that good faith transferees from whom a trustee recovers property under a are entitled to a lien on the recovered property to offset the cost of any improvement including payment of debt that the transferee made following the transfer.imc argued that as a good faith transferee from ams who improved the property by paying off debt,it was entitled to a lien in the amount of.
the bankruptcy court concluded that imc was not entitled to a lien under e.the statutory language provides for a lien to secure the cost,to such transferee of improvements,and imc had not introduced any evidence that it had actually incurred the cost of the improvements.rather,the evidence suggested that the money used to satisfy the debtors prior mortgages had come from ams,and imc was not entitled to take advantage of the improvements made by ams.the bankruptcy court order was issued on january,and imc filed a notice of appeal from that judgment on january.
imc also filed a motion for reconsideration,arguing for the first time that b governs the recovery and lien issues.imc argued that the bankruptcy court judgment on e overlooked the legislative intent that was expressed in b.because b states that immediate good faith transferees are entitled to the same protections from a trustee recovery as those transferees such as ams who take for value,in good faith,and without knowledge of voidability,imc argued that e should be interpreted similarly so that imc,as a good faith transferee of ams,would be entitled to the same protections as ams.and so to the extent that ams had provided the debtors the money they used to satisfy their prior mortgages,imc argued that the bankruptcy court erred in finding that imc had not satisfied that requirement of e.
on january,the bankruptcy court denied imc motion for reconsideration.the court went beyond its earlier decision in which it had ruled that imc did not meet the requirements of e,and it ruled that had no applicability to the case at all.section governs only cases in which the trustee attempts to recover property or the value of property the trustee in the present case had sought only to declare that his interest in the debtors residence was superior to the interest of ams and imc.accordingly,any effort to import b into e,or assert any of the defenses,was irrelevant.
after this denial of the motion for reconsideration on january,imc notice of appeal from the january e judgment became effective and the time period under fed.a in which imc would be required to file a notice of appeal from the denial of motion for reconsideration,regarding the b issue,began to run.imc did not file such a notice of appeal,but on march,it filed a motion for leave to amend its notice of appeal from the january e ruling to include the january b decision.the bankruptcy court granted the motion the next day,and on march,imc amended its notice of appeal in order to appeal from both the january e ruling and the january b ruling.
the bap affirmed the bankruptcy court on the january e appeal and dismissed the january b appeal.with respect to the january e appeal,the bap ruled that was inapplicable to the present case.the bap ruled that when the trustee had avoided the transfer under,imc interest in the property was immediately preserved and automatically became part of the estate pursuant to a.accordingly,the trustee never had to resort to the recovery provisions of,and thus imc was unable to take advantage of defenses that create liens following the recovery of property.therefore the bap affirmed the bankruptcy court.with respect to the january b appeal,the bap ruled that imc had not timely appealed.the period in which imc should have appealed the january judgment expired on february,and the period that federal rule of bankruptcy procedure c allows appellants to move to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal expired on february.thus the district court lacked the authority to grant an extension and to permit the amended notice of appeal.
imc timely appealed from both decisions,and we have jurisdiction over the appeals pursuant to.we review the decision of the bankruptcy court directly,reviewing its factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.harker troutman in re troutman enterprises,cir.
ii.case the january e case 
this case involves two main concepts in bankruptcy law.the first concept is avoidance,through which a trustee is able to nullify a transfer that in some way diminished the estate.it is uncontroverted here that the trustee avoided imc mortgage in the debtors property.the question,however,is what happened to imc mortgage interest upon avoidance.imc argues that once the transfer was avoided,the trustee recovered the interest under a.recovery,the second concept,is a statutory mechanism through which property may be returned to the estate.the trustee argues that recovery was unnecessary in the present case,because imc interest returned to the estate immediately when the mortgage was avoided,without recovery.we agree.accordingly,we do not need to decide whether,as imc asserts,the protections offered in e apply not only to the initial good faith transferees,but also to any subsequent good faith transferees.
