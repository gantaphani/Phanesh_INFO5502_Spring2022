the bureau of ocean energy management boem of the department of the interior has sought to lease excellent prospects for oil and gas development in the chukchi sea off the northwest coast of alaska.the parcels available for lease are cumulatively known as lease sale.pursuant to the national environmental policy act nepa,boem prepared a final environmental impact statement feis analyzing the environmental effects of the proposed leases.boem based its environmental analysis on the assumption that if oil development actually occurs,one billion barrels of oil will be economically recoverable.
plaintiffs argued in the district court that boem abused its discretion by failing to account for essential missing information in the feis.plaintiffs also argued that boem estimate of one billion barrels is arbitrary and capricious.they contended that the potential economically recoverable oil from the lease sale is far higher than one billion barrels,and that boem had not given an adequate explanation for using its lower estimate.the district court initially rejected the feis for failing to account for the missing information.after remand,boem prepared a supplemental eis seis addressing the missing information.based on the feis and seis,the district court granted summary judgment to defendants.
we largely agree with the district court that the agency did not abuse its discretion in its analysis of the missing information.however,we agree with plaintiffs that the agency estimate of one billion barrels was chosen arbitrarily,and that this arbitrary decision meant that the agency based its decision on inadequate information about the amount of oil to be produced pursuant to the lease sale.
background 
the chukchi sea is a southern arm of the arctic ocean between alaska and russia.the sea contains a wide variety of animals,including bowhead whales,polar bears,pacific walrus,seals,fish,and birds.some of these animals provide subsistence for native inupiat communities along the alaskan coast.some of the animals are listed under the endangered species act esa as endangered or threatened.five exploratory wells were drilled in the sea between and.they had positive shows but did not lead to commercial production.

lease sale 
after completing a leasing plan for the chukchi sea,boem decided to offer a large portion of the sea for oil and gas leasing.the feis analyzed four alternatives for the lease sale a million acre proposed lease option covering blocks of the chukchi sea a option a proposed lease option excluding blocks extending along a corridor about miles from the alaskan coast and a proposed lease option excluding blocks extending along a corridor between and miles from the alaskan coast.
the national marine fisheries service recommended that the secretary of the interior select the third alternative,under which development would be farther from the coast,based on its conclusion that numerous endangered and threatened species living close to shore would be adversely affected by oil development.the secretary of the interior accepted boem recommendation and selected the fourth alternative,under which development would be closer to the coast.
the lease sale occurred on february.the federal government collected over billion from the winning bidders.at the time of the lease sale,there were no active leases in the sea.
procedural history 
plaintiffs filed suit,alleging seven deficiencies in the feis 
the feis does not adequately analyze and present the impacts of lease sale on the environment and human communities 
it fails to include essential missing information about the chukchi sea and the potential impacts of the lease sale,or explain why excluding this information is justified 
it fails to adequately analyze the impact of the lease sale in the context of a warming climate 
it understates the potential impacts of oil and gas development pursuant to the leases by analyzing a limited development scenario 
it understates the risks of an oil spill 
it fails to fully analyze the cumulative impacts to threatened eiders of the lease sale and other oil and gas development in threatened eiders arctic habitat and 
it provides a misleading analysis of the effects of seismic surveying.
the parties for summary judgment.
the district court agreed with defendants that much of the feis complied with nepa,including the feis assumption that there would be one billion barrels of economically recoverable oil.however,the court concluded that the feis analysis was flawed in three respects it failed to analyze the environmental impact of natural gas development,despite industry interest and specific lease incentives for such development it failed to determine whether missing information identified by the agency was relevant or essential under and it failed to determine whether the cost of obtaining the missing information was exorbitant,or the means of doing so unknown.the district court granted in part plaintiffs motion for summary judgment,issued a limited injunction,and remanded to boem for further proceedings.
after remand from the district court,boem prepared an seis.the seis analyzed the consequences of natural gas exploration and production.in the aftermath of the deepwater horizon oil spill in the gulf coast,it also analyzed the environmental impacts of a very large oil spill.finally,boem prepared an appendix analyzing whether the information gaps that were identified in the sale feis were relevant and necessary to evaluate reasonably foreseeable significant adverse effects.based on the feis,now supplemented by the seis,the secretary of interior again chose the fourth alternative for oil and gas leasing.
based on the feis and seis,the district court granted boem motion for summary judgment.the court found that boem has identified missing or incomplete information and has adequately evaluated it in a manner that is clearly sufficient at this stage of the development process to satisfy the requirements of.the court gave considerable deference to boem expertise.plaintiffs timely appealed.

iii.discussion 
on appeal,plaintiffs argue that boem abused its discretion in two respects.first,they argue that essential information is missing from the feis and seis,in violation of.second,they argue that the feis and seis underestimate the adverse environmental impact of the lease sale because they use an unrealistically low estimate of the economically recoverable oil.we disagree with plaintiffs first argument,but agree with their second argument.
essential information 
an agency obligation with respect to incomplete or unavailable information is spelled out in.the agency shall always make clear that information is lacking.id.if the missing information is relevant to reasonably foreseeable significant adverse impacts and is essential to a reasoned choice among alternatives and the overall costs of obtaining it are not exorbitant,the agency must include that information in the eis.id.a.if the missing information can not be obtained because the overall costs of obtaining it are exorbitant or the means to obtain it are not known,the agency must include the following in the eis a statement that such information is incomplete or unavailable a statement of the relevance of the incomplete or unavailable information to evaluating reasonably foreseeable significant adverse impacts on the human environment a summary of existing credible scientific evidence relevant to evaluating the reasonably foreseeable adverse impacts and the agency evaluation of such impacts based upon theoretical approaches or research methods generally accepted in the scientific community.id.b.section b clarifies that reasonably foreseeable effects include impacts which have catastrophic consequences,even if their probability of occurrence is low.
much of the information missing from the eis concerns animal populations potentially affected by oil exploration and production under the leases.the missing information concerns such things as population levels of various species of animals in the chukchi sea,including endangered or threatened animals the locations of various animal populations during the year the feeding and breeding habits of various animal populations and the vulnerability of various animal populations to drilling and other exploration and activities.
with respect to the potential environmental harm from a large oil spill,boem concluded that the missing information was not essential to a reasoned choice among the alternatives.it wrote in the seis,i n the unlikely event of a large oil spill,it is that environmental impacts could be severe.the severity of potential impacts would be nearly identical under any action alternative therefore,very specific types of information relevant to species,particular life history traits,or behavior do not help substantially in distinguishing among alternatives.with respect to other activities or events with potential adverse impacts on the animal populations in the chukchi sea,boem concluded that sufficient protections would be provided by the requirements of other environmental statutes,such as the clean air act,the marine mammal protection act mmpa,and the esa,and by the requirement under nepa to provide analyses at later stages of development.
based on these conclusions,boem stated in the seis that it did not consider any of the incomplete or unavailable information at issue to be essential to a reasoned choice among alternatives at this stage of the development process.a.boem therefore did not determine whether the information was unobtainable because the overall costs of obtaining it are exorbitant or the means to obtain it are not known.id.b.nor did boem go through the steps required by b if it had found essential information to be unobtainable.instead,boem specifically relied in the seis on what it characterized as its understanding that certain items of presently missing or incomplete information will be known and utilized to avoid or minimize adverse impacts at a later stage of ocs lands act environmental review.boem promised in the seis that it would thoroughly review specific development production plans at step development and production,if and when a project proponent actually submits a plan.thus,while certain information may,in fact,be essential at a later stage of ocs lands act review,such information may not be essential to a reasoned choice among alternatives at this lease sale stage.
in village of false pass clark,cir,we reviewed an eis of an oil and gas lease sale under ocsla.the plaintiff had argued that the commitment made by the government when entering into leases under ocsla is so substantial that a fully exhaustive environmental analysis under nepa had to be performed at the lease sale stage.we disagreed,writing 
nepa may require an environmental impact statement at each stage leasing,exploration,and production and development.furthermore,each stage remains separate.the completion of one stage does not entitle a lessee to begin the next.

p rojects for the development of oil and gas natural resources generally entail separate stages of leasing,exploration and development.at the earliest stage,the leasing stage we have before us,there is no way of knowing what plans for development,if any,may eventually materialize.
a lease sale under ocsla is analogous to a programmatic plan.the required level of analysis in an eis is different for programmatic and plans.we wrote in friends of yosemite valley norton,cir 
an agency planning and management decisions may occur at two distinct administrative levels 
the programmatic level at which the agency develops alternative management scenarios responsive to public concerns,analyzes the costs,benefits and consequences of each alternative in an eis,and adopts an amendable management plan to guide management of multiple use resources and the implementation stage during which individual site specific projects,consistent with the management plan,are proposed and assessed.

regardless of whether a programmatic or plan is at issue,nepa requires that an eis analyze environmental consequences of a proposed plan as soon as it is reasonably possible to do so.we wrote in kern bureau of land management,cir,with respect to a programmatic plan 
once an agency has an obligation to prepare an eis,the scope of its analysis of environmental consequences in that eis must be appropriate to the action in question.nepa is not designed to postpone analysis of an environmental consequence to the last possible moment.rather,it is designed to require such analysis as soon as it can reasonably be done.if it is reasonably possible to analyze the environmental consequences in an eis for a resource management plan,the agency is required to perform that analysis.
id.at citation omitted see also pac.rivers council forest,cir,dismissed as moot.this is not to say that an agency must provide the most extensive environmental analysis possible at the earliest possible moment,for an agency has some flexibility in deciding the level of analysis to be performed at a particular stage.we will defer to the agency judgment about the appropriate level of analysis so long as the eis provides as much environmental analysis as is reasonably possible under the circumstances,thereby provid ing sufficient detail to foster informed at the stage in question.friends of yosemite valley,at internal quotation marks omitted.
in the case before us,we conclude that boem has reasonably concluded that the missing information from the feis and seis is not essential to informed decisionmaking at the lease sale stage.we agree with boem that compliance with statutes such as the mmpa and the esa will provide protection for animals covered by those statutes.the mmpa generally prohibits the take of marine mammals.a.a take encompasses any act of torment or annoyance that has the potential to injure or disturb a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild by causing disruption of natural behavioral patterns,including,but not limited to,migration,surfacing,nursing,breeding,feeding,or sheltering.id,a i ii.unlawful takes trigger civil and criminal penalties.id.a,b.further,under the esa a,a,boem must consult with the national marine fisheries service and the fish and wildlife service to insure that any action authorized,funded,or carried out by such agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species.if an action is likely to jeopardize a species,the acting agency must determine whether any reasonable and prudent alternatives exist that will avoid jeopardizing that species.b a.we recognize that boem has already consulted with these agencies at the lease sale stage.it may well have to consult with them again at the development and production stage when specific plans have been proposed and activities are contemplated.we note that it may also have to consult again at the lease sale stage,once it has performed a proper analysis of the estimated overall oil production.because these statutes provide additional protections for animals in the chukchi sea,they support boem conclusion that missing information about these animals was not essential at this stage.
we also agree with boem that further environmental analysis will be appropriate at a later stage.in boem words,certain items of presently missing or incomplete information will be known and utilized to avoid or minimize adverse impacts at a later stage of ocs lands act environmental review.that is,when a project proponent actually submits a plan,boem will be required under nepa to perform a plan or environmental analysis of that proposed plan.at that stage,missing or incomplete information that has not been essential to a reasoned choice among alternatives at the lease sale stage may later become essential.if there is essential information at the plan or development and production stage,boem will be required to perform the analysis under b that it has not performed in the feis and seis now before us.
of course,we recognize that our discussion and decision in the next section regarding boem one billion barrel estimate may have some effects upon the remainder of the feis.but we will not at this time speculate about the extent of those effects,if any.the defendants are in the best position to analyze those effects,if any,and have the duty to analyze them in the first instance.
b.one billion barrel estimate 
plaintiffs contend that boem chose an arbitrary number for the total barrels of economically recoverable oil from lease sale.the feis estimated the amount of recoverable oil by estimating production from the first offshore oil field that would be developed within the area of the leases.boem did not make any estimate of recoverable oil from additional fields that might be developed.the feis specified that the recoverable oil resources from this field are assumed to be billion barrels bbbl.the feis then used the one billion barrel estimate as the basis for its environmental analysis.
we must determine whether boem has articulated a rational basis for its decision to use the one billion barrel estimate.mora meraz thomas,cir.we must reverse a decision as arbitrary and capricious if 
the agency relied on factors congress did not intend it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,or offered an explanation that runs counter to the evidence before the agency or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.
lands council ii,at internal quotation marks omitted.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that boem one billion barrel estimate is arbitrary and capricious.
the selection of one billion barrels 
boem first announced it was developing an eis in preparation for lease sale in july.according to internal boem emails,boem analyst jim craig was assigned to provide resource estimates and a scenario which other boem scientists would use to analyze environmental effects.craig emailed his supervisor,deborah cranswick,stating that he believed that t he reasonably foreseeable scenario should include oil production from the first field only,not the full economic potential.craig reason for focusing on the first field production was practical he would have to wait for about two months to have information that would allow him to develop a scenario for the entire area covered by the lease sale.craig stated in his email,you realize that we wo have the resource assessment numbers until sept,so we must base the scenario on the first development not the total economic potential.craig also indicated that this emphasis on the first oil field was a departure from previous work.
craig asked cranswick whether the scenario should employ a single estimate of oil production from that first field,or whether it should employ a range.cranswick responded by email that she preferred a range.craig then suggested,in a july email,a range from million barrels to billion barrels.craig emphasized in his email that the scenario should assume equal probability for any volume within the range so that one billion barrels does not become the de facto outcome.craig draft scenario also noted,with respect to recoverable oil in the chukchi sea,that o ur current petroleum assessment indicates that recoverable oil resources could range from to billion barrels.
there is a gap in the email chain in our record,so we do not know cranswick next response to craig.but we do know that in a subsequent email from craig to cranswick on august,craig proposed a single one billion barrel estimate as an alternative to using a range that was too broad 
attached is a table with e d data.if this represents too broad of a range,then i think we should fall back to a single volume bbbl for the eis analysis with a corresponding set of single e d numbers.it hard to have it both ways very narrow range when these figures are entirely speculative.
there are two clear options 
mmbbl,as a uniform distribution every point in range is equally likely.this will require a low and high case analysis.
bbbl as a single point estimate with no confidence interval.this will require a mostly likely case analysis only.
although it would be nice to propose a recoverable oil volume of mmbbl mmbbl in a confidence interval,we do have any data to support it.
pick or,but not and.
on august,cranswick emailed craig a data chart reflecting craig second option.it contained only a single one billion barrel estimate.
on that same day,craig emailed to cranswick a draft scenario relying on the one billion barrel estimate of oil production.this draft explained 
the scenario assumed for environmental analysis involves the discovery,development,and production of the first oil field in the chukchi sale area.ultimately recoverable oil resources from this field are assumed to be billion barrels bbbl.smaller oil volumes are not likely to be economic to produce and single pools containing larger volumes are increasingly rare.if oil prices drop below per barrel they are above when this scenario was written,exploration in the chukchi ocs is expected to be minimal and oil discoveries may not be developed.
the draft also pointed out that the mean recoverable oil resource in the chukchi sea is bbbl with a probability of bbbl.craig also prepared a chart for cranswick comparing the numbers craig had selected for the lease sale eis to an eis prepared for the chukchi sea and hope sea basin for the five year oil and gas leasing program.that previous eis had estimated a range for economical oil production from billion barrels to billion barrels.
on august,cranswick circulated the lease sale eis scenario to other boem scientists who would be working on the eis.the scenario contained the one billion barrel estimate.cranswick explained in an email that 
t he scenario is based on a one economic resource number note this is not necessarily the most likely.a lower volume is more likely to occur but less likely to be developed from an economic standpoint a higher volume is less likely to occur but more likely to be developed.
several boem employees expressed concern with the agency proposed scenario.for example,one nepa analyst employed by boem,dee williams,wrote,i do understand why the agency does use their sophisticated assessment indices to impose a more definitive likely scenario.clearly,it is impossible to predict with certainty,but the narrative needs to inspire greater public confidence by explaining the parameters of reasonable expectations.williams further stated 
if it becomes economical to build one platform to produce an estimated billion barrels,and there is between and billion barrels that are recoverable,why is the scenario not compelled to imagine more than one platform is a single platform always the initial scenario,in which case maybe we should just explain that 
cranswick responded that the initial scenario is one platform because we ca have only a partial platform if that is all that the resource estimate support s.at the same time,cranswick suggested that smaller oil developments would be associated with the first oil platform.once the first platform goes in,it is likely that additional satellite subsea completions would be developed before another host platform would be considered.
once the draft eis was completed,boem sought comments from other agencies and from the public.numerous outside commentators expressed concern about the scenario boem had developed.for example,the environmental protection agency wrote that 
the hypothetical development scenario that is used in the document add s additional layers of uncertainty regarding the probabilities of exploration,production and development activities and the risks associated with those activities epa is concerned that,overall,the depth and diversity of uncertainties presented in the document resulted in the lack of adequate support for many of the document conclusions.
the division of migratory bird management at the fish and wildlife service fws similarly challenged the one billion barrel estimate as inaccurate 
the basic assumptions used in the analysis of effects are flawed with regards to the size of development scenarios.the draft eis deis states that the current petroleum assessment indicates a mean recoverable oil resource of billion barrels yet all environmental analyses reported in the deis are based on a development of billion barrels,thereby significantly underestimating likely scenarios.
the division recommended that boem not proceed with the lease sale until problems with the eis were corrected.public commentators similarly pointed to flaws in employing a one billion barrel production estimate,including that such an estimate was based on a price of oil at half the current market value,that the estimate severely understates the true cumulative impacts of oil production,and that it was nowhere justified with scientific analysis.despite these criticisms,boem continued to rely on its one billion barrel estimate.the one billion barrel estimate was the basis for the entire feis,including its analysis of the risk of a large oil spill.for example,boem instructed the fws to rely on that estimate in that agency analysis of whether the lease sale would jeopardize listed threatened species such as the spectacled and steller eiders.had fws made a jeopardy finding,boem either would not have been able to proceed with the lease sale under the esa or would have had to obtain an exemption from the no jeopardy rule.a.
arbitrary and capricious 
plaintiffs contend that the one billion barrel estimate was chosen arbitrarily,and that boem did not provide an adequate explanation for its selection.we agree for three reasons.
first,boem has not justified its choice of the lowest possible amount of oil that was economical to produce as the basis for its analysis.the draft eis scenario stated that the agency chose to focus on a one billion barrel estimate in part because any volume lower than one billion barrels would not be economical to produce.at the same time,boem was well aware that if any oil was produced from lease sale,the economically recoverable oil was very likely to exceed one billion barrels.in an august,email commenting on the draft eis,jim craig wrote,we assume billion bbl for the first field,but there is another bbbl that is economic at.craig attached a table to a december email,listing estimates for speculative oil and gas reserves,specifying a range between and billion barrels for the chukchi shelf.finally,in a may email craig wrote,the billion barrel,first field assumption is subjective for purposes of analysis and represents only a fraction of the full economic resource potential in the chukchi which was recently published.
the mean estimate of economical oil production,at the center of the distribution curve,is by definition a more likely occurrence than is the lowest estimate of viable oil production.previous eises in the chukchi sea had used the mean estimate of oil production as the basis for their analyses,and those eises had also included low and high estimates.for example,boem previously leased portions of the chukchi sea in lease sale.the parcels leased in lease sale overlap substantially with the parcels leased in lease sale.documents prepared in advance of lease sale stated that t he mean resource estimate is billion barrels of oil with a percent chance of a discovery of commercially recoverable oil.in estimating the effects of oil spills from lease sale,boem assume d the full development of the resource estimate of billion barrels.in contrast,while estimates in the record about the economically recoverable amount of oil from lease sale vary,nowhere is the mean amount of economical production calculated to be less than billion barrels.but the feis for lease sale uses one billion rather than billion barrels as the basis for its analysis of environmental consequences.
boem primary explanation for using its estimate for oil production is that this scenario overestimates the likely amount of production.boem emphasizes that because of the remoteness of the area and the risk of economic failure,any oil production activity is an unlikely result of the lease sale.more specifically,boem estimates that there is a less than percent likelihood that oil development in the region will occur.defendants argue that since the most likely foreseeable outcome is no oil development at all,one billion barrels of oil production is actually a generous estimate.
this analysis is flawed.the assumption that there is a percent chance of commercial oil development is itself without a rational basis in the record.jim craig first developed the estimate off the top of his head in an email exchange.that calculation contradicts estimates used earlier in the eis,as well as estimates used in past eises for the chukchi sea.further,boem conflates the likelihood of oil and gas production with the likelihood of environmental effects if such production occurs.based on its responsibility to consider all foreseeable direct and indirect impacts of the proposed action,alaska envtl,at citation omitted,boem concluded that oil production was reasonably foreseeable.there is a substantial basis for this in the record because,as noted by boem,the area has high oil resource potential and there is existing transportation infrastructure to move oil from northern alaska to distant markets.once boem made the determination that production is reasonably foreseeable,it was required to consider the full cumulative impact of that production.see.put differently,boem might well be right that the most likely outcome is that there will be no oil development in the chukchi sea.but that fact should have made no difference to boem analysis of the reasonably foreseeable environmental effects of oil development,if such development does occur.
second,the feis did not take into account variation in oil prices in arriving at the estimate that one billion barrels of oil are economically recoverable.an assumption of stable prices ignores the fact that the amount of economically recoverable oil varies substantially depending on oil prices.this may be seen,for example,in a report of the minerals management service a prior incarnation of boem,which estimated economically recoverable oil from the chukchi shelf at different prices.at per barrel,the mean estimate was barrels at per barrel,the mean estimate was billion barrels at per barrel,the mean estimate was billion barrels at dollars per barrel,the mean estimate was billion barrels.
third,boem has not provided an adequate explanation for its decision to base its eis only on the amount of oil expected to be produced from the first field in the leased area of the chukchi sea.it is unclear from the record how boem initially estimated that the first field would produce one billion barrels of oil.jim craig himself suggested that his calculations regarding that first development were entirely speculative.but even assuming that one billion barrels is an accurate estimate of the amount of oil to be produced from the first field,it is unclear why boem assumed that only one oil field would be developed in the lease area.the feis itself acknowledges that w hen the first project overcomes the cost,logistical,and regulatory hurdles,more projects are likely to follow.
the feis explains that it is unlikely that all economically viable resources will be developed in the sea due to the difficulties in operating in a frontier area of oil production.but the feis does not explain why production would be expected to stop if the first oil field is developed.the primary explanation for that assumption suggested by the record is that data to analyze the full economic potential of the lease sale would not be available until about two months after jim craig initially proposed an estimate based on the first field.previous evaluations of chukchi sea oil development had assumed that multiple oil fields would develop once commercial development was viable.in a technology assessment of chukchi sea petroleum development performed in for boem,the bureau of land management had used a billion barrel estimate to measure prospects in the central chukchi shelf.that assessment assumed that two oil fields would be developed one of one billion barrels and one of billion barrels.on the record before us,it remains unclear why boem chose to analyze the lowest amount of oil that could be produced in the chukchi sea from the smallest number of oil fields that could be developed.
defendants contend that any error resulting from using the one billion barrel estimate can be corrected through sitespecific eises later in the development process.we disagree.an agency is required to analyze the environmental effects in an eis as soon as it is reasonably possible to do so.kern,at.an appropriate time to estimate the total oil production from the lease sale is the time of the lease sale itself.under nepa,boem is required to take into account the full environmental effects of its actions when deciding whether and in what manner to pursue the lease sale.c.a later project or environmental analysis is an inadequate substitute for an estimate of total production from the lease sale as a whole.it is only at the lease sale stage that the agency can adequately consider cumulative effects of the lease sale on the environment,including the overall risk of oil spills and the effects of the sale on climate change.it is also only at the lease sale stage that the agency can take into account the effects of oil production in deciding which parcels to offer for lease.
we also disagree with defendants that our decisions in akutan,at,false pass,at,and watt,at,compel a contrary result.in false pass,plaintiffs challenged the agency for failing to consider the worst case scenario for oil development.at.in the circumstances presented there,we held that there was a rational explanation for not considering the worst case at the lease sale stage.here,in contrast,the boem considered only the best case scenario for environmental harm,assuming oil development.a best case scenario skew s the data toward fewer environmental impacts,and thus impedes a full and fair discussion of the potential effects of the project.native ecosystems council forest,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
unlike in akutan,boem estimate did not merely inform an assessment of the likelihood of an oil spill.at.among other things,its estimate informed an assessment of seismic effects,habitat effects,oil production,and the cumulative effects of the sale on global warming.boem estimate also informed fws determination that lease sale would not jeopardize listed species.the record suggests that fws was close to finding,even under the one billion barrel assumption,that the lease sale would jeopardize the spectacled and steller eiders.had boem not selected the least amount of oil necessary for production,fws may well have concluded that the listed species were in jeopardy.see a.
finally,the degree of error in the estimation of total oil production is greater here than in our earlier cases.in watt,the agency was ready to publish its eis when newly available figures suggested that oil reserves were roughly twice those originally estimated.at.we held in watt that the agency had acted reasonably when it decided not to supplement its eis with analysis of the risk of an oil spill based on the new figures.id.at.in the case before us,boem was fully aware from the ver
