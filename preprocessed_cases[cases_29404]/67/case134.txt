background 
facts not in issue 
in the hornbeck entered into a vessel conversion contract the contract with cianbro for the conversion of the vessels from sulfur tankers into supply vessels.section of the contract provided that 
all portions of the work that cianbro does not perform shall be performed under subcontracts or by other appropriate agreement between cianbro and the entity performing the work.nothing contained in the contract shall create any contractual relationship between the hornbeck entities and any subcontractor of cianbro.notwithstanding the foregoing,for informational purposes only,cianbro shall furnish to the hornbeck entities at its request a copy of each subcontract it enters into in connection with the work.at the request of the hornbeck entities,they shall be included in all negotiations with the subcontractor shall be provided pertaining thereto sic.upon the hornbeck entities request,cianbro will provide the hornbeck entities with copies of all work papers and correspondence relating or pertaining to a subcontractor.
in section of the contract it is further established that 
the hornbeck entities may designate specific persons or entities from whom cianbro shall obtain bids.cianbro shall obtain bids from prospective subcontractors and from suppliers of materials or equipment fabricated especially for the work and shall deliver such bids to the hornbeck entities prior to the award in sufficient time for the hornbeck entities to evaluate the bids without compromising the project schedule.the hornbeck entities shall then determine,with the advice of cianbro,which bids will be accepted.cianbro will not be required to contract with anyone to whom cianbro has reasonable objection.
in the following section,the parties stipulated that any subcontracts of any tier with affiliates of cianbro or entities owned in whole or in part by shareholders of cianbro are to be awarded only with the written approval of the hornbeck entities.the contract further provided that cianbro warranted to the hornbeck entities that it would complete the work free and clear of any liens,a provision which fueled cianbro filing of the present action seeking a declaration that such liens had not been established,and an action in which the hornbeck entities have intervened as interested parties 
thereafter,on or about november,cianbro,as general contractor by means of a purchase order so dated contracted with hub technologies,hub a business entity engaged in the manufacture,design,engineering and fabrication of structures used in various industrial applications,to fabricate for cianbro certain steel components to be used in the conversion work of the vessels.as required by section of the contract,prior to awarding the bid to hub,cianbro identified the bid to the hornbeck entities and delivered hub bid to them.there is no evidence in the record that the hornbeck entities had any other involvement in this relationship or in the performance by hub of its contract with cianbro.
cianbro agreed that it would supply some of the necessary steel to hub from its stores since it was aware that hub itself did not supply or warehouse structural steel,and that hub would need to acquire the steel from other suppliers.cianbro never informed hub that hub was not authorized to incur liens on the vessels or to extend credit on the vessels to its subcontractors.nor did cianbro instruct hub to inform its subcontractors that the subcontractors would not be allowed to place liens on the vessels or to rely on the credit of the vessels.
in december of,dean became involved in the project as a subcontractor to hub.dean was to perform some of the initial cutting work on the steel as part of hub project to fabricate the steel into components for the vessels.both hub and dean steel were provided with the plans,drawings,and specifications for the conversion project the specifications by cianbro,so that the finished components to be delivered to cianbro by hub would meet the specifications.in the meantime,cianbro shipped approximately pounds of raw structural steel directly to dean steel at hub request,and as a result,together with the steel supplied by dean steel itself,between november,and october,dean steel supplied hub with substantial quantities of structural steel which had been cut in accordance with the specifications.thereafter,hub used the steel delivered by dean steel to hub facilities to fabricate the components that hub had contracted for with cianbro for installation in the vessels most importantly,it is undisputed that dean steel never delivered any components directly to cianbro nor to the vessels.
these components were later installed in the vessels by cianbro,which paid hub in full for the work and materials that it had provided in manufacturing these components.unfortunately,hub had failed to pay dean steel for all of the work and materials that dean steel had invested in the steel used in these components.when hub filed for bankruptcy in november,hub owed dean steel the sum of for the materials and labor that dean steel had provided to hub.nevertheless,dean steel proceeded to file notices of maritime liens against the vessels for said amount,claiming that it had provided necessaries to the vessels between november,and september,but had not been paid for the same.in response,cianbro filed an action for declaratory judgment under c.the hornbeck entities intervened as a plaintiff,and cianbro and the hornbeck entities moved for summary judgment on their claim.
b.the decision of the district court 
in adopting the recommended decision of the magistrate judge,the district court granted summary judgment against dean steel on two alternate grounds which succinctly encapsulate the medulla of the question to be decided by us first the district court concluded that dean steel failed to raise a genuine issue that it acted at the direction of the vessels owners or the vessels designee and second that dean steel failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether it provided necessaries to the vessels.
