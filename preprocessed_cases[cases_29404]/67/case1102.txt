this case arises from the sale of an expensive and historic home in neenah,wisconsin.after moving in,the buyers discovered numerous defects in the home and sued the sellers in federal district court for breach of contract,various forms of misrepresentation,and negligence.the present appeal is limited to a dispute about insurance,whether the sellers insurer has a duty to defend the sellers under the terms of several insurance policies,all of which provide coverage for property damage caused by an occurrence,which is defined in the policies as an accident.the district court,sitting in diversity and applying wisconsin law,held there was no duty to defend,entered summary judgment for the insurer,and certified the judgment as final for purposes of an immediate appeal under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.
in their briefs and at oral argument,the sellers maintained that their insurer duty to defend was triggered by the allegations in two of the claims in the underlying lawsuit a fraudulent misrepresentation claim under section of the wisconsin statutes and a negligent misrepresentation claim.the wisconsin supreme court intervening decision in stuart weisflog showroom gallery,stuart ii,wi,has eliminated the first of these arguments,as the sellers have conceded.as to the remaining argument,we conclude that the buyers claim for negligent misrepresentation does not allege property damage caused by an accident.accordingly,the insurer owes no duty to defend,and we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
torge and svetlana goderstad owned a vintage century home in neenah,wisconsin,and in they enlarged it with a addition.in they sold the home to eric and deborah eberts for million.the ebertses took occupancy in august and by november began to notice defects in the exterior insulation and finishing work in the addition,which led to water leaks and moisture entrapment between the home interior and exterior walls.these and other defects in the home prompted the ebertses to sue the goderstads and their business,national plastics trading,in the united states district court for the eastern district of wisconsin the goderstads had since moved to colorado,and the suit invoked the court diversity jurisdiction.the complaint alleged seven claims for relief under wisconsin law breach of contract intentional misrepresentation a claim under.stat.for violation of wisconsin criminal theft statute.stat.misrepresentation fraudulent misrepresentation in violation of,which prohibits false,deceptive,or misleading representations in the sale of real estate negligent misrepresentation and negligence.
american family mutual insurance,the goderstads insurer under several policies,appointed counsel for the goderstads under a reservation of rights,see estate of sustache am.family mut.ins,wi,and moved to intervene under rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure in order to protect its interest in the lawsuit.the district court allowed the intervention and on american family motion,agreed to bifurcate the issues of liability and coverage.
american family then moved for summary judgment on the coverage issue,which the district court granted.applying wisconsin law,the court held that none of the ebertses claims were covered under any of the goderstads policies and therefore the insurer had no continuing duty to defend.the district court then certified its judgment under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure to satisfy the rule and permit immediate review.fed.civ.b.in its current posture,therefore,this case comes to us as the goderstads versus american family,with the goderstads as the appellants,opposing their insurer early exit from the suit.
ii.discussion 
a.the american family policies and applicable principles 
the goderstads and national plastics were covered under four american family insurance policies during the relevant time homeowner policy,an umbrella liability policy,and two business relevant portions of which are not materially different.each policy provides coverage for property damage caused by an occurrence.as is usually the case,occurrence is defined in the policies as an accident,but the term accident is otherwise left undefined.wisconsin caselaw provides several alternative definitions,all of which attempt to capture the fortuity principle central to liability insurance.lucterhand granite microsystems,cir.an accident for purposes of liability insurance coverage is a n unexpected,undesirable event or an unforeseen incident which is characterized by a lack of intention.everson lorenz,wi,internal quotation marks omitted.the word accident,in accident policies,means an event which takes place without one foresight or expectation.a result,though unexpected,is not an accident the means or cause must be accidental.am.family mut.ins.am.girl,wi,quoting black law dictionary ed.
american family will owe a continuing duty to defend the goderstads if the allegations in the ebertses complaint raise the possibility of coverage under the foregoing policy language.lucterhand,at wausau tile,county concrete,t he duty to defend hinges on the nature,not the merits,of the claim.see also doyle engelke.on appeal,the goderstads have focused on just two of the seven claims in the underlying suit they contend that the claim for fraudulent misrepresentation under and the claim for negligent misrepresentation fall potentially within their policies coverages 
everson and the court of appeals opinion in stuart 
the parties initial briefing and oral argument concentrated largely on the interplay between the wisconsin supreme court decision in everson lorenz,wi,and the wisconsin court of appeals decision the following year in stuart weisflog showroom gallery,wi app.at issue in everson was whether a commercial general liability policy provided coverage for claims of negligent misrepresentation.wi.the plaintiffs,paul and michelle everson,purchased a residential lot in a subdivision developed by the defendant,richard lorenz,unaware that their lot was within the boundary of a flood plain.lorenz had provided the eversons with a list of the lots partially within the flood plain,but the list erroneously designated lot instead of lot as among those affected.that is,lot parcel the eversons mistakenly designated as lot on the list,making it appear that lot was not in the flood plain.the eversons sued lorenz for strict responsibility and negligent misrepresentation 
like the policies at issue here,lorenz insurance policy covered only losses caused by an occurrence,defined as an accident.the supreme court held that lorenz insurer was not obligated to defend the misrepresentation claims.using the definition of accident we have set forth above,the court concluded that lorenz misrepresentation about the lot can not be considered an accident for purposes of liability insurance coverage.id.the court noted that t o be liable,lorenz must have asserted a false statement,and such an assertion requires a degree of volition inconsistent with the term accident.although this assertion may be prompted by negligence,it is nevertheless devoid of any suggestion of accident.id,citation omitted.thus,the court viewed the degree of volition inherent in the making of a false factual statement as incompatible with the common understanding of the term accident.accordingly,the court concluded that lorenz insurance policy did not cover the and negligent misrepresentation claims asserted in the underlying complaint.id.this was so even though lorenz did not intend to deceive the eversons when he made the false statement but was merely alleged to have been negligent as strictly responsible statement falsity.id.
everson scotches insurance coverage for most misrepresentation claims where the policy in question limits coverage to losses caused by occurrences,meaning accidents as many liability policies do.almost all cognizable claims of misrepresentation require a false statement of fact and therefore a degree of volition inconsistent with an accident under the rationale of everson indeed,the goderstads agreed in the district court that based on everson,the ebertses various misrepresentation claims against them were not covered.the district court accepted that concession and summarily disposed of the goderstads remaining the negligence claim was sufficient to trigger dismissing that count for failure to state a claim.see supra note.
the district court decision,however,was issued before the wisconsin court of appeals decided stuart weisflog showroom gallery,wi app.stuart involved the question of liability coverage for a loss incurred in connection with a claim for violation of a regulation.the regulation in question,wisconsin administrative code atcp,prohibits the making of any false,deceptive or misleading representation in order to induce any person to enter into a home improvement contract.the case involved a building contractor who was retained on a home remodeling project and was later sued by the homeowner for serious defects in the remodeling work.the court of appeals heard the case in two stages one concerning issues on the merits,stuart weisflog showroom gallery,wi app,and the other concerning issues,stuart weisflog showroom gallery,wi app.
in the second stage,the court of appeals held that the contractor insurer was obligated to indemnify the contractor under its commercial general liability policy,like the policies coverage for loss caused by an occurrence,defined as an accident.the court of appeals reasoned that because a misrepresentation in violation of atcp did not require intent to defraud,the contractor misrepresentation could be considered an accident for purposes of the insurer indemnity obligation.id.the court also noted that statute on which the ebertses have premised one of their misrepresentation claims in this be read in pari materia with the court interpretation of atcp.id.
on the strength of the court of appeals decision in stuart,the goderstads asked the district court to reconsider its decision.the court declined to do so,and this appeal ensued.in the meantime,however,the wisconsin supreme court granted review in stuart,and like the court of appeals,heard the case in two stages.see stuart weisflog showroom gallery,stuart i,wi,involving merits issues stuart weisflog showroom gallery,stuart ii,wi,involving coverage issues.but when the goderstads argued their case in this court,stuart ii was still pending and awaiting decision in the supreme court.the goderstads suggested that we certify this case to the supreme court pursuant to circuit rule,but we opted to hold it in abeyance and required the parties to file supplemental briefs after the supreme court released its decision in stuart ii.they have done so.
c.the wisconsin supreme court decision in stuart ii 
stuart ii and the misrepresentation claim 
as we have noted,the goderstads initially maintained,based on the court of appeals decision in stuart,that the ebertses misrepresentation claim under triggers american family duty to defend.they argued that the atcp,at issue in an element and therefore the alleged statutory misrepresentation should be considered a covered accident.but the supreme court in stuart ii reversed the court of appeals,rejecting the argument that either atcp or lack a scienter requirement both the regulation and the statute require proof of a defendant purpose or intent to induce a contract or sale.stuart ii,wi.more specifically,atcp prohibits the making of any false,deceptive or misleading representation in order to induce any person to enter into a home improvement contract prohibits any assertion,representation or statement of fact which is untrue,deceptive or misleading made with intent to sell or intent to induce a contract for the sale of among other things real estate.
it is true,as we have recently observed,that the stuart ii court was sharply divided on the underlying rationale for its decision the case was decided by a plurality opinion and two concurrences,each of which attracted two votes.see lucterhand,at discussing the split in stuart ii.but the court was unanimous in concluding that the misrepresentation claim was not covered all of the justices agreed that a claim for misrepresentation under atcp required a degree of volition that was inconsistent with the idea of an accident.stuart ii,wi.the intent to sell and intent to induce a contract language of is,if anything,even clearer on this point than the in order to induce a contract language in atcp.the supreme court decision in stuart ii is fatal to the goderstads argument that the misrepresentation claim falls potentially within the coverage of their policies.they recognize as much,conceding the issue in the statement they filed with this court after stuart ii was released.
stuart ii and the negligent misrepresentation claim 
the goderstads remaining the ebertses negligent misrepresentation claim triggers also fall short based on everson alone,for the reasons we have already explained.but the split opinions in stuart ii have complicated the matter.to recap,everson held that and negligent misrepresentation claims were not covered under policy language defining occurrence as an accident because the insured was alleged to have asserted a false statement and such an assertion requires a degree of volition inconsistent with the term accident.everson,wi.the justices disagreement in stuart ii centered primarily on the proper way to read everson.see lucterhand,at.
the everson decision appeared to establish a rule that the very act of making a false statement or assertion of to most claims for inherently repugnant to the idea of a covered accident.as we have noted,the logic of this decision precludes coverage for almost all claims of misrepresentation,or at least all those that involve an affirmative false statement or assertion as opposed to a failure to disclose.everson,wi.the logic of the decision probably precludes coverage for any misrepresentation based on nondisclosure as well in the limited circumstances where the law imposes a duty to disclose,the failure to do so is treated as the equivalent of an affirmative false representation kaloti,kellogg sales,wi.
but in stuart ii,the court appears to have taken a position that is less categorical than everson,or at least less clear.we described the competing positions of the justices at greater length in lucterhand,at,and need not repeat that discussion here.it suffices to say that only justice roggensack,joined in concurrence by justice ziegler,adhered to a interpretation of everson.stuart ii,wi,roggensack,concurring.justice bradley,joined in concurrence by chief justice abrahamson,rejected that view this was unsurprising,since they had dissented in everson.id.bradley,concurring everson,wi,bradley,dissenting.the three justices in the plurality sidestepped the debate between the concurrences,focusing instead on the purposive inducement element of the atcp claim.the plurality concluded that the contractor false representations about his qualifications and design were both volitional and as required for a violation of atcp made in order to induce the making of a contract,and that this combination rendered the loss nonaccidental.stuart ii,wi.justice bradley and chief justice abrahamson joined this part of the plurality opinion,with certain provisos that are not important to the analysis here.id.bradley,concurring see also lucterhand,at explaining the disagreement between the stuart ii plurality opinion and justice bradley concurrence.
significantly,stuart ii involved a claim for misrepresentation in violation of atcp,not a claim for negligent misrepresentation although the justices disagreed about how to interpret everson,there is nothing in the stuart ii opinions to suggest that the holding of everson is no longer good law.everson held that a false assertion of fact giving rise to a or negligent misrepresentation claim is not an accident for purposes of liability coverage,and that holding is fully applicable here.
in their supplemental brief,the goderstads do not contest this conclusion but maintain instead that because the ebertses complaint alleges nondisclosures,the negligent misrepresentation claim by definition involves an inadvertent,failure to act rather than a volitional false statement of fact.they argue that a neglig
