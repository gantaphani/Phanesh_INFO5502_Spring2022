dorothy davis was the victim of a predatory mortgage loan in.she sued the original lender and won a judgment that has not been collectable.in this lawsuit,davis and now,after her death,her estate sought damages from wells fargo bank,which later bought her loan,and litton loan servicing,which later took over the servicing of her loan.the lawsuit asserted claims for unconscionability and fraud under illinois state law,as well as federal claims for violations of the home ownership and equity protection act hoepa,and race discrimination under the equal credit opportunity act ecoa,a,and race discrimination under the fair housing act fha,b.the district court dismissed most claims under rule b as barred by applicable statutes of limitations and others on the merits,and granted summary judgment on the merits of one final claim.davis estate appeals the dismissal of these claims.we agree with the district court analysis of all but one claim.the exception is that we conclude that davis ecoa claim of race discrimination should not have been dismissed at the pleading stage.the error was harmless,however,because the defendants were entitled to summary judgment on the merits of her claim of race discrimination.we affirm the judgment of the district court.
statutes of limitations 
the respective limitations periods for each of davis claims frame the issues we review in this appeal.unconscionability and fraud claims are subject to a statute of limitations under illinois law.see ilcs.hoepa has a statute of limitations for money damages and a statute of limitations for rescission,f,e,and the ecoa has a statute of limitations.f.the fha also has a statute of limitations.a a.the original predatory loan was made in,but davis did not file this lawsuit until.the district court determined that continuing violation theories under illinois and federal law were not applicable.the district court therefore found that the statutes of limitations for davis various claims barred her claims except to the extent they were based on only the following events litton letter proposing a modification of davis loan dated september,wells fargo failure to inform davis prior to january,that it was the owner of her mortgage and litton march payoff demand.see davis wells fargo bank,wl,at.april.thus,the formation of the mortgage contract in september fell outside the statute of limitations for each of davis claims and was not directly actionable.davis has not offered any basis for challenging the district court statute of limitations determinations.like the district court,then,we review only whether litton september,loan modification proposal,wells fargo failure to identify itself as the holder of davis mortgage,or litton march payoff demand can support davis claims.
ii.motion to dismiss 
we turn first to davis claims that were dismissed under rule b for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.we review these claims de novo.see tamayo blagojevich,cir.when analyzing the sufficiency of a complaint,we construe it in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,accept facts as true,and draw all inferences in the plaintiff favor.see id.davis claims could withstand the defendants motion to dismiss only if she alleged enough facts to render the claims facially plausible,not just conceivable.see ashcroft iqbal,bell atlantic twombly.to withstand a rule b challenge after iqbal and twombly,the plaintiff must give enough details about the of the case to present a story that holds together,and the question the court should ask is could these things have happened,not did they happen.swanson citibank,cir emphasis in original plaintiff claim under fair housing act survived motion to dismiss by identify ing the type of discrimination that she thinks occur red,by whom,and when this is all that she needed to put in the complaint.davis claims of unconscionability,fraud,violations of hoepa,and discrimination under ecoa were based on the following events,as set forth in her second amended complaint.we accept these allegations as true for purposes of this appeal.see hemi group,llc city of new york.
dorothy davis,a widowed,elderly,homeowner,lived in a home in kankakee,illinois.in,larry turner approached davis and recommended that she allow him to make repairs to her home and garage.davis told turner that she still owed money on the house and told him the terms of her mortgage.turner offered to help her obtain a new home loan at a better rate than she was then paying.the loan that turner was pushing on davis would also pay him for the home repairs he said davis needed,and would consolidate some of davis other outstanding debt.on september,turner came to davis home with frank saenz,an agent of mortgage express,the originating lender and not a party to this case.davis did not receive a good faith estimate in connection with the mortgage express loan and did not receive a copy of the closing documents.she signed the loan documents that turner and saenz presented to her under pressure,without reading the documents and without understanding their terms.when the loan closed,davis had borrowed.settlement charges totaled a whopping.davis monthly payments under the loan terms would be,even though her monthly income amounted to only.
in,davis brought suit against mortgage express pgnf home lending corporation for breach of contract,unjust enrichment,and violations of the illinois consumer fraud and deceptive businesses practices act in kankakee county,illinois.her case was presented to a jury on february,apparently in the absence of the named defendant.the jury rendered a verdict in favor of davis,finding that mortgage express had breached the mortgage loan contracts and had been wrongfully enriched.the court also found for davis on her fraud claim,and the court entered a verdict of against mortgage express.mortgage express went out of business in april,and davis was unable to collect the judgment from mortgage express.
in the meantime,however,davis loan had changed hands mortgage express assigned it to the provident bank on september.on june,the provident bank filed a foreclosure action against davis.davis answered and raised as an affirmative defense that mortgage express had violated the illinois consumer fraud and deceptive business practices act.at some point,the provident bank assigned davis loan to wells fargo,and wells fargo was substituted as the plaintiff in the foreclosure action against davis 
besides pursuing foreclosure,the defendants made other attempts to collect on davis mortgage loan.on september,while both the foreclosure and fraud lawsuits were still pending,davis received a proposed loan modification agreement from litton.the proposal was said to be based on the mortgage contract between davis and wells fargo in its capacity as trustee,under the pooling and servicing agreement dated september,home equity loan asset backed certificates,series.after davis won her case against mortgage express,her counsel contacted wells fargo attorney by phone and by mail to inform him of the verdict against mortgage express.the defendants continued their attempts to collect on the mortgage loan after the jury found the original loan was fraudulent.about five weeks after the verdict against mortgage express,litton sent a loan payoff statement to davis demanding payment of.the payoff statement was based,in part,on the closing costs and settlement fees that had been found to be fraudulent in the february trial.then,on april,wells fargo appeared in court to pursue the foreclosure action that was still pending against davis in kankakee county,seeking damages in that case,again based in part on the fraudulent closing costs and settlement fees built into davis original mortgage contract with mortgage express.
although not contained in davis federal complaint,the record shows that on february,after a trial,the kankakee county court dismissed wells fargo foreclosure action against davis,finding that it had failed to prove its claim.this ruling was based in large part on the fact that the settlement charges wrapped in the loan had been found to be fraudulent in davis action against mortgage express.
unconscionability 
davis alleged that wells fargo and litton actions were unconscionable under illinois common law.specifically,she contended that the contractual loan,lease and written agreements davis signed were transactions that no fair and honest lender would make and no reasonable borrower would accept,and that she signed the loan documents without being able to read or to understand them,and no one read or explained the contents of the papers to her before she signed them.the contracts were,oppressive,unfair and unconscionable.compl.because a claim of unconscionability under illinois law requires a showing that either the formation of the contract or a contractual term was improper,and none of davis allegations falling within the limitations period related to the formation of a contract,the district court dismissed davis unconscionability claim.
under illinois law,a contract may be found to be unconscionable as a matter of law on either a procedural or substantive basis,or both.razor hyundai motor america.procedural unconscionability refers to a situation in which a term is so difficult to find,read,or understand that the party could not fairly be said to have been aware she was agreeing to it.procedural unconscionability also takes into account the party relative lack of bargaining power.razor,at,citing frank maintenance engineering,roberts.substantive unconscionability,on the other hand,refers to contractual terms which are inordinately in one party favor.razor,at,citing rosen scil,llc.
davis has not shown that the district court erred when it barred consideration of the formation of her mortgage contract in september on statute of limitations grounds.in this federal lawsuit,davis was not using the doctrine of unconscionability in its most familiar way,as an affirmative defense to bar enforcement of a contract or a particular term of a contract.see,razor,at holding that exclusion of consequential damages in limited warranty was not enforceable because it was unconscionable.davis instead sought damages from the successors in interest to the original lender.we do not address here whether unconscionability gives rise to a standalone claim for damages under illinois law,as davis asserts here.we do not address that issue because even if such a claim is cognizable in illinois,it is clear that such a claim would be barred by the statute of limitations.
to avoid the statute of limitations bar,davis contends that her claim of unconscionability should be extended to the defendants later attempts to enforce the mortgage contract and should not be limited to the contract formation.in particular,davis relies on specific language in razor,in which the illinois supreme court stated that it was appropriate,in determining whether a contract or a contractual term was unconscionable,to take into account later events and to look beyond the facts and circumstances in existence at the time the contract was created.see razor,at the unconscionability determination is not restricted to the facts and circumstances in existence at the time the contract was entered into indeed,ilcs itself expressly provides that matters which become known only subsequent to the drafting of the,the type of injuries suffered as a result of relevant to the unconscionability calculus.internal citations omitted.but that provision which applies to sales of goods addresses only the facts and evidence that may come to bear on the underlying question of whether a contract or a particular contractual term was unconscionable under illinois law.it does not change the underlying question itself.
that question remains whether a contract as a whole or a specific contractual provision is unconscionable.in davis case,answering that question hinges on the formation of her mortgage contract with mortgage express and the terms of that contract.davis signed her mortgage contract in september,outside the statute of limitations for any possible claim for damages for unconscionability.she has not alleged an actionable claim that is not barred by the statute of limitations.the district court properly dismissed davis unconscionability claim.
to prove fraud under illinois law,a plaintiff must show that the defendant made a knowingly false representation of a material fact.the plaintiff must also show that she reasonably relied on the false representation to her detriment.see enterprise recovery systems,salmeron,citing phil dressler associates,old oak brook investment.davis allegations of fraud are based on the following statements in her complaint 
d efendants have fraudulently concealed from davis or have purposely misled her about the duplicative,padded and excessive settlement fees she would be charged and the monthly payments she would be required to pay,an d now is being compelled to pay through the foreclosure proceeding,for the mortgage loan.
defendants further intentionally,knowingly and recklessly have misrepresented that they were offering davis a fair loan when the terms and conditions of the loan were set and agreed to at an artificially high rate which davis could never meet and are now demanding that she repay the loan and costs which have been found to be illegal.
davis was deceived by defendants,justifiably relied on their willful misrepresentations,and was induced to rely on them to her extreme detriment.
the district court limited its consideration of davis fraud allegation to wells fargo failure to identify itself as the owner of her mortgage until january.the court found that although that omission could constitute a false statement under illinois law,dismissal was appropriate because davis had failed to allege that she relied on that statement to her detriment.
on appeal,davis contends that the district court erred in not also considering the defendants demands that she pay her loan,demands that continued even after the defendants knew that the kankakee county court had ruled that her loan was based in part on mortgage express fraud.we agree that overlooking this allegation was incorrect.statements made to induce someone to pay a purported debt that they do not actually owe,if made with the requisite knowledge and intent,can support an allegation of fraud.see hartigan e e hauling,allegations that contractor letter sent to a metropolitan authority contained material misrepresentations as to contractor compliance with minority business enterprise contract requirements,made for purpose of inducing authority reliance in paying contract installment,supported allegation of fraud.however,we agree with the district court that davis fraud claim still fails for a different reason.even though davis alleged that the defendants attempted to induce her to pay money that they knew she did not owe,davis did not allege that she had relied on the defendants demands for payment or that she had suffered any damages as a result of those demands.to the contrary,with the help of her attorney,she fought those unjustified demands.without reliance or damages,davis does not have a viable claim for fraud.we affirm the district court dismissal of davis fraud claim.
c.the home ownership and equity protection act 
the home ownership and equity protection act requires lenders to make certain disclosures to borrowers of high cost or high rate loans.see cunningham nationscredit financial services,cir.davis alleged that the defendants violated hoepa by failing to disclose the real cost of her mortgage and the nature of the terms of her mortgage,including a description of the components and the material terms of her loan,the rate of interest,the period of the loan,the repayment schedule,any prepayment provision,her right to cancel the loan,and other terms.she also alleged that the defendants failed to give her a copy of a truth in lending act statement prior to,during,or soon after the loan closing.compl.davis loan closed in,well outside the statute of limitations for claims under hoepa.without resolving the threshold issue of whether or not davis loan would have qualified for hoepa protection if her claim had been timely,the district court dismissed her claim.we affirm.
although she closed on her loan in,davis argues tha
