the real estate settlement procedures act respa,provides,as relevant here,that n o person shall give and no person shall accept any portion,split,or percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a real estate settlement service other than for services actually performed.b.petitioners,three couples who obtained mortgage loans from respondent,filed separate actions,alleging that respondent had violated b by charging them fees for which no services were provided in return.after the cases were removed to federal court and consolidated,respondent sought summary judgment,arguing that petitioners claims were not cognizable under b because the allegedly unearned fees were not split with another party.the district court agreed and because petitioners had not alleged any splitting of fees,it granted respondent summary judgment.the fifth circuit affirmed.
held in order to establish a violation of b,a plaintiff must demonstrate that a charge for settlement services was divided between two or more persons.
a section b unambiguously covers only a provider splitting of a fee with one or more other persons it can not be understood to reach a single provider retention of an unearned fee.
section b clearly describes two distinct exchanges.first,a charge is made to or received from a consumer by a provider.that provider then give s,and another person accept s,a portion,split,or percentage of the charge.congress use of different sets of verbs,with distinct tenses,to distinguish between the transaction and the one would be pointless if,as petitioners contend,the two transactions could be collapsed into one.their reading that a provider can make a charge and then accept the portion of the charge consisting of percent does not avoid collapsing the sequential relationship of the two stages and would destroy the tandem character of activities that the text envisions at stage two,a giving and accepting.and if the consumer were the person who give s a portion,split,or percentage of the charge to the provider who accepts it,consumers would become lawbreakers themselves.
the normal usage of the terms portion,split,and percentage which,when referring to a portion or percentage of a whole,usually mean less than percent reinforces the conclusion that b does not apply where a provider retains the entirety of a fee received from a consumer.the meaning is also confirmed by the commonsense canon of noscitur a sociis,which counsels that a word is given more precise content by the neighboring words with which it is associated.united states williams.this connation is not undermined by the canon against surplusage.portion,split,and percentage may all mean the same thing,but the canon merely favors that interpretation which avoids surplusage,see microsoft.partnership,and petitioners interpretation no more achieves that end than the court does.
b petitioners arguments in favor of their contrary interpretation are unpersuasive.section b,as interpreted here,is not rendered surplusage by a express prohibition of kickbacks,for each subsection reaches conduct that the other does not.respa general purpose to protect consumers from certain abusive practices,a also provides no warrant for expanding b prohibition beyond the field to which it is unambiguously limited the splitting of fees paid for settlement services.and giving b its natural meaning would not lead to absurd results.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
justice scalia delivered the opinion of the court.
a provision of the real estate settlement procedures act respa,codified at b,prohibits giving and accepting any portion,split,or percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a real estate settlement service other than for services actually performed.we consider whether,to establish a of b a plaintiff must demonstrate that a charge was divided between two or more persons.
enacted in,respa regulates the market for real estate settlement services,a term defined by statute to include any service provided in connection with a real estate settlement,such as title searches,title insurance,services rendered by an attorney,the preparation of documents,property surveys,the rendering of credit reports or appraisals,services rendered by a real estate agent or broker,the origination of a federally mortgage loan,and the handling of the processing,and closing or settlement.among respa provisions is,which directly furthers congress stated goal of eliminat ing kickbacks or referral fees that tend to increase the costs of certain settlement services,b.section a provides 
no person shall give and no person shall accept any fee,kickback,or thing of value pursuant to any agreement or understanding,oral or otherwise,that business incident to or a part of a real estate settlement service involving a federally related mortgage loan shall be referred to any person.
the neighboring provision,subsection b,adds the following 
no person shall give and no person shall accept any portion,split,or percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a real estate settlement service in connection with a transaction involving a federally related mortgage loan other than for services actually performed.
these substantive provisions are enforceable through,alia,actions for damages brought by consumers of settlement services against a ny person or persons who violate the prohibitions or limitations of,with recovery set at an amount equal to three times the charge paid by the plaintiff for the settlement service at issue.d.
petitioners in this case are three married couples who obtained mortgage loans from respondent quicken loans.in,they filed separate actions in louisiana state court,alleging,as pertinent here,that respondent had violated b by charging them fees for which no services were provided.in particular,the freemans and the bennetts allege that they were charged loan discount fees of and,respectively,but that respondent did not give them lower interest rates in return.the smiths allegations focus on a loan processing fee and a loan origination fee of more than 
respondent removed petitioners lawsuits to federal court,where the cases were consolidated.respondent thereafter moved for summary judgment on the ground that petitioners claims are not cognizable under b because the allegedly unearned fees were not split with another party.the district court agreed and because petitioners did not allege any splitting of fees it granted summary judgment in favor of respondent.
a divided panel of the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit affirmed.we granted certiorari.
the question in this case pertains to the scope of b,which as we have said provides that n o person shall give and no person shall accept any portion,split,or percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a real estate settlement service other than for services actually performed.the dispute between the parties boils down to whether this provision prohibits the collection of an unearned charge by a single provider what we might call an undivided unearned fee or whether it covers only transactions in which a provider shares a part of a charge with one or more other persons who did nothing to earn that part.
petitioners argument that the former interpretation should prevail finds support in a policy statement issued by the department of housing and urban development hud,the agency that was until recently authorized by congress to prescribe such rules and regulations and to make such interpretations as may be necessary to achieve the purposes of respa,a that policy statement says that b prohibit s any person from giving or accepting any unearned fees,charges or payments for real estate settlement services other than for goods or facilities provided or services performed.fed.reg.it specifically interprets b as not being limited to situations where at least two persons split or share an unearned fee.ibid.more broadly,the policy statement construes b as authority for regulation of the charges paid by consumers for the provision of settlements.it says that a settlement service provider may not the cost of another provider services without providing additional settlement services such payment must be for services that are actual,necessary and distinct.at.moreover,in addition to facing liability when it collects a fee that is entirely unearned,a provider may also be liable under b when it charges a fee that exceeds the value of goods,facilities,or services provided,on the theory that the excess over reasonable value constitutes a portion of the charge other than for services actually performed,b.
the last mentioned point,however,is manifestly with the statute hud purported to construe.when congress enacted respa in,it included a directive that hud make a report to congress within five years regarding the need for further legislation in the area.see a ed.among the topics required to be included in the report were recommendations on whether federal regulation of the charges for real estate settlement services in federally related mortgage transactions is necessary and desirable,and,if so,recommendations with regard to what reforms should be adopted.b.the directive for recommendations regarding the desirability of price regulation would make no sense if congress had already resolved the issue if b already carried with it authority for hud to proscribe the collection of unreasonably high fees for settlement services,to engage in price regulation.
no doubt recognizing as much,petitioners do not fully adopt hud construction of b.noting that even those courts of appeals which have found b not to be limited to situations have held that the statute does not reach unreasonably high fees,see kruse wells fargo home mortgage,santiago gmac mortgage group,friedman market street mortgage,petitioners that the statute does not cover overcharges.they nonetheless embrace hud construction of b insofar as it holds that a provider violates the statute by retaining a fee after providing no services at all in return.in short,petitioners contend that,by allegedly charging each of them an unearned fee,respondent accept ed a portion,split,or percentage of a settlement,service charge,percent of the charge other than for services actually performed.b ed.
the parties vigorously dispute whether the position set forth in hud policy statement should be accorded deference under the framework announced by this court in chevron natural resources defense council.we need not resolve that dispute or address whether,if chevron deference would otherwise apply,it is eliminated by the policy statement palpable overreach with regard to price controls.for we conclude that even the more limited position espoused by the policy statement and urged by petitioners goes beyond the meaning that the statute can bear,mci telecommunications american telephone telegraph.in our view,b unambiguously covers only a provider splitting of a fee with one or more other persons it can not be understood to reach a single provider retention of an unearned fee 
by providing that no person shall give or shall accept a portion,split,or percentage of a charge that has been made or received,other than for services actually performed,b clearly describes two distinct exchanges.first,a charge is made to or received from a consumer by a provider.that provider then give s,and another person accept s,a portion,split,or percentage of the charge.congress use of different sets of verbs,with distinct tenses,to distinguish between the transaction the charge that is made or received and the transaction the portion,split,or percentage that is give n or accept ed would be pointless if,as petitioners contend,the two transactions could be collapsed into one.
petitioners try to merge the two stages by arguing that a provider can make a charge stage one and then accept stage two the portion of the charge consisting of percent.see reply brief for petitioners.but then is not the provider also receiv ing the charge at the same time he is accept ing the portion of it and who give s the portion of the charge consisting of percent the same provider who accept s it this reading does not avoid collapsing the sequential relationship of the two stages,and it would simply destroy the tandem character of activities that the text envisions at stage two,a giving and accepting.
petitioners seek to avoid this consequence,at stage two at least,by saying that the consumer is the person who give s a portion,split,or percentage of the charge to the provider who accept s it.see brief for petitioners reply brief for petitioners.but since under this statute it is so to speak as accursed to give as to receive,this would make lawbreakers of consumers the very class for whose benefit b was enacted,see.it is no answer to say that a consumer would not face damages liability because a violator is liable only to the person or persons charged for the settlement service,d,and it would not make sense to render a consumer liable to himself.it is the logical consequence that a consumer would be liable to himself,not the specter of actual damages liability,which provides strong indication that something in petitioners interpretation is amiss.
at any rate,b is also enforceable through criminal prosecutions,d,and actions for injunctive relief brought by federal and state regulators,d.hud policy statement asserts that hud is,of course,unlikely to direct any enforcement actions against consumers for the payment of unearned fees,fed.reg,but that assurance is cold comfort.moreover,even assuming as seems realistic that the justice department would be similarly reluctant to prosecute consumers for criminal violations of b,prosecutorial discretion is not a reason for courts to give improbable breadth to criminal statutes.abuelhawa united states.
nor is the problem of consumer criminal liability solved by petitioners suggestion that an unstated mens rea requirement be read into the criminal enforcement provision,d,see,staples united states.if that would excuse only those consumers who are unaware that they are paying for unearned services,some consumers would remain criminally liable those who know that the fee is unearned but decide to pay it anyway,perhaps because the provider proposal is still the best deal.and if it would immunize all consumers,the statute criminalization of the entire giving portion of transactions would make little sense.we find it virtually unthinkable that congress would leave it to imputed mens rea to preserve from criminal liability some or all of the class respa was designed to protect and entirely unthinkable that congress would have created that strange disposition through language as obscure as that relied upon here.
the phrase portion,split,or percentage reinforces the conclusion that b does not cover a situation in which a provider retains the entirety of a fee received from a consumer.it is certainly true that portion or percentage can be used to include the entirety,or percent.see,portion g,supp.iv percentag e b b ed.same m b ii ii same.but that is not the normal meaning of portion when one speaks of giv ing or accept ing a portion of the whole,as dictionary definitions uniformly show aesop fable would be just as wryly humorous if the lion claim to the entirety of the kill he hunted in partnership with less ferocious animals had been translated into english as the lion portion instead of the lion share.as for percentage,that word can include percent or even percent when it refers to merely a ratable measure unemployment claims were up percent but,like portion,it normally means less than all when referring to a percentage of a specific whole he demanded a percentage of the profits and it is normal usage that,in the absence of contrary indication,gov
