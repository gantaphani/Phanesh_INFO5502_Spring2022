this case arises from joann yates joann refusal to sell her family home at eckert road in mansfield,ohio to qualified buyers douglas and tina lindsay based on her alleged desire to keep the property in the family.the property was acquired by joann and her husband gene yates gene during the and served as their residence until around.record on appeal volume i roa.the yateses had two children,brent yates brent and deborahyates deborah,who both grew up in the home.roa.after the parents moved out,deborah lived there for approximately seven years.roa.the house has remained vacant since deborah left.at the time of trial,the properties surrounding eckert were either owned directly by members of the yates family or by mid ohio pipeline,a business entity owned by brent.roa.
the district court summarized the of relevant events 
around may,with the house vacant,gene suggested to joann that they sell the home.joann allegedly resisted,wanting to keep it in the family.roa.ultimately,gene prevailed,and he and joann contacted defendant carol eicher eicher to list the property for sale.eicher is a licensed realtor associated with defendant sluss realty company sluss,a real estate brokerage.on august,eicher met with gene and joann yates.gene and joann son,brent yates,was also present,as was his wife,kim.gene and joann yates agreed to list the property with eicher through sluss,and signed the listing agreement.the house was put on the market,with the listing to expire on february.
towards the end of september,gene yates was diagnosed with lung cancer.roa.sometime that fall,he and joann went to florida.during that time,eicher would notify brent and kim yates when she was showing the house.
on january,gene yates passed away.joann alleges that a bout two weeks before his death,gene and joann had agreed to take the house off the market.roa.however,in the subsequent weeks before his death,gene did not take the house off the market.when he died,the house passed to his estate.at that point,gene and joann children tended to a number of joann financial affairs,including the sale of the house.roa.brent yates took over responsibility for the sale of the home 
on february,eicher called brent yates to tell him that the listing on his parents property was about to expire and asked if she should speak with joann.brent indicated that would not be necessary because he had the authority to handle the paperwork he subsequently signed a listing extension.
during april,plaintiffs douglas and tina lindsay the lindsays visited the yates property with their real estate agent.the lindsays subsequently submitted a written offer through their agent to eicher,the yates agent.eicher conveyed the offer to brent,who rejected it.however,after some negotiation,the parties arrived at a purchase price of.on may,the lindsays signed a purchase agreement,and brent signed the next day.
on may,sluss and eicher informed the lindsays that the sales contract would be terminated because joann yates could not bear to part with the property for sentimental reasons.based upon certain events that occurred between may,when brent signed,and may,when joann terminated the purchase agreement,the lindsays believe that joann reason for terminating was pretext they believe that joann yates did not want to sell them the property because they are.
the exact timing of these intervening events is highly disputed.
the lindsays evidence is inconsistent.they allege that a couple days after brent signed the purchase agreement,the lindsays visited the property to identify the property lines,which is when they first met brent yates.a couple days after brent signed the contract would be saturday,may.in deposition,douglas lindsay thought that the meeting had occurred on a saturday or sunday.roa.
the lindsays acknowledge that the contract was terminated on may,which they allege was the day after they met brent.however,prior to filing this lawsuit,the lindsays filed a complaint with the united states department of housing and urban development in which they stated that the contract was terminated days after they met brent.roa.
brent yates testimony is also inconsistent.he alleges that he met the lindsays on a thursday or a friday,which would presumably be may or.roa.he also states that he was told that the lindsays stopped by his office three or four days later,but did not meet with him at that time because he was tied up.roa.brent further states that both of these events took place before he called his mother to tell her there was a buyer.roa.however,brent also indicates that he told his mother about the purchase agreement within three to five days of his signing,meaning by may.roa.when brent called his mother and told her about the purchase agreement,she allegedly said that she did not want to sell the property it had been gene who had wanted to sell,not her.roa.
the parties agree that the purchase agreement was terminated on may.

following remand,joann and brent yates,later joined by the estate of gene yates,moved for summary judgment pursuant to.they argued the lindsays could not possibly establish a prima facie case of discrimination in housing because the lindsays did not offer any evidence that eckert remained on the market after the purchase agreement was terminated.on may,the district court agreed in a memorandum opinion that a jury could not conclude the house remained available,and therefore could not return a verdict for the lindsays.lindsay iii,wl,at.the court,inter alia,granted the yates defendants motion for summary judgment and dismissed all federal discrimination claims against them with prejudice.id.it further dismissed the lindsays state law housing discrimination claim with prejudice on the ground that the same federal housing discrimination evidentiary framework applied.id the lindsays appealed the district court decision that same day.

before this court on appeal are the lindsays claims of housing discrimination filed pursuant to the fair housing act a,the civil rights act,and ohio ann.h the analysis of the lindsays federal housing discrimination claims,as well as their state claim,is governed by the same legal framework.see selden apartments dep t of hous.urb,cir mitchell toledo,cir.specifically,they turn on the evidentiary standard first developed by the supreme court for employment discrimination cases in mcdonnell douglas green,d.mencer princeton.apartments,cir on summary judgment,this scheme first requires that the plaintiff present evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that there exists a prima facie case of housing discrimination.see blair henry filters,cir mencer,at.if the plaintiff is successful,the burden shifts to the defendant to offer evidence of a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse housing decision.see mencer,at.if the defendant carries his burden,the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to identify evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the proffered reason is actually pretext for unlawful discrimination.see mencer,at.
prima facie case 
in this appeal,the lindsays challenge the district court award of summary judgment in favor of the defendants based on the court ruling that the lindsays could not demonstrate a prima facie case of housing discrimination.see generally lindsay iii,wl,at.under mcdonnell douglas,a plaintiff may establish a prima facie case of discrimination either by presenting direct evidence of intentional discrimination by the defendant or by showing the existence of circumstantial evidence which creates an inference of discrimination.talley,at.the lindsays have not offered any direct evidence of intentional discrimination,thus we focus only on the requirements for establishing a prima facie case through circumstantial evidence.
mcdonnell douglas held that a prima facie case of racial discrimination in employment was established when the plaintiff shows that 
i he belongs to a racial minority ii he applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants iii despite his qualifications,he was rejected and iv after his rejection,the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of complainant qualifications.
at.this court has employed a slightly different formulation in the context of housing discrimination.see mencer,at noting c ourts have adapted the mcdonnell douglas test to fair housing claims by requiring the plaintiff to first establish a prima facie case of discrimination.specifically,we have held that a prima facie case arises when the plaintiff is a member of a racial minority he or she applied for and was qualified to purchase certain property or housing he or she was rejected and the housing remained available thereafter.id.at.the yateses concede that the lindsays can prove the first three elements of this test.however,the yateses argue the district court correctly found the lindsays were not able meet the fourth element of mencer remained available in establishing a prima facie case.see lindsay iii,wl,at.the lindsays counter that the district court erred by requiring them to offer evidence that eckert remained available after the yateses terminated the purchase agreement.they contend that the evidence creates a genuine issue of material fact as to the prima facie case of discrimination under the mcdonnell douglas framework,as modified for housing claims,notwithstanding their inability to satisfy the remained available prong for the reasons below,we rule in favor of the plaintiffs.
the supreme court has emphasized that the prima facie standard offered in mcdonnell douglas was not inflexible and that the specific proof required of the plaintiff in that particular case was not necessarily applicable in every respect in differing factual situations.texas dep t of comm.affairs burdine,d quoting mcdonnell douglas,at.satisfaction of the mcdonnell douglas test creates an inference of discrimination only because we presume these acts,if otherwise unexplained,are more likely than not based on the consideration of impermissible factors.furnco const.waters,d.thus,the key question this court must answer is whether the plaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable jury to conclude they suffered an adverse housing action under circumstances giving rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination,not whether the prima facie elements specifically articulated in mcdonnell reinterpreted by mencer for housing be established.see blair,at,stating the mcdonnell prima facie elements did not constitute rigid requirements.we remain mindful that the burden of establishing,much less creating a genuine issue of material fact over,a prima facie case is not onerous.see burdine,at.
in shah general,this court considered a summary judgment order to deny the plaintiff employment discrimination claim stemming from his termination.cir.although ultimately affirming the district court decision,we emphasized the plaintiff need not offer evidence that his employer continued to solicit applications to prove a prima facie case of discrimination.id.at.embracing the flexibility characterizing mcdonnell douglas,we indicated that some additional evidence tend ing to establish the inference of discrimination could also satisfy the prima facie burden.id.continuing to solicit applications is simply the employment analog to the housing discrimination element that a property remain available after the plaintiffs were rejected.accordingly,a plaintiff inability to create a genuine issue of material fact over the remained available element is not necessarily fatal to a prima facie housing discrimination claim on summary judgment so long as there exists additional evidence from which a reasonable juror could find an inference of discrimination.see id.thus,we rule the district court erred in granting the yateses motion for summary judgment on the ground that there was no evidence in the record that eckert remained available.
nevertheless,a plaintiff can not carry the prima facie burden for showing housing discrimination merely by offering evidence that he was a qualified minority purchaser whose competitive offer for a property was rejected.see id.this circuit has long held that satisfaction of the first three elements of the mcdonnell douglas prima facie case without more can not give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.see id the something more or additional evidence typically consists of favorable treatment for individuals not within the plaintiff protected group.see id.declaring that an employment discrimination plaintiff supplies this indispensable comparative evidence at the prima facie stage through the last prong of the mcdonnell douglas test i n particular,by identifying those individuals who are allegedly treated differently.see also talley,at interpreting shah to hold that the fourth element of the mcdonnell douglas prima facie case is established by showing either that the plaintiff was replaced by a person outside of the protected class or that employees were treated more favorably than the plaintiff mitchell,at holding that the plaintiff did not satisfy a prima facie test because he did not show he was treated differently than individuals.
but while a discriminatory inference is usually,and perhaps most readily,generated through evidence of unfavorable treatment of the minority plaintiff individuals,mcdonnell douglas and its progeny do not require this always be the case as the yateses contend.shah,at individual disparate treatment cases generally require indirect evidence from which an inference of discriminatory motive may be drawn,namely,comparative evidence demonstrating that the treatment of the plaintiff differs from that accorded to otherwise similarly situated individuals who are not within the plaintiff protected group.emphasis added citation omitted.as this court has recognized,the prima facie inquiry was never intended to be rigid,mechanized,or ritualistic.rather,it is merely a sensible,orderly way to evaluate the evidence in light of common experience as it bears on the critical question of discrimination.irvin,cir,table quoting furnco,at.a prima facie case is established whenever the actions taken by the property owner lead one to reasonably infer,if such actions remain unexplained,that it is more likely than not that such actions were based on discriminatory criterion such as race.see furnco,at.quoting teamsters united states,d.keeping this ultimate inquiry in mind,we find that so long as additional evidence showing the first three elements of the mcdonnell douglas indicates discriminatory intent in light of common experience,the required inference of discrimination can be made in satisfaction of the prima facie case.this holds true even if the plaintiff is not necessarily able to identify individuals outside of the relevant protected group who were treated more favorably.
the additional evidence which can be relied upon to establish a prima facie claim depends on the attendant facts and circumstances.see blair,at citing cases that merely offered various ways by which plaintiffs may establish a prima facie case,and did not establish rigid requirements that all plaintiffs with similar claims must meet regardless of context citing mcdonnell douglas,at.in this case,the suspicious timing of the termination of the purchasing agreement provides the evidentiary basis for inferring the yateses acted with discriminatory motives.
the significance of timing is most apparent in our decisions pertaining to the causal connection element for title vii retaliation claims,which similarly employ a mcdonnell douglas scheme.see mickey zeidler tool die,cir.to establish a prima facie case of unlawful retaliation,the plaintiff must demonstrate,inter alia,a causal connection between the protected activity like filing a complaint for unlawful discrimination and the employer materially adverse action such as termination id.causation is found where the plaintiff proffer s evidence sufficient to raise the inference that the protected activity was the likely reason for the adverse action.michael caterpillar fin.servs,cir quoting dixon gonzales,cir.
causation can be proven indirectly through circumstantial evidence such as suspicious timing.see mickey,at.specifically,this court has found that temporal proximity between an assertion of title vii rights and a materially adverse action,is sufficient to establish the causal connection element of a retaliation claim w here an adverse employment action occurs very close in time after an employer learns of a protected activity.id.at see also dicarlo potter,cir i n certain distinct cases where temporal proximity between the protected activity and the adverse employment action is acutely near in time,close proximity is deemed indirect evidence such as to permit an inference of retaliation to arise.where the nexus is not very close,we have declined to find a causal connection based on timing alone.see mickey,at michael,at.
this title vii retaliation analysis bears close resemblance to the prima facie inquiry required for racial discrimination claims analyzed under mcdonnell douglas.in both instances,the court is seeking to determine whether the circumstances create an inference that the defendant acted with impermissible motives.see muhammad close,cir noting that proximity may be significant enough to constitute indirect evidence of a causal connection so as to create an inference of retaliatory motive christian stores,cir stating the the very point of the prima facie case requirement for a racial discrimination claim evaluated under mcdonnell douglas framework is to provide a basis for inferring the existence of a discriminatory motive.just as a reasonable juror may infer a plaintiff undertaking of a protected activity was the likely reason for the defendant adverse action when the temporal proximity is very close in retaliation cases,see mickey,at,so too could the juror infer discriminatory motives when the defendant refuses to consummate a purchase agreement for real property soon after discovering the racial identity of the prospective buyers 
in this case,brent accepted in writing the lindsays purchase offer for eckert on may.roa.the yateses cancelled the purchase agreement on may,two days after the lindsays allege that brent met douglas lindsay and discovered the prospective buyers were.roa,prior to this meeting,the yateses had not given any indication that they intended to back out of the deal.rather,brent had agreed to modifications in the agreement on may.roa.the lapse alleged by the plaintiffs falls well within the range that constitutes very close temporal proximity.see mickey,at finding temporal proximity alone to be sufficient when the defendant fired the plaintiff on the same day in which it learned that the plaintiff had filed an eeoc complaint dicarlo,at day lapse between protected activity and adverse employer action fell within close temporal proximity singfield akron metro.hous,cir finding that temporal proximity of three months was significant enough to constitute sufficient evidence of a causal connection in satisfaction of a prima facie case.thus,we find that the very close temporal proximity between brent and douglas lindsay meeting and the cancellation of the purchase agreement creates an inference of unlawful discrimination for the purposes of summary judgment in other words,it would permit a reasonable juror to find it more likely than not that racial animus motivated the yateses decision.
the yateses contend that the termination of the purchase agreement on may,occurred several days after douglas and brent met,not just two days later as alleged by the lindsays.as a result,they essentially argue the nexus of events is not as close as the lindsays claim and is,therefore,inadequate to create an inference of discrimination.but even if the relevant time lapse was ten days,it would still fall within the very close temporal range,which a reasonable juror could consider suspicious.see dicarlo,at day lapse between protected activity and adverse employer action was grounds for inferring an improper motive in title vii retaliation context.moreover,whether the alleged time line proffered by the yateses is actually correct is not relevant at this stage of the proceedings.on summary judgment,we must accept the party evidence as true.see muhammad,at.the yateses proposed is simply beyond our purview in the instant appeal.
for these reasons,we conclude the lindsays carried their prima facie burden on summary judgment and could establish an inference of discrimination based on the evidence.in doing so,we emphasize that this court takes no position o
