charles levy and his defunct company,refund research associates,rra to whom we refer collectively as levy unless the context requires otherwise,have been locked in battle with the defendants,several cook county officials and cook county itself,for some time.the basis for levy complaints is the defendants handling of levy efforts,as rra agent,to obtain real estate tax refunds for cook county residents.the defendants contend that most of levy claims are barred by among other things the tax injunction act the act.the district court agreed with their position,and so do we.
the tax injunction act is a somewhat unusual statute,in that it does not confer jurisdiction on the district courts,but instead it deprives them of jurisdiction they would otherwise have to hear certain challenges to state taxes.see,california grace brethren church,d.the standard of review that we apply to the district court decision here that the act precludes the plaintiffs claims,however,is the same as we would use for any jurisdictional challenge.our review of the legal conclusion that these claims fall within the scope of the act prohibition is de novo.insofar as the district court found facts to support its determination,as is sometimes necessary for jurisdictional decisions,see arbaugh y h,d,we review those findings of fact for clear error.united phosphorus,angus chem,cir en banc.we recite the facts here in the light of these standards.
levy was the president and sole shareholder of rra,an illinois corporation that has since been dissolved.rra was engaged in the business of assisting taxpayers in obtaining real estate tax refunds.rra would examine tax records to determine which taxpayers were entitled to real estate tax refunds,but had not yet received their money.levy would contact these taxpayers in an effort to convince them to enter into an agreement with rra whereby rra would agree to file for a refund on behalf of the taxpayer,and the taxpayer would agree to pay rra of the money recovered.
in february,levy filed a lawsuit in illinois state court against maria pappas in her official capacity as treasurer of cook county,alleging a conspiracy through which cook county retained millions of dollars in tax overpayments instead of refunding the amounts to taxpayers or turning over the money to the state of illinois.after he filed that suit,he alleges,pappas and other cook county officials began to retaliate against him personally and against rra.specifically,levy asserts that the cook county officials placed obstacles in rra path to make it difficult for rra to collect tax refunds for its clients,and that they caused a criminal investigation to be instigated against levy.
before the state court lawsuit was filed,rra typically received requested refund checks approximately days after it filed a refund application.after the lawsuit began,this period ballooned up to approximately days.levy also began having problems getting refund checks delivered directly to rra.on one occasion in may,when levy arrived to collect a set of refund checks,a clerk told levy that the checks could not be released because the office had lost the forms that authorized the treasurer office to release the checks to him instead of to the taxpayers themselves.levy did not have copies of the authorization forms,and the treasurer office refused to release the checks to him based on copies of the contracts between the clients and rra.it appears that the treasurer office still has some of these checks,but it is not clear what happened to the rest.
on or about may,peter karaholios,then counsel for the treasurer,told levy that rra did not have the right to conduct its business and that liens filed by rra were invalid.after this point,refund checks were no longer delivered to rra.by august,cook county assessor james houlihan arranged that checks issued to rra clients would be mailed directly to the client,rather than to rra.
employees of the treasurer office made it difficult for levy to get information.in april,james crawley then assistant general counsel and later counsel for treasurer pappas informed levy that incomplete applications for refunds would not be accepted and that the treasurer office did not have the personnel to find the correct cr number for levy applications.because levy was being forced to provide complete applications,levy submitted a request to inspect the cr book,which contains records of all certificates of error that have been authorized by the county assessor.the treasurer office responded that levy needed to specify a tax year and to pay a copying charge levy parried with a request to view the files in person.the treasurer office did nothing.some time around august,levy was unable to review microfiche records at the treasurer office.employees at the treasurer office informed levy that in order to obtain a client microfiche records,he would need a notarized power of attorney from his client.he had never before been required to produce such a form.
in august and september,levy had difficulty reviewing other records at the treasurer office.the treasurer office maintains and keeps cr books and jr books which contain information about whether the authorized refunds have actually been paid.levy wanted access to these books both in order to conduct rra business and to obtain evidence for his state court case.when he asked to inspect the cr and jr books,however,he was told he could not.levy wrote a letter to martha mills,chief counsel for the treasurer,who responded that levy would be given access to the books.but as of the time when he filed his federal action,levy had not been given access to the books.levy alleges that mills and the other employees who failed to provide levy with access to the books acted at pappas direction.another foia request related to levy state court suit was stymied,because,levy believes,pappas and her employees in the treasurer office knew that levy was behind it.also,telephone calls by levy and rra clients went unreturned while the treasurer office returned phone calls placed by not represented by rra.
as if these bureaucratic obstacles were not enough,the county defendants also allegedly retaliated against levy with threats of criminal action.around the same month when levy filed his state court case,karaholios told levy that he karaholios had been a prosecutor and that he was going to put levy out of business.levy interpreted the comment as a threat to institute criminal charges.in october,levy was at the treasurer office.in the presence of pappas,crawley,and deputy treasurer william korukulis,karaholios told levy that levy was committing fraud by submitting refund applications using refund research fein number instead of the taxpayer social security number.karaholios added that pappas planned to submit the applications to the state attorney and file a complaint.pappas picked up the refund applications levy had with him,waved them at levy and said,this is fraud.i going to take this to the state attorney.
in april,amy huang a supervisor with the financial crimes investigations unit of the state attorney office sent letters to more than clients of rra.the letters stated in part 
our office is currently conducting a criminal grand jury investigation pertaining to a complaint received from the cook county treasurer office.according to records provided by the cook county treasurer office,you filed a certificate of error refund application,and designated refund research associates,as to complete the refund application process.in order for this office to complete its investigation into said matter,please review the attached application and contact us if the information is incorrect.our office would like to talk with you regarding the refund you have filed through refund research associates.
at least once,a representative of the state attorney office went to the home of an rra client to ask the client to verify his signature the client did so.in may,an rra client telephoned the treasurer office and spoke to an employee,ilene psarras.when the client asked about the status of her refund,psarras told the client that checks payable to rra were not being released because rra was being investigated for cheating clients out of their money.the state attorney never charged rra or levy with unlawful conduct.
in,levy and rra filed the present action in federal court.the amended complaint named cook county and the following officials as defendants maria pappas,the treasurer of cook county william korukulis,the deputy treasurer of cook county martha mills,the chief counsel for the treasurer of cook county james crawley,counsel for the treasurer of cook county peter karaholios,prior counsel for the treasurer of cook county james houlihan,assessor of cook county and richard devine,the state attorney for cook county.all of the individual defendants were sued in both their official and individual capacities.invoking,the complaint charges violations of plaintiffs first amendment rights,infringements of plaintiffs due process and equal protection rights,three rico claims,a conspiracy claim,a tortious interference claim,and a conversion claim.the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss both the original and the amended complaints.
the district court concluded that most of the plaintiffs claims were barred by the act and comity interests.the act reads as follows 
the district courts shall not enjoin,suspend or restrain the assessment,levy or collection of any tax under state law where a plain,speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such state.
as the supreme court held in grace brethren,supra,it deprives the district court of jurisdiction to hear certain types of actions in federal courts.at.see also hibbs winn,d.the court took the opportunity in hibbs to clarify the extent of this restriction.in that case,the plaintiffs challenged an income tax credit that provided financial aid to children attending private schools.at.in finding federal jurisdiction over the matter,the court held that for a near half century,courts in the federal system,including the supreme court have entertained challenges to tax credits authorized by state law,without conceiving of the act as a jurisdictional barrier.id.at.the court contrasted those cases with those typically barred by the act,describing the latter as cases in which a ll involved plaintiffs mounted federal litigation to avoid paying state taxes or to gain a refund of such taxes.relief would have operated to reduce the flow of state tax revenue.id.at.hibbs,therefore,leaves the doors of the federal court open to a narrow category of state tax challenges 
nothing in hibbs suggested that the court was overruling its decision in fair assessment in real estate ass mcnary,d,an earlier opinion that discussed the related limits that comity doctrines impose on the adjudication of certain claims in federal court.id.at.basing decision on comity and declining to reach the question of whether the act would also bar the suit.hibbs cited fair assessment in a list of cases that fell within undisputed compass despite the fact that fair assessment itself was based on comity.at.in fair assessment,the plaintiffs brought a claim seeking damages based on equal protection and due process violations for unequal taxation of real property.at.the court commented that the act 
has thus far barred federal courts from granting injunctive and declaratory relief in state tax cases but b ecause we decide today that the principle of comity bars federal courts from granting damages relief in such cases,we do not decide whether th e tax injunction act,standing alone,would require such a result.
id.at.the hibbs court noted without any hint of disapproval that the fair assessment opinion relied upon principles of comity to preclude original jurisdiction only when plaintiffs have sought aid in order to arrest or countermand state tax collection.at.
other circuits have understood hibbs to be consistent with fair assessment.in may trucking.dep t of,cir,the ninth circuit held that the dispositive question in determining whether the act jurisdictional bar applies is whether federal court relief would have operated to reduce the flow of state tax revenue.id.at quoting the hibbs passage discussed above.this standard also applies in the second and tenth circuit cases,which levy cites,but which are not particularly helpful to him.see luessenhop clinton county,cir ex rel.tax comm int l registration plan,cir.in luessenhop,the second circuit dealt with whether a taxpayer challenge that the notice of foreclosure provided by the taxing authority of a state is constitutionally inadequate it was not concerned with whether the tax assessed or the process of taxation was problematic.at.in oklahoma tax commission,the tenth circuit dealt with what was essentially a contract dispute involving the governmental recipients of revenue,some of which was tax revenue.again,this was not a dispute about the tax or the taxation process.at.
as for comity,hibbs commented that prior cases in this area are not fairly cut loose from their secure,moorings.id.at.the court then quoted rosewell la salle bank,d,which held that we may readily appreciate the difficulties encountered by the county should a substantial portion of its rightful tax revenue be tied up in injunction actions.hibbs,at.thus,hibbs does not reject the use of comity to bar federal district court jurisdiction in broad strokes,but it does restrict comity to cases that could tie up rightful tax revenue.applying this standard,hibbs found that comity was not a reason to refrain from acting,because relief would have increased the state tax revenues and would not have tied up any state tax revenues as in fair assessment.
in the end,it is not how levy has described his complaint,but what relief he ultimately seeks,that matters.we must determine whether his claims are more like those in hibbs or those in fair assessment.if the relief sought would operate to reduce the flow of state tax revenue or would tie up rightful tax revenue,then the act bars federal jurisdiction over the claims.all of levy claims stem from one of two sources,either the defendants treatment of rra in the real estate tax refund process or the defendants treatment of levy and rra allegedly in retaliation for the state court action.in substance,most of the alleged retaliatory treatment is nothing but an allegation of unfairness in aspects of cook county tax refund process.the only part of the complaint that does not fit that description is the claim of a retaliatory criminal investigation against levy,which we discuss in a moment.
the rest of the claims are,as the district court concluded,essentially a complaint about the loss of tax refunds and about delayed refunds and defendants ultimate refusal to issue taxpayer refund checks.the complaint repeatedly alleges lost profits as the primary injury suffered.levy business was obtaining tax refunds on behalf of rra clients.to the extent that this business was harmed by the failure to receive refunds,the relief sought would operate to reduce the flow of state tax revenue.to the extent the plaintiffs business was harmed by delaying refunds or even sending checks directly to taxpayers,the relief sought for this would tie up rightful tax revenue by freezing some money in the county tax coffers and arrest ing state tax collection,putting the county system of administering refunds at the mercy of the federal courts.the relief levy is seeking goes to the heart of the county ability to control its tax revenue by managing its real estate tax refunds.it would have a negative impact on the county ability to rely on its own tax revenue.this is exactly what the court was worried about in fair assessment.
when a plaintiff alleges that the state tax collection or refund process is singling her out for unjust treatment,then the act and comity bar the federal action,as in fair assessment.when a plaintiff alleges that the state tax collection or refund process is giving unfair benefits to someone else,then according to hibbs the act and comity are not in play.this case falls on the fair assessment side of the line.the district court correctly held that the act and comity bar its jurisdiction over the plaintiffs claims in counts i through v,with one exception the cr
