defendants appellants,charles livecchi and his real estate company management,collectively,livecchi appeal from an amended judgment entered april,in the united states district court for the western district of new york payson,following partial summary judgment in favor of the government claim,united states livecchi,cv,wl,at,livecchi i,and a subsequent bench trial rejecting livecchi counterclaim for recoupment and granting the government application for double damages and prejudgment interest,united states livecchi,d,livecchi ii.
on appeal,livecchi argues that the government lacked standing to sue under a because hud had foreclosed on livecchi mortgage and the action was barred by the statute of limitations provision,d,because the limitations period started to run when livecchi defaulted on the mortgage,in,and not,as the district court held,when the government discovered livecchi equity skimming in.
livecchi interpretation of the statute is inconsistent with the statute clear purpose.the government authority to foreclose on a mortgage can not preclude the government from subsequently recovering assets or rental income retained in violation of a related regulatory agreement.as for the limitations period,livecchi failed to establish that hud had any knowledge of his equity skimming prior to august,the date hud first acquired livecchi financial records.we therefore affirm the amended judgment in all respects.

citing his ongoing disputes with hud regarding the financial reporting obligations and the release of money from the rfr,livecchi informed hud by letter dated january,that he intended to stop paying into the rfr and hold those payments in escrow.id.at.on march,hud responded with its own letter,stating that livecchi november rfr disbursement request had been denied because of his numerous violations of the regulatory agreement,including his failure to submit audited financial statements for,his failure to maintain the property in a satisfactory condition,and his failure to submit an adequate capital needs budget.id.hud further cautioned livecchi that his failure to correct these violations could result in hud declaring a default under the regulatory agreement and resorting to any and all rights set forth in the agreement id.despite hud warning,however,livecchi continued his,deducting the monthly rfr payment of from his february and march mortgage payments to continental.id.
