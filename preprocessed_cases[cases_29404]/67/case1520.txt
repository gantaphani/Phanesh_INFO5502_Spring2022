in this appeal,the kawaiisu,a recognized native american group indigenous to the tehachapi mountains and the southern sierra nevada the tribe or the kawaiisu,and its elected chairperson,david laughing horse robinson,appeal the dismissal of their claims asserting title to the tejon ranch,one of the largest continuous expanses of private land in california.we review de novo a district court order granting a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,manzarek paul fire marine,cir,and we affirm the judgment of the district court.
as with most land disputes of this type,historical perspective is important in resolving the claims.during first the spanish and then the mexican occupations of what is now california,those governments encouraged settlement by issuing large land grants in the territory.at the conclusion of the mexican american war in,the united states acquired california from mexico through the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo.the treaty promised to honor spanish and mexican land grants.treaty of peace,friendship,limits,and settlement between the united states of america and the mexican republic art.viii ix,stat.treaty of guadalupe hidalgo.
the discovery of gold in california just eight days prior to the signing of the treaty,and the subsequent,unprecedented influx of settlers to the territory,placed a great deal of pressure on land claims.to resolve disputes over the validity of private title to land,congress passed the act of march,ch,stat.act of,commonly known as the california land claims act of.the act created a board of commissioners commission to evaluate claims and required that anyone claiming title derived from a mexican or spanish grant present a claim to the commission within two years.id.any land not claimed within that period,or for which a claim was rejected,would be returned to the public domain of the united states.id.
no indian groups,including the predecessors to the kawaiisu,registered claims with the commission during the period.in addition,the united states senate refused to ratify any of the eighteen treaties negotiated with california tribes between and,a decision that was sealed until.william sturtevant,handbook of north american indians california.
following the cessation of hostilities with mexico and the signing of the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo,the united states entered into and ratified a treaty with an array of western native american leaders collectively referred to as the utah.the treaty with the utah,signed in in santa fe,new mexico,provided for an end to hostilities between the utah tribes and the united states and stipulated that the utahs accept and submit to the jurisdiction of the united states.further,it stated 
the united states shall,at its earliest convenience,designate,settle,and adjust their territorial boundaries a nd the said utahs,further,bind themselves not to depart from their accustomed homes or localities unless specially permitted and so soon as their boundaries are distinctly defined,the said utahs are further bound to confine themselves to said limits,under pueblos,or to settle in such other manner as will enable them most successfully to cultivate the soil,and pursue such other industrial pursuits as will best promote their happiness and prosperity and they now deliberately and considerately,pledge their existence as a distinct tribe,to abstain,for all time to come,from all depredations to cease the roving and rambling habits which have hitherto marked them as a people to confine themselves strictly to the limits which may be assigned them and to support themselves by their own industry,aided and directed as it may be by the wisdom,justice,and humanity of the american people.
treaty with the utah,art.vii,stat.the kawaiisu allege that several of its leaders,including its head chief at the time,acaguate nochi,were among the signatories to the treaty.
the kawaiisu identify themselves as an indian tribe that has resided in and around kern county,california since time immemorial.plaintiff robinson traces his lineage through multiple previous head chiefs of the kawaiisu back to acaguate nochi.the kawaiisu are not currently,and have never been,included on the official list of federally recognized tribes maintained by the bureau of indian affairs at the department of the interior.
according to the tribe complaint,the kawaiisu first appeared in the historical record in the diary of father francisco garces.father garces map of the following year notes the tribe presence according to a number of its historic names.while the name kawaiisu derives linguistically from a tribe to the north in san joaquin valley,the tribe identifies as one of the ancient great basin shoshone paiute tribes whose territory extended from utah to the pacific ocean.the kawaiisu complaint lists an array of ethnographic accounts documenting its unique tribal identity,including the bureau of american ethnology handbook of american indians north of mexico.
in two years after the signing of the treaty with the utah and just a few months after the california land claims act of went into effect the united states executed a treaty with various tribes of indians in the state of california in which the tribes agreed to cede large portions of land and the federal government promised to set aside reservations for the sole use and occupancy of the tribes and supply the indians with goods and services,including schools.this treaty,known as treaty d,was submitted to congress but never ratified by the senate 
in the absence of any ratified treaties with the indians of california,the establishment of reservations in the state could only result from an act of congress or from the president acting under delegation from congress.three acts of congress taking place in,and are relevant here.the act of authorized the president to create five military reservations no more than acres in size in the state of california or the territories of utah and new mexico.act of march,ch,stat.in,congress amended the act of to provide funding and authorization for two additional reservations.act of march,stat.
during the period prior to,the president appears to have only officially created three reservations in california.mattz arnett,d at the time of the passage of the act there were,apparently,three reservations in california the klamath river,the mendocino,and the smith river.the tribe alleges that the reservation was created pursuant to the act of,pointing to a letter from president franklin pierce to the secretary of the interior,robert mcclelland,and a subsequent letter from the secretary to the superintendent of indian affairs for california,edward beale,from that same year.
after quoting the paragraph of the act authorizing creation of five reservations,president pierce letter states,in the exercise of discretion vested in me by said act of congress,i have examined and hereby approve the plan therein proposed for the protection of the indians in california,and request that you will take the necessary steps for carrying the same into effect.secretary mcclelland letter to superintendent beale repeats the language from the act of and then states that 
the president of the united states has examined and approved the plan provided for in said act,and directs that you be charged with the duty of carrying it into effect.for this purpose you will repair to california without delay,and by the most expeditious route.the selections of the military reservations are to be made by you in conjunction with the military commandant in california,or such officer as may be detailed for that purpose,in which case they must be sanctioned by the commandant.it is likewise the president desire that,in all other matters connected with the execution of this plan,you will,as far as may be practicable,act in concert with the commanding officer of that military department.
however,no presidential proclamation or executive order was ever issued regarding the tejon or sebastian reservation.
in,congress significantly reorganized management of reservations in california.the act of consolidated california as one indian superintendency,empowered the president to create no more than four reservations,and required that lands not retained as reservations under the act be offered for public sale.act of,ch,stat.the president eventually established four reservations by executive order.the reservation was not among them.
the land at issue in the case the acres comprising tejon ranch and the of those acres referred to as the tejon or sebastian reservation is made up of portions of four different mexican land grants rancho el tejon,rancho los alamos y agua caliente,rancho castac,and rancho la liebre.the various holders of those four grants submitted claims pursuant to the act of,all of which were confirmed by the commission,which issued patents for the claims between and.the rights to all four of these grants were acquired by edward beale between and.defendants tejon mountain village,llc,tejon ranch corporation,and tejon ranchcorp collectively,tejon ranch defendants ultimately acquired title through transactions traceable to the patents.the tejon ranch defendants propose a home development named tejon mountain village on the tejon ranch.
the tribe filed this action asserting title under a variety of theories ultimately asserting four claims against the secretary of interior two against the tejon ranch defendants and one against kern county,california 
after dismissing two complaints with leave to amend,the district court dismissed the complaint with prejudice.
the tribe has waived appeal of its claims against the secretary by failing to present a specific,cogent argument for our consideration.greenwood faa,cir see also fed.a a requiring that an appellant brief must contain an argument section which includes their contentions and the reasons for them,with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.
on appeal,the tribe asserts a new theory of estoppel against the secretary and suggests that the united states violated its trust responsibility by failing to present or preserve the tribe claims before the commission.neither theory was presented to the district court.we decline to consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal.raich gonzales,cir.
the tribe claims ownership to the tejon ranch as against the tejon ranch defendants on its alleged receipt of a spanish land grant,its rights under the treaty with the utah,and its negotiation of treaty d with the federal government.however,the district court correctly concluded that the tribe failure to present a claim to the commission pursuant to the california land claims act of extinguished its title,that the treaty with the utah did not convey land rights to the signatory tribes or recognize aboriginal title,and that treaty d was never ratified and conveyed no rights.
the tribe asserts that i n,the spanish government granted the kawaiisu land in what would become the state of california.the only support for this assertion is its alleged presence on diseno maps from that year created by father francisco garces even assuming that the kawaiisu possessed such a grant,the terms of the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo alone were insufficient to preserve it.the land claims act of required that each and every person claiming lands in california by virtue of any right or title derived from the spanish or mexican government,shall present the same to the said commissioners stat.presentation to the commission was the only avenue allowed by the act for preservation of claims and the issuance of a patent.section of the act provides that all lands the claims to which shall not have been presented to the said commissioners within two years after the date of this act,shall be deemed,held and considered as part of the public domain of the united states.id.the tribe concedes that it did not present any claims to the commission within the statutory time frame.
the tribe claims land rights were bestowed by the subsequent treaty with the utah,or,alternatively,argues that its participation in treaty d constituted substantial compliance with the act of.neither argument is persuasive.
the treaty with the utah did not grant the tribe title to tejon ranch,nor did it recognize aboriginal title of any of the signatory tribes,including the kawaiisu.aboriginal title means mere possession not specifically recognized as ownership by congress.tee hit ton indians united states.absent such recognition by congress,aboriginal right of occupancy can be terminated by the sovereign at any time without any legally enforceable obligation to compensate the indians.id.recognition of aboriginal title requires a clear statement from congress unequivocally granting legal rights.see uintah ute indians of utah united states,recognition of indian title may take various forms,but such recognition must manifest a definite intention to accord legal rights.the congress must affirmatively intend to grant the right to occupy and use the land permanently.by recognition,the courts have meant that congress intended to acknowledge to indian tribes rights in land which were in addition to the indians traditional use and occupancy rights exercised only with the permission of the sovereign.sac fox tribe united states,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
the question of whether the treaty with the utah created any enforceable property rights has been addressed by the court of federal claims,which determined in that the treaty did not recognize indian title.uintah ute indians.at.as that court observed,article vii of the treaty does not recognize title because the boundaries of aboriginal lands were to be settled in the future.by its terms the treaty does not designate,settle,adjust,define,or assign limits or boundaries to plaintiff it leaves such matters to the future.consequently,the treaty can not be said to recognize indian title.
the district court correctly adopted the reasoning of uintah ute indians.by referring to limits which may be assigned the utahs that they would be bound to confine themself to,the treaty language indicates that any rights to the land the indians occupied at the time of its execution were not recognized by the united states government.treaty with the utah,art.vii.we can not assume that congress would have intended through its ratification of the treaty with the utah to grant title to the vast,expanses of land occupied by the various signatory tribes.the treaty language points to its aims of promoting peaceful relations and encouraging the indians to adopt a more geographically constrained agrarian mode of living.id 
treaty d,executed in by the kawaiisu and the united states,was never ratified by the senate and thus carries no legal effect.see const.art.ii,cl.the treaty itself contained language to that effect,stating that it would be binding on the contracting parties when ratified and confirmed by the president and senate of the united states of america.the kawaiisu argue that through its participation in treaty d,the tribe substantially complied with the act of and thus perfected title tracing to its alleged spanish land grant or the treaty with the utah.this argument also fails.the act of provides for no alternative to presenting one claims to the commission.
treaty d granted no land rights,nor did it create any other enforceable rights,as it was never ratified and is thus a legal nullity it was also insufficient for the purposes of the act of requirement that any parties claiming title to land in california under spanish or mexican grants present their claims to the commission.
subsequent case law established that the act of fully extinguished any existing aboriginal title or unregistered land grants.in,the supreme court held in barker harvey,that even perfect title was subject to the presentation requirement of the act of,as were claims by mission indians derived from mexican land grants.id.at if these indians had any claims founded on the action of the mexican government they abandoned them by not presenting them to the commission for consideration.the court further suggested that the act itself extinguished aboriginal title surely a claimant would have little reason for presenting to the land commission his cl
