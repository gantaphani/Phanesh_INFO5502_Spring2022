harding county,south dakota,is home to many valuable fossils.in june,fossil hunter mark eatman found fossilized remains of a juvenile tyrannosaurus rex dinosaur on land in harding county that was either owned by rancher gary gilbert or owned by the county and leased to gilbert for grazing.eatman sold his interest in the fossil for to a texas group led by ron frithiof,who named the fossil tinker.frithiof and gilbert then entered into a series of prospecting leases.from june until november,frithiof and his partners excavated from the site approximately field jackets soil and fossils removed together and wrapped in plaster casing,and frithiof began negotiations to sell tinker to the indianapolis children museum.his asking price was million.
becoming aware that tinker may have been found on land,frithiof and his group approached harding county for a lease.on november,frithiof and the county entered into a lease granting frithiof legal title to fossils located collected on county property in exchange for ten percent of the actual selling price of any fossils collected from county property and which are sold by frithiof for a sum exceeding one thousand dollars.at issue on this appeal was an additional clause entitled other,which provided that the lease terms would apply to fossils that lessee has located,discovered,or removed on the leased property,or any other property owned by harding county,prior to the date of this lease.
when the county later learned that frithiof found tinker two years before the lease was signed,it rescinded the lease and commenced this action against frithiof and three of his partners we will refer to defendants,collectively,as frithiof.a class of harding county taxpayers joined as plaintiffs.the district court initially granted summary judgment for the county,concluding that the lease was void because the county failed to hold a public hearing before authorizing the lease,as sdcl requires if a lease is for an amount exceeding five hundred dollars annual value.frithiof appealed.we vacated the judgment and remanded because the county failed to present evidence of the fair market value of the lease at the time it was entered,and thus the district court erred in granting the county motion for partial summary judgment.county of harding,frithiof,cir frithiof i.on remand,the district court granted summary judgment to frithiof.the county appeals,raising numerous issues.reviewing the grant of summary judgment de novo,we affirm.heppler thomson newspapers,cir standard of review.
although the county complaint asserted eight separate claims sounding in contract and tort,and all are argued on appeal,the appeal turns on the answers to three questions did frithiof have a legal duty to disclose his prior discovery of tinker before the lease was signed may the county void the lease if it committed a mistake of law that resulted in with did frithiof commit actionable trespass or conversion in removing fossils from county land before the lease was signed after describing the lease negotiations,we will address the county arguments on appeal in the context of these questions.
i.the lease negotiations 
frithiof attorney,jimmy nassour,first contacted harding county auditor kathy glines in july.the county had signed two fossil excavation leases with other prospectors in.auditor glines testified the county knew in advance that both prospective lessees had already found fossils on county land.in july,nassour proposed a written lease modeled on one of the leases,containing identical purpose,rent,and title provisions.nassour added two new provisions,proposing to the lease to and including an other clause providing that lessee shall be responsible for negotiating a lease with any other lessee which may have rights to lease the property.in tandem,these additions would have resolved the prior discovery issue while making frithiof responsible for dealing with any prior lessee during the period in other words,gilbert,with whom frithiof had already negotiated.
glines and the county attorney,robert haivala,reviewed nassour proposed lease.they rejected the proposed as not authorized by law and noted errors in the land description.nassour drafted a revised lease,making the requested changes.he also replaced the prior other clause with the provision applying the lease terms to prior discoveries.nassour mailed the revised lease to glines,with a cover letter noting the changes to the land legal description but not the revised other clause glines presented the revised lease to the county board of commissioners while haivala was out of town.the board approved it on november without notice or public hearing pursuant to.
neither party disputes that tinker was found on county land.frithiof testified that he sought a lease with the county after gilbert told him in the summer of there was county land as well as land in the area where tinker was found.frithiof claimed he did not know tinker was on county land until the area was professionally surveyed in march.the county view is more sinister,based on testimony by a frithiof marketing consultant that frithiof was just tickled how clever they were to slip the prior discovery clause in that way because the county still were going to know that it was tinker they were talking about.for summary judgment purposes,we of course credit that testimony.the county rescinded the lease in may and commenced this lawsuit.
ii.frithiof alleged duty to disclose 
the county complaint alleged that frithiof failed to disclose that he had entered county property to search for fossils and had found,excavated,removed,and attempted to sell tinker,despite having a duty to disclose such information during the lease negotiations.based on this failure to disclose,the county asserted tort and contract claims for damages and rescission of the lease based on actual and constructive fraud,mistake of fact and law,breach of fiduciary duty,and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.though the district court separately discussed each claim,central to its decision was the conclusion that,under south dakota law,failure to provide a full disclosure of facts known to one party during contract negotiations is neither fraudulent nor a breach of a fiduciary or other duty.on appeal,the county lead argument is that frithiof had a duty to disclose information material to the contract.the existence of a duty is a question of law that is appropriate for summary judgment decision.garrett bankwest.
breach of fiduciary or other duty.like the district court,we begin with the question whether frithiof breached a fiduciary duty to disclose during the lease negotiations that he had previously discovered,removed,and attempted to sell tinker fossils.under south dakota law 
fiduciary duties are not inherent in normal arm length business relationships,and arise only when one undertakes to act primarily for another benefit.the law will imply such duties only where one party to a relationship is unable to fully protect its interests and the unprotected party has placed its trust and confidence in the other.
taggart ford motor credit.fiduciary relationships juxtapose trust and dependence on one side with dominance and influence on the other.high plains genetics research,ranch.
the county argues that a fiduciary duty arose because it placed trust and confidence in frithiof.but this alone does not create a fiduciary relationship 
one party can not transform a business relationship into one which is fiduciary in nature merely by placing trust and confidence in the other party.there must be additional circumstances,or a relationship that induces the trusting party to relax the care and vigilance which he would ordinarily exercise for his own protection.
high plains,at citation omitted.no additional circumstances emerge from the parties arm length dealings in this case,such as the conflict of interest that motivated a bank to lure investors into a investment in buxcel first fidelity bank.the county as owner had control of the land,was experienced in fossil leases,and had its auditor and attorney review the proposed lease and insist on changes.
in high plains,the supreme court of south dakota reversed an award of damages for breach of fiduciary duty,noting that,although one party had superior knowledge and technical skills and provided a specialized service,the other party was not lacking in mental acuity,business intelligence or knowledge of the basic principles involved.at accord cleveland bdl.based on these controlling authorities,we agree with the district court there was no fiduciary relationship or breach of fiduciary duty 
the county further argues that,even if frithiof had no fiduciary duty to disclose,he breached an obligation to disclose facts basic to the transaction,a duty recognized in maybee jacobs motor,and e of the restatement second of torts.the district court did not discuss this contention.
restatement e requires disclosure of facts basic to the transaction only if the other party,because of the relationship between them,the customs of the trade or other objective circumstances,would reasonably expect a disclosure of those facts.in maybee,the court applied this standard and concluded,not surprisingly,that a professional car dealer had a duty to disclose that the van being sold contained a rebuilt engine.on the other hand,in schwaiger mitchell radiology,the court concluded that the duty outlined in did not compel an employer to disclose in arm length negotiations with a prospective employee the existence of a voting agreement that affected control of the corporation.in concluding there was no duty to disclose,the court quoted approvingly restatement,cmt.k,at 
superior information and better business acumen are legitimate advantages,which lead to no liability.the defendant may reasonably expect the plaintiff to make his own investigation,draw his own conclusions and protect himself and if the plaintiff is indolent,inexperienced or ignorant,or his judgment is bad,or he does not have access to adequate information,the defendant is under no obligation to make good his deficiencies.
we conclude that schwaiger is controlling.the county as lessor had prior dealings with lessees who had made prior discoveries in one case,of a valuable tyrannosaurus rex fossil.frithiof made no affirmative misrepresentation.in their arm length dealings,he could reasonably expect the county to make its own investigation and protect its interests by inquiring into prior discoveries were that truly basic to the transaction.in these circumstances,we assume that restatement e reflects south dakota law but conclude that it imposed no duty to disclose tinker prior discovery during the lease negotiations.the absence of a duty to disclose is true,in general,when it is the buyer of land who has the better information and fails to disclose it.restatement,cmt.
finally,the county argues that frithiof failure to disclose breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the district court concluded that this duty applies once a contract is executed but does not require a party full disclosure of one knowledge,plans,and intent during the negotiation of a contract.on appeal,the county cites no contrary authority.we agree with the district court.under south dakota law,this implied covenant is not a repository of limitless duties and obligations.farm credit servs.of am.dougan.it targets actions by one party that limit or completely prevent the aggrieved party from receiving the expected benefits of the bargain.nygaard sioux valley hosp.health.
constructive fraud.constructive fraud under south dakota law includes any breach of duty which,without any actually fraudulent intent,gains an advantage to the person in fault by misleading another to his prejudice.sdcl.constructive fraud will support an action to avoid a contract,but not a tort action for damages.schmidt wildcat cave.as the statute expressly requires a breach of duty,the district court dismissed this claim based on its conclusion that frithiof had no duty to disclose his prior discovery during the lease negotiations.we agree.see sejnoha city of yankton.
actual fraud.actual intentional fraud is the basis for a tort action of deceit as well as an action to avoid a fraudulently induced contract.see sdcl.fraud is almost identically defined for both purposes in sdcl and.as the county concedes frithiof made no affirmative misrepresentation,this case implicates only the third subsection the suppression of a fact by one who is bound to disclose it,or who gives information likely to mislead for want of communication of that fact.sdcl see also sdcl.the county argues that summary judgment was improper because actual fraud is a question of fact,and it presented evidence that frithiof intended to deceive the county by withholding facts material to the lease and the lease terms.however,applies to suppression of a fact by one who is bound to disclose it.no fraud action for intentional concealment will lie absent a duty to disclose.see taggart,at.
the county argues that attorney nassour cover letter enclosing the revised lease brings this fraud claim within the statute because it misleadingly failed to mention the revised other clause.we disagree.this passive was not tantamount to active suppression or misrepresentation.indeed,nassour put the county agents on notice of prior fossil activity by first proposing a lease and then,when that proposal was rejected,proposing a substitute other clause expressly applying the lease to prior discoveries.as the district court observed 
it was not the obligation of defendants to orally provide notice of a clause that was set apart from the remainder of the lease.harding county,as a party to the contract,had a duty to review the contract and familiarize itself with the obligations of the contract to permit a party to admit that he signed a contract but did not read it or know its stipulations would absolutely destroy the value of all contracts.
this is not a case like life benefit,elfring,where the insured fraudulently induced the insurance contract when she disclosed minor surgery but intentionally suppressed and concealed the truth as she knew it,that she had had a serious disorder of the breast and had had that breast removed.here,even if frithiof hoped that the prior discovery issue would slip by the county notice,he had no duty to disclose and therefore committed no fraud,actual or constructive.see weitzel sioux valley heart partners,taggart,at.
for the same reasons,the district court properly granted summary judgment dismissing the claim for rescission of the lease agreement based on the county unilateral mistake of fact.see sdcl.rescission for mistake of fact requires that the mistake not result from the want of such care and diligence as would be exercised by a person of reasonable prudence under the same circumstances.lpn trust farrar outdoor.it is undisputed that harding county made no effort to inquire into prior discoveries despite the lease unambiguous other clause.the county did not ask frithiof about any such discoveries,inspect its land,or attempt any investigation before entering into the lease.such complete inaction can not satisfy the requirement for care and diligence.if the county agents mistakenly assumed that any prior discoveries were of nominal value,that assumption was contrary to the lease plain language,which contemplated discovery of fossils worth more than,and can not provide grounds for rescission.see id.at first colony life ins.berube,cir no rescission for mistake caused by neglecting to understand the contents of the contract before he signed it applying south dakota law.
iii.the county mistake of law sdcl 
the county did not hold public hearings under before entering into either of the leases.in his motion for summary judgment,frithiof argued that the county can not have it both ways two identical lease agreements providing for the same contingent compensation,one being worth in excess of,while the other one is not.the county responded that whether the lease had a value of at least per year was a disputed fact issue that must be tried.the district court avoided that issue.adopting the suggestion in judge colloton concurring opinion in frithiof i,at,the court concluded that any failure to comply with was an exercise of the county leasing authority in an irregular manner,and the county is estopped by its own actions to rescind the lease on this ground.
on appeal,the county argues the court committed two errors of law first,if the value of the lease exceeded per year,then the county consented to the lease under a mistake of law and may now rescind,see sdcl and second,the necessary elements of estoppel are absent because the county took no affirmative action on which frithiof relied to his detriment.we reject both contentions.
section authorizes rescission of a contract if there was misapprehension of the law by all parties making substantially the same mistake as to the law,or misapprehension of the law by one party of which the others are aware at the time of contracting.the mistake must be material to the contract.home loan ass perpetual sav.loan ass n.here,the county presented no evidence that frithiof made a mistake of law regarding compliance with.indeed,there is no evidence he even knew of that statute,which simply imposed a condition precedent on the county authority to enter into the lease.thus,any mistake as to compliance was the county unilateral mistake of law and likely was no mistake of law at all given auditor glines testimony that the county was aware of the statute and concluded that the frithiof lease,like the fossil leases,was worth less than per year.thus,provides no basis to rescind the lease.
the county argues that with made the lease an impermissible enlargement of the county commission power and authority.but that purported illegality is not a ground for rescinding the lease under sdcl,and the county provides no other rescission authority.section is silent as to the consequences of failed or improper application.the county has not identified,nor have we found,any case or statute providing that a failure to comply with automatically voids the offending lease.
turning to the estoppel issue,the county does not challenge the district court conclusion,consistent with judge colloton opinion in frithiof i,that failure to hold a public hearing under amounted to an irregular exercise of the county power to lease.when a county has power to act,it may be estopped by the acts of its agents although the method of exercising the power was irregular.mellette county arnold.the county argues that it took no affirmative act that could create an estoppel.this contention is without merit.entering into the lease agreement,without more,was such an affirmative act.see even city of parker,issuing a building permit mellette county,at a consent judgment being in the nature of a contract constitutes in the absence of fraud or mistake a waiver of errors and irregularities.emphasis added.river.city of mitchell,enacting ordinance.
the county further argues that frithiof failed to meet his burden to prove detrimental reliance.this argument,too,is without merit.it is undisputed that,in reliance on the signed lease,frithiof continued excavation and negotiations to sell tinker to the indianapolis children museum,brought museum representatives to the site and assured them the lease gave him marketable title to the fossil,and later contracted with colorado dinosaur company and prehistoric journeys for preparation,mounting,and marketing of the fossil.this is more than adequate reliance to trigger an estoppel.see even,at estoppel applied when builder purchased materials in reliance on invalid permit.
viewing this issue in perspective,the county seeks to use its own alleged mistake in construing to reap the entire profit from frithiof efforts,based on failure to comply with a statutory procedure that likely would have delayed,but not prevented,signing of the lease.though estoppel should be used sparingly against public entities,we conclude the county position on this issue is manifestly unjust.we affirm the district court decision that the county is estopped to rescind the lease based on.
iv.tort issues 
trespass.the county argues that the district court erred in dismissing its claim for damages resulting from frithiof unconsented entry onto county property prior to signing of the november lease.the district court ruled that the county ratified any trespass because the other clause expressly contemplates defendants previous presence on county land.the county argues there can be no ratification absent knowledge of the material facts and intent to ratify.see drew stanton.
as we see it,ratification is not the critical issue.consent to enter land is a defense to trespass under south dakota law.benson state.auditor glines testified that lands are open to the public and that anyone can go walk through state land without it being a trespass issue.the county raised no trespass issue with two previous prospectors who requested and were granted leases after already entering county land and discovering fossils.consequently,we conclude that frithiof entry on harding county property prior to the lease signing was privileged by consent.moreover,frithiof was on the land with gilbert permission,and the county cloaked gilbert as lessee with at least apparent authority to grant frithiof permission to enter contiguous lands that gilbert both owned and leased.finally,we agree with the district court that the lease waived any claims for prior trespass.
conversion.the county complaint alleged that frithiof committed the tort of conversion when he excavated and removed tinker from county property without the county consent.the county sought compensatory and punitive damages for this serious interference with its ownership and possessory rights,later limiting this claim to fossils excavated and removed from the site prior to signing of the lease in november.the district court granted summary judgment dismissing this claim on alternative grounds i the fossils were real property an ingredient of the soil and therefore not subject to conversion,see denke mamola,and ii if the fossils were subject to an action for conversion,the lease other clause provided permission for frithiof action and thus,obviates any claim for conversion.
on appeal,frithiof concedes that any fossils removed from the ground prior to the lease became personal property subject to an action for conversion.see black hills inst.of geological research sch.of mines,cir.thus,the district court first ground does not support summary judgment dismissing the entire conversion claim.turning to the second ground,the county argues,relying again on drew,at,that it did not ratify frithiof conversion because one can not ratify an action of which they were not aware had already taken place.frithiof counters that the county consent to the prior removal of fossils is reflected in the prior discovery clause.
in november,harding county knew it was leasing land for the purpose of fossil prospecting and excavation,knew from prior discoveries in the area that fossils of more than nominal value might be found,knew county lands were open to the public and prior lessees had made discoveries before approaching the county for leases,and should have known from the plain language of the lease proposed by frithiof that he may well have made prior discoveries.with this knowledge,the county entered into a lease expressly granting frithiof title to prior fossil discoveries in exchange for ten percent of their sale price.it is a nice question,not adequately briefed by the parties,whether the county,as a matter of law,thereby waived an existing cause of action for conversion of which it may not have known but could easily have uncovered with even modest inquiry.see generally plm inv,dakota ry,cir,quoting norwest bank venners,to support the defense of waiver,there must be a showing of a clear,unequivocal and decisive act or acts showing an intention to relinquish the existing right.
we conclude we need not resolve this question because a cause of action for conversion will not lie after signing of the lease.c onversion is an intentional exercise of dominion or control over a chattel,which so seriously interferes with the right of another to control it that the actor may justly be required to pay the other the full value of the chattel.rensch riddle d
