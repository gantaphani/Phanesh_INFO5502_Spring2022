the primary claim in this criminal appeal is the familiar one that a conspiracy conviction was flawed because the facts revealed multiple conspiracies rather than the single overarching scheme that was charged.the indictment against william trainor,charging both conspiracy to commit wire fraud and multiple episodes of the substantive crime,stemmed from his role in fraudulently securing mortgages on two adjacent properties owned by his family in maine.asserting that the conduct related to each property was separate,appellant argues that the conspiracy treated the two ventures as a single have been dismissed as duplicitous.he alternatively argues prejudicial variance,contending that the evidence presented at trial showed separate schemes and thus was insufficient to prove the single charged conspiracy.he also claims that spillover in evidence between the two schemes denied him a fair trial on the wire fraud charges,requiring that those convictions also be set aside.
we find no merit in these contentions or his related evidentiary claim.the jury was properly instructed to consider whether a single conspiracy had been proven,and the record amply supports its verdict.we therefore affirm appellant conviction on all counts.
factual background 
appellant trainor and his family owned two lakeside trainor road and trainor lebanon,maine.appellant allegedly orchestrated a complex series of financial transactions involving sham deposits,altered checks,forged signatures and myriad other false representations to fraudulently elicit mortgage funds from two different financial institutions.we present the facts as the jury could have found them,reserving additional detail for our discussion of defendant claims of error.see united states byrne,cir.
the mortgage on trainor road 
in the summer of,trainor approached john desmarais,a family friend and carpenter who had done work for him about buying the house and land at trainor road,which was held in the name of trainor wife.desmarais earned only a year and had filed for bankruptcy in,but trainor offered to help him secure financing.the original purchase and sale agreement showed a sale price of and an initial deposit of.desmarais had not,in fact,given such a deposit.he previously had purchased a boat from trainor for,and trainor told desmarais he would credit the money from the boat purchase toward the property deal 
in helping desmarais obtain a mortgage from chase manhattan mortgage chase,appellant took various steps aimed at creating the false impression that desmarais had the resources to buy the property.for example,at trainor suggestion,desmarais borrowed from an acquaintance,don walden,which desmarais used in part to purchase stock in a company associated with trainor desmarais understood that,like the boat purchase,the money for the stock would be considered a deposit on the property.walden money also was used to fund a personal check written to trainor wife,geraldine,as a deposit.desmarais subsequently told a chase loan officer,david barney,that he planned to finance the property purchase by selling stock worth.desmarais testified that the stock value was set by trainor,and he admitted at trial that he did not own stock of that value.during the loan process,desmarais did not disclose that he had borrowed money to finance the,a fact that would have disinclined the mortgage company to issue the loan because an outlay of cash is considered some security against default.
as part of the loan application process,trainor submitted appraisals for the property that the jury could have found were inflated.see infra note.also among the documents provided to chase was a memo stating that desmarais had exchanged his original stock for shares of another company,and that he had a buyer ready to purchase that stock for.the memo bore the heading from the office of john desmarais and was signed with the initials desmarais testified,however,that he had not created the document,that it was not his handwriting on it,and that he never spelled his last name with a barney also was sent a revised purchase and sale agreement,which showed a new sale price of and referenced in deposits that desmarais was to have paid by september.desmarais testified that he did not see the revised purchase and sale agreement until after his arrest,and also stated that the signature that appears on not written by him.
on december,the mortgage company received another memo purportedly from desmarais,along with photocopies of cancelled checks that were meant to be evidence of his on the property.the evidence showed,however,that some of the photocopied checks had been altered on december,the company received a faxed copy of desmarais bank statement showing deposits of and and an account balance of proof that desmarais had sufficient funds of his own for the loan to close.the two deposited checks had been written by trainor,however,on an account of fradco holdings,that at the time contained only.at the closing on december,trainor provided the that was due from the borrower by using another fradco holdings check,this time for,and a cashier check for.trainor had purchased the cashier check with money he obtained from walden he gave walden in return a fradco holdings check that walden was told he should hold off on cashing until he heard back from trainor.
chase provided for the closing,and that money was disbursed based on directions from trainor,who stated in his letter to the mortgage company that he and his wife were donating most of the sale proceeds.the specified disbursements included a payment wired to the fradco holdings account,which covered the checks that trainor recently had written on that account the to walden for the cashier check,the paid at closing,and the check deposited into desmarais account trainor put a stop payment order on the fradco holdings check that also had been deposited into desmarais account.another was used to repay walden for his original loan to desmarais.
desmarais moved into the house at trainor road and managed to make the loan payments for eighteen months before the bank foreclosed on the property.
the mortgage on trainor road 
within weeks after the closing on trainor road,trainor approached desmarais with a new proposal.he suggested that desmarais become involved in a plan to purchase the adjoining plot at trainor road,which was held in the name of trainor son,and to build a custom home on the property the sale of the house would generate funds to help desmarais afford his loan payments on trainor road.desmarais introduced trainor to his friend,builder donald third in this the discussions eventually led to desmarais bowing out of the financing for trainor road because of his inability to borrow any more money.trainor and smith agreed that smith would serve as the buyer,and desmarais would receive a finder fee from the loan proceeds.
trainor again provided a purchase and sale agreement,which listed the sale price as and stated that the purchase would be accomplished with a deposit and a mortgage.smith and trainor had agreed,however,that the real sale price for the land was and that smith did not have to make the deposit.smith gave trainor,but understood that he would be reimbursed when the loan closed.on april,a deed was executed showing transfer of the property to smith.
meanwhile,trainor had interested individual who had lent money to desmarais for the earlier investing in trainor businesses.when walden became nervous about his investments,trainor offered him a security interest in the trainor road property as a line of credit up to a investment.in essence,this arrangement meant that walden would become the on trainor road,with the security interest in the land protecting him in case his investments with trainor turned out badly.the deal allowed trainor to create the impression that smith had purchased the property with a temporary mortgage funded by walden trainor prepared a mortgage and promissory note in which smith agreed to pay walden.
using the walden mortgage as evidence that had changed hands in his purchase of the property,smith submitted an application to citizens mortgage corporation citizens for a construction loan intended to repay the original mortgage and the remainder to finance construction of the house.smith told the loan officer that the house would be a vacation home rather than a custom investment deception necessary to gain approval for the loan.the mortgage company also was deceived about the down payment,another prerequisite to its loan.trainor sent an email message to the loan officer confirming the sale price of and stating that he had received from smith.he also reported that the remaining would come from desmarais payment for an easement on the property.smith testified at trial that the representations about the sales price and easement were false.
a construction loan in the amount of closed on october,but only the initial was disbursed at that time.trainor provided instructions directing that be paid to walden and that the remainder be given to trainor in five checks totaling two of those checks went to smith he was given a check for to repay him for his original deposit,and he received another check for.desmarais received his finder fee.about two weeks after the closing,walden was convinced to most of the proceeds he had received from the loan in another trainor deal so trainor ended up benefitting from more than of the citizens mortgage funds.
the lee transaction 
during the same time period in which trainor was arranging the transaction with smith,he also transferred trainor road to an unrelated individual in a settlement of debts.the recipient of the property,nevada attorney james lee,had represented a client,robert jones who was unable to pay attorney fees totaling more than.trainor owed jones a substantial amount of money,and he offered to pay off his debt by transferring property in maine to taking care of jones attorney fee problem.lee agreed to the deal,intending to obtain a loan on the property and then sell it.
between february and april,trainor arranged for the filing of several documents relating to lee purchase of trainor road a deed showing sale of the property to the law offices of james lee a lien certificate claiming a lien against the property based on purported obligations to various individuals and businesses,including fradco holdings and a lien release that purportedly transferred the property from lee back to trainor son lee was unaware of the lien returned the property to trainor so the sale to smith could he testified that when he discovered that activity i think we contacted the authorities.an investigation followed.
procedural background 
trainor,desmarais,and smith were charged in an indictment with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud,in violation of,and multiple counts of wire fraud,in violation of as noted earlier,desmarais and smith entered into plea agreements with the government,and each pled guilty to a single count of wire fraud.trainor filed a motion to dismiss the conspiracy count and to sever counts two through to trainor counts five through to trainor road.the motion was denied,and trainor was convicted by a jury of conspiracy and five counts of wire fraud 
the district court sentenced trainor to a term of imprisonment,followed by three years of supervised release.the court also imposed an assessment of and restitution,shared jointly and severally with desmarais and smith,in the amount of on appeal,trainor sets out four contentions the district court erred in refusing to dismiss the conspiracy count for duplicity the court abused its discretion in refusing to sever the wire fraud counts pertaining to trainor road from the counts pertaining to trainor road because the evidence at trial showed multiple conspiracies rather than one,variance occurred and his conviction on count,which charged a single conspiracy,lacked sufficient support in the record and the court abused its discretion in requiring redaction of the listing price for trainor road from a real estate brochure admitted as an exhibit.
appellant counsel acknowledged at oral argument that his client first three claims of error reduce to two primary points the record mandates a conclusion that two conspiracies existed,rather than one,and the spillover in evidence concerning those separate transactions injected unfair prejudice into his trial.our conclusion that appellant is wrong as to the first of these contentions leads inevitably to the failure of the second 
conspiracy,duplicity and variance 
a claim that the government improperly has characterized a series of allegedly unlawful transactions as a single enterprise can implicate both the doctrine of duplicity the joining of two or more distinct offenses in a single count of an indictment,see,united states verrecchia,cir,and the doctrine of variance the presentation at trial of evidence that varies materially from the crime charged in the indictment,see,united states balthazard,cir.trainor asserts both here.he claims that the indictment allegations reflect a surgical division between the two sets of charges and that count one thus improperly joins them in a single alleged conspiracy.in addition,he maintains that the evidence produced at trial proved two different and disconnected conspiracies.
appellant argues,in other words,that the indictment alone establishes reversible error on the conspiracy count because the two conspiracies were improperly joined in a single count,but that,even if we reject the duplicity claim,the conspiracy conviction nonetheless is defective because the evidence as presented at trial depicted two separate conspiracies.he further argues that error of either type requires that we reverse the jury verdicts on all counts because of the prejudice resulting from trying the two transactions together 
we find it unnecessary in this case to discuss duplicity separately.appellant does not argue that the facts presented at trial differed from the factual allegations in the that these facts,as alleged and proven,established two conspiracies rather than one.our conclusion that the evidence sufficiently supported the jury verdict on count one as,that appellant participated in a single,overarching dooms his contention that the indictment was fatally flawed.this is so because,in rejecting his variance claim,we also are implicitly concluding that the facts set out in the mirror the facts proven at a scenario that is permissibly viewed as a single conspiracy.see,united states mastelotto,cir,overruled on other grounds by united states miller,d t he question for review is simply whether the indictment may be read to allege a single unified scheme in each count.we therefore address the legality of the conspiracy conviction solely as an issue of variance 
in assessing whether the government case varied materially from the crime charged in the indictment,the initial the only one that we need to reach one of evidentiary sufficiency.united states,cir see also united states wihbey,cir quoting united states glenn,cir 
w e employ the same framework that we employ in connection with other sufficiency challenges in criminal cases we canvass the evidence direct and circumstantial in the light most agreeable to the prosecution and decide whether that evidence,including all plausible inferences extractable therefrom,enables a rational factfinder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the charged crime.
at quoting united states noah,cir see also balthazard,at.specifically,when the question is the singleness or multiplicities of the conspiratorial relationships,united states morrow,cir quoting american law institute,model penal code and commentaries,we consider all relevant circumstances and focus on such factors as whether the alleged conspirators shared a common purpose,whether their actions demonstrated interdependency,and the extent to which participants overlapped during the life of the alleged conspiracy.balthazard,at see also,at.at the end of the day,a defendant can not succeed with a sufficiency challenge as long as a plausible reading of the record supports the jury implied finding that he knowingly participated in the charged conspiracy.balthazard,at quoting,at.
such is the case here.the government alleged a scheme in which appellant and his conspired to enrich themselves and others by securing mortgages based on false representations.from the evidence presented at trial,the jury reasonably could conclude that,from the beginning,trainor anticipated using both of his family trainor road properties to effectuate the scheme.he initiated the second deal on the heels of the closing for the first property,proposing desmarais purchase of trainor road as,in essence,a method of obtaining additional financing for the purchase of trainor road.although there was no evidence that desmarais initially shared trainor vision,the jury rationally could find that desmarais agreed to extend the original conspiracy to protect his interest in trainor road,and that he did so by recruiting partners to purchase trainor road.similarly,while smith was uninvolved in the first phase of the alleged conspiracy,the evidence of his friendship with desmarais and his presumed awareness of desmarais need for cash permitted the jury to find that smith knew from the outset of his participation that the unorthodox financial arrangements that trainor,selling the property for while seeking a part of the larger scheme involving both pieces of property.smith acquiescence in desmarais role as a silent partner in the second the recipient of a finder the inference that smith knew the trainor road transaction was intended,at least in part,to prop up the original deception.the circumstances were thus readily susceptible to a finding of shared purpose among the three charged.
moreover,the collaborators overlapping participation is on its own a significant factor.desmarais was a key player in both deals,serving as the central in the first enterprise and playing an important role in the second transaction by bringing in smith.for his efforts,he was rewarded with the fee in connection with trainor road,and thus benefitted from both transactions.the fact that smith was not involved until the second transaction did not inevitably signal that a new enterprise was born o ne conspiracy does not necessarily end and a new one begin each time a new member joins the organization.balthazard,at.
both episodes also used similar techniques,including sham and falsely reported sales prices,and were in various ways interdependent.for example,the jury could have found that the appraisals appellant obtained for trainor road were inflated those valuations later were used as comparable sales to justify the also inflated appraisal reported for trainor road by invoking desmarais purported payment for an easement,appellant took advantage of desmarais ownership of trainor road to paper of the that smith needed to qualify for the mortgage on trainor road.both mortgage deals also used walden as a financial resource.indeed,the successful payoff to walden from the proceeds obtained from the trainor road mortgage set the stage for his willingness to go along with appellant odd proposal that he accept a mortgage on trainor road as security for his arrangement that advanced smith application for a construction loan on the property.
we think this evidence sufficient to permit the jury to find appellant guilty of the charged single conspiracy.it is of significance,too,that the court gave the jury an extended instruction on the government burden to prove the existence of one overall conspiracy as opposed to separate and independent conspiracies.determining whether one or more conspiracies existed is ordinarily a question of fact for the jury to resolve,balthazard,at see also united states portela,cir,and this jury,properly instructed,knew how to make that judgment.
harmless error 
though we reject appellant multiple conspiracy claim,we acknowledge that the evidence was not so potent that it compelled a finding of a single conspiracy.however,even if we were wrong in our assessment,appellant could not prevail.a variance is fatal only if the defendant shows prejudice.united states mueffelman,cir see also kotteakos united states.quoting berger united states.united states,cir.here,appellant was found guilty on all of the wire fraud counts presented to the jury,and he was the central actor in each of the two enterprises.the jury thus found that he criminally participated in both loan transactions,eliminating any risk that the conspiracy conviction applied to only one of the two conspiracies.
the only possible ground for prejudice would be a type of evidentiary,if the guilty verdicts on the fraud counts relating to one transaction were influenced by evidence relating to the other the interconnectedness of the two deals compels a conclusion of harmlessness indeed,even if the government had alleged two separate conspiracies,we think there is little chance that a trial court would have agreed to try them separately given their proximate timing and the substantial overlap.see.a while the evidence of the later transaction arguably was unnecessary to prove a conspiracy relating solely to trainor road,a conspiracy relating solely to trainor road surely would have required considerable focus on the earlier deal to explain the roles played later by desmarais and walden.moreover,as appellant has asserted in arguing that two conspiracies were proven,the evidence on each loan was presented any claim that the jury verdicts were infected by.while appellant emphasizes the mountainous amount of otherwise inadmissible b spillover evidence,his view that the transactions are distinct leads him to understate the quantity of fully relevant crossover evidence.in any event,a claim of prejudicial spillover can not succeed unless a defendant prove s prejudice so pervasive that a miscarriage of justice looms.united states,cir internal citation omitted.given the close relationship of the two transactions,appellant acknowledgment that the evidence at trial differentiated between them,and the court careful instructions,appellant has not come close to such a showing.
evidentiary claim 
appellant final claim of error is that the district court abused its discretion in ordering redaction of a portion of a real estate brochure that was admitted as an exhibit.see united states,cir noting abuse of discretion standard for evidentiary issues.the brochure contained pictures,written descriptions,and sales prices for three properties,including trainor road.the redacted exhibit deletes the information about the two unrelated properties and the selling price for trainor road.
the government sought exclusion of the selling price on the ground that the information did not relate to the time period of the charged offenses and therefore was both irrelevant and confusing for the jury.the trial judge agreed,stating that he did not think the defense should be allowed to argue price on something that has been testified to and is not in the right time frame because it would be misleading and improper.
on appeal,appellant contends that the brochure price was vital to his attempt to show that the appraisals he had obtained were reasonable,and he argues that there was,in fact,record support for the price.he points to the following colloquy between defense counsel and appraiser hill 
q do you see the real estate appraisal value to the side of the photo 
q do you think that accurately describes the property description as of october,
the government asserts that appellant is in suggesting that defense counsel use of the words appraisal value in his question indicates that hill response endorses the selling price rather,the government contends,the response more reasonably is understood to be hill affirmation that the property description is accurate.we think this is the only sensible characterization of the evidence.not only did the questions immediately following the excerpted colloquy pertain to the wording of the property description,but hill had performed one of the appraisals on the property admitted into evidence.hill appraisal set the property value in october at.given that context,the testimony cited above can not be understood to support the price in the brochure,and the district court can not be faulted for excluding it.
appellant duplicity and variance claims both fail because the facts as alleged
