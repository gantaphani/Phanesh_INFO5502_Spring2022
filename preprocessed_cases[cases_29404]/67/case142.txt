invoking the false claims act fca,a local real estate developer brought a qui tam action against the city of woonsocket,rhode island the city,and mayor susan menard.the developer claimed,in substance,that the city had defrauded the federal government by making false statements to the department of housing and urban development hud when applying for federal grants.
relying upon the fca public disclosure bar,the district court dismissed the action.the developer now appeals,raising questions of law not yet settled in this circuit regarding the operation of the public disclosure bar.we resolve those questions and,when all is said and done,affirm the dismissal of the action.
background 
the relator,gordon ondis,directly or indirectly owns several residential complexes in woonsocket.a number of the dwelling units in these complexes are classified as subsidized housing.sometime in,mayor menard visited one of the relator properties and,according to the relator,threatened to do away with all section housing the relator took umbrage and began to look into the city housing policies.his avowed objective was to ascertain whether the city was reaping a harvest of hud grants under false pretenses specifically,by offering assurances that the city would promote subsidized housing programs when,in reality,it was trying to stifle those programs.
in the course of this probe,the relator directed his employees to search public records,interview local developers and others with knowledge of the city housing policies,and obtain documents submitted by the city to hud.
the investigation revealed that,from to,the city received roughly in hud grants for public works projects,social service programs,and affordable housing.the investigators obtained the city grant applications through a freedom of information act foia request.see.the applications trumpeted a plan,which referred to preserving section rent subsidies as a means of meeting the city pressing need for affordable housing.
the relator also discovered or so he alleges that,during the same period,the city actually had followed a policy that tended to restrict the spread of subsidized housing.almost all the specific instances that he identifies to support this thesis were previously disclosed in daily newspapers of general circulation in woonsocket,namely,the woonsocket call and the providence journal.the only additional data point unarguably came from the public records of a suit brought by the city against two housing partnerships.
on february,the relator brought a qui tam action against the city and mayor menard in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.after the federal government declined to intervene,see b,the court transferred the case to the district of rhode island.united states ex rel.ondis city of woonsocket ondis i,d.
the transferee court,in response to the defendants motion to dismiss for want of subject matter jurisdiction.b,conducted an evidentiary hearing.based on the proof presented,the court dismissed the action.united states ex rel.ondis city of woonsocket ondis ii,d.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.the statutory scheme 
the fca allows private persons,called relators,to bring qui tam actions on behalf of the united states against persons or entities who knowingly submit false claims to the federal government.b.the united states has a right to intervene and assume primary responsibility for prosecuting the action.id.c.if the united states declines to intervene,the relator may pursue the action on its behalf.id.b.either way,the relator is eligible to collect a portion of any damages awarded.id.d.
the fca is hedged about with conditions.among other things,it erects a jurisdictional bar,familiarly known as the public disclosure bar,which may block a putative qui tam action.id.e.that bar is designed to foreclose qui tam actions in which a relator,instead of plowing new ground,attempts to by merely repastinating previously disclosed badges of fraud.united states ex rel.duxbury ortho biotech,cir.to draw an analogy from the world of entomology,the bar seeks to prevent parasitic suits.united states ex rel.mckenzie bellsouth,cir.
in this way,congress aspired to etch a fine line between encouraging and discouraging opportunistic behavior.united states ex rel.prawer fleet bank,cir.for this purpose,congress took pains to delineate the dimensions of the public disclosure bar 
no court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing,in a congressional,administrative,or government accounting office report,hearing,audit,or investigation,or from the news media,unless the action is brought by the attorney general or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.
based on this prescription,we have formulated a inquiry for use in determining whether a relator has carried his burden of negating the ubiquity of the bar in a given case.in its initial stages,this formulation asks 
whether there has been public disclosure of the allegations or transactions in the relator complaint if so,whether the public disclosure occurred in the manner specified in the statute and if so,whether the relator suit is based upon those publicly disclosed allegations or transactions 
united states ex rel.rost pfizer,cir.we conduct that inquiry here.if the answer to any one of these three questions is in the negative,then the public disclosure bar drops out of the case.if,however,the answers to all three questions are in the affirmative,the relator still may dismantle the public disclosure bar by showing that he qualifies as an original source under e b.see rost,at.we deal with this possibility separately.see infra part iii d.
iii.discussion 
a district court order of dismissal for want of subject matter jurisdiction ordinarily engenders de novo review.duxbury,at valentin hosp.bella vista,cir.when the district court does not rule on the pleadings alone but,rather,takes evidence in connection with a motion to dismiss for want of subject matter jurisdiction,the court factual findings are reviewed for clear error.see valentin,at,babcock wilcox,cir describing varying standards of review in analogous context.
federal courts,as courts of limited jurisdiction,must be scrupulous in applying the tenets that define the limits of their subject matter jurisdiction.gabriel preble,cir.the proponent of federal jurisdiction bears the burden of proving its existence by a preponderance of the evidence.see campbell dynamics gov t,cir see also d.
with these guideposts in place,we embark on a sequential appraisal of the three rost factors described above.then,we take up the original source exception and a disputed evidentiary ruling.
disclosure.
we start with the question of whether,prior to commencement of this action,there was a public disclosure of the transactions chronicled in the relator complaint.
for the purpose of the fca,public disclosure occurs when the essential elements exposing the particular transaction as fraudulent find their way into the public domain.united states ex rel.feingold adminastar,cir united states ex rel.springfield term.ry.quinn.t he disclosure must reveal both the misrepresented state of facts and the true state of facts so that the inference of fraud may be drawn.united states ex rel.mistick pbt hous.auth.of pittsburgh,cir accord.ass of nurse anesthetists allina health,cir.the two states of facts may come from different sources,as long as the disclosures together lead to a plausible inference of fraud.see united states ex rel.poteet medtronic,cir see also united states ex rel.reagan.med.ctr.reg l healthcare,cir.
against this backdrop,our initial task is to determine whether both the city alleged misrepresentation that it would promote subsidized housing and what the relator alleges was the city true plan that it would strive to curtail or eliminate subsidized housing were sufficiently in the public domain to ground an inference of fraud.
the relator wisely concedes that the events disclosing the city opposition to subsidized housing,which he contends reflected the city actual housing policy,were publicized in widely circulated newspaper articles and,thus,were in the public domain.see appellant br.at.he insists,however,that the city insincere promise to promote subsidized housing was kept under wraps and never publicly disclosed.this,then,is the bone of contention.
this quandary turns on the fact that the city promise to promote subsidized housing only became evident from hud response to the relator foia request.whether a response to a foia request constitutes a public disclosure within the purview of the fca is a question of first impression in this circuit see rost,at leaving the question open.
nevertheless,we do not write on a pristine page.other courts have answered this question in the affirmative.see,united states ex rel.grynberg praxair,cir it is generally accepted that a response to a request under the foia is a public disclosure.reagan,at similar mistick,at similar.we agree with these courts.
we have stated that the public disclosure requirement is satisfied when there is some act of disclosure to the public outside of the government.rost,at.responding to a foia request constitutes such an act.see mistick,at noting that,under the foia,e ach agency shall make available to the public certain specified categories of information emphasis and alteration in original quoting a.the supreme court reached this conclusion in an analogous context.see consumer prod.safety comm gte sylvania,d a s a matter of common usage the term public is properly understood as including persons who are foia requesters.a disclosure pursuant to the foia would thus seem to be most accurately characterized as a public disclosure.finding this reasoning easily transferable to the jurisprudence of the fca,we hold that a response to a foia request is an act of public disclosure because the response disseminates and,thus,discloses information to members of the public and,thus,outside the government bailiwick.
in this case,it is uncontested that the city alleged misrepresentation was disclosed,prior to suit,in hud response to the relator foia request.this fact,taken in conjunction with the publication of what the relator admits were the relevant indicia of the city true housing policy in the local press,means that all the essential elements of the alleged fraud were in the public domain before the relator started suit.we may,therefore,check the first rost factor off the list.
the fca public disclosure bar further requires that the disclosure emanate from a source specified in the statute.see e a see also united states ex rel.leblanc raytheon,cir.
the airing of the events that are said to reflect the city true housing policy,published in the woonsocket call and the providence journal,constitutes a disclosure from the news media and,thus,a disclosure from a listed source.see e a.it is less clear whether the disclosure of the city allegedly false promise,which came about through the foia response,falls within the compendium of sources listed in section e a.although this circuit has not yet answered that question,two data points lead us to conclude that such a response is an administrative report and,thus,falls within the taxonomy of section e a.
first,it can not be gainsaid that responding to a foia request constitutes an administrative action.after all,the response originates with a federal agency,and its transmission to the requestor constitutes official government action.see generally a describing agency responsibilities upon receipt of foia request.second,a foia response is a report,at least in the sense that it constitutes an official statement concerning the results of the agency search of its files.see id.given these data points,there is a logical basis for concluding that a foia response is an administrative report within the meaning of section e a.several courts have so held.see,grynberg,at reagan,at mistick,at.
the ninth circuit,however,has reached a different conclusion.see united states cath.healthcare,cir.that court suggested that whether a response to a foia request triggers the public disclosure bar depends on the nature of the document retrieved by means of the request unless the underlying document itself emanates from a source enumerated in section e a,the second prong of the public disclosure bar is not satisfied.id.at.the court reasoned that a foia response could not categorically qualify as an administrative report because such a characterization denotes a document that includes an analysis of findings,and responding to a foia request requires little more than duplication of an agency files.id.
we see no reason to narrow the definition of report so drastically.after all,the word report is typically defined as something that gives information.webster third new int l dict.the result of an agency search of its files in response to a foia request fits comfortably within this broad definition.see mistick,at.
to cinch matters,the ninth circuit interpretation fails to lend any independent significance to the act of responding to a foia request.just as transmittal of the foia response to the relator constitutes an act of public disclosure,the end product of the government search locating and compiling the requested documents independently constitutes an administrative this is so regardless of the character of the underlying documents.
the ninth circuit also expressed concern that if a foia response is categorically deemed an administrative report,it would deter individuals from either making foia requests or investigating suspected fraud.cath.healthcare,at.this is pure speculation that ignores legislative intent.congress plainly intended the fca to encourag e lawsuits by relators who have firsthand knowledge of fraud against the government.glaser wound care consultants,cir emphasis supplied.an individual who obtains information through foia disclosures in order to uncover fraud is not a person with firsthand knowledge and,thus,not a person whom congress chose to reward under the fca.
to say more on this point would be supererogatory.for these reasons,we reject the ninth circuit interpretation of administrative report adopt the majority view,and hold that a foia response is an administrative report within the purview of the fca.the second rost requirement is,therefore,satisfied.
because the relator allegations track facts that were publicly disclosed prior to suit through specified sources,we are left with the last piece of the tripartite puzzle whether the relator qui tam action is based upon those disclosures.this inquiry,too,demands that we answer a question of first impression in this circuit.
the courts are divided over the meaning of the phrase based upon as that phrase is used in the fca.the majority view holds that as long as the relator allegations are substantially similar to information disclosed publicly,the relator claim is based upon the public disclosure even if he actually obtained his information from a different source.see,united states ex rel.meyer horizon health,cir grynberg,at.ass of nurse anesthetists,at mistick,at mckenzie,at united states ex rel.findley employees club,cooper blue cross blue shield of,cir united states ex rel.doe john doe,cir.a few courts have interpreted the phrase more narrowly,requiring proof that the relator allegations are actually derived from the publicly disclosed information.see united states bank of farmington,cir united states ex rel.siller becton dickinson,cir.earlier this year,however,the tilt in favor of the majority view grew more pronounced the seventh circuit switched from the minority to the majority position.see glaser,at.this leaves the fourth circuit alone among the courts of appeals in favoring a narrow reading of the based upon language.
having examined this split,we conclude that the majority view is correct.while the fourth circuit interpretation draws some sustenance from the phrase itself,see siller,at relying on dictionary definition of base upon as meaning to use as a base or basis for,there are situations in which rigid adherence to semantic orthodoxy must yield to common sense.this is such a situation the construction of based upon spawned b
