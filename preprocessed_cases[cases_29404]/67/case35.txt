this case presents the labyrinthine question of whether new hampshire law requires a foreclosing entity to hold both mortgage and note before it can exercise a power of sale under.ann.rsa.in turn,that issue splinters into two distinct inquiries whether either the common law or state statute mandates the unity of the two and,if so,whether parties can override that baseline rule by agreement.because controlling state precedent does not provide definitive guidance on how to resolve these queries,and since consequential federalism interests are implicated,we will certify the questions to the new hampshire supreme court.
in april,plaintiff appellant joseph castagnaro executed a promissory note in favor of regency mortgage corporation regency and a mortgage to mortgage electronic registration systems,mers as nominee for the lender and lender successors and assigns.from that point forward,the mortgage document evidencing the security interest in the property and the note evidencing the underlying agreement to repay the loan on the property secured by the mortgage traveled different routes.
on december,mers assigned the mortgage to bac home loan servicing bac.subsequently,it was assigned to defendant appellee bank of new york mellon bnym.bnym is the current mortgagee.
two versions of the note are found in the record.the first shows an undated indorsement from regency to american residential mortgage.the phrase certified true copy has been excised in this version.the second version includes an undated assignment from regency to american residential mortgage,and an undated indorsement to countrywide bank fsb.an allonge in essence,an attachment to this note reveals an undated assignment from countrywide bank fsb to countrywide home loans,followed by an undated indorsement in blank.
after castagnaro failed to make certain mortgage payments,bnym moved to foreclose.just days before the scheduled foreclosure sale,however,castagnaro obtained an ex parte injunction in new hampshire state court.invoking diversity jurisdiction,bnym removed the case.
once in federal court,castagnaro amended his complaint,which bnym swiftly moved to dismiss.in january,the district court allowed bnym motion.it concluded that the parties intent to separate the mortgage and note at the onset of the transaction trumped any common law rule requiring unity.the court based this decision on analogous cases from the federal district court of new hampshire,see,galvin emc mortg,cv jl,wl,galvin i,and a state superior court decision,dow bank of mellon trust,cv.lexis.rockingham cnty.as mortgagee,bnym could thus proceed with the foreclosure under rsa,which authorizes mortgagee s to conduct foreclosures where,as here,the mortgage document contains a clause allowing them.
castagnaro timely appealed,and he requests that we certify the issues to the new hampshire supreme court.
we may certify a question to the new hampshire supreme court when the issue of state law may be determinative of the case,and if it appears that there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of the new hampshire supreme court.though we are generally reluctant to do so when a party requests certification for the first time on appeal,see boston car,acura auto,am.honda motor,cir,that delay alone does not tie our hands,see easthampton sav.bank city of springfield,cir referencing our sua sponte authority to certify questions of law.
here,the relevant requirements are satisfied such that the new hampshire supreme court is better suited to address the issue s,pagán colón walgreens of san patricio,cir.definitive answers to the certified questions will either resolve the entire case or position us to wrap up this appeal.yet,existing new hampshire law does not forecast the answers to the questions as they have emerged in the context of the modern market.a brief discussion shows why.
must an entity foreclosing under rsa hold both the mortgage and note 
though bnym held the mortgage when the foreclosure was initiated,it is unclear who held the underlying promissory note.thus,the baseline issue in this case is whether,as a general rule,a party must possess both instruments in order to foreclose under rsa.two sources of law may affect the resolution of this question the common law and new hampshire statutory regime.neither,however,permits us as a federal court to answer the question with confidence.
the relevant case law dates back to the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.these cases suggest that the mortgage and note are inseparable and thus a party would need both to foreclose.see platts auclair,this evidence was sufficient to sustain the plaintiff burden of proof to establish his ownership of the note and mortgage.see also page pierce,smith moore.indeed,several new hampshire superior court decisions have invoked the common law to hold just that.see,deutsche bank trust monchgesang,c.lexis.hillsborough cnty,newitt wells fargo bank,cv.lexis.chesire cnty.july,zecevic bank,ass n,e,wl.belknap cnty.
yet,there exists another interpretation of the common law that may reconcile those cases with modern market practices.the early decisions emphasize the debt rather than the note as being tethered to the mortgage.see,southerin mendum,unless he or she at the same time transfers the debt,nothing will pass by his or her deed.though the note may serve as evidence of that debt,see howland spencer,according to bnym,it is the mortgagee connection to the debt,rather than to the note,that permits the mortgagee to move forward with a foreclosure.bnym goes on to argue that if a mortgagee retains legal title to the mortgage,while the note holder possesses an equitable interest in the mortgage,see,culhane aurora loan servs.of nebraska,cir stating that,under massachusetts law,t he noteholder possesses an equitable right to demand and obtain an assignment of the mortgage,then the mortgage and debt are inexorably tied together regardless of where the note may travel,and the mortgage alone should be sufficient to foreclose.this is true even if the mortgagee then has an obligation to account to the.this perspective,bnym proffers,is the one that best comports with a market in which instruments are routinely divided and sold off.
even if the new hampshire supreme court rejected that argument,it might view this question as the massachusetts supreme judicial court did as one governed by principles of agency.see eaton fed.mortg.ass n.it could therefore hold that although a mortgagee must generally possess the note to foreclose under rsa,it can also foreclose as the agent of the note holder.id.if the new hampshire court were to follow that approach,it would also need to decide whether language in the mortgage document in this case naming mers nominee for lender and lender successors and assigns creates an agency relationship allowing foreclosure under rsa.id.at noting that possibility but not resolving it.it would further need to resolve whether the use of the term nominee to describe that relationship imposes any burden on the mortgagee to show specific authorization from the note holder before foreclosing.dwire sullivan,unlike in a true trust,the trustees of a nominee trust have no power,as such,to act in respect of the trust property but may only act at the direction of in effect,as agents for the beneficiaries.internal quotation marks omitted.we see nothing in existing new hampshire precedent that provides a clear answer to these questions.
even if the common law were clear a cogent argument can be made that,regardless of the common law,the statute governing foreclosures independently requires an entity to hold both the mortgage and note.rsa.though the law itself does not explicitly address the rights or responsibilities of the,several provisions assume that the borrower will be paying the mortgagee in other words,it presumes that the mortgagee and would be one in the same.see,rsa a.this could theoretically imply that the legislature intended to impose this requirement,and considered the proposition so obvious that it had no need to state it.
of course,that argument is somewhat undercut by the statute plain language.indeed,one could read the term m
