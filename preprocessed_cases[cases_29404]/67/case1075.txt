plaintiffs saul catalan and mia morris sued defendants rbc mortgage company and gmac mortgage company under the federal real estate settlement procedures act respa,et,and under illinois law for gross negligence,breach of contract,and willful and wanton negligence.the district court dismissed the plaintiffs gross negligence claim as merely duplicating the willful and wanton negligence claim.the court granted summary judgment to gmac mortgage on the plaintiffs respa,breach of contract,and remaining negligence claims.the plaintiffs appeal those decisions.we reverse the grant of summary judgment for gmac mortgage on the plaintiffs respa and breach of contract claims,and we affirm summary judgment on their negligence claims 
i.the real estate settlement practices act 
before digging into the details of plaintiffs maddening troubles with their mortgage,we provide a sketch of the relevant respa requirements.respa is a consumer protection statute that regulates the real estate settlement process,including servicing of loans and assignment of those loans.see congressional findings.the statute imposes a number of duties on lenders and loan servicers.most relevant here are the requirements that borrowers be given notice by both transferor and transferee when their loan is transferred to a new lender or servicer,b and c,and that loan servicers respond promptly to borrowers written requests for information,e.
the details of the requirement for responding to written requests will become relevant here.first,it takes a qualified written request to trigger the loan servicer duties under respa to acknowledge and respond.the statute defines a qualified written request as written correspondence other than notices on a payment coupon or similar documents from the borrower or her agent that requests information or states reasons for the borrower belief that the account is in error.e b.to qualify,the written request must also include the name and account of the borrower or must enable the servicer to identify them.id.
within days after receiving a qualified written request,the servicer must take one of three actions either make appropriate corrections to the borrower account and notify the borrower in writing of the corrections investigate the borrower account and provide the borrower with a written clarification as to why the servicer believes the borrower account to be correct or investigate the borrower account and either provide the requested information or provide an explanation as to why the requested information is unavailable.see e a,b,and c.no matter which action the servicer takes,the servicer must provide a name and telephone number of a representative of the servicer who can assist the borrower.see id.during the period after a servicer receives a qualified written request relating to a dispute regarding the borrower payments,a servicer may not provide information regarding any overdue payment,owed by such borrower and relating to such period or qualified written request,to any consumer reporting agency.e.
respa provides for a private right of action for violations of its requirements.f.the provision for a private right of action includes a safe harbor provision,which provides in relevant part that a transferee service provider like gmac mortgage shall not be liable for a violation of section if,within days after discovering an error whether pursuant to a final written examination report or the servicer own procedures and before the commencement of an action under this subsection and the receipt of written notice of the error from the borrower,the servicer notifies the person concerned of the error and makes whatever adjustments are necessary in the appropriate account to ensure that the person will not be required to pay an amount in excess of any amount that the person otherwise would have paid.f.
ii.the facts 
because the plaintiffs appeal the district court grant of summary judgment,we review the trial court decision de novo,viewing all evidence in the light most favorable to and drawing all reasonable inferences for the plaintiffs,as the parties.see.c hukic aurora loan services,cir burnett lfw,cir.we trace the plaintiffs problems with their original mortgage servicer,then with the transfer of the mortgage to gmac mortgage,as relevant to plaintiffs claims that gmac mortgage violated respa by failing to provide notice of the transfer and by failing to respond to their qualified written requests,and by failing to correct erroneous information it had given to services.
plaintiffs problems with rbc mortgage in june,the plaintiffs bought a home in matteson,illinois.they obtained a federal housing administration loan by executing a mortgage and note in favor of rbc.at the outset,theirs was a fixed loan at annual interest with a monthly payment of that included principal,interest,and escrow.
although the plaintiffs first payment was not due until august,rbc incorrectly entered the plaintiffs mortgage into its computer accounting system to show a first payment due date of july.because of this error,when the plaintiffs made their first payment they were already least according to rbc system.by the time the plaintiffs made their second payment,rbc had determined that their loan was in default,and it increased their monthly payment amount to.the plaintiffs,at first unaware of the increase,and then,without receiving an explanation of the increase,continued to send their mortgage payments for the original amount.rbc returned those checks uncashed.
rbc filed for foreclosure on the plaintiffs home on february.in may and june,the plaintiffs provided checks to rbc in an attempt to make up for the uncashed payments.however,the plaintiffs may payment was still due even after this reconciliation of their account.rbc did not provide the plaintiffs with an account statement or otherwise inform them of that delinquency.then,when the plaintiffs sent their august payment to rbc,rbc did not apply that payment to the loan.
gmac mortgage steps in in september,rbc assigned the plaintiffs loan to gmac mortgage.when gmac mortgage assumed the plaintiffs mortgage,it did not send the plaintiffs a letter notifying them of the transfer.plaintiffs,not knowing that gmac mortgage was their new mortgage holder,sent their september payment to rbc.rbc did not cash it but forwarded it to gmac mortgage.
at some point in this period,gmac mortgage sent the plaintiffs an account statement dated september,which they received.that account statement was based on information that gmac mortgage had received from rbc.it showed that the plaintiffs account was past due in the amount of and that gmac mortgage had already assessed late fees totaling.on september,gmac mortgage sent the plaintiffs a letter demanding proof of their homeowners insurance coverage.then,on september,gmac mortgage returned the plaintiffs september payment,which they had sent to rbc.the letter returning the payment informed the plaintiffs that the payment represented only one of five payments that were then due from may to september,and provided the plaintiffs with a phone number.
on october,the plaintiffs wrote to the united states department of housing and urban development hud detailing what they understandably described as their nightmare with rbc.they explained 
despite admissions by rbc that they made errors,they feel no obligation to correct the grievance sic wrongs by supplying information necessary to bring closure to this situation,and they have cashed checks as if there was never any question raised or breach of obligation on their part.this is the same company that as of a few weeks ago was in hot pursuit of our home by means of foreclosure and had for months refused to accept our payments.the last message we received from rbc stated that there were updates on our account yet they have continually refused to operate in a professional manner by providing a written explanation that would offer us clarity and accountability on their part.
the letter provided a detailed outline of the plaintiffs account history with rbc,including the fact that their first payment had been due in august.it also recounted that rbc did not cash their august or september payments,and that on october they received a letter from gmac mortgage returning their september payment and informing them that the payment was not enough to cover the past due balance because five payments were then due.the plaintiffs wrote gmac claims that they took over our mortgage in may.no information to that effect had ever previously been provided by rbc or gmac.finally,their letter asked several questions about rbc and gmac mortgage servicing practices,among them 
why did rbc cash checks in july for an account that they did not hold and according to gmac had purportedly been sold in may 
what happened to the funds that were taken in july 
why were previous checks not forwarded to the new company 
why would gmac just now initiate contact 
why would gmac purchase a nonperforming mortgage 
the plaintiffs sent their letter to hud,which forwarded it to gmac mortgage,which received it on october.
in the meantime,on october and again on october,the plaintiffs wrote to gmac mortgage directly,requesting information concerning the transfer of their loan,including the date of the transfer,the amount transferred,confirmation of their monthly payment amount,and the payment address.the october letter further sought any information available about this account.
on october,in response to the plaintiffs october letter,gmac mortgage advised the plaintiffs that their account had been transferred on september,and that a monthly payment of had been due on may.the response also listed plaintiffs principal balance.then,under separate cover,when gmac mortgage did not receive the plaintiffs october payment,the company demanded for payments on the plaintiffs account since may,plus in late fees.in that letter dated october,gmac mortgage informed the plaintiffs that they were in default and stated that they could cure by paying the total amount due within days.days later on october,gmac sent an odd letter informing plaintiffs that their monthly payment was,their next payment due date was may,and that there was an escrow shortage in their account of.
on october,gmac mortgage responded to the letter that it had received from hud in a letter to hud captioned re saul catalan and mia morris payment dispute.gmac mortgage informed hud that there was no indication that the plaintiffs funds were missing or misapplied based on the records that gmac mortgage had received from rbc.gmac mortgage also told hud that those records reflected that the plaintiffs first payment had been due in july.
gmac mortgage sent a letter to the plaintiffs on october,to advise them that their mortgage had reached an advanced stage of delinquency and to offer alternatives,such as a repayment plan,loan modification,or deed in lieu of foreclosure,to avoid a completed foreclosure.
on november,the plaintiffs sent a letter to gmac mortgage,describing their history with rbc and enclosing a check for to cover seven payments of.in that letter they informed gmac mortgage that rbc received payments from us that were not applied promptly,other payments that were never applied and they never provided a clear explanation for their refusal to accept our payments,an action which resulted in our home being wrongfully placed in foreclosure.they also set forth their expectations for how their account would be handled,advising gmac mortgage that they expected that any request from us for information will be provided,any changes to our account or information that requires correspondence will be forwarded to us in writing,and all payments will be processed in a timely manner.finally,they advised gmac mortgage that if you have any questions regarding this account i would appreciate them being asked in writing from the standpoint that documentation is clarity.it is an unsafe approach to take the word of rbc as fact because as a company they have proven to me that fact for them is evasive.on november,gmac mortgage commenced foreclosure proceedings.by december,gmac mortgage was reporting the plaintiffs loan as delinquent to the credit bureaus.
on december,the plaintiffs sent gmac mortgage another letter to request that gmac mortgage apply the payment to their account,explaining that it becomes a major disruption to have large sums of money unaccounted for.they wrote again on december,again asking gmac mortgage to process the check and requesting quick resolution of whatever issues remain since the transfer of this account to your company by processing and updating this and all future payments received immediately.the plaintiffs sent their december mortgage payment on the same date under separate cover.on december,gmac mortgage returned the check,explaining that the funds did not represent the full amount required to bring the plaintiffs account current and advising the plaintiffs that their account had been sent to an attorney to begin foreclosure proceedings.it then responded to the plaintiffs december and letters on december and.in each of those letters,it stated,thank you for your inquiry on your account.we are currently processing your request and will respond in writing within days.the record does not contain these promised responses.
the plaintiffs then wrote gmac mortgage outside foreclosure counsel a letter dated december stating that they disputed gmac mortgage attempt to collect on their account and that they had sent everything necessary to bring their account current.they also requested an explanation for why,according to the letter they had received from foreclosure counsel,the balance of their account had been increased by between september and november.that same day and days after it had filed for foreclosure,gmac mortgage dismissed the foreclosure proceedings.then,inexplicably,on december,gmac mortgage sent another letter to the plaintiffs advising them that their account had been transferred to gmac mortgage attorney for foreclosure proceedings and returning their december payment 
on january,hud again intervened,requesting that,upon receipt of ten mortgage payments from the plaintiffs for the months of may to february,gmac mortgage reinstate the plaintiffs loan as current and waive any and all extra charges and attorney fees.the plaintiffs sent a check for to gmac mortgage on february.that amount represented ten mortgage payments and included no account fees or costs,and thus amounted to what the plaintiffs would have otherwise paid in regular mortgage payments over ten months.once it had received the plaintiffs check,gmac mortgage brought their account current without charging them penalties or additional interest.
in april,hud contacted gmac mortgage on the plaintiffs behalf to request that gmac mortgage stop reporting them as delinquent to the credit bureaus.on may,gmac mortgage complied,and in august it sent the plaintiffs a letter claiming that its records indicated that it had not reported any derogatory credit information on the plaintiffs account from september through july.
the district court proceedings gmac mortgage moved for summary judgment on all of the plaintiffs claims.without reaching the merits of the plaintiffs respa claims,the court found that gmac mortgage qualified for respa safe harbor provision and was therefore not liable for any violations under that statute.the court dismissed the plaintiffs gross negligence claim,finding that it duplicated the plaintiffs negligence claim.the court granted summary judgment for gmac mortgage on the plaintiffs negligence claim after finding that gmac mortgage promptly corrected the errors relating to the plaintiffs account when it received notice of the plaintiffs payment dispute,so that its conduct could not be deemed willful or wanton.the court found that the plaintiffs could not recover for breach of contract because the plaintiffs had purposely withheld their october mortgage payment and were themselves in breach.
iii.plaintiffs respa claims 
plaintiffs contend that gmac mortgage violated respa in a number of ways,including failing to give notice of the transfer of their mortgage,failing to respond promptly to qualified written requests for information,and failing to correct wrong information provided to agencies.the district court did not reach the merits of those claims because it found that gmac mortgage was entitled to the protection of the respa safe harbor provision in f.we address first the safe harbor provision and then the substantive claims.
respa safe harbor 
although respa provides a private right of action for violations of its requirements,it also includes a or safe harbor provision,which provides 
a transferor or transferee servicer shall not be liable under this subsection for any failure to comply with any requirement under this section if,within days after discovering an error whether pursuant to a final written examination report or the servicer own procedures and before the commencement of an action under this subsection and the receipt of written notice of the error from the borrower,the servicer notifies the person concerned of the error and makes whatever adjustments are necessary in the appropriate account to ensure that the person will not be required to pay an amount in excess of any amount that the person otherwise would have paid.
gmac mortgage is not entitled to the protection of the safe harbor in section f.although the parties have debated other requirements in the safe harbor provision,gmac mortgage did not argue,and nothing in the record shows,that gmac mortgage notif ied the person concerned of the error,as required to invoke the protection.on this basis alone,gmac mortgage was not eligible for protection in the respa safe harbor.the district court finding otherwise was error.
in the district court,gmac mortgage argued that it was protected by the safe harbor because,when all was said and done,the plaintiffs did not pay any money in excess of what they otherwise would have paid,and gmac mortgage corrected all errors in the plaintiffs account within days after receiving the plaintiffs december,letter,and before the plaintiffs filed suit.under this view of the statute,the defendant must have corrected the error only before plaintiffs filed suit,even if the defendant did not discover and correct the error before receiving written notice of it from the borrower.plaintiffs contend that the safe harbor provision requires the defendant to have corrected the error both before suit was filed and before the defendant received written notice of the error from the borrower.because gmac mortgage failure to provide notice keeps it out of the safe harbor in this case,we express no view on the district court reasoning on this point.
b.the qualified written request issue 
the plaintiffs argue that the letters they sent on october,november,december,december and december were qualified written requests.they contend that gmac mortgage violated respa by reporting their account as delinquent to the credit bureaus within the window after each of those qualified written requests was received,and that gmac mortgage also failed to investigate properly or to take corrective action in response to the october,november,december and december qualified written requests.
respa defines a qualified written request as follows 
for purposes of this subsection,a qualified written request shall be a written correspondence,other than notice on a payment coupon or other payment medium supplied by the servicer,that 
i includes,or otherwise enables the servicer to identify,the name and account of the borrower and 
ii includes a statement of the reasons for the belief of the borrower,to the extent applicable,that the account is in error or provides sufficient detail to the servicer regarding other information sought by the borrower.
gmac mortgage argues that the letters in question were not qualified written requests because the letters do not identify an error in plaintiffs account or provide any statement of the reasons plaintiffs believe their account was in error.gmac mortgage br.relying on several district court decisions,gmac mortgage contends that letters that merely dispute a debt or request information are not qualified written requests,and do not trigger the obligations under section,citing moore federal deposit ins,wl,at,plaintiffs letters requesting information regarding reinstatement of a defaulted mortgage loan and the amounts of delinquent mortgage payments due did not relate to servicing and thus were not qualified written requests,champlaie bac home loans servicing,lp,d,plaintiffs claim that lender failed to respond in violation of respa was dismissed because plaintiff did not allege that his written request for rescission of the loan related to the servicing of his loan and thus his communication was not a qualified written request,keen american home mortgage servicing,d,plaintiff demand to cancel trustee sale of home and for rescission disputed the validity of the loan but did not dispute the servicing of the loan and was not a qualified written request,pettie saxon mortgage services,wl,at.may,plaintiffs inquiry letter disputing amount owed and requesting sets of documents did not offer reasons for their dispute and thus was not a qualified written request under section e b morequity,naeem,d,letter seeking information about the validity of a loan and mortgage documents but making no inquiry as to the account balance or credit for periodic payments did not relate to servicing and was thus not a qualified written request.by gmac mortgage argument,a lender would have no obligation to respond to a borrower who expressed her belief that her account was in error but was unable to provide specific reasons for that belief,an untenable result under the language of the statute.
respa does not require any magic language before a servicer must construe a written communication from a borrower as a qualified written request and respond accordingly.the language of the provision is broad and clear.to be a qualified written request,a written correspondence must reasonably identify the borrower and account and must include a statement of the reasons for the belief of the borrower,to the extent applicable,that the account is in error or provides sufficient detail to the servicer regarding other information sought by the borrower.e b emphasis added.any reasonably stated written request for account information can be a qualified written request.to the extent that a borrower is able to provide reasons for a belief that the account is in error,the borrower should provide them,but any request for information made with sufficient detail is enough under respa to be a qualified written request and thus to trigger the servicer obligations to respond.see e a,e,and e see also garcia wachovia mortgage,d,when construed in light most favorable to borrower,letter was a qualified written request even though it did not contain a statement of reasons for borrower belief of error letter provided sufficient detail regarding other information being sought rawlings dovenmuehle mortgage,d,plaintiffs claims survived summary judgment where court found that descriptions of payments made to a prior servicer sufficiently stated plaintiffs reasons for their belief that their account was in error and were qualified written requests.we turn to the disputed letters.
letter of october,
the plaintiffs october letter included content that was clearly sufficient to be a qualified written request.the letter described in great detail the difficulties the plaintiffs encountered at the hands of rbc.the letter recounted that their first payment was due in august,but that rbc failed to process the plaintiffs august payment in a timely manner,and that a discrepancy arose between the plaintiffs and rbc as to whether the plaintiffs had made their payments or not.the letter described how rbc raised the plaintiffs monthly payment amount without informing them of the change,and that each of the plaintiffs attempts to communicate with rbc was rebuffed until rbc at last acknowledged its error and dismissed its foreclosure action against the plaintiffs in july.the letter then reported that rbc did not cash the plaintiffs august and september payments,but that gmac mortgage returned the plaintiffs september payment uncashed,even though that payment had been sent to rbc,and that gmac mortgage informed the plaintiffs that their september payment was insufficient to cover the amount they then owed on their mortgage account,which,according to gmac mortgage,was five months overdue.the plaintiffs,naturally,wrote this description of the history of their loan servicing from their perspective,and without access to the incorrect information that gmac mortgage had acquired from rbc.but the letter was certainly a thorough statement of the reasons for the belief of the borrower,to the extent applicable,that the account is in error under section e b.
the letter then continued,requesting very specific information.plaintiffs asked that rbc explain why it had cashed the checks they had sent in july if,as they had been told by gmac mortgage,rbc had sold their account to gmac mortgage in may.the letter also sought an accounting of the funds plaintiffs had paid in july and sought information related to the,why rbc had not forwarded their checks to gmac mortgage,why gmac mortgage had delayed initiating contact with them after purchasing their account,and why gmac mortgage would purchase a nonperforming mortgage.some of this information might have been unavailable or unable to be obtained by the servicer under section e c,but whether the information the plaintiffs sought was unavailable or whether their questions were unanswerable does not negate the fact that they had provide d sufficient detail to the servicer regarding other information sought by the borrower under section e b.their october letter was a qualified written request,and gmac mortgage was obligated to respond.
of course,the plaintiffs did not send their october,letter directly to gmac mortgage.they sent it to hud,which forwarded it to gmac mortgage.the statute requires that qualified written requests be received from the borrower or an agent of the borrower.e a.we do not have difficulty interpreting that requirement,under the circumstances of this case,to include hud intercession on the plaintiffs behalf.respa is a consumer protection statute,and on summary judgment we must view the facts in the plaintiffs favor.here,the record amply demonstrates that the plaintiffs had exhausted every reasonable avenue in their communications with rbc,yet in the fall of,they were back in the same nightmare with a different company.again they were being accused of not paying their mortgage,and again they were being threatened with foreclosure.their confusion and desperation at this point were palpable,and they reasonably sought help from hud.besides,when it received the plaintiffs letter,gmac mortgage tacitly acknowledged that the letter was a request for information and raised a dispute with their account.after all,in its response to hud,gmac mortgage provided a detailed accounting of the history and transfer of the plaintiffs mortgage and captioned its letter as a response to the plaintiffs payment dispute.after the months the plaintiffs had spent writing to and getting nowhere with rbc,and due to the fact that gmac mortgage received the plaintiffs october letter and treated it as a payment dispute and as a request for information,the fact that gmac mortgage received the letter from hud and not directly from the plaintiffs does not prevent the plaintiffs october letter from being a qualified written request under respa.
letter of november,
in the plaintiffs november letter,they explained their understanding that,based on information they had received from gmac mortgage,there were seven payments due on their mortgage of each,for a total of.a check for that amount was enclosed with the letter.the plaintiffs also set forth their expectations for how gmac mortgage would handle their account going forward,including that gmac mortgage would provide any information they request,that any requested information and any changes to their account would be in writing,and that their mortgage payments would be applied in a timely manner.however,the plaintiffs did not raise any disputes or errors in their account,and their expectations were not requests for information.we can not construe the plaintiffs november letter as a qualified written request under respa.
letter of december,
in the plaintiffs letter of december,they explained that they sent a check to gmac mortgage for on november,which gmac mortgage had not yet cashed.their letter requested that gmac mortgage cash their check and apply the funds to their account because it becomes a major disruption to have large sums of money unaccounted for.although this letter certainly pertained to the servicing of their account,the plaintiffs were not requesting information and were not stating a belief that their account was in error.the plaintiffs were requesting that gmac mortgage process their payment more quickly,but in and of itself,that request does not seem to be based on any belief that an underlying error was causing the delay.the plaintiffs december letter was not a qualified written request under respa.
letter of december,
the plaintiffs letter of december was similar to their letter of december.they recounted how gmac mortgage returned their august and september mortgage payments and how they sent a check for in response to gmac mortgage statement that was necessary to bring the plaintiffs account current.they stated that gmac mortgage refusal to process this check when only having an association with the account for two months raises questions in our minds about your motivation for acquiring our account,and that 
the chaotic state that existed when you acquired the account was a direct result of the extreme mismanagement of our account by rbc.however your actions also give me pause to wonder if your interest is more in acquiring our home than servicing the account.additionally,it is extremely questionable as to why your company would assume an account that appeared to be in as severe disarray as the one received from rbc.
the plaintiffs then asked for quick resolution of whatever issues remain since the transfer of this account to your company by processing this and all future payments immediately.although the plaintiffs were understandably frustrated that gmac mortgage had not yet cashed their check and applied that amount to their account,we do not interpret the plaintiffs december letter as a statement of their belief that gmac mortgage servicing of their account was in error.again,their letter expressed their desire that gmac mortgage process their payment more quickly,which is not a statement of error or a request for information.they also hinted at issues remaining since gmac mortgage acquired their account from rbc,but we can not reasonably construe the plaintiffs use of the word issues as a statement of error,or as a request for information.the plaintiffs december letter was not a qualified written request.
letter of december,
the plaintiff december letter was unequivocally a qualified written request under respa.the first sentence of the letter said i am disputing your attempt to collect on the above referenced account.the plaintiffs stated that they had sent gmac mortgage the full amount required to bring the account current,but by then gmac mortgage had returned their check and had advised them that it was seeking foreclosure against them.against this backdrop,the plaintiffs statement that gmac mortgage had refused to process checks to alleviate any unnecessary actions or undue harm was a statement of their belief that their account was in error they also very clearly requested specific information regarding their,an explanation of how their account balance increased from to over a time span.the december was also a qualified written request.
having found that the plaintiffs october and december letters were qualified written requests under respa,we leave it to the district court to resolve on remand whether gmac mortgage satisfied its obligations to investigate and respond under e a and e and to refrain from reporting the plaintiffs as delinquent to the credit reporting bureaus under e.on remand,the district court will also need to consider the plaintiffs claims that gmac mortgage violated respa by not sending them an appropriate notice that their loan had been transferred and by charging them late fees within days of the transfer.see c requiring transferee servicer to notify the borrower of the transfer within days of the effective date of transfer,with certain exceptions d prohibiting transferee servicer from imposing a late fee if borrower payment is received by the transferor servicer before the payment due date.summary judgment for gmac mortgage on the plaintiffs respa claims is reversed,and we remand to the district court for further proceedings.
iv.common law claims 
breach of contract 
the plaintiffs also claimed that gmac mortgage breached the contract when it refused to accept the payments they sent on september,and november,the district court dismissed the plaintiffs breach of contract claim on summary judgment.the court found that the plaintiffs had purposely withheld their october payment and that this withholding was itself a breach.we agree with plaintiffs that this was an error.
gmac mortgage does not dispute that it refused the plaintiffs september and november payments and did not immediately apply those payments to the plaintiffs debt.it argues instead that its failure to do so did not amount to a breach of the contract.nothing in the contract required gmac mortgage to apply the payments according to any sort of schedule,it argues,and it attempts to reframe the plaintiffs breach of contract claim as nothing more than a gripe that the payments were not applied as plaintiffs would have liked,pointing out that in time,all of the plaintiffs payments were applied properly.gmac mortgage br.
to swallow gmac mortgage argument,we would have to accept,as a matter of law,that a lender is free to refuse a tendered payment and then to hold the borrower responsible for having failed to make the payment.we would have to accept,as a matter of law,that it does not matter if a holder of a promissory note without a specified time period for its own performance performs its obligations under the contract in a reasonable time,so long as the party performs its obligations eventually.we do not accept that argument.it is a basic tenet of contract law,recognized in illinois,that where no time for performance is specified,the law implies a reasonable time.see in re marriage of tabassum and younis,d,rose mavrakis,d,meyer marilyn miglin,d.whether or not gmac mortgage delay in applying the plaintiffs payments was when gmac mortgage was claiming that plaintiffs were in breach by failing to make those same an issue of material fact that precludes summary judgment for gmac mortgage on the claim.
gmac mortgage also argues that its breach should be excused because the plaintiffs breached the contract first when they failed to remit their october payment true,another general tenet of contract law is that plaintiffs can not succeed on a breach of contract claim unless they demonstrate their own performance of the contract requirements.see hukic aurora loan services,cir solai cameron,plainfield community consolidated school dist,d,under general contract principles,a material breach of a contract provision by one party may be grounds for releasing the other party from his contractual obligations,quoting mohanty john heart clinic,borys rudd,d,only material breach of a contract provision will justify by the other party.the plaintiffs were certainly obligated to make timely payments under the contract.but the servicers had their own obligations under the contract,one of which was to provide timely and accurate information about where and to whom those payments should be sent in the event of a transfer.such notice was also required under respa.see b and c.on these facts,which party breached first is not a question with a clear answer.a reasonable jury could find that the plaintiffs failure to submit their october payment in a timely manner was justified by earlier wrongs by rbc mortgage and gmac mortgage.
in september,gmac mortgage assumed the plaintiffs mortgage from rbc,but the plaintiffs were not informed of the transfer.not knowing that gmac mortgage was their new mortgage holder,the plaintiffs sent their september payment to rbc.that payment was later returned to the plaintiffs uncashed,not by rbc but by gmac mortgage,along with a letter informing them that they owed not one payment but five,relying on inaccurate information from rbc.when,on october,gmac mortgage told the plaintiffs that they could bring their account current by paying,the plaintiffs paid check that gmac mortgage again returned,uncashed.why gmac mortgage did not accept the plaintiffs september and november checks as partial payment of the total amount it believed the plaintiffs owed is not explained by the parties and remains a mystery.a reasonable jury could conclude that the plaintiffs were doing their best to hold up their end of the all,they were not squandering their uncashed mortgage payments,and in november they were able to send gmac mortgage more than it asked for.a jury could also find that plaintiffs attempts were thwarted,first by rbc and then by gmac mortgage mismanagement of their account.given the plaintiffs understandable confusion and frustration with the servicing of their loan in the fall of and gmac mortgage mixed messages regarding how they might fix the problems,a reasonable jury could conclude that the plaintiffs failure to submit their october payment to gmac mortgage was excused.
gmac mortgage cites our decision in hukic,arguing that any misstep by a borrower in performance of the contract absolves a lender from liability for a later breach of the contract.we do not read hukic so broadly.hukic paid his property taxes and insurance directly,as his mortgage contract permitted him to do so long as he also submitted proof of payment to his mortgage company or mortgage was also transferred from one servicer to another several times.hukic,at.this he failed to do despite his servicers repeated requests for the required proof.because they were unaware that hukic had already paid those items,the mortgage servicers also paid them,which put hukic mortgage account in arrears.hukic brought suit against the servicers for breach of contract.we upheld summary judgment for the mortgage servicers,finding that hukic had breached the contract by not informing the companies that he had paid the property taxes and homeowner insurance,as he was contractually obligated to do.id.at.hukic failure to comply with his contractual obligations was material and absolved the servicers from liability because it directly caused the servicers actions that were the basis of his own breach of contract claims.there was no issue in hukic concerning whether or not hukic breach was excusable.
here,even assuming that the plaintiffs delayed in making their october payment as gmac mortgage contends,that delay did nothing to exacerbate the already serious problems with gmac mortgage servicing of the plaintiffs mortgage account.their delay in submitting their october payment,viewed in light of rbc and gmac mortgage repeated failures to provide them with information regarding their account or to conduct an investigation into the errors in transferring their account,is not comparable to hukic stonewalling.a reasonable trier of fact could find that the plaintiffs failure to remit their october payment in a timely manner,although a breach of the contract,was excused due to the lenders earlier breaches and errors and the resulting confusion surrounding their account.summary judgment for gmac mortgage on the plaintiffs breach of contract claim is reversed.
negligence 
finding that gmac mortgage promptly corrected the errors in the plaintiffs account,the district court held that gmac mortgage could not be found to have acted willfully or wantonly for its own financial gain,and the court dismissed the plaintiffs consolidated negligence claims on summary judgment.the plaintiffs appeal.they describe their negligence claims as willful and wanton negligence or negligence based on willful or wanton misconduct.they argue that,however described,the issue of willfulness or wantonness is one for a jury and that the trial court erred in dismissing their neglige
