in this telecommunications act case the plaintiff,a landowner,was denied permission to build a wireless communications tower by the pelham,new hampshire zoning board of appeals zba or board.the federal district court,on cross motions for summary judgment,rejected the landowner claims that the zba decision was not supported by substantial evidence and the decision was an unlawful effective prohibition on the provision of wireless services.in doing so,the district court adopted a rule that so long as any carrier provides service in the area,there is never a basis for a claim that a town has effectively prohibited personal wireless service,in violation of the act,by preventing other carriers from filling a significant geographic gap in their cellular networks.this holding raises a novel and interesting question.we disagree with the district court rule,but affirm on other grounds.
second generation planned to build on its land in a telecommunications tower which would permit carriers to provide service along route,a state highway.pelham has four commercial cell towers,one approved after the zba denied second generation first variance application.pelham has six licensed,operating wireless carriers voicestream communications at t wireless sprint pcs verizon cellular and nextel communications as they are currently known.cingular wireless is not among them.second generation owns a ninety acre,heavily wooded lot at the top of seavy hill also called spaulding hill directly above a portion of route,which runs through a narrow valley between two ridges of hills.daily traffic on this portion ranges from cars,just south of route,to around cars,north of route.
two wireless carriers,at t wireless and voicestream,originally committed to use the second generation tower,but voicestream withdrew from its agreement,leaving only at t under contract.two other carriers,sprint pcs and nextel,had expressed interest in using the proposed tower.
in,second generation applied for a special exception to erect a cell tower on spaulding hill.the zoning ordinance then provided that communications towers in residential zones were a permitted use,subject to obtaining a special exception.the zoning board of appeals zba denied the request for a special exception on june.second generation appealed to the state superior court,which upheld the decision.second generation then applied to build a smaller,cell tower.
in march,the town passed a personal wireless services ordinance which authorizes the town planning board to issue conditional use permits for the construction of cell towers in a newly established telecommunications overlay zone.the overlay zone includes only areas currently zoned for industrial and commercial uses,and is separated from route by hills.a variance must be obtained from the zba to construct a tower outside the overlay zone.since second generation property is in a residential zone,it needed a variance 
in february,second generation filed a federal court complaint alleging that the ordinance violated the tca by effectively prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services,in violation of c b i ii,and unreasonably discriminating against some licensed wireless carriers,in violation of c b i i.it also brought a claim against the town under.the court issued a stay in august to allow second generation to seek a variance from the zba.
at the zba variance hearing,second generation presented testimony from its engineers one a voicestream employee,consultants one from at t,attorneys,and its general partner.representatives of at t and voicestream stated that their networks had coverage gaps on route blaine hopkins,a second generation consultant,purported to show that the presence of a cell tower has no impact on property values,and that the alleged gaps could not be serviced by existing pelham towers or new towers in the overlay zone.a second generation executive testified that the cell tower would generate less noise and traffic than would a single residence,that the surrounding topography would hide the lower part of the tower,and that research by a local appraiser confirmed that the tower would not diminish the value of surrounding properties.
numerous abutters and other pelham residents testified that the tower would interfere with their view and spoil the pristine character of the neighborhood.three abutters said that the tower would diminish property values one reported that local real estate firms had informed him that the surrounding homes would be devalued by approximately fifteen percent.a zba member,also a realtor,strongly criticized the methodology used in hopkins analysis of the impact of cell towers on property values two residents contended that the second generation property could be put to other uses for agriculture,residential development,tree harvesting,or elderly housing.one abutter and one zba member stated that they had phone service within the alleged gap.a resident also testified that the area could be largely served by a tower in a commercial zone in dracut,massachusetts.
the board voted unanimously to deny the variance on the ground that second generation failed to prove hardship as required by new hampshire law.
second generation amended its complaint to challenge the zba decision as well as the ordinance.it alleged that pelham had instituted an absolute prohibition against the construction of cell towers in residential zones,that at least four of the six licensed wireless carriers had significant coverage gaps along route,and that it would be impossible to eliminate these gaps without building a cell tower in a residential zone.the ordinance and waiver,it asserted,violated c b i by effectively prohibiting wireless service and unreasonably discriminating against the four carriers.it also added new claims that the zba waiver denial was not supported by adequate written findings or substantial evidence in the record,in violation of c b iii.second generation dropped its claim and its request for damages it now requested only that the court enjoin the town ordinance.
shortly after the zba decision,the new hampshire supreme court decided simplex technologies,town of newington,which relaxed the criteria for proving hardship in zoning board proceedings.id.at.in may,both parties filed summary judgment motions.on june,the district court remanded the case to the zba for a redetermination of hardship.
at the zba hearing on september,second generation presented testimony from two experts and two attorneys several residents again testified in opposition.the hearing yielded the following new information.the pelham planning director testified that the planning board was considering proposed subdivisions with approximately homes near the second generation tract.second generation radio frequency engineer,anthony wells,presented a propagation study purporting to show that the alleged gap could not be serviced by existing pelham towers,new towers in the overlay zone,or an existing tower in hudson,new hampshire.second generation also made a number of concessions.first,second generation experts acknowledged that the company tract was not the only site that could provide coverage in the alleged gap.second,they did not contest that a tower shorter than feet could allow a limited number of carriers to service the alleged gap.second generation executives later said that they were willing to settle,at least temporarily,for a variance to build a tower.finally,when counsel to an abutter stated that carriers in new hampshire can enter into leases along state highways,second generation acknowledged that it had not explored this option and was unsure about its effectiveness.
the zba denied the waiver in a written decision dated september,finding that second generation did not meet any of the five conditions for obtaining a waiver,and,more specifically,that second generation had failed to meet any of the three unnecessary hardship criteria.
the parties again filed for summary judgment in district court and agreed to resolve the case essentially on a basis.the court had before it the record developed as a result of the zba hearings for the effective prohibition claim,it also considered other evidence submitted by the parties in support of their motions.second generation submitted affidavits that four of the six carriers licensed to provide wireless services in pelham experienced gaps in coverage along route,but that one licensed carrier,cellular,had roaming coverage in the alleged gap via the network of cingular wireless.
on may,the district court granted pelham motion for summary judgment and denied second generation motion.second generation,town of pelham,no.civ,wl,at may.the court held that second generation did not meet its burden to show that there was a significant gap in coverage or its burden to show that the gap could not be filled by other means.it found that a gap is significant only if the area in question is not served by any carrier.id.at.the court found that cellular provided roaming service and nextel might provide regular service along the relevant portion of route.id.it noted that second generation propagation study did not consider the possibility that a carrier could obtain a waiver of the ordinance height limitation and build a taller tower in the overlay zone.id.in addition,the court observed that second generation failed to investigate whether other sites outside the overlay zone could provide the necessary service.id.the district court also held that substantial evidence supported the zba decision to deny the waiver.id.at.
the tca preserves state and local authority over the siting and construction of wireless communication facilities,subject to five exceptions specified in the act.c b see town of amherst omnipoint communications,cir.two exceptions,the substantial evidence and effective prohibition clauses,are pertinent here if a board decision is not supported by substantial evidence,c b iii,or if it effectively prohibits the provision of wireless service,c b i ii,then under the supremacy clause of the constitution,local law is in order to effectuate the tca national policy goals.
substantial evidence attack on zba decision 
second generation argues that the zba decision is not supported by substantial evidence and so is invalid.the substantial evidence test is highly deferential to the local board.see penobscot air,fed.aviation,cir.as southwestern bell mobile systems,todd,cir,explains 
the substantial evidence standard of review is the same as that traditionally applicable to a review of an administrative agency findings of fact.judicial review under this standard,even at the summary judgment stage,is narrow substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion t he possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency finding from being supported by substantial evidence.
id.at internal quotations omitted.in conducting substantial evidence review,a reviewing court normally considers only evidence contained in the administrative record,the evidence presented to the zba.see tower,llc plainville zoning bd.of appeals,cir.
in order to qualify for a variance under new hampshire law,the landowner must show that meeting the normal zoning requirements poses an unnecessary hardship.olszak town of new hampton,under new hampshire law,applicants must meet a test to establish unnecessary hardship 
a zoning restriction as applied to their property interferes with their reasonable use of the property,considering the unique setting of the property in its environment no fair and substantial relationship exists between the general purposes of the zoning ordinance and the specific restriction on the property and the variance would not injure the public or private rights of others.
simplex,at.the zba found that second generation did not meet any of the prongs.it explained that the land,given its unique setting,could reasonably be used for the residential purposes for which it was zoned and that there was a fair and substantial relationship between the ordinance and the restriction on the property because the ordinance prohibits obtrusive commercial uses from infiltrating the residential zone.
both of these determinations are amply supported by substantial evidence.there was considerable,unrebutted evidence that second generation land is well suited for developing housing and that if second generation were granted a variance,then inhabitants of the scenic view drive would look out over the top of a cell tower.the district court correctly characterized the administrative record as showing 
the area abutting the proposed tower has no towers or other commercial uses.roads in the area are not lit by street lamps.moreover,the property is located in a section of town that is prized for its spectacular views of the surrounding countryside.several of the residences that would be affected by the proposed tower have deed restrictions protecting their views.further,while only a limited number of existing residences would have a view of the tower,it is unclear whether it would also impair the views of any of the homes that are likely to be built in several proposed subdivisions in the area.
second generation,wl,at.in such a pristine residential setting,a tower would be an obtrusive commercial use.
second generation protests that this court may only look to the board statements,and not to the district court characterization.second generation confuses two different doctrines.this is not an instance in which the board is improperly attempting to justify its decision in court on different grounds than it gave in its written decision.tower,at.instead,this is simply an instance in which the district court reviewed the record developed by the board and provided more detail than did the board in its decision.that is entirely in accordance with the act.local zoning boards are lay citizen boards,and while their decisions must be in writing,the boards need not make extensive factual findings in support of their ultimate decision.bell mobile,at.the findings here are sufficient to permit judicial review,and that ends the challenge.
effective prohibition challenge 
the more difficult question is whether,on the evidence before the district court,the denial of the variance sought by the landowner constituted an unlawful effective prohibition on the provision of wireless services.see c b i ii.this in turn raises a series of issues inherent in the effective prohibition analysis,including the requirements to show an effective prohibition the contours of the significant gap formulation previously used by this court and the relevance of evidence of coverage provided by roaming service,towers in other towns,and carriers not licensed in the town.most significantly,it raises the question of the correctness of the rule adopted by the district court that if any carrier provides any coverage within a purported gap,then there can not,as a matter of law,be an effective prohibition on the provision of wireless services.we disagree with and reject any such rule,but ultimately agree with the court alternate ground for holding that there was no effective prohibition.
scope of review 
unlike the substantial evidence issue,the issue of whether the zba has prohibited or effectively prohibited the provision of wireless services is determined de novo by the district court.tower,at.the district courts are free to consider additional evidence.amherst,at.in turn,this court reviews the district court legal conclusions de novo.tower,at.if the facts had been contested before the district court,we would review the district court factual conclusions for clear error.id.if the parties had each simply moved for summary judgment,we would review the district court summary judgment conclusions de novo.see atc realty,llc town of kingston,cir.here,the parties agreed that the trial judge could resolve the issues on a basis.second generation,wl,at.accordingly we review the inferences drawn by the district court from the stated facts for clear error.see lederle parenterals,cir.in the end,we would reach the same result here regardless of which of these standards of review applied.
general standards for clause 
the rule in this circuit is that the tca clause is not restricted to blanket bans on cell towers imposed by towns.amherst,at.the clause may,at times,apply to individual zoning decisions.id.in invoking the effective prohibition language,the burden for the carrier is a heavy one to show from language or circumstances not just that this application has been rejected but that further reasonable efforts are so likely to be fruitless that it is a waste of time even to try.id.a landowner tower developer is in no better position than a carrier and has an equally heavy burden 
the tca does not itself expressly authorize local zoning boards to consider whether individual decisions amount to an effective prohibition.see c.since board actions will be invalidated by a federal court if they violate the effective prohibition provision,many boards wisely do consider the point.see,amherst,at.there appears to be nothing in new hampshire law to preclude a board from considering the issue.the zba here implicitly did so by concluding that second generation had failed to show that there were no alternative sites to build a tower that would solve whatever coverage problem existed no special deference is given to the board conclusion on this point.
this court has identified two sets of circumstances where there is a prohibition in effect.the first is where the town sets or administers criteria which are impossible for any applicant to meet.see id.at.that was the situation in national tower,which affirmed the district court finding that a permit denial constituted an effective prohibition.see at.the second involves the situation where the plaintiff existing application is the only feasible plan in that case,denial of the plaintiff application might amount to prohibiting personal wireless service.amherst,at accord sprint spectrum,willoth,cir these factors,when pertinent,should be analyzed in determining whether there is an effective prohibition.this means,of course,that there can be no general rule classifying what is an effective prohibition.it is a determination.
second generation initially attempts to show a violation of the clause by arguing that the personal wireless services ordinance restricting the location of the towers to certain districts is a blanket prohibition.that attack is meritless.the ordinance does not restrict the power to grant variances to build towers in other districts,the town has allowed four commercial towers to be constructed,and the town has not said as a categorical matter that it would never grant a variance outside the overlay zone.there is no credible claim of a blanket prohibition.
second generation then argues that the individual variance denial is an effective prohibition.the question of whether an individual denial is an effective prohibition is largely.since the effective prohibition clause is not,the importance of particular facts must be seen through the prism of the statutory language and intent.overall,the tca attempts to reconcile the goal of preserving local authority over land use with the need to facilitate nationally the growth of wireless telephone service.amherst,at.congress intended to promote a national cellular network.see also todd,at tca reflects congress intent to rapidly expand personal wireless services president statement on signing the telecommunications act of february,reprinted in federal telecommunications law a legislative history of the telecommunications act of,doc,at reams,manz,tca intended to promote universal service.the act aims to secure lower prices and better service for consumers by opening all telecommunications markets to competition.see telecommunications act of,stat,conf,at,reprinted in,thus,the act attempts to reconcile the interests of consumers and residents many of whom are themselves cell phone users.
significant gap formulation 
courts have provided a judicial gloss on the effective prohibition language of the statute in order to determine whether a coverage problem exists at all.we have concluded that a town refusal to permit a tower that is needed to fill a significant geographic gap in service,where no service at all is offered in the gap,would violate the effective prohibition clause.see tower,at accord willoth,at apt pittsburgh,at.the context in which a question arises is important.in national tower,where this circuit adopted and employed a significant gap analysis,it was undisputed that no carrier provided coverage in the geographic gap area and that the gap affected the ability of a large number of users to connect or maintain a connection,id.at.the issue addressed in national tower by the significant gap formulation,then,had to do with when a purported geographic gap,served by no carrier,is large enough in terms of physical size and number of users affected to amount to an effective prohibition,rather than being a mere,and statutorily permissible,dead spot.federal regulations contemplate that areas enjoying adequate coverage will still include spots without reliable service.see degrees communications,at b see also id.defining dead spots as s mall areas within a service area where the field strength is lower than the minimum level for reliable service.
like many legal concepts,the significant gap language used in one context is now being used by the parties to address a qualitatively different and much more complex set of problems.the parties use the phrase to frame arguments about whether an effective prohibition can exist in a geographic area where a carrier already provides some service.the ultimate question of course remains whether a given decision,ordinance,or policy amounts to an effective prohibition on the delivery of wireless services.inquiries into the existence and type of gap are merely helpful analytic tools toward that end 
consideration of services by carriers 
second generation attempts to buttress its argument by saying the coverage that does exist should be ignored and so this is actually a situation where no carrier provides coverage.the only carriers that provide coverage in the purported gap are cellular,which provides roaming service via the cingular wireless network,and cingular wireless,which is not licensed in pelham and provides service from a tower in dracut,massachusetts.
second generation raises a question of law as to whether the town or court may consider service by these carriers.in ascertaining the existence and extent of coverage for purposes of resolving an effective prohibition claim and indeed the proposed solution,we hold it permissible to consider roaming service,the coverage provided from towers in other towns,and service by carriers not licensed in the jurisdiction at issue.see cellular,at under the right conditions it may be possible to provide an adequate level of personal wireless services to a particular community solely through facilities located outside that community.accord omnipoint communications mb operations,llc town of lincoln,d.
second generation protests that this result would allow pelham to displace onto other jurisdictions the obligation to host new cell towers and would infringe the rights of carriers that purchased fcc licenses for the geographic area including pelham.both these arguments overlook the fact that licensed carriers may be able to on the same existing tower s used by carriers the argument,moreover,runs contrary to the tca emphasis on protecting the interests of consumers and residents rather than those of carriers and developers.
rejection of rule that any coverage equals no effective prohibition 
this case squarely raises the issue,which has divided the courts,of whether there can ever be an effective prohibition of personal wireless service if there is any carrier that provides coverage in the geographic gap area.the district court,following the third circuit holding in apt pittsburgh.partnership,at,adopted the rule that if any coverage is provided in the gap area by any carrier including roaming service through a tower in a different town then there can be no effective prohibition 
a flat any service equals no effective prohibition rule would say a town could refuse permits to build the towers necessary to solve any number of diff
