this appeal arises from the bureau of indian affairs bia approval of a lease of passamaquoddy tribal land to a developer who wishes to construct a liquified natural gas lng terminal in part on that land.nulankeyutmonen nkihtaqmikon nn,a group of tribe members who oppose construction of the lng terminal,and several individual tribe members collectively,plaintiffs challenge the district court dismissal of their case for lack of jurisdiction.after careful review,and based in large part on the bia change of position on appeal regarding the finality of its lease approval,we conclude that plaintiffs have standing and that their claims are ripe for review,and therefore that the district court has jurisdiction to adjudicate plaintiffs claims.we thus reverse the dismissal of this suit by the district court and remand the case for further action consistent with this opinion.
background 
quoddy bay lease 
the complicated nature of this case requires a slightly extended introduction.part of the complexity stems from the fact that neither of the litigants are parties to the lease agreement that precipitated this dispute.the lease at issue is between the pleasant point passamaquoddy reservation and quoddy bay,llc quoddy bay,a developer seeking to construct an lng terminal on tribal lands.in may,these parties formalized a ground lease agreement quoddy bay lease,which would allow quoddy bay to develop a lng terminal on a portion of tribally owned land known as split rock,pending federal approval of the project.the lease is a complex and multistage contract,contemplating four distinct phases permitting,construction,operations,and removal and remediation.the latter periods call for heavily invasive construction and operation of the lng terminal.the permitting period,however,allows only testing and surveying,necessary for obtaining federal energy regulatory commission ferc approval during this initial period,quoddy bay is limited to 
a right and license to enter upon and restrict access to the premises,at any time and from time to time,to inspect,to examine,to survey,and to conduct,soil tests,borings,installation of water monitoring wells,and other engineering,geotechnical,archaeological,and architectural tests and studies on the premises,and otherwise to do that which,in tenant reasonable discretion,is necessary to conduct due diligence,to secure permits and to determine the suitability of the premises for the lng project 
the tribal council approved the lease on may,and pursuant to the indian leasing act of leasing act,sent the lease to the bia for review.on june,the bia approved the lease at the same time,the bia issued a categorical exclusion checklist,indicating that 
lease approval is solely for the site investigation required for the ferc permitting process in the development of an environmental impact statement eis c omplete environmental analysis and eis development will be conducted through the ferc permitting process.continuing the lease beyond the investigation period is contingent upon ferc permit approval,acceptability of the eis analysis and insignificant impact on the leased property.the bia will be a cooperating agency for the eis development through ferc.
the bia determined that the site investigation fell within the definition of a categorical exclusion,such that an eis was not required prior to approval of the lease 
plaintiffs 
in opposition to the lng project,a group of private citizens banded together to form nn.nn members live on passamaquoddy tribal lands in maine,though none possess individual ownership rights in split rock.they oppose the construction of the quoddy bay lng terminal out of concern that it will fundamentally and permanently transform the split rock site from a natural beach area with historical,cultural,religious,and recreational significance,to an industrial zone that will not be accessible to the members of the group.
and individual tribe within a mile of split rock use the leased land for traditional tribal ceremonies,community events,and recreation.according to plaintiffs,split rock is the tribe only remaining community space.
procedural history 
on november,plaintiffs initiated this suit claiming that the bia approval of the quoddy bay lease violated the leasing act,the national environmental policy act of nepa,et the national historic preservation act nhpa,et the administrative procedure act apa,and the endangered species act esa,et.specifically,plaintiffs complain that the bia failed to appraise the land,to prepare an environmental assessment,to provide an opportunity for public comment,or to consider the historical,religious,and cultural significance of the leased land.plaintiffs later added a claim that,by violating the above statutes,the bia had breached the federal government fiduciary duty to indian citizens the trust obligation claim 
the bia moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,contending that plaintiffs lacked standing and that their claims were not yet ripe.on november,the district court dismissed all of plaintiffs claims,concluding that the nepa,nhpa,and trust obligation claims were not ripe and that plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the nepa,nhpa,esa,and leasing act claims nulankeyutmonen nkihtaqmikon impson,d.plaintiffs now appeal the dismissal.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court decision to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on standing and ripeness grounds.mangual,cir.the plaintiff has the burden of clearly alleging definite facts to demonstrate that jurisdiction is proper.dubois dep t of,cir.we then construe such facts and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in favor of the plaintiff.see right to life political action comm.gardner,cir.
iii.finality of lease approval 
plaintiffs ask us to forego review of the standing and ripeness issues and instead remand the case to the district court based on the bia reversal of position regarding the finality of its lease approval.plaintiffs claim that the bia argued before the district court that lease approval was limited to site investigation and was revocable upon further review by the bia,and that the district court relied heavily on these representations.on appeal,the bia concedes that its lease approval is final.it argues to the same implementation of the lease is contingent upon multiple factors,including ferc authorization,and that therefore plaintiffs alleged injuries resulting from construction of the lng terminal are too attenuated to satisfy standing and ripeness requirements.
because we review the standing and ripeness issues de novo,and because we have all the information we need to decide these issues,we see no reason to remand.we approach the standing and ripeness issues everyone the bia has completed its lease approval process and will not have another opportunity to review the lease.for purposes of our review,we also assume,as alleged by plaintiffs,that the bia has failed to meet its federal obligations with respect to the lease approval.whether or not this is true is a question on the merits of plaintiffs case,which we need not address at this stage of the proceedings 
iv.standing 
the doctrine of standing addresses whether a particular plaintiff has such a personal stake in the outcome of a controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination.baker carr,d.the core of the doctrine arises from the constitutional requirement that federal courts act only on cases or controversies.lujan defenders of wildlife,d see also const.art.iii.in addition,s tanding doctrine embraces several judicially limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction,such as the general prohibition on a litigant raising another person legal rights,the rule barring adjudication of generalized grievances more appropriately addressed in the representative branches,and the requirement that a plaintiff complaint fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.allen wright,d.we begin with the challenged constitutional elements of standing before moving on to the additional prudential concerns.
nepa,nhpa,and esa claims 
to satisfy the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing,plaintiffs must show that they have suffered an injury in fact,that the injury is fairly traceable to the bia allegedly unlawful actions,and that it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.lujan,at.internal quotation marks omitted.an injury in fact is an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.id.at.internal citations,footnote,and internal quotation marks omitted.
in cases of alleged procedural harm,however,plaintiffs receive special treatment.dubois,at internal quotation marks omitted.the person who has been accorded a procedural right to protect his concrete interests can assert that right without meeting all the normal standards for redressability and immediacy.lujan,at.for example,
one living adjacent to the site for proposed construction of a federally licensed dam has standing to challenge the licensing agency failure to prepare an environmental impact statement,even though he can not establish with any certainty that the statement will cause the license to be withheld or altered,and even though the dam will not be completed for many years.
the case before us is very similar to the above example described by the supreme court in lujan.plaintiffs allege that they have been harmed by the bia failure to follow the procedures required by nepa,nhpa,and esa before approving the quoddy bay lease bringing their claims within the procedural standing analysis.with immediacy concerns relaxed,to establish an injury in fact,plaintiffs need only show that nepa,nhpa,and esa were designed to protect some threatened concrete interest personal to plaintiffs.id.at nn.see also ashley creek phosphate norton,cir focusing on the question of whether the procedures at issue protect the plaintiff concrete interest.here,plaintiffs concrete and particularized interest is clear they not only live very near split rock,but they also use the land and surrounding waters for a variety of ceremonial and community purposes.see,lujan,at.o ne living adjacent to the site for proposed construction of a federally licensed dam has standing to challenge the licensing agency failure to prepare an environmental impact statement dubois,at finding sufficient interest where litigant regularly visited and engaged in recreational activities in the subject area see also ashley creek phosphate,at p laintiffs who use the area threatened by a proposed action or who own land near the site of a proposed action have little difficulty establishing a concrete interest.the lease constitutes a change in land use,which allegedly endangers the environment,the historic preservation of tribal land,and protected animal species in the area.the statutes in question were specifically designed to protect against these very dangers by requiring federal agencies,like the bia,to consider these dangers before taking action.see massachusetts watt,cir discussing the purposes of nepa.plaintiffs have therefore alleged a sufficient injury in fact to establish standing to pursue their procedural claims under nepa,nhpa,and esa.
the bia focuses its arguments on the causation requirement of standing.the agency characterizes plaintiffs alleged injury as the harm to split rock,and consequently,plaintiffs interests in the land,resulting from the impacts of the construction of the lng terminal.it goes on to argue that any such harms are not fairly traceable to the bia lease approval because the lng terminal can not be constructed until quoddy bay receives ferc approval,which is unpredictable sea shore sullivan,cir t he injury is not imminent because it depends upon several tenuous contingencies.this argument misapprehends the injury claimed by plaintiffs.while it is true that the potential harm to split rock,and therefore to plaintiffs,as a result of the construction of the lng terminal is not certain,the procedural injury alleged by plaintiffs has already occurred.see watt,at w hen a decision to which nepa obligations attach is made without the informed environmental consideration that nepa requires,the harm that nepa intends to prevent has been suffered.the procedures at issue seek to minimize the risk of future harm by influenc ing the decisionmaking process their aim is to make government officials notice environmental and other considerations and take them into account.id.the lease contemplates construction and operation of a lng terminal,and it is the risks posed by the implementation of the lease which the bia is required to consider under nepa,nhpa,and esa.as discussed above,plaintiffs have clearly established a demonstrable risk to their interests in split rock as a result of the bia alleged failure to adequately assess the dangers associated with the lease as required by federal law.sierra club marsh,cir t he irreparable harm consists of the added risk to the environment that takes place when governmental decisionmakers make up their minds without having before them an analysis with prior public comment of the likely effects of their decision upon the environment.
finally,plaintiffs meet the redressability requirement of article iii standing.all that is required in cases of procedural injury is some possibility that the requested relief will prompt the party to reconsider the decision that allegedly harmed the litigant.massachusetts epa,d.here,although plaintiffs can not establish with any certainty that the requested procedures will change the bia collective mind,there is at least a chance that proper consideration would convince the bia to withhold approval of the lease.
although the bia does not challenge plaintiffs prudential standing to pursue the nepa,nhpa,and esa claims on appeal,it is clear from our discussion above that the violations and injuries alleged in the complaint are the sort that these statutes were specifically designed to protect,and that plaintiffs are asserting their own interests,rather than those of third parties dubois,at internal quotation marks omitted.we accordingly find that plaintiffs have established standing to pursue their procedural claims under these statutes.
leasing act claim 
the prudential standing concern at issue here is whether plaintiffs leasing act claim fall s within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.allen,at.the zone of interest test is a guide for deciding whether,in view of congress evident intent to make agency action presumptively reviewable,a particular plaintiff should be heard to complain of a particular agency decision.clarke sec.indus.ass n,d.
we disagree with the district court conclusion that plaintiffs do not fall within the zone of interests protected by the leasing act.it is true,as the district court emphasized,that the leasing act requires federal approval when restricted indian lands,whether tribally or individually owned,are leased by the indian owners.nulankeyutmonen nkihtaqmikon,d at quoting a.the district court also agreed that plaintiffs are almost certainly correct that the leasing act was intended to protect indian tribes and their members.id.quoting san xavier dev.auth.charles,cir.but we do not read the former passage referring to indian owners to suggest that the duty owed by the bia under the leasing act is limited to the land owners regulated by the act.but see bullcreek dep t of interior,d,denying standing to tribal members with no property interest in the leased land because the act refers to indian landowners.rather,it clearly appears to us to be a limitation on the leases subject to the leasing act.
the federal government duty under the leasing act,through the bia,is to ensure that the parties to a lease of indian land have given adequate consideration to the impacts of the lease on,inter alia,neighboring lands and the environment.a.the land owners presumably have a vested interest in a lease approval,so it stands to reason that they would rarely challenge the bia failure to comply with federal law in approving the lease.congress surely intended,therefore,for other tribal members whose interests would be adversely affected by the lease impacts to complain of the agency action.see clarke,at.this conclusion is bolstered by the bia own regulations,which allow any person whose interests could be adversely affected by a decision in an appeal to request review of an agency action.see also id.allowing appeal of bia lease approvals pursuant to pt.
furthermore,t he zone of interests test is not meant to be especially demanding.clarke,at.i n particular,there need be no indication of congressional purpose to benefit the plaintiff.see also dennis higgins,d the plaintiff need only demonstrate a plausible relationship between his interest and the policies to be advanced by the relevant provision.internal quotation marks omitted.when a plaintiff is not the subject of the regulatory action,as here,prudential standing requirements may be satisfied so long as the plaintiff interests are not so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it can not reasonably be assumed that congress intended to permit the suit.id.here,plaintiffs have demonstrated,as discussed above,their concrete and particularized interest in the lands and environment surrounding split rock these interests are explicitly addressed in the leasing act as ones that the bia must consider before granting approval of the lease.they are therefore not peripheral interests.plaintiffs interests are also consistent with the statute,which was intended to protect native american interests,rosebud sioux tribe mcdivitt,cir referring to,an analog to,and to ensure that the parties to the lease have adequately considered its impacts.thus,we find that plaintiffs meet the prudential standing requirement that their interests arguably fall within the zone of interests protected by the leasing act see ass of data processing serv,camp,d the question of standing concerns,apart from the case or controversy test,the question whether the interest sought to be protected by the complainant is arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question.
trust obligation claim 
the district court also dismissed plaintiffs claim of breach of fiduciary duty to the extent that it was a separate cause of action from the leasing act claim nulankeyutmonen nkihtaqmikon,d at a generalized claim of violation of a fiduciary duty,which is not tethered to any statute or regulation,can not stand.on appeal,plaintiffs argue that the district court erred because the indian leasing act is a codification of the trust duty,citing brown united states for the proposition that t he scope and extent of the fiduciary relationship is established by the regulation s that control this type of leasing and define the contours of the united states fiduciary responsibilities,emphasis omitted quoting pawnee united states,and united states mitchell mitchell ii,d.
although the district court and the parties addressed this issue in their discussions on standing,we construe the court dismissal as one for failure to state a claim,and accordingly review de novo.see palmer champion mortgage,cir.
we agree with the district court that plaintiffs trust obligation claim can not stand alone.despite plaintiffs vague assertions to the contrary,we can find no law in support of an enforceable fiduciary duty owed by the federal government to plaintiffs qua individuals who are not landowners.as plaintiffs acknowledge,the general trust relationship between the united states and the indian people is insufficient to establish specific fiduciary duties.united states navajo nation,d.substantive statutes and regulations must expressly create a fiduciary relationship that gives rise to defined obligations.see united states white mountain apache tribe,d.brown found a fiduciary relationship between the government and indian land owners who could lease their lands only subject to the secretary approval under the leasing act precisely because the secretary was acting in part to protect the land owners financial interests,a traditional fiduciary capacity.id.at.in other cases finding enforceable fiduciary duties,too,the government had extensive management control over resources,and the duties arising from the government fiduciary responsibilities were owed to the owners of the resources being managed.compare mitchell ii,at.finding fiduciary relationship between government and indian allottees where secretary had full responsibility to manage indian resources and land for the benefit of the indians pawnee,at t he united states has a general fiduciary obligation toward the indians who own the oil and gas leases in question with respect to the management of those oil and gas leases,with united states mitchell mitchell i,d finding no fiduciary duty to indian allottees where t he act in question does not unambiguously provide that the united states has undertaken full fiduciary responsibilities as to the management of allotted lands.
here,plaintiffs are not land owners and the bia does not manage their interests in a fiduciary capacity.while plaintiffs have standing to complain of the bia failure to comply with federal law because they fall within the zone of interests protected by the leasing act,they can not claim a specific trust relationship created by the secretary general obligation to consider their interests before approving a lease.see brown,at t he statutory criteria that constrain the secretary exercise of his or her approval power are in the nature of zoning,safety,or environmental concerns,which are the traditional general welfare concerns of government when acting in a capacity.internal quotation marks omitted.
although plaintiffs have no fiduciary duty claim,their leasing act claim generally encompasses the same allegations,and the dismissal of the separate trust obligation claim in no way impairs their claimed right to the relief requested.the district court should therefore treat their references to the trust obligation as commensurate with the leasing act,which,as plaintiffs explain,derives from the general trust obligation assumed by the federal government toward the indian people.see morton mancari,d literally every piece of legislation dealing with indian tribes and reservations,and certainly all legislation dealing with the bia,are derived from historical relationships and explicitly designed to help only indians.see also seminole nation united states.under a humane and self imposed policy which has found expression in many acts of congress and numerous decisions of this court,the government has charged itself with moral obligations of the highest responsibility and trust.footnote omitted.to the extent that the trust obligation claim is one and the same as the leasing act claim,plaintiffs have established standing for the same reasons.
vi.ripeness 
whereas standing asks who may bring a claim,ripeness concerns when a claim may be brought.ass of realtors,whitehouse,cir.with respect to administrative decisions,the ripeness doctrine seeks to prevent the courts,through avoidance of premature adjudication,from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies,and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.abbott labs.gardner,d.to determine whether a particular claim is ripe,we generally evaluate the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.doe bush,cir quoting abbott,at.
plaintiffs remaining from the trust obligation that the bia failed to comply with various federal laws before approving the quoddy bay lease.these claims of procedural injury are clearly ripe under ohio forestry ass n,sierra club a person with standing who is injured by a failure to comply with statutory procedure may complain of that failure at the time the failure takes place,for the claim can never get riper,d.the bia now concedes that its approval was final,and therefore now is the appropriate time to complain that the agency failed to do its duty 
the bia argues,however,that
