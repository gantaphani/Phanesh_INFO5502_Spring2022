the state of south dakota,city of oacoma,and lyman county collectively referred to as the state appeal from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the department of the interior the department,upholding the secretary of the interior decision to use his authority based on section of the indian reorganization act ira,to take certain land into trust for the lower brule sioux tribe.we affirm.
in,the lower brule sioux tribe sought to have acres of land that it had purchased taken into trust.the land is located within the municipal limits of the city of oacoma,some seven or eight miles south of the tribe reservation and adjacent to interstate near exit.the department approved its request,and the interior board of indian appeals dismissed the resulting appeal.the state filed a claim in the district court,seeking review of the secretary action and contending that was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.the district court concluded that the statute was constitutional,but held that it was without jurisdiction to review the remaining claims and dismissed the case.this court reversed,finding that constituted an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.we concluded that the department had interpreted its own power too broadly and was exercising that power in an unchecked manner because it had also interpreted the statute as delegating unreviewable discretionary authority to the secretary.south dakota united states dep t of the interior,cir south dakota i.the department promulgated a new regulation that provided for judicial review,b,and then petitioned for writ of certiorari,asking that the united states supreme court vacate our decision and remand the case to the department.the supreme court granted the writ and vacated the judgment,directing that the matter be remanded to the secretary of the interior for reconsideration of his administrative decision,dep t of the interior south dakota,d south dakota ii,in light of the new regulation allowing for judicial review.some seven months later,the department removed the land from trust status.
in,the tribe submitted an amended application to the secretary,requesting that the united states take the land into trust on the tribe behalf.the tribe submitted a business plan describing its intent to use the land for a cultural center and tourist attraction that would draw tourists to further explore the south dakota native american scenic byway state app.app.the bureau of indian affairs bia gave notice to state,county,and city officials,requesting information and comments.the state responded by raising the following objections the statute unconstitutionally delegated legislative authority the tribe had not shown its need for the land to be taken into trust a significant loss in state revenue and numerous jurisdictional problems would result if the land were taken into trust the distance between the land and the reservation counseled against the acquisition and the land would likely be used for gaming purposes.the city and county separately objected by alleging that the taking of the land into trust could stifle the growth of the community and affect its income.
in its may,response to the objections,the tribe asserted that it would benefit from having the land held in trust because of the resulting significant federal protections that would facilitate the growth of tribal industry and would assure the tribe future generations the continued use of the land.the tribe also asserted that because the tribe planned use of the land would result in increased tourism,the local governments would suffer no significant revenue loss.the response confirmed that the tribe business plan detailed its specific intentions for the land and stated that the tribe would not use the land for gaming.
the secretary evaluated the application in accordance with the department regulations,basing his conclusion on the information provided by the parties involved and on internal recommendations from various levels within the department.the secretary concluded that it would be appropriate to take the land into trust and published notice in the federal register.
the state again filed suit in federal court to challenge the agency action the suit was delayed for the completion of an environmental assessment in accordance with the national environmental policy act,after which the secretary ratified his decision,finding that taking the land into trust would have no significant impact on the quality of the human environment.the state amended its complaint and filed a motion to supplement the administrative record to provide support for its claim that the tribe in fact intended to use the land for gaming purposes.the district court denied the motion to supplement the record,finding that the record adequately reflected the facts and concluding that the plaintiffs had not shown bad faith or improper behavior sufficient to justify supplementation.the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court granted the department motion,once again finding to be constitutional and holding that the decision to grant trust status was not arbitrary or capricious.south dakota united states dep t of the interior,d south dakota iii.it concluded that the secretary decision satisfactorily addressed all relevant criteria in its regulations.id.at.

the state first claims that because does not delineate any boundaries governing the executive decision to acquire land in trust for indians,it constitutes an unlawful delegation of legislative power in violation of article,section,of the constitution all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a congress of the united states.congress may delegate its legislative power if it lay s down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to act is directed to conform.hampton,united states.the supreme court has given congress wide latitude in meeting the intelligible principle requirement,recognizing that congress simply can not do its job absent an ability to delegate power under broad general directives.mistretta united states,d.
the supreme court has struck down statutes on delegation grounds on only two occasions.panama refining ryan.schechter poultry united states.the statutes at issue in those cases were promulgated in a unique political climate and delegated to the president exceptionally broad control over the national economy.section c of the national industrial recovery act,invalidated in panama refining,gave the president blanket authority to prohibit transportation of petroleum neither its language nor its context provided any criteria to guide the president or required any specific findings before he acted.at.section of the national industrial recovery act,struck down in schechter poultry,authorized the president to prescribe and approve mandatory codes of fair competition for various industries without additional congressional approval.at.the court warned that congress can not delegate legislative power to the president to exercise an unfettered discretion to make whatever laws he thinks may be needed or advisable for the rehabilitation and expansion of trade or industry.id.at.
since,however,the court has given narrow constructions to statutory delegations that might otherwise be thought to be unconstitutional.mistretta,at.the court has almost never felt qualified to congress regarding the permissible degree of policy judgment that can be left to those executing or applying the law.whitman am.trucking ass ns,d quotation omitted.the court has made such narrow constructions by rejecting overly broad interpretations of certain words and giving the words content by their surroundings.id.at.the court has found an intelligible principle,although admittedly broad,even when an act simply stated that an agency should promulgate regulations encouraging the effective use of radio in the public interest,convenience,or necessity,noting that the meaning of public interest was limited in light of the larger aim of the act.broad.united states.broad phrases of purpose in an act are not utterly without meaning when viewed in the light of the purpose of the act,its factual background and the statutory context in which the phrases of purpose appear.am.power light securities exch.comm n.
congress fails to give sufficient guidance in its delegations only if it would be impossible in a proper proceeding to ascertain whether the will of congress has been obeyed.yakus united states.its will is sufficiently articulated if congress clearly delineates the general policy,the public agency which is to apply it,and the boundaries of this delegated authority.am.power,at.the statute does not have to provide a determinate criterion for the exercise of the delegated power,as long as a policy is articulated.whitman,at.
the ira delegation of authority is set forth as follows 
the secretary of the interior is hereby authorized,in his discretion,to acquire through purchase,relinquishment,gift,exchange,or assignment,any interest in lands,water rights,or surface rights to lands,within or without existing reservations,including trust or otherwise restricted allotments whether the allottee be living or deceased,for the purpose of providing land for indians.
section also authorizes the allocation of up to two million dollars each fiscal year for that purpose.id.the state argues that provides no practical boundaries to the secretary authority and that the statute purposes are so broad that they could be construed to justify almost any land acquisition.
as indicated above,we previously found to be unconstitutional,south dakota i,concluding that the statutory language contained no perceptible boundaries,no intelligible principles,id.at,a fact that,together with the broad agency interpretation,created an agency fiefdom whose boundaries were never established by congress,and whose exercise of unrestrained power is free of judicial review.id.at.judge murphy dissented,stating that the court had unnecessarily reached the constitutional issue instead of reaching the merits of the state administrative procedure act apa claim.id.at.she also concluded that the statute contained boundaries sufficient to bring it within the broad range of acceptable delegations because the statute was confined in scope,its text,when viewed in its historical context,limited the secretary discretion,and its legislative history revealed its purposes.id.at.
because the supreme court vacated our opinion,we are not bound by its conclusion accordingly,we reexamine the broader context of the act to determine whether the delegation in includes guidance sufficient to withstand a challenge based upon nondelegation doctrine grounds.we may look solely to the language and the context of the statute in determining its constitutionality and may not consider any particular agency interpretation as determinative in our constitutional inquiry see whitman,at.stating that w e have never suggested that an agency can cure an unlawful delegation of legislative power by adopting in its discretion a limiting construction of the statute.whether the agency is reasonably applying its delegated power is an inquiry distinct from the question whether the delegation contains sufficient guidance to pass constitutional muster.we will,if possible,give narrow constructions to statutory delegations,mistretta,at,and then proceed to evaluate the agency action under the apa.
we conclude that the purposes evident in the whole of the ira and its legislative history sufficiently narrow the delegation and guide the secretary discretion in deciding when to take land into trust.the ira,enacted in,reflected a new policy of the federal government and aimed to put a halt to the loss of tribal lands through allotment.it gave the secretary of the interior power to create new reservations,and tribes were encouraged to revitalize their mescalero apache tribe jones,d see also chase mcmasters,cir highlighting that the various sections of the act all reflected the purpose of ensuring protection of indian lands.
the tenth and the first circuits have both found that does not violate the nondelegation doctrine.united states roberts,cir carcieri norton,cir.in roberts,the tenth circuit cited judge murphy dissent and concluded that the statute places adequate limits on the secretary discretion,namely,the requirement that the land be acquired for indians,the limitation on authorized funds,and the goals identified in the legislative history.at see also carcieri,at adopting the roberts court reasoning.
we agree with the views expressed by judge murphy in her dissent in south dakota i the scope of the power conferred in is broad,the powers conferred in panama refining and schechter does not involve granting to the executive authority to unilaterally enact a sweeping regulatory scheme that will affect the entire national economy.we believe that it is possible to ascertain whether the will of congress has been obeyed when examining an application of the secretary authority under based upon the guidance in the ira and its legislative history.see yakus,at.
the language of itself provides guidance.as judge murphy stated 
it directs that any land acquired must be for indians as they are defined in.it authorizes the appropriation of a limited amount of funds with which land could be acquired and specifically prohibits use of such funds to acquire land for the navajo indians outside of their established reservation boundaries in arizona and new mexico.
south dakota i,at murphy,dissenting.the state argues that these claimed textual limitations are artificial because any acquisition could be seen as for indians,regardless of who else it harms.likewise,because most of the land currently taken into trust has been previously purchased by a tribe,the limit on appropriated funds for purchasing land is irrelevant.we disagree that these limitations were meaningless when the ira was enacted,and we conclude that the context of the entire act and its legislative history continue to give meaning to the phrase for the purpose of providing land for indians.
the legislative history of the ira indicates that t he intent and purpose of the reorganization act was to rehabilitate the indian economic life and to give him a chance to develop the initiative destroyed by a century of oppression and paternalism.mescalero apache tribe,at.quoting,at.numerous sections in the act itself and in its legislative history indicate that congress believed that a critical aspect of that broad goal was to conserve and develop indian lands and resources,at the first phrase included in the title of the bill,at same.the act includes six sections addressed to land policy.providing means to preserve and increase the amount of indian lands.representative howard,the sponsor of the bill in the house of representatives,described the tremendous loss of land that resulted from the government allotment policy,begun in,cong.rec,and indicated that the act would help remedy the problem by preventing any further loss of indian lands and permitting the purchase of additional lands for landless indians.id.at see also cong.rec.june,statement of senator wheeler,sponsor of the bill in the senate,echoing the remedial goals in relation to indian lands.
congress believed that additional land was essential for the economic advancement and of the indian communities,at stating that section would meet the needs of landless indians and of indian individuals and tribes whose land holdings are insufficient for,at noting that the purchase of lands would help t o make many of the now pauperized,landless indians cong.rec.statement of howard that section would provide land for indians who have no land or insufficient land,and who can use land beneficially.although the legislative history frequently mentions landless indians,we do not believe that congress intended to limit its broadly stated purposes of economic advancement and additional lands for indians to situations involving landless indians.the house and senate reports imply that members of congress believed that that would be the most common application of the land to landless indians would enable them to farm or work in stock grazing or forestry the statutory language and the expressions of purpose for section in the reports indicate that congress placed primary emphasis on the needs of individuals and tribes for land and the likelihood that the land would be beneficially used to increase indian.see,at cong.rec.statement of howard that a goal is to build up indian land holdings until there is sufficient land for all indians who will beneficially use it 
accordingly,we conclude that an intelligible principle exists in the statutory phrase for the purpose of providing land for indians when it is viewed in the statutory and historical context of the ira.the statutory aims of providing lands sufficient to enable indians to achieve and ameliorating the damage resulting from the prior allotment policy sufficiently narrow the discretionary authority granted to the department.we therefore affirm the grant of summary judgment for the department on the nondelegation doctrine challenge.
we turn,then,to a review of the secretary action approving the taking of the acres into trust.we review the agency action under the apa.when reviewing the district court opinion upholding the administrative agency decision,this court must render an independent decision on the basis of the same administrative record as that before the district court.united states massey,cir.we will set aside the agency action if the secretary acted in a manner that is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.when we apply an agency regulation,we accord substantial deference to an agency interpretation of its own regulation,unless the regulation violates the constitution or a federal statute,or unless the interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.coalition for fair equitable,at.
as the reviewing court,we engage in a substantial inquiry,based on an examination of the administrative record,in order to answer three questions whether the secretary acted within the scope of his authority,citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors,id.at.and whether the secretary follow ed the necessary procedural requirements.id.at.here,the secretary acted within the scope of his authority,for,as quoted above,specifically authorizes the secretary to take land into trust for indians.the more relevant questions on review are whether he considered the relevant factors and followed the necessary procedural requirements.
we are to make a searching inquiry into the facts,examining the full administrative record,but we do not substitute our judgment for that of the agency,south dakota ubbelohde,cir,even if the evidence would have also supported the opposite conclusion.harrod glickman,cir.we ask whether the agency articulate d a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.ubbelohde,at quoting bowman,freight,d see also motor vehicle mfrs.ass of the united states,state farm mut.auto.ins,d stating that an agency must cogently explain why it has exercised its discretion in a given manner.we will not try to identify failures in clarity or detail,state farm,at,and will reverse only when there is no rational basis for the policy choice.ubbelohde,at.in other words,the agency need not exhaustively analyze every factor,but must base its determination upon factors listed in the appropriate regulations and must use a reasonable interpretation of the regulation and the statute in reaching its conclusion.harrod,at.the burden is on the plaintiff to prove that the agency action was arbitrary and capricious.massey,at.
the state challenges the adequacy of the department consideration of several of the required factors.in order to meet its burden of proof,however,it must present evidence that the agency did not consider a particular factor it may not simply point to the end result and argue generally that it is incorrect.the regulations established by the department to implement the ira are binding,and they establish the process that the secretary must follow in deciding whether to take land into trust,and,thereby guiding our inquiry.
for an acquisition,described in,the secretary must consider all but one of the factors in considerations for acquisitions plus three additional considerations.the state claims that the following criteria in were not properly considered 
b the need of the individual indian or the tribe for additional land 
c the purposes for which the land will be used 
e if the land to be acquired is in unrestricted fee status,the impact on the state and its political subdivisions resulting from the removal of the land from the tax rolls 
f jurisdictional problems and potential conflicts of land use which may arise.
the state also argues that b was not adequately analyzed.this provision states 
b the location of the land relative to state boundaries,and its distance from the boundaries of the tribe reservation,shall be considered as follows as the distance between the tribe reservation and the land to be acquired increases,the secretary shall give greater scrutiny to the tribe justification of anticipated benefits from the acquisition 
the record reveals that the department extensively reviewed the tribe application and the objections raised in the state response.in light of the complex history of the case,the secretary final decision was issued by the assistant secretary of indian affairs rather than by the bia regional director.the regional director had recommended final approval,stating that the tribe would greatly benefit economically and setting forth a brief review of each of the relevant provisions in and.app.the acting deputy commissioner of indian affairs noted several deficiencies in the application and asked the regional director for a more detailed analysis of several factors.id.at.the regional director submitted another memorandum and reconfirmed her recommendation.id.at.the director of the office of trust responsibilities,through the deputy commissioner of indian affairs,then provided a memorandum in support of the assistant secretary decision to take the land into trust that included a detailed analysis of the factors in the regulations.id.at.
we conclude that the secretary reasonably and appropriately evaluated the relevant factors.the agency articulate d a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made,ubbelohde,at quotation omitted,for each of the regulatory provisions,and we do not require precise explanations that respond to every contention.the record supports the conclusion that the expressed rationale in the secretary conclusions was consistent with the facts.
in analyzing the tribe need for the additional land,b,the regional director expressed her belief that the particular tract of land would greatly enhance the tribe economic base and its ability to be,thereby serving the purposes of the ira.app.the memorandum accompanying the final decision also emphasized that the tribe had great need for additional income and stated that t he location of the land,adjacent to interstate,makes it more attractive to business and would enhance the tribes sic economic rehabilitation and support self sufficiency.id.at.the tribe asserted that the protections of trust status were essential to facilitate growth in tribal industry and ensure the use of the land for future generations.id.at.we agree with the district court that it would be an unreasonable interpretation of b to require the secretary to detail specifically why trust status is more beneficial than fee status in the particular circumstance.south dakota iii,d at.it was sufficient for the department analysis to express the tribe needs and conclude generally that ira purposes were served.its conclusion that the tribe needed the
