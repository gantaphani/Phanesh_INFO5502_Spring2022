the kroger company appeals the district court affirmance of the regional airport authority of louisville and jefferson county decision to partially reimburse kroger for relocation expenses under the uniform relocation assistance and real property acquisition policy act of ura,west supp.kroger contends that the district court applied the incorrect standard of review,that kroger was inappropriately denied an evidentiary hearing,and that the denial of certain expenses was unsupported by the record.we affirm.
in,the regional airport authority,a entity implementing a relocation program pursuant to the ura,purchased kroger crittenden drive property for million.as a result,kroger moved its distribution center operations to a new facility and applied for over million in relocation benefits.the raa approved.this appeal involves an additional to which kroger alleges it is entitled.
kroger continues to seek reimbursement for seven items permits and licenses management wages dixie costs and product move to peyton trailer rental forklift expense and equipment rental telephone and data cabling and consulting fees.the raa denied these expenditures either because they were ineligible expenses,in excess of the reasonable and necessary amount,or submitted without sufficient documentation.
before making this determination,the raa met with kroger several times,permitted kroger to amend its claim twice,and reviewed volumes of material submitted in support of the application.the raa determination contained two detailed tables a cost comparison that illustrated where the raa evaluation differed from kroger and a summary of the claim for relocation expenses,which listed the reasons why particular expenses were approved or denied.
kroger administratively appealed this determination to the raa general manager,robert michael.in addition to reviewing the existing documentation,michael considered kroger oral presentation and a written position statement.he informed kroger that it was free to supplement the record with additional materials or legal authorities,but kroger did not do so.in june,michael affirmed the raa determination.
kroger sought review of the raa determination at the district court.as an initial matter,the court found that the raa did not err in denying kroger request for an evidentiary hearing,and that the determination was subject to the arbitrary or capricious standard of review.later,the district court granted raa motion for summary judgment on all categories of expenses except four at the parties request,those issues were remanded to the raa for further development of the administrative record.when the matter returned,the district court affirmed the raa subsequent determination to deny relocation expenses for the remaining issues.
kroger here contends that the district court erred by not reviewing the raa determination de novo or for substantial evidence,by affirming the raa denial of an evidentiary hearing,and by affirming the raa denial of full reimbursement for the challenged seven items.
standard of review 
kroger contends that the district court erred when it declined to review the raa administrative determination de novo or for substantial evidence.kroger is incorrect.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,using the same standard to review the raa actions as the district court.see clark portage county,ohio,cir.agency actions involving relocation assistance under the ura are subject to judicial review under the administrative procedure act,et.west supp.see nagi united states,cir see also cape ann united states,cir supreme oil metro.transp,cir ackerley communications of florida,henderson,cir.thus,review of the raa denial of relocation benefits is under the narrow standard set forth in the apa we may set aside the raa findings,conclusions,or actions only if they were arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with the law.a see supreme oil,at nagi,at.
t he focal point for judicial review should be the administrative record already in existence,not some new record made initially in the reviewing court.camp pitts,d.even were the raa determination unsupported by the record,the proper remedy would be to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation,because t he reviewing court is not generally empowered to conduct a de novo inquiry into the matter being reviewed and to reach its own conclusions based on such an inquiry.florida power light lorion,d.
the district court properly applied the arbitrary or capricious standard of review,rejected de novo review,and remanded any issues for which the record was incompletely developed.d e novo review is appropriate only where there are inadequate factfinding procedures in an adjudicatory proceeding,or where judicial proceedings are brought to enforce certain administrative actions.camp,at.neither situation applies here.the proceeding before the district court was not brought to enforce the raa determination,and the only reasonable deficiency suggested in the administrative proceedings is that the raa inadequately supported its decision.kroger was permitted to submit enormous amounts of material,meet multiple times with raa officials,amend its claim twice,and supplement the record in any way it saw fit.there was no deficiency in the factfinding procedures that would warrant a de novo hearing in this matter.
for the first time on appeal,kroger presents an issue of first impression in our circuit whether an agency denial of relocation benefits under the ura should also be examined for substantial evidence under e.section e provides that a reviewing court shall set aside those agency determinations found to be unsupported by substantial evidence in a case subject to sections and of this title or otherwise reviewed on the record of an agency hearing provided by statute.the supreme court has noted that the arbitrary or capricious provision in a and the substantial evidence standard in e are separate standards,and that it would be consistent to find one violated while the other is not.see bowman transp.freight,d citizens to preserve overton park volpe,d,abrogated on other grounds by califano sanders,d.
because no hearing is provided by the ura for relocation benefit claims and and are inapplicable,neither the ura nor the apa require a court to apply the substantial evidence standard see starke secretary,dep t of housing,see also cape ann,at applying only the arbitrary or capricious standard of a in review of denied ura relocation benefits.compare camp,at.i t is also clear that neither the national bank act nor the apa requires the comptroller to hold a hearing or to make formal findings on the hearing record when passing on applications for new banking authorities t he proper standard for judicial review of the comptroller adjudications is not the substantial evidence test which is appropriate when reviewing findings made on a hearing record.citation omitted,with bowman,at.noting that arbitrary or capricious and substantial evidence standards applied to formal agency hearing involving an order of the interstate commerce commission.the district court did not err by not examining the raa determination under the substantial evidence test.
denial of an evidentiary hearing 
kroger contends that the raa and the district court violated the ura,the apa,and the due process clause by not holding an evidentiary hearing.kroger is incorrect.
the apa requires hearings only where an adjudication is required by the appropriate substantive statute.see,florida power light,at.the apa specifically contemplates judicial review on the basis of the agency record compiled in the course of informal agency action in which a hearing has not occurred.the ura states only that the head of an agency must establish regulations to ensure that a person whose claim for benefits is not approved in full may have the denial reviewed by the head of the agency having authority over the applicable program or project.b emphasis added.in promulgating the relevant ura regulations,the united states department of transportation acknowledged an agency broad discretion to determine its
