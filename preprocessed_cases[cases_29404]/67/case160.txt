this case raises first amendment questions about limiting the participation of at a new england town meeting.
miriam and thomas curnin,who own property but are not registered to vote in the town of egremont,massachusetts,appeal from the district court refusal to grant a preliminary injunction mandating that they be permitted to speak at egremont town meeting.the curnins contend that the town meeting is a designated public forum and egremont policy of permitting like themselves,who own property and pay taxes but are not town meeting members,to speak only at the discretion of the town meeting and its moderator violates their first amendment rights.
we hold that forum analysis is inapposite because the town meeting is a legislative body in deliberation.the curnins are not registered to vote in egremont and therefore are not town meeting legislators.the first amendment does not give the right to speak at meetings of deliberating legislative bodies,regardless of whether they own property or pay taxes.
we also reject the curnins arguments that egremont has engaged in viewpoint discrimination and that the first amendment is violated by the discretion vested in the town meeting moderator to recognize speakers,including individuals not members of the town meeting.we affirm the district court denial of a preliminary injunction.
the new england town meeting is a special form of government dating back to the colonial era and often considered an exemplar of pure democracy.see tilden,town government.

egremont is a small town in western massachusetts that employs an open town meeting,not a representative town meeting,as its legislative body.as of,it had a population of,with registered voters.
egremont bylaws supplement the state requirements by providing that all warrants be posted in at least four public places within the town at least fourteen days before the town meeting is scheduled to occur if a special town meeting is called,the selectmen must place a synopsis of the warrant in the local newspaper at least fourteen days before the meeting.sixty voters must be present at town meeting in order for a quorum to exist.
egremont current moderator,thomas gage,has adopted a policy of separating voters from by giving voters colored placards.under a previous moderator,were seated in a separate section of the room.unless constrained by a contrary vote of the town meeting members,the moderator has the discretion to determine whether who wish to speak may do so.the moderator follows the rules of order set forth in town meeting time.for example,if there is an appropriate motion to call the vote,there is no further discussion before the vote.thus,even the right of town meeting members to speak is qualified.
the curnins own a house and pay taxes on it and approximately acres of land in egremont,but they are not registered to vote there.they also have a residence in larchmont,new york,where they are registered to vote.
the curnins point to three specific town meetings at which they assert they were prevented from speaking on issues important to them as taxpayers.at the beginning of a special town meeting to consider a proposed sewer project on may,a motion was made to allow to speak.this motion failed by a vote of to.the sewer proposal was defeated,in a quick succession of motions,without any discussion or debate by either voters or.
at the annual town meeting on may,thomas curnin and another rose to speak on a proposal to amend the town zoning laws to limit new commercial space to square feet.moderator gage told the other who wished to speak to wait and that he would be considered later.at that point,town meeting members called for a vote on the zoning law amendment there were no further comments from either voters or.
at a special town meeting on june,voters considered whether to spend on a new fire truck for the town.curnin asserts that he wanted to speak about the propriety of the bid the town received for the truck,although he does not seem to have made his desire to speak known.moderator gage called for a vote regarding the purchase of the truck after asking two voters who were about to leave to delay their exit because a quorum would not exist without them.
on may,the curnins sought declaratory and injunctive relief in federal district court under,claiming that egremont policy of not permitting who own property and pay taxes to speak at town meetings violates their rights under the first and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution and similar provisions of the massachusetts constitution 
on april,the curnins filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to force egremont to permit them to speak at its annual town meeting on may.the district court denied the injunction in an oral opinion issued on april.the district court emphasized that it did not see how the ownership of property and the payment of taxes gives someone who is a nonvoting member of the town a status equal to voting members when it comes to speaking at town meetings.the district court also expressed skepticism about the curnins arguments that egremont engages in viewpoint discrimination by allowing voters but not to speak and that the discretion in the moderator to decide when a can speak creates a first amendment violation.this timely appeal followed.
although the may town meeting has now passed,egremont policy has not changed,nor has the curnins desire to speak at future town meetings.
we review the denial of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion,cir.there are no questions of fact in dispute,so the only issues are ones of law.
the district court correctly considered four factors in determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction the likelihood of success on the merits the potential for irreparable harm if the injunction is denied the balance of relevant impositions,the hardship to the nonmovant if enjoined as contrasted with the hardship to the movant if no injunction issues and the effect if any of the court ruling on the public interest.bl a ck tea soc y city of boston,cir quoting charlesbank equity fund ii blinds to go,cir internal q
