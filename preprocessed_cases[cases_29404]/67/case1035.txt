plaintiff marys foundry appeals from an order awarding summary judgment to defendant employers insurance of wausau,after plaintiff filed a complaint in federal diversity jurisdiction under for declaratory judgment pursuant to,seeking a declaration that it was entitled to insurance coverage for lost income following a warehouse fire.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court order.
plaintiff is located in marys,ohio,and manufactures metal castings for customers in a wide variety of industries.the castings range in size from to pounds,and plaintiff makes them by pouring molten iron into sand molds.the sand molds are formed from wood patterns.each pattern is custom made to produce a particular casting.plaintiff can not manufacture castings without patterns.the patterns plaintiff uses to make castings are owned by plaintiff customers.consistent with industry practice,plaintiff stores the patterns when not using them.plaintiff stored approximately patterns in a warehouse known as the pattern storage warehouse.
on february,defendant issued business property policy the policy to plaintiff providing insurance coverage for various interests including the pattern storage warehouse.the policy provided coverage for plaintiff property interests during the period from february,to february.as drafted and issued by defendant,the policy provided separate units of insurance for separate property interests,including coverage for real property,personal property,loss of income,additional expense,and equipment breakdown.the unit has terms set forth in separate coverage forms.
the policy begins with a declarations section which sets forth the total annual premium along with the policy limits and deductibles.immediately following the declarations are the separate coverage forms.the loss of income form provides,in pertinent part 
we will pay for 
loss of income or,
necessary expenses which you incur to resume,or to maintain your ability to resume,normal operations,not exceeding the amount by which your loss of income is reduced 
that you sustain during a period of recovery,resulting from a covered loss,up to the limit of liability shown on the declarations.
at emphasis in original.under the policy,covered loss means a loss to covered property at a covered location resulting from a peril insured against.the policy also includes a property not covered endorsement pnc endorsement,which expressly excludes coverage for patterns,dyes,and molds not owned by plaintiff.the pnc endorsement,however,modifies only the personal property form.
on april,a fire destroyed the pattern storage warehouse.as a result,plaintiff suffered a loss of income in excess of.plaintiff concedes that the policy does not cover the value of its customers patterns,but claims entitlement to coverage for its business losses that resulted from the loss of the patterns.
when defendant disagreed with plaintiff theory of coverage,plaintiff filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in ohio auglaize county court of common pleas seeking a declaration that it was entitled to coverage for lost income.pursuant to and,defendant removed the action to the united states district court for the northern district of ohio.
both parties filed cross motions for summary judgment on the issue of plaintiff coverage for loss of income under the policy.on september,the district court denied plaintiff motion and granted defendant.
on october,plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
we review summary judgment de novo.eastman kodak image technical,d johnson econ.dev,cir buckeye cmty.hope found.city of cuyhaoga falls,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact such that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.kocsis,cir.the supreme court restated the framework governing motions for summary judgment in a series of cases anderson liberty lobby,d celotex catrett,d and matsushita electrical industrial zenith radio,d.in anderson liberty lobby,the supreme court explained that 
t he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff position will be insufficient there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.the judge inquiry,therefore,unavoidably asks whether reasonable jurors could find by a preponderance of evidence that the plaintiff is entitled to a verdict.
d.the mere possibility of a factual dispute can not create a triable case.gregg,cir.to avoid summary judgment,the plaintiff must come forward with more persuasive evidence to support his or her claim than would otherwise be necessary.matsushita,at.if the defendant successfully demonstrates,after a reasonable period of discovery,that the plaintiff can not produce sufficient evidence beyond the bare allegations of the complaint to support an essential element of his or her case,summary judgment is warranted.celotex,at.when determining whether to reach this conclusion,we draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the party.adickes kress,d williams int l paper,cir smith thornburg,cir.
in ohio,normal rules of contract construction apply to the interpretation of insurance policies.weiss paul fire marine ins,cir.ohio courts first determine whether contract terms are ambiguous.united ins.sst fitness,cir.a term is ambiguous if it is reasonably susceptible of more than one meaning.weiss,at citing king nationwide ins,ohio.if the terms of the contract are unambiguous the court determines the meaning of the contract.nationwide mut.fire ins.guman.farm,ohio.ohio courts give the terms of the contract their plain and natural meaning.burdett oxygen employers surplus lines ins,cir essex house paul fire marine ins.following ohio law,we must give meaning to every paragraph,clause,phrase,and word.affiliated fm ins.fiberglas,cir.finally,we can not look to evidence outside of the policy where the contract is clear and unambiguous.kelly med.life ins,ohio.
when an insurance policy includes ambiguous exclusions,a general presumption arises to the effect that that which is not clearly excluded from the operation of such contract is included in the operation thereof.moorman prudential ins.of,ohio,quoting home indem.plymouth,ohio.the exclusion must be stated clearly in explicit wording setting forth with specificity exactly what is to be excluded.river servs.hartford accident indem,citing am.fin.fireman fund ins,ohio.the insurer,being the one who selects the language in the contract,must be specific in its use an exclusion from liability must be clear and exact in order to be given effect.lane grange mut,ohio.as we explained in burdett 
the basis of this rule is that the formulates the insurance contract and proffers it to the insured for the ostensible benefit of the insured in the event of a responsible for the language employed.furthermore,the purpose of the contract being to provide insurance coverage,an interpretation of doubtful terms which construes the language to provide such coverage tends to effectuate the presumed good faith intent of the contracting parties.
burdett,at.for these reasons,the insurer,not the insured,bears the burden of proving the applicability of an exclusion in its policy.cont l ins.louis marx,ohio.courts should not,however,construe an insurance contract against the insurer in the absence of ambiguity in its language.karabin state auto.mut.ins,ohio,see also king,at holding that only if provisions in an insurance contract are open to more than one interpretation should it be construed strictly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured.
to restate the applicable law simply we use ordinary principles of contract interpretation to determine whether an exclusion in an insurance policy is ambiguous.if the exclusion is ambiguous,we construe it in favor of affording coverage to the insured.
plaintiff argues that the pnc endorsement,which excludes coverage for patterns,only modifies the personal property form.it does not,under plaintiff theory,modify the loss of income form,which would mean that loss of income due to the destruction of the patterns is covered by the loss of income form.
