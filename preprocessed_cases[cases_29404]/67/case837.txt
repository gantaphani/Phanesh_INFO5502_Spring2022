in this property dispute,each of the plaintiffs collectively,the landowners owns a parcel of land in jackson or victoria county,texas,subject to a railroad referred to as the victoria segment of the rosenberg line.the landowners sought a judgment declaring that the portion of the victoria segment that abuts their land reverted to them as a matter of law after southern pacific transportation company southern pacific,the former owner of the line,allegedly abandoned it.the district court dismissed for want of subject matter jurisdiction.we affirm.
southern pacific sought permission to abandon the victoria segment in by filing a notice of exemption with the interstate commerce commission icc asserting that no local traffic had moved over the line during the previous two years the notice of exemption became effective on december,subject to a public use condition,imposed by the icc,pursuant to prohibiting southern pacific from disposing of the property for days to permit interested parties to acquire it for public purposes.
in,southern pacific entered into unsuccessful negotiations with another rail carrier regarding a possible sale of the entire rosenberg line.later that year,the gulf coast rural rail transportation district gulf coast,a consortium of governmental entities and businesses,attempted to purchase or lease the victoria segment from southern pacific to preserve rail service,but the parties could not come to an agreement on price.
having failed to reach an agreement,but determined to prevent southern pacific from removing the tracks,gulf coast filed a petition in state court seeking to condemn the victoria segment and requesting a temporary restraining order and temporary injunction.after the state court granted the temporary restraining order,southern pacific removed the matter to federal court and sought to quash the state court temporary restraining order.gulf coast opposed the relief sought by southern pacific and requested the federal court to issue a temporary injunction.
on august,the district court granted a preliminary injunction in favor of gulf coast enjoining southern pacific from removing tracks along the victoria segment.in granting the preliminary injunction,the district court found that southern pacific clearly expressed its intent to permanently abandon the rail line from el campo to victoria and that southern pacific consummated its abandonment of the rail line.as a result,the district court concluded that the icc no longer exercises jurisdiction over the rail line.
in april,while the gulf coast suit was pending,southern pacific filed a letter with the icc reporting that the texas parks and wildlife department had expressed an interest in acquiring the victoria segment for and interim trail use purposes,pursuant to the national trails act,d in a decision and order issued on may,the icc reopened the abandonment proceeding and issued a notice of interim trail use nitu the nitu extended the effective date of the notice of exemption for days,to november,thereby deferring southern pacific authority to abandon the line and permitting negotiations for possible and interim trail use to continue through that date.
in an effort to permit continued negotiations between the texas parks and wildlife department and southern pacific,the negotiation period was extended on two more occasions,first on november,by a decision of the icc,and second on may,by a decision of the stb.the final negotiation period expired on november,without an agreement.
between and,southern pacific and union pacific had been engaged in negotiations to merge.the stb approved the merger on august,and union pacific succeeded to southern pacific ownership interest in the rosenberg line.
in,texas mexican and union pacific entered into negotiations regarding the sale of the rosenberg line.in november,union pacific and texas mexican executed a contract whereby texas mexican agreed to purchase the line from union pacific on the express condition that the stb issue a decision determining that the victoria segment remained subject to the stb jurisdiction and authorizing the sale.
texas mexican thus petitioned the stb in august to determine whether the victoria segment was subject to the stb jurisdiction and to authorize the sale.on december,the stb issued a decision granting texas mexican petition,stating its conclusion that it still retained jurisdiction over the line,and approving the sale.in march,texas mexican purchased the line from union pacific for.
in may,the landowners filed separate declaratory judgment actions against texas mexican in state court in jackson county and victoria county.the landowners sought judgments declaring that the railroad at issue the victoria segment was abandoned as a matter of law by southern pacific and that the stb no longer exercises jurisdiction over the line.texas mexican removed the actions to federal court on the basis of a federal question,whether there had been an abandonment and a resulting termination of federal agency jurisdiction the actions were consolidated.
both sides moved for summary judgment.the landowners moved for partial summary judgment,contending that southern pacific had abandoned the victoria segment as a matter of law as early as,and,consequently,the stb had been improperly exercising jurisdiction over the victoria segment.to that end,the landowners maintained that the district court findings of fact and conclusions of law in the gulf coast,its finding that southern pacific had consummated the abandonment of the victoria segment,and its conclusion that the icc no longer had jurisdiction over the entitled to preclusive effect in their declaratory judgment action.
texas mexican moved for summary judgment,claiming that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the stb retained exclusive and plenary jurisdiction to determine whether the victoria segment had been abandoned and the landowners declaratory judgment action was an improper collateral attack on the stb december,decision approving the sale of the rosenberg line from union pacific to texas mexican.
in october,the district court denied the landowners partial summary judgment motion and granted texas mexican summary judgment motion,thereby dismissing the landowners suit for want of subject matter jurisdiction.in so doing,the court refused to give preclusive effect to its prior decision in the gulf coast suit,finding that it was limited to the issues surrounding the application for a temporary injunction and was thus not reached after a final hearing on the merits.
in a thorough opinion,the court determined that the conditional nature of the abandonment exemption granted southern pacific by the icc was dispositive it held that when an abandonment exemption is conditional,the stb retains jurisdiction over a railroad until it has been abandoned pursuant to the conditions established by the agency and,in such cases,the agency retains exclusive and plenary jurisdiction to determine whether there has been an abandonment sufficient to terminate its jurisdiction.
because the original exemption granted to southern pacific was conditional,the district concluded that the stb retained exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether southern pacific or its successors in interest ever consummated the abandonment of the victoria segment.moreover,the court characterized the landowners suit as an improper collateral attack on icc and stb decisions precluded by the hobbs act,which vests federal courts of appeals with exclusive jurisdiction to review all final stb orders.
the landowners contend that because the precise issue whether southern pacific consummated the abandonment of the railway,thereby terminating stb jurisdiction over the decided in the gulf coast temporary injunction proceeding,that finding is entitled to preclusive effect.this plea for collateral estoppel is unavailing.
collateral estoppel vel non is a question of law reviewed de novo.baby dolls topless saloons,city of dallas,cir.where a party seeks to employ collateral estoppel offensively,however,a court has broad discretion to determine whether relitigation of an issue should be precluded.see,parklane hosiery shore,d.we thus review the district court refusal to offensively apply collateral estoppel only for abuse of the broad discretion afforded it.winters diamond shamrock chem,cir citing copeland merrill lynch,cir.
to determine whether collateral estoppel applies,we consider whether 
the issue under consideration is identical to that litigated in the prior action the issue was fully and vigorously litigated in the prior action the issue was necessary to support the judgment in the prior case and there is any special circumstance that would make it unfair to apply the doctrine.
winters,at quoting copeland,at.we have set out several other safeguards that must be present before estoppel may be employed.id.as relevant here,first among these additional safeguards is a requirement that the facts and the legal standard used to assess them are the same in both proceedings.id.quoting copeland,at.second,we inquire whether a new determination of the issue is warranted by differences in the quality of extensiveness of the procedures followed in the two courts.id.quoting copeland,at quoting restatement second of judgments.third,we regard the availability of judicial review of the first proceeding as being of paramount importance to the issue of preclusion.id.at 
the district court can hardly be said to have abused its discretion by deciding that its finding in the gulf coast suit was not entitled to preclusive effect.not only was the abandonment finding entered only ten days after gulf coast sued southern pacific,but it was made under the legal standard applicable to issuance of a temporary,a substantial likelihood of success on the merits in light of a substantial threat of irreparable injury.thus,the abandonment finding can not be said to have been fully and vigorously litigated in the prior action,nor was the question of abandonment assessed under the same legal standard as would be applicable on a direct petition for review of an order of the stb 
moreover,the prior abandonment finding was not subject to judicial review.the district court august,order granting the temporary injunction,which incorporated the court findings of fact and conclusions of law,never went into effect because gulf coast failed to post the bond required as a prerequisite southern pacific thus had neither the incentive to appeal because the judgment never went into effect nor the ability to appeal because the order was not final.because we have treated finality and the concomitant availability of judicial review as an essential predicate to issue preclusion this fact alone is sufficient to reject the landowners preclusion argument.
accordingly,given,inter alia,the temporary and limited treatment the issue of abandonment received in the gulf coast suit preliminary injunction proceeding,the legal standard applied in that proceeding,and the unavailability of judicial review,the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to give preclusive effect to its abandonment finding.
putting aside the question of estoppel,we now consider anew the district court conclusion that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to determine whether southern pacific or its successors in interest ever consummated the abandonment of the line.we conclude that because the abandonment authorization initially granted by the icc was conditional,the stb retained exclusive and plenary jurisdiction to determine whether there has been an abandonment sufficient to terminate its jurisdiction.accordingly,the district court properly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the landowners suit alleging that,as a matter of law,southern pacific consummated the abandonment of the victoria segment.
although the district court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the landowners suit,it did not dismiss the suit under.b rather,it dismissed for want of jurisdiction by granting texas mexican summary judgment motion.in any event,the distinction is ultimately of little consequence for purposes of this appeal,because w e review dismissals for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and grants of summary judgment de novo.hager nationsbank,cir per curiam 
once a rail carrier abandons a line,the line is no longer part of the national transportation system,and the stb jurisdiction terminates.see preseault,at.thus,in proceedings in which the stb imposes no conditions on an abandonment,the stb decision to authorize the abandonment will end its jurisdiction over the line 
in contrast,where an abandonment is conditional,the stb retains jurisdiction over a railroad until it has been abandoned pursuant to the conditions imposed by the agency.see lucas,at.in such cases,the agency also retains exclusive,plenary jurisdiction to determine whether there has been an abandonment sufficient to terminate its jurisdiction.lucas,at citing friends of the trail,at.
there is no dispute that southern pacific authority to abandon the victoria segment was expressly conditioned in several respects by the icc decision granting its notice of exemption first,the icc imposed a public use condition to enable any state or local government agency or other interested person to negotiate the acquisition of the line for public use.second,the icc required southern pacific to consult with the texas natural heritage program prior to initiating any salvage activities on this line.third,the icc required that southern pacific consult with the army corps of engineering concerning future flood prevention measures prior to initiating any salvage activities on the line.and fourth,the icc prohibited southern pacific from altering the historic integrity of a portion of the line until completion of the national historic preservation act review process.
because southern pacific abandonment authorization was conditional,the district court correctly determined that the stb retained exclusive and plenary jurisdiction over the line to determine whether there has been an abandonment sufficient to terminate its jurisdiction.see id.consequently,the court correctly concluded that it did not have jurisdiction to decide whether southern pacific or its successors in interest abandoned the line.
the landowners do not directly dispute any of the foregoing.instead,they contend that southern pacific abandonment was automatically consummated,as a matter of law,when no agreement was reached on interim trail use within the initial period imposed by the icc,thus depriving the agency of further jurisdiction over the and allowing the landowners reversionary interests to vest.according to this theory,the agency order of may,reopening the victoria segment abandonment proceeding and postponing the abandonment exemption effective date for days to allow for further interim trail use negotiations,was for naught,because the agency no longer had jurisdiction over the line the same was true for its november,and may,decisions further postponing the effective date,and the stb december,decision approving the sale of the line to texas mexican.
it is not disputed that under stb regulations a nitu,such as the one issued here or a citu in nonexempt abandonment proceedings,converts into an effective certificate of abandonment if no trail use agreement is reached during the period allotted for negotiation but from this proposition the landowners infer that abandonment is consummated as a matter of thus agency jurisdiction no interim trail use agreement is reached upon expiration of a nitu.this,however,is incorrect.
the relevant stb regulation states that expiration of a nitu will permit a railroad fully to abandon the line,therefore indicating that an effective certificate of abandonment authorizes,but does not itself establish,complete consummation of the abandonment thus,an effective certificate of abandonment confers permissive authority on the railroad until the railroad actually consummates an abandonment,none occurs,and the commission retains jurisdiction over the railroad.birt,at emphasis added.the landowners claim that agency jurisdiction was automatically terminated upon expiration of the initial public use negotiation period is,therefore,c
