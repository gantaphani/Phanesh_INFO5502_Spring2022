background 
in,painter point development company limited partnership painter point began construction of a hotel and condominium resort on a tract of land located on the shores of lake hamilton in hot springs,arkansas.painter point commonly owned the hotel property and resort property until,when it conveyed the resort property to the lakeshore resort yacht club limited partnership lakeshore lp.painter point continued to construct a hotel on the tract of land surrounding the resort property.
in june,lakeshore lp started lakeshore,a project organized pursuant to the provisions of the arkansas act,ann.to the act.contemporaneous with its organization of the project,lakeshore lp reached a license agreement with painter point that allowed individual purchasers of lakeshore units to use hotel parking,as well as the recreational amenities contemplated in the operation of the hotel.
the lakeshore project had to be registered with,and accepted by,the arkansas real estate commission the commission before interests could be sold to prospective buyers.see ann.a,b.lakeshore lp filed an application for registration containing the public offering statement required by the act,see id.at a,and a document entitled horizontal property regime,master deed and bylaws for lakeshore resort and yacht club.
the master deed referred to the purchasers rights to use hotel amenities by stating that 
t he developer is presently contemplating construction of certain recreational facilities on property owned by the developer adjacent to the property described in exhibit a.the of this regime shall have the right to use said recreational facilities jointly with other property regimes established or to be established by the developer or such other persons who are licenses or guests of the developer.emphasis added.
the public offering statement referred to the hotel license agreement but the agreement itself was not included with lakeshore lp application to the commission.by letter dated july,the commission accepted the lakeshore application conditioned upon the submission of the licensing agreement referred to in the public offering statement that is intended to insure use of hotel amenities by the purchaser.
lakeshore lp submitted the license agreement to the commission,but it was not accepted.in a letter dated august,the commission stated 
the licensing agreement was not accepted as written t he licensing agreement must be drafted so that the agreement can not be voided or cancelled by either the lakeshore developer or the hotel owner.the agreement should be drafted so that it will be in existence as long as the program exists,to insure the promised use of the amenities by interval purchasers.
the commission accepted the application only after a revised irrevocable license agreement was submitted.
following registration,lakeshore lp began marketing interests to the named plaintiffs and other members of the class.each purchase was memorialized by a warranty deed that incorporated by reference the lakeshore resort master deed and by laws,and gave the purchasers a interest in the resort until noon on the first friday of the year.
a sales brochure given to the plaintiffs represented that a s a lakeshore owner all of the facilities at the hotel are yours to use and enjoy.in addition,during the application process with the commission,lakeshore lp represented that the license agreement with the hotel provid es for the continued use of all amenities and parking facilities of the resort by the timeshare owners of lakeshore resort and yacht club.nei stipulated that representations made during the application process were corroborated by oral representations made by sales agents to individual purchasers.
nei also stipulated that representations were made that purchasers would receive standard utilities in exchange for paying annual maintenance fees.finally,nei stipulated that the plaintiffs decisions to purchase interests were based upon the express representations regarding the continued use of the hotel amenities,and that plaintiffs would not have purchased their interests absent the continued use of the hotel amenities.
the hotel honored the terms of the license agreement for the first seven or eight years of each plaintiff contemplated year interest in the project.lakeshore also provided utilities,such as sewer and water,via the hotel property in exchange for annual maintenance fees.problems arose,however,after a series of changes in the financing and ownership of both the lakeshore and hotel properties.
lakeshore lp transferred its interests in the lakeshore property to hansen,hooper hayes,hhh in august.hhh then executed a note and mortgage in favor of independence federal savings loan independence with the lakeshore property pledged as collateral.in,independence went into receivership,and the resolution trust corporation rtc was appointed as receiver.hhh subsequently defaulted on the note and the rtc started foreclosure proceedings against the lakeshore property.in october,nei purchased the note and mortgage from the rtc,and then purchased the lakeshore property itself following a foreclosure sale in may.for present purposes,then,nei stood in the shoes of lakeshore lp as owner of the lakeshore property 
the hotel property also experienced a series of changes.the original developer painter point defaulted on its financing.the lender,union planter,initiated foreclosure proceedings against the hotel in november.union planter purchased the hotel following a foreclosure sale in september.in december,union planter sold the hotel property to robert and shannon fewell.in april,the fewells conveyed the hotel to their own corporation,lake hamilton resort.for present purposes,then,we have referred to lake hamilton resort,as the hotel.
before nei purchased lakeshore note and mortgage,the hotel managed the interests in the lakeshore property pursuant to an agreement with the rtc.the hotel collected revenues,paid expenses,then split the profits with the rtc,all the time honoring the license agreement that provided owners with access to hotel amenities and parking.
after nei became involved,the hotel began negotiating with nei to buy lakeshore note and mortgage.the hotel offered,based in part upon its belief that it was not legally required to honor the license agreement.the hotel stated that 
lakeshore is a very unusual piece of property and is of little value to anyone other than the owner of the hotel.as you know,the condos have many problems that affect their market value.the condos have no parking nor any property for parking to be added.the utilities are furnished by the hotel and could be disconnected.there is no legal requirement for the hotel to provide either parking or utility services.also,without access to the hotel recreation amenities swimming pools,marina,there would be little reason to stay in the condos.
nei responded by demanding for the sale of lakeshore note and mortgage,based in part upon nei belief that the hotel was legally obligated to honor the license agreement.nei stated that 
w hile we recognize that there may be some perceived concerns surrounding parking and utility access,and recreational amenities,we believe your best interests would not be served by disconnecting,or refusing access to these services for the time being.at minimum,such action could be construed as a violation of the timeshare holders entitlements,as set forth in a memorandum of agreement which was recorded along with the original sale and follows along the chain of title for this property.
on november,the hotel rejected the,calling it totally.the hotel considered itself under no legal obligation to provide any services,parking or hotel facilities to any resident or timeshare holder.on december,the hotel advised the individual owners that all utilities provided to lakeshore via the hotel property would be disconnected,and that owners would no longer have access to hotel amenities and parking.the lakeshore units have been unusable ever since.
nei purchased the lakeshore note and mortgage itself in may,then promptly filed suit against the hotel in garland county chancery court to enforce the irrevocable license agreement.in august,following trial,the state court directed entry of judgment for the hotel.the court concluded that the license agreement was a mere license and created no other interest in the hotel property that the license agreement purported irrevocable nature did not survive the hotel foreclosure and that lakeshore owners had only an easement of necessity for ingress and egress over the hotel property.
procedural history 
in november,after nei unsuccessful attempt to enforce the license agreement against the hotel,the plaintiffs initiated the instant class against nei in state court.count i of the complaint alleged that the denial of access to hotel amenities and parking constituted a breach of their contracts with the initial developer,and that nei assumed the obligations of the initial developer pursuant to of the act count ii alleged that the initial developer misrepresented that the estates would include access to hotel amenities and parking,and again alleged that nei was responsible for the initial developer obligations pursuant to the act.as to both counts,the plaintiffs alleged that they had no adequate remedy at law,and in the alternative asked for equitable rescission of the remaining portion of their estates,and a corresponding partial refund of their respective purchase prices.
nei removed the action to federal court,and then filed a complaint against the hotel regarding the license agreement.nei also moved for summary judgment claiming that the plaintiffs claims were barred by the doctrine expressed in,duhme fdic,and its statutory counterpart,e,due to nei status as the foreclosure sale purchaser of an asset acquired by the rtc.the district court dismissed nei complaint against the hotel,but granted nei summary judgment motion.we reversed and remanded after concluding that the claims were not barred by the doctrine.see kessler,cir.
on remand,the parties submitted the case to the district court on stipulated facts and an agreed documentary record.the court entered judgment in favor of nei,concluding that nei was not liable as a successor and that,in any event,the initial developer was not liable for breach of contract or misrepresentation constructive fraud.plaintiffs appeal nei challenging the prior dismissal of nei complaint against the hotel.we dismissed nei because it should have been pursued when plaintiffs brought their first appeal.see kessler,cir.we now address the remaining issues raised by the plaintiffs.
discussion 
standard of review 
the district court granted summary judgment after the case was submitted to it on a stipulated record without trial.therefore,de novo is the proper standard of review.see am.civil liberties union city of florissant,cir discussing standard of review for a case submitted on a stipulated record turner iowa fire equipment,cir discussing standard of review for a district court grant of summary judgment.
ii.nei liability for the developer obligations 
because the plaintiffs seek a partial equitable rescission of their original purchase contracts,a critical threshold question is whether nei can be held liable for the initial developer alleged breaches of contract misrepresentations.the plaintiffs assert that of the act provides that nei is liable for all obligations of the initial developer.alternatively,the plaintiffs contend that nei either expressly or impliedly assumed the developer obligations under common law principles of corporate successor liability.
the district court determined that nei succeeded only to the property interests conveyed in the may foreclosure sale,and that those property interests did not include the initial developer obligations to provide utilities,and access to hotel amenities and parking.the district court further determined that of the act refers only to the transfer of the developer obligation to perform certain functions,not to a transfer of all obligations of the initial developer.
we disagree.we conclude that means what it says.any transfer of the developer interest in the program to any third person shall be subject to the obligations of the developer.the statute does not limit the obligations transferred to certain functions.instead,the statute refers to all of the developer obligations vis a vis the individual owners.
our interpretation of is hardly novel.in a separate state court proceeding brought against nei by lakeshore owners charles and mickie rea presided over by the same garland county chancery court that decided the license agreement dispute,the court held that nei was liable for the misrepresentations of the original developer pursuant to the provisions of the act.that decision was affirmed by the arkansas supreme court on procedural grounds,without addressing the merits.see,rea.
though the arkansas supreme court has not had occasion to address the meaning of,that provision is derived from a model act adopted verbatim by several other states.see iowa code ann.ann.see also guam code ann.
one state,tennessee,has addressed precisely the question at stake here do the initial developer obligations transfer to a third party by operation of the act as the result of a foreclosure sale.state heath.in heath,the tennessee attorney general sued to prevent the foreclosure of certain unsold units in a program,unless at the time of the foreclosure sale the rights of all purchasers were specifically recognized and preserved.see heath,at.the court held that 
t hese provisions of the act referring to a transfer of the developer interest are to protect a consumer from what actually transpired in this case,foreclosure by lender that extinguishes the rights of the purchaser.while the statute does not forbid foreclosure,it requires any foreclosure to take into account the purchasers of the interest.
the court noted that the legislature intended to give purchasers a remedy against both the developer lender and the third party to whom the developer interest is sold,because a is a good sign that any remedy against the developer itself would be meaningless 
section states that any third party to whom the developer interest is transferred shall be subject to the developer obligation even if,arguendo,the bank was not required to comply with section when the agreement was made,the bank as transferee would assume the obligations of compliance once the developer defaulted.
the overriding purpose of the act is to protect consumers.regulatory,civil and criminal remedies are provided.to hold that a civil remedy against a lender or other transferee is inapplicable would defeat the legislative intent.ordinarily,a developer defaults on a note because it has no money to pay its obligation.to conclude that the legislature intended to limit the consumer civil remedies to an action for damages against the developer under section would be a meaningless gesture.
the instant case is indistinguishable from heath for all material purposes.in both cases,the original developer defaulted,the lender foreclosed,and a third party purchased or intended to purchase the developer interest at the foreclosure sale.under the reasoning in heath,mandates that nei shall be subject to the obligations of the developer.
florida has also enacted a provision in its act that serves the same purpose as of the arkansas act,though the statutory language is not identical.see.stat.ann.in bell rdi resort servs,so d,the court held that the florida legislature intended that subsequent participants in the operation of a project could be held liable for alleged misrepresentations made by the original developer.see bell,so d at see also smith of bus,so d financier who accepted assignment of unsold units as collateral for balance of loan to developer was subject to statute requiring developer to honor rights of purchasers.
our interpretation of is thus consistent with the nature of projects,and the unique obligations that arise from the development and creation of such projects.the developer sells not only an interest in real property,but an interest in time.the regime is meaningless unless the purchasers continued interests in the project are protected.thus,when a developer interests in the project are transferred to a third party,the transferee must acquire not only the interest in the property,but also all the other obligations of the developer with respect to the regime 
iii.statute of limitations 
the second question we must address is whether the plaintiffs cause of action is.the district court addressed both the general statute of limitations for breach of contract claims found at ann.b,and the general statute of limitations for constructive fraud claims found at ann,and concluded that the plaintiffs claims were not barred under either statute.
we agree with the district court conclusion,but not with its reasoning.having determined that nei may be subject to liability for the original developer obligations pursuant to the arkansas act,we conclude that act statute of limitations governs this action.see shelton fiser,holding that,under arkansas law,a specific statute of limitations involving the particular subject matter governs over more general statutes.
the act actually contains two separate statutes of limitations.the first applies to proceedings where the accuracy of the public offering statement or validity of any contract or purchase is in issue and a rescission of the contract or damages is sought.ann.emphasis added.in such a situation,suit must be commenced within four years of the date of the contract of purchase.id.
the second limitation period applies to proceedings with respect to the enforcement of provisions in the contract of purchase which require the continued furnishing of services and the reciprocal payments to be made by the purchaser.suit must be commenced within four years for each breach.id.this second limitation period can be shortened to two years by agreement of the parties.see id 
the plaintiffs initiated this suit on november.the plaintiffs entered their contracts of purchase more than four years earlier,so this action is barred if the first limitation period applies.however,the first breach of contract requiring the continued furnishing of services did not occur until december,when the hotel terminated lakeshore utilities and access to hotel amenities and parking.the plaintiffs filed this action within four years of that date,so this action is timely if the second limitation period applies.
the plaintiffs do not challenge the accuracy of the public offering statement,or the validity of any contracts of purchase.instead,their claims are based on provisions in the contract which require the continued furnishing of services that is,access to the hotel amenities and parking,as well as the continued furnishing of utilities.due to nei unsuccessful attempt to enforce the license agreement,nei is legally incapable of actually furnishing the described services.thus,the plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law and are entitled,in the alternative,to pursue a claim for equitable rescission.see strout realty.burghoff.we do not believe that this equitable remedy,sought in lieu of actual contract enforcement,equates to the type of rescission claim contemplated by the first limitation period set forth in.the plaintiffs suit is more appropriately viewed as an attempt to enforce contract provisions that require the continued furnishing of services,services for which the plaintiffs made reciprocal payments consideration for the original contract payments,or ongoing annual maintenance fees,with equitable relief sought in lieu of an adequate remedy at law.thus,we hold that this action is governed by the second statute of limitation set forth in,and is therefore timely.
having determined that nei may be liable for the obligations of the initial developer,and that the statute of limitations is satisfied,we turn now to the merits of plaintiffs claim.plaintiffs contend that the initial developer made misrepresentations regarding the owners continued access to hotel amenities and parking.
under arkansas law,a buyer of property may be entitled to rescind the purchase contract if the purchase was induced by constructive fraud.constructive fraud may be found in the absence of actual fraud 
to rescind a contract based upon fraud,it is not necessary that actual fraud exist.it is well settled that representations are construed to be fraudulent when made by one who either knows the assurances to be false or else not knowing the verity asserts them to be true neither actual dishonesty of purpose nor intent to deceive is an element of constructive fraud.
lane rachel,emphasis in original see also south county,first west.loan,describing constructive fraud as the making of misrepresentations by one who,not knowing whether they are true or not,asserts them to be true without knowledge of their falsity and without moral guilt or evil intent cardiac thoracic vascular surgery,profit sharing trust bond,holding that a cause of action for constructive fraud will lie even when the misrepresentations were made innocently,and their false nature is not discovered until well after the representations are made.to establish constructive fraud under arkansas law,the misrepresentation must be material.see scollard scollard.
in this case,the material nature of the misrepresentation is satisfied by nei stipulation that the plaintiffs would not have purchased their interests without access to the hotel amenities and parking.the question remains,however,whether the developer represented that the plaintiffs would enjoy permanent access to the hotel parking,utilities,and recreational amenities throughout the life of the interests.we conclude that the developer made those representations.
we find persuasive the fact that the arkansas real estate commission reviewed the public offering statement and master deed,and concluded that those documents promised the use of the amenities by interval purchasers.we find even more persuasive the fact that the commission would not accept the lakeshore application until the license agreement referenced in the public offering statement was amended to purportedly provide owners with permanent access to the licensed amenities.the commission demanded a license agreement that was drafted so that it will be in existence as long as the program exists,to insure the promised use of the amenities by interval purchasers.emphasis added.the developer responded with an amended license agreement representing that it provid es for the continued use of all amenities and parking facilities of the resort by the timeshare owners of lakeshore resort and yacht club.nei subsequent stipulation,that this representation was later corroborated by oral representations made to individual purchasers by the developer sales agents,is the linchpin in support of our conclusion that the developer represented to plaintiffs that they would have permanent access to the hotel amenities and parking 
conclusion 
nei assumed the obligations of the original developer pursuant to of the arkansas act.this suit,brought pursuant to that act,is timely.the original developer misrepresented the plaintiffs right to continued access to hotel amenities and parking.therefore,the plaintiffs are entitled to equitable relief in the form of partial rescission.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the district court,and remand for calculation of damages.
