the federal national mortgage association fannie mae is a federally chartered corporation that participates in the secondary mortgage market.by statute,fannie mae has the power to sue and to be sued,and to complain and to defend,in any court of competent jurisdiction,state or federal.a.when petitioners beverly ann and her daughter crystal lightfoot filed suit in state court alleging deficiencies in the refinancing,foreclosure,and sale of their home,fannie mae removed the case to federal court,relying on its clause as the basis for jurisdiction.the district court denied a motion to remand the case to state court and later entered judgment against petitioners.the ninth circuit affirmed.in concluding that the district court had jurisdiction under fannie mae clause,the court relied on american nat.red cross,which it read as establishing a rule that when a clause in a federal charter expressly authorizes suit in federal court,it confers jurisdiction on the federal courts.
held fannie mae clause does not grant federal courts jurisdiction over all cases involving fannie mae.
a this court has addressed the jurisdictional reach of clauses in five federal charters.three clauses were held to grant jurisdiction osborn bank of united states,wheat,duhme fdic,american nat.red cross,while two were found wanting bank of united states deveaux,cranch bankers trust texas pacific.describing the earlier decisions as this court best efforts at divining congressional intent retrospectively,at,the court in red cross concluded that those decisions support the rule that a congressional charter sue and be sued provision may be read to confer federal court jurisdiction if,but only if,it specifically mentions the federal courts,at.
in specifically mentioning the federal courts,fannie mae clause resembles the three clauses this court has held confer jurisdiction.but unlike those clauses,fannie mae clause adds the qualification any court of competent jurisdiction,a.thus,the outcome here turns on the meaning of court of competent jurisdiction.
a court of competent jurisdiction is a court with the power to adjudicate the case before it,black law dictionary,and a court jurisdiction defines its power to hear cases,see steel citizens for better environment.it follows that a court of competent jurisdiction is a court with a grant of jurisdiction covering the case before it.this court has understood that phrase as a reference to a court with an existing source of jurisdiction.see,ex parte phenix ins.on this understanding,fannie mae clause is most naturally read not to grant federal courts jurisdiction over all cases involving fannie mae but to permit suit in any state or federal court already endowed with jurisdiction.
red cross does not require a different result.it did not set out a rule that an express reference to the federal courts suffices to make a clause a grant of federal jurisdiction.rather,it restated the basic rule of deveaux and osborn that a clause conferring only a general right to sue does not grant jurisdiction to the federal courts,at.
b fannie mae arguments against reading its clause as merely capacity conferring are unpersuasive.its alternative readings of court of competent jurisdiction are premised on the already rejected reading of red cross.the prior construction canon of statutory interpretation does not apply because none of the cases on which fannie mae relies suggest that congress in would have surveyed the jurisprudential landscape and necessarily concluded that the courts had already settled the question whether a clause containing the phrase court of competent jurisdiction confers jurisdiction on the federal courts.finally,fannie mae appeals to congressional purpose do not call into question the plain text reading of its clause.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court.
the corporate charter of the federal national mortgage association,known as fannie mae,authorizes fannie mae to sue and to be sued,and to complain and to defend,in any court of competent jurisdiction,state or federal.a.this case presents the question whether this clause grants federal district courts jurisdiction over cases involving fannie mae.we hold that it does not.
during the great depression,the federal government worked to stabilize and strengthen the residential mortgage market.among other things,it took steps to increase liquidity reasonably available funding in the mortgage market.these efforts included the creation of the federal home loan banks,which provide credit to member institutions to finance affordable housing and economic development projects,and the federal housing administration fha,which insures residential mortgages.see of housing and urban development,background and history of the federal national mortgage association.
also as part of these efforts,title iii of the national housing act act authorized the administrator of the newly created fha to establish national mortgage associations that could purchase and sell certain first mortgages and such other first liens and borrow money for such purposes.a,stat.the associations were endowed with certain powers,including the power to sue and be sued,complain and defend,in any court of law or equity,state or federal.c,at.
in,the fha administrator exercised that authority and chartered the federal national mortgage association.avoiding a mouthful of an acronym fnma,it went by fannie mae.see,washington post,july,fanny may times,fannie mae as originally chartered,fannie mae was wholly owned by the federal government and had three objectives to establish a market for first mortgages covering new housing construction,to facilitate the construction and financing of economically sound rental housing projects,and to make the bonds it issued available to investors.fed.nat.mortgage.information regarding the activities of the circular.
fannie mae was rechartered in.housing act of act,stat.no longer wholly government owned,fannie mae had mixed ownership private shareholders held its common stock and the department of the treasury held its preferred stock.the act required the secretary of the treasury to allow fannie mae to repurchase that stock.see,at.it expected that fannie mae would repurchase all of its preferred stock and that legislation would then be enacted to turn fannie mae over to the private stockholders.from then on,fannie mae duties would be carried out by a privately owned and privately financed corporation.at.along with these structural changes,the act replaced fannie mae initial set of powers with a more detailed list.in doing so,it revised the clause to give fannie mae the power to sue and to be sued,and to complain and to defend,in any court of competent jurisdiction,state or federal.at.
in,fannie mae became fully privately owned and relinquished part of its portfolio to its new spinoff,the government national mortgage association known as ginnie mae.see housing and urban development act of act,stat.fannie mae continue d to operate the secondary market operations but became a private corporation.ginnie mae remain ed in the government and took over the special assistance functions and management and liquidating functions.ibid.ginnie mae received the same set of powers as fannie mae.see a see also act,z,stat.minor revisions to a.
this general structure remains in place.fannie mae continues to participate in the secondary mortgage market.it purchases mortgages that meet its eligibility criteria,packages them into securities,and sells those securities to investors,and it invests in securities itself.one of those mortgage purchases led to fannie mae entanglement in this case.
beverly ann refinanced her mortgage with cendant mortgage corporation cendant in the summer of.fannie mae then bought the mortgage,while cendant continued to service it.unable to make her payments,pursued a forbearance arrangement with cendant.no agreement materialized,and the home entered foreclosure.around this time,cendant repurchased the mortgage from fannie mae because it did not meet fannie mae credit standards.
to stave off the foreclosure,and her daughter,crystal lightfoot,pursued bankruptcy and transferred the property between themselves.these efforts failed,and the home was sold at a trustee sale in.the two then took to the courts to try to undo the foreclosure and sale.
after two unsuccessful federal suits,the pair filed this suit in state court.they alleged that deficiencies in the refinancing,foreclosure,and sale of their home entitled them to relief against fannie mae.their claims against other defendants are not relevant here.
fannie mae removed the case to federal court under a,which permits a defendant to remove from state to federal court any civil action over which the federal district courts have original jurisdiction.it relied on its clause as the basis for jurisdiction.the district court denied a motion to remand the case to state court.
the district court then dismissed the claims against fannie mae on claim preclusion grounds.after a series of motions,rulings,and appeals not related to the issue here,the district court entered final judgment.and lightfoot immediately moved to set aside the judgment under federal rule of civil procedure b,alleging fraud upon the court.app.the district court denied the motion.
the ninth circuit affirmed the dismissal of the case and the denial of the rule b motion.fed.appx.after and lightfoot sought rehearing,the ninth circuit withdrew its opinion and ordered briefing on the question whether the district court had jurisdiction over the case under fannie mae clause.
a divided panel affirmed the district court judgment.the majority relied on american nat.red cross.it read that decision to have established a rule that resolves this case when a clause in a federal charter expressly authorizes suit in federal courts,it confers jurisdiction on the federal courts,at.the dissent instead read red cross as setting out only a default rule that provides a starting point for the analysis.at opinion of stein.it read any court of competent jurisdiction in fannie mae clause to overcome that default rule by requiring an independent source for jurisdiction in cases involving fannie mae.ibid.

we granted certiorari,and now reverse.
fannie mae clause authorizes it to sue and to be sued,and to complain and to defend,in any court of competent jurisdiction,state or federal.a.as in other federal corporate charters,this language serves the uncontroversial function of clarifying fannie mae capacity to bring suit and to be sued.see bank of united states deveaux,cranch.the question here is whether fannie mae clause goes further and grants federal courts jurisdiction over all cases involving fannie mae.
in answering this question,we do not face a clean slate.red cross,at.this court has addressed the jurisdictional reach of clauses in five federal charters.three clauses were held to grant jurisdiction,while two were found wanting.
the first discussion of clauses came in a pair of opinions by chief justice marshall.the charter of the first bank of the united states allowed it to sue and be sued,plead and be impleaded,answer and be answered,defend and be defended,in courts of record,or any other place whatsoever.deveaux,cranch,at.another provision allowed suits in federal court against certain bank officials,suggesting the right to sue does not imply a right to sue in the courts of the union,unless it be expressed.at.in light of this language,the court held that the first bank of the united states had no right to sue in the federal courts.ibid.the court concluded that the second bank of the united states was not similarly disabled.its charter allowed it to sue and be sued,plead and be impleaded,answer and be answered,defend and be defended,in all state courts having competent jurisdiction,and in any circuit court of the united states.osborn bank of united states,wheat.the court took from deveaux that a general capacity in the bank to sue,without mentioning the courts of the union,may not give a right to sue in those courts.at.by contrast,the second bank charter did grant jurisdiction to the federal circuit courts because it used words expressly conferring a right to sue in those courts.ibid.
a mortgage dispute between a railroad and its creditor led to the next consideration of this issue.the texas and pacific railway company federal charter authorized it to sue and be sued,plead and be impleaded,defend and be defended,in all courts of law and equity within the united states.bankers trust texas pacific.this court held that the clause had the same generality and natural import as the clause in deveaux,at.thus,all that was intended was to render this corporation capable of suing and being sued by its corporate name in any court whose jurisdiction as otherwise competently defined was adequate to the occasion.at.
another lending dispute,involving defaulted bonds,led to the next statement on this issue.the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic clause authorized it t o sue and be sued,complain and defend,in any court of law or equity,state or federal.j ed.in,duhme fdic,this court held that federal jurisdiction over the case was based on the fdic clause.see red cross,at expressing no doubt that the court held federal jurisdiction to rest on the clause.
this court most recent discussion of a clause came in red cross,which involved a tort suit related to a contaminated blood transfusion.it described the previous quartet of decisions as reflecting this court best efforts at divining congressional intent retrospectively,efforts that had put congress on prospective notice of the language necessary and sufficient to confer jurisdiction.at.those decisions support the rule that a congressional charter sue and be sued provision may be read to confer federal court jurisdiction if,but only if,it specifically mentions the federal courts.at.under that rule,the court explained,the result was clear.at.the red cross clause,which permits it to sue and be sued in courts of law and equity,state or federal,within the jurisdiction of the united states,a,confers jurisdiction.red cross,at.in expressly authorizing suits in federal courts,using language in all relevant respects identical to the clause in on which the court based a holding of federal jurisdiction just five years before its enactment,the provision extends beyond a mere grant of general corporate capacity to sue,and suffices to confer federal jurisdiction.ibid.
armed with these earlier cases,as synthesized by red cross,we turn to the clause at issue here.
fannie mae clause resembles the clauses this court has held confer jurisdiction in one important respect.in authorizing fannie mae to sue and to be sued,and to complain and to defend,in any court of competent jurisdiction,state or federal,a,it specifically mentions the federal courts.red cross,at.this mention of the federal courts means that fannie mae c
