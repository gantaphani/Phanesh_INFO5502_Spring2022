the plaintiffs are all people whose vehicles were towed to,and subsequently damaged or destroyed at,an impoundment lot located at sacramento avenue in chicago lot between july and may.the plaintiffs brought a class action lawsuit pursuant to,alleging that the city of chicago deprived them of due process of law and was liable for these incidents of damage and destruction.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the city,and we affirm.
background 
a.the city towing and impoundment policies 
the city of chicago municipal code the code authorizes the city to tow and impound motor vehicles in various enumerated circumstances.lot only impoundment lot about which the plaintiffs one of the impoundment lots.between and,a total of vehicles were impounded at lot,which covers five square blocks and has only one entrance.otherwise,the lot is relatively inaccessible due to high fences and railroad track berms that surround its borders.the city department of streets sanitation was responsible for the operation and management of lot until august,when a private company named environmental auto removal,ear was contracted to operate and manage the lot throughout the remainder of the class action period.
the city policies relating to the towing and impoundment of vehicles are stated in the code and in a procedural manual created by ear in.when a vehicle is towed to lot,pound personnel conduct a physical examination of the vehicle and complete a motor vehicle inventory report.the inventory report describes the condition of the vehicle,describes the specific location of the vehicle in the lot,identifies when the vehicle was redeemed and by whom,and if the vehicle was never redeemed,describes the manner and date in which the vehicle was disposed.pound personnel then enter this information into a daily log book and into a computer system known as the hot desk system,which allows the city to track the location and disposition of all towed vehicles in the city and to respond to inquiries by vehicle owners about the location of their vehicles.for example,the hot desk system allows any city pound and several city departments such as the police department and department of streets sanitation to determine whether a vehicle is located at lot by entering the vehicle license plate number or vin number into the system.
after a vehicle is towed to lot,pound personnel also access the secretary of state database in order to identify the registered owner of the vehicle.upon obtaining this information,the city has ten days to send a notice of impoundment notice form to the vehicle owner.the notice form describes the vehicle,states when it was towed and the reason for the tow,and identifies the lot in which the vehicle is being impounded.the notice form also describes the procedures that allow the vehicle owners to retrieve their vehicles after paying the applicable charges or to obtain a hearing to challenge the impoundment.finally,the notice form states that the vehicle will be disposed of if not retrieved by a certain date 
when a vehicle owner picks up his vehicle from lot,he has the opportunity to request that pound personnel fill out a claim form,allowing the owner to document any alleged damage or theft that occurred while the vehicle was impounded.the pound employee who completes the claim form is required to verify that the alleged damage accurately reflects the condition of the vehicle and that any property allegedly stolen is not inside of the vehicle.
b.the plaintiffs claims 
the plaintiffs filed a complaint in the district court,alleging that the city deprived them,and others similarly situated,of due process of law for four reasons.first,the plaintiffs claimed that the city failed to timely notify vehicle owners that their vehicles had been towed to lot.specifically,of the vehicles that were towed to lot during the class action period,there were four instances where the vehicle owners did not receive a notice form.for example,plaintiffs casey gable,greg moore,and brian johnson were mailed notice forms within the required period to the most recent addresses that each had reported to the secretary of state.however,none of these plaintiffs received the notice forms because the addresses to which the notice forms were sent were not the addresses at which any of them still their vehicles were towed,all three had moved without reporting their address changes to the secretary of state.further,although the record is unclear as to the reason,plaintiff melinda dimond also did not receive a notice form,but subsequently learned that her vehicle had been towed to lot and retrieved it from the lot four days after it was towed.
second,the plaintiffs alleged that the city denied to vehicle owners that their vehicles were present at lot even though it knew or should have known that the vehicles were in fact present there.the record reveals that there were three instances in which this respect to plaintiffs gable,gene floriani,and moore.for example,gable or her boyfriend called lot every day for seven days inquiring about whether her vehicle was being impounded there.pound personnel repeatedly told her that her vehicle was not there.two weeks after gable vehicle was towed,a friend of gable who worked in another impoundment lot called lot,and pound personnel told gable friend that gable vehicle was in fact located at lot and had been since the day it was towed.upon learning this,gable immediately went to the pound and retrieved her vehicle,which had incurred extensive damage while being impounded.
after floriani vehicle was towed to lot,he contacted the lot,but pound personnel told him that his vehicle was not there.two or three days later,floriani received a call from the chicago police department,informing him that his vehicle was at lot.however,when floriani arrived at lot,he discovered that it had been damaged to such an extent that he decided to leave it there.
when moore vehicle was towed from a friend driveway,the person towing it told the friend that it was being towed to lot.thus,five days later,moore went to a chicago police department precinct,and a police officer entered moore license plate and vin numbers into the hot desk system,but the system incorrectly indicated that moore vehicle had not been towed.moore went to lot later that day,and pound personnel again told him that his vehicle was not being impounded there.for the next several weeks,moore made inquiries to pound personnel about the whereabouts of his vehicle,and the personnel repeatedly told him that it was not located at lot.finally,moore returned to lot a few weeks after his vehicle had been towed,and a pound employee told moore that it had been present there but had been disposed of a few days earlier.
third,the plaintiffs alleged that the city,through its agents,systematically broke into and entered vehicles towed to lot,and stole property from these vehicles.during the class period,there were approximately damage and theft claims filed with respect to vehicles towed to lot.it is undisputed that many of the vehicles were accidentally damaged while initially being hoisted by the tow truck or while being transported to lot.with respect to the incidents of intentional damage to the vehicles or theft therefrom,since,there have been only two incidents where pound employees were caught causing damage to or stealing from vehicles impounded at lot,and these employees were immediately fired.on the other hand,there is ample evidence that third parties are mainly responsible for the intentional incidents of damage and theft that have occurred at lot.the record shows that police officers patrolling lot or pound personnel have often caught third parties stealing from or damaging impounded vehicles.furthermore,incident reports prepared by ear reflect that pound personnel have discovered several holes cut in the fence surrounding lot and have seen third parties enter the lot through these holes.
in any event,the city has made efforts to reduce the number of damage and theft claims occurring at lot,whether perpetrated by pound employees or by third parties.for example,since at least,police officers are required to conduct routine surveillance of lot and the area immediately surrounding it.further,pound employees are required to check the fencing around lot every morning and must repair any damage they observe to the fence.perhaps the most significant step the city took to minimize the incidents of damage and theft was to hire ear to operate and manage lot.indeed,the city included a clause in ear contract that required ear to take all necessary precautions to avoid any damage or injury to persons or property,including without limitation city property,any towed vehicle and any personal property in the vehicle.pursuant to the policies in ear employee handbook,pound personnel are subject to periodic,random inspections of their vehicles to ensure that they are not removing any stolen property from lot,and ear policy specifically states that any pound employee caught stealing from the impounded vehicles will be fired immediately.pound personnel also inspect every tow truck that enters and exits lot in order to ensure that no property is being unlawfully removed.in addition,in order to deter trespassers,ear erected a dog run around lot perimeter in which eight guard dogs roam freely.ear also requires a guard and dog team to roam the inside of lot at all times.although it is undisputed that incidents of damage and theft continue to occur,the number of claims filed has decreased steadily each year since ear began managing lot in.
finally,the plaintiffs claimed that the city,through its agents,systematically compacted and destroyed vehicles that were towed to lot without notice to the owners,often in an attempt to cover up the theft and vandalism done to the vehicles.the record reveals that the city disposed of four plaintiffs vehicles that had been impounded at lot during the class action period.in all four of these instances,the vehicles were not disposed of until after expiration of the time period within which the vehicle owners could retrieve their vehicles from lot.
the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment,and the city filed a.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the city,and the plaintiffs now appeal.
ii.analysis 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing all of the facts,and drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom,in favor of the nonmoving party.see cent.states,southeast and southwest areas pension fund white,cir.summary judgment should be granted if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.cengr fusibond piping,cir quoting.c.
municipal liability 
the plaintiffs argue that the city violated their procedural and substantive due process rights through the following actions failing to notify the plaintiffs that their vehicles had been towed to lot denying to the plaintiffs that their vehicles were impounded at lot,when in fact they were damaging the plaintiffs vehicles and stealing items therefrom and continuing to allow incidents of damage and theft to occur at lot and unlawfully disposing of the plaintiffs vehicles.the plaintiffs contend that these actions deprived them of two property use of their vehicles during the time in which the city incorrectly told them that their vehicles were not at lot and the damage that their vehicles incurred.
it is well settled that the city can not be liable for the above actions through a theory of respondeat superior.see monell dep t of social,d.rather,it is when execution of a government policy or custom,whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy,inflicts the injury that the government as an entity is responsible under.id.at.in other words,to maintain a claim against a municipality,one must establish the requisite culpability a policy or custom attributable to municipal policymakers and the requisite causation the policy or custom was the moving force behind the constitutional deprivation.id.at.
the plaintiffs can establish a policy or custom by showing an express policy that,when enforced,causes a constitutional deprivation a widespread practice that,although not authorized by written law or express municipal policy,is so permanent and well settled as to constitute a custom or usage with the force of law or an allegation that the constitutional injury was caused by a person with final policymaking authority.baxter vigo county school,cir citations and quotations omitted.the plaintiffs concede that their injuries did not result from the application of an express policy or from any particular act of an individual with policymaking authority.rather,the plaintiffs claim that the actions of which they complain were so permanent and well settled that they constituted city customs.
in order for the plaintiffs to show that the alleged customs were attributable to the city and thus had the force of law,they must show that city policymakers were deliberately indifferent as to their known or obvious consequences.bd.of county comm rs brown,d quotations omitted the supreme court has defined deliberate indifference in this context to mean that a reasonable policymaker would conclude that the plainly obvious consequences of the city actions would result in the deprivation of a federally protected right.id.at.see also frake city of chicago,cir stating that a finding of deliberate indifference requires a showing that policymakers were aware of a substantial risk of a constitutional violation and failed to take appropriate steps to protect plaintiffs from a known danger.
culpability was the city deliberately indifferent 
as a preliminary matter,the plaintiffs have waived two of their arguments on appeal by not developing them in their opening the city had customs of failing to notify people that their vehicles were at lot and of disposing of vehicles without notice.see jones motor holtkamp,liese,beckemeier childress,cir holding that argument that was so little developed in plaintiff opening brief in this court was waived.
we turn,therefore,to whether the plaintiffs can establish the requisite culpability to link the city to the other actions about which they complain.first,they contend that the city had a custom of erroneously denying to vehicle owners that their vehicles were at lot.in support of this argument,the plaintiffs adduced evidence that this occurred on only three occasions during the class respect to class members gable,floriani,and moore the district court found,and we agree,that these three incidents were too few to indicate that the city had a widespread custom of which city policymakers had reason to be aware.see denno school bd.of volusia county,cir n ormally random acts or isolated incidents are insufficient to establish a custom.in denno,the plaintiff brought suit on behalf of her son who had been suspended for displaying a confederate flag at school,alleging that the school board had a custom of prohibiting confederate flags in violation of the first amendment.see id.at.although the plaintiff had adduced evidence of three other students who had been suspended for displaying confederate flags,the court held that these incidents did not represent a persistent and widespread practice.id.at.likewise,in our case,we have no problem concluding that of the vehicles that were towed to lot,the three incidents where vehicle owners were erroneously told that their vehicles were not at lot do not amount to a persistent and widespread practice.id.
the plaintiffs next contend that the city,through its agents,systematically broke into and stole items from vehicles impounded at lot and continued to allow these incidents of damage and theft to occur despite numerous complaints.there were only two incidents of damage and theft that were perpetrated by pound employees these incidents are too few to constitute a permanent and well settled custom.see denno,at.moreover,even if pound employees were responsible for many more of the incidents of damage and theft,as the plaintiffs suspect but have not shown,the city was not del
