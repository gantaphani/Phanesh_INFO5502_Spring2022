opinion of the court 
amelia woessner woessner appeals from the grant of summary judgment in favor of the two remaining defendants in this diversity switchboard corporation international switchboard and olsen engineering corporation olsen.she contends that the district court erred in its analysis of new jersey choice of law doctrine by applying delaware builder statute,s,to bar her products liability claims.furthermore,woessner argues that neither the builder statute of delaware nor new jersey should preclude her action because her injuries were the result of alleged defects in production machinery and therefore were not covered by the scope of either builder statute.we affirm the grant of summary judgment of the district court because it properly applied delaware law in this case and correctly found that delaware builder statute precluded woessner cause of action.
factual and procedural history 
in,cardox,cardox planned the construction of a carbon dioxide recovery plant adjacent to its existing facilities in delaware city,delaware.cardox contracted with olsen to provide design and engineering services for that construction.one component of the construction was a volt motor control center,also known as a switchgear.that motor control center was manufactured by international switchboard to the specifications demanded by olsen and was integrated into the production process of the facility in.cardox was later acquired by air liquide,air liquide,a delaware corporation,which continued to operate the facility.
woessner was employed as a field technician by d electric motors electric on july,the day of her injury.d electric is located in vineland,new jersey and woessner is a new jersey resident.in her capacity as a field technician,woessner visited air liquide at its request on that day to provide an evaluation of a motor that was not functioning.unable to make repairs to the motor on site,woessner sought to remove it for repair at the d electric facility in new jersey.before removing the motor,air liquide officials asked woessner to evaluate the attached motor control center.while examining the motor control center with an electrical tester,woessner was severely burned by an explosion.
this products liability action was brought by woessner in,alleging that the motor control center was defective in that it contained exposed electrical components.jurisdiction was based on the diversity of the parties.s.the district court made two determinations relevant to this appeal.on january,the court granted the motion of international switchboard to establish that the law of delaware will govern the determination of liability.on march,the court then granted summary judgment in favor of olsen and international switchboard,predicting that delaware builder statute would bar woessner claims against them.all of the defendants not involved in this appeal,including d electric,general electric and cardox,have either settled or been dismissed from this action,and thus the entry of summary judgment was a final order which is ripe for appeal to this court.s.

iii.analysis 
as an initial matter,we note that the district court was required to apply the law of the forum state,including its choice of law provisions.klaxon stentor.robertson central jersey bank trust,cir.new jersey has rejected the strict lex loci delicti place of the wrong rule for determining the choice of law based on the place where the tort occurred.veazey doremus.in its place,the new jersey courts have substituted the more flexible analysis in decisions.id.citations omitted.it is the district court application of this analysis to which woessner objects on appeal.
before discussing the analysis,we observe that the scope of our review of the choice of law question will not be as broad as the district court determination.the district court found that delaware law applied with respect to all issues of liability.we need not delve that far,for we note that the application of new jersey choice of law test proceeds on an basis.veazey,at.conflicts principles do not dictate that all legal issues presented by a single case should be decided under the laws of a single state.the evaluation of significant relationships and governmental interests takes place issue by issue and can lead to the application of different bodies of law.johnson matthey pennsylvania mfrs.ass ins.we are convinced,at least as to the question of which builder statute applies in this case,that the district court properly applied the law of delaware.
new jersey test requires a inquiry.the first step in the analysis is to determine whether a conflict exists between the law of the interested states if an actual conflict exists,the next step is to identify the governmental policies underlying the law of each state and how those policies are affected by each state contacts to the litigation and to the parties.veazey,at.thus,we begin with whether a conflict exists between the builder statutes of new jersey and delaware.
the delaware builder statute provides a six year limitations period on actions for damages,indemnification,or contribution for damages resulting from personal injuries arising out of any deficiency in the construction or improvement to any real property or the design,planning,supervision,or observation of any such construction.city of dover international telephone telegraph,see s.the six year period runs from the earliest of any of a variety of dates signaling the completion of construction.s b.there is a governmental interest in such laws.the delaware supreme court has noted that builder statutes have been enacted in as many as states and that t hey are prophylactic measures taken by the legislatures to lessen the construction professionals exposure to the almost unlimited liability which has resulted from the demise of the privity doctrine and the imposition of a discovery rule in tort cases.becker hamada.
the new jersey builder statute,stat.ann,does not differ from that of delaware in any respect material to this litigation.was adopted,effective may,as a legislative response to the then expanding liability concepts in this jurisdiction concerning the legal responsibility of contractors,architects,engineers,and others involved in creating improvements to real estate.brown jersey cent.power light.the primary distinction between the two is that delaware statute provides that no actions may be brought against the builder after six years,while new jersey has chosen to do similarly after ten years.compare s b with stat.ann.of course,because the current action was brought almost years after the construction of the cardox facility,the action would be by either statute,assuming either applied in this case.indeed,woessner has made no effort to distinguish between new jersey and delaware builder statutes and has submitted that the outcome is the same regardless of which statute of repose is applied.br.of woessner at.
even assuming,arguendo,that the builder statutes of new jersey and delaware differed other than as noted,an evaluation of the relative governmental interests can lead only to the conclusion that the district court properly applied delaware law.woessner notes the following considerations favoring the employ of new jersey law woessner was a new jersey resident,was employed by a new jersey company,sought medical assistance in new jersey and was the beneficiary of public aid in
