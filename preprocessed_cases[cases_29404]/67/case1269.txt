this controversy arose over plaintiff orp application to operate a community living facility for six adults impaired by traumatic brain injury or developmental disabilities or both.the city,through its board of zoning appeals boza,denied the request for a variance pursuant to a municipal ordinance restricting such homes from operating within feet approximately one half of a mile of another community living arrangement.
orp is a wisconsin corporation licensed by the state to operate residential programs.the wisconsin department of health and family services dhfs regulates its operations.homes for independent living hil,a division of orp,operates approximately group homes which provide residential and support services to persons with developmental disabilities,chronic mental illness,and traumatic brain injuries.over persons in ten southeastern wisconsin counties receive services provided by hil.
wisconsin coalition for advocacy,wca is a wisconsin corporation which provides statewide advocacy and protection for the rights of persons with disabilities.wisconsin statutes grant wca the responsibility and authority to pursue legal and other remedies for persons with developmental disabilities or mental illness.stat.janet and valerie are residents of milwaukee county and each has suffered a traumatic brain injury because janet injuries occurred prior to adulthood,she also has been diagnosed as having a developmental disability.both janet and valerie have been determined to be incompetent,thus their legal guardians,geraldine and clarence,and theresa respectively,brought this action on their behalf.both janet and valerie are under protective placement orders pursuant to the state of wisconsin civil commitment statute for placement,chap.pursuant to a district court order defining k least restrictive placement,janet must be placed in a group home or residential facility.under a similar court order,valerie must be placed in a group home,adult family care home,supervised apartment,or other comparable community placement.
aware of the need for residential facilities for people with traumatic brain injury and developmental disabilities,orp staff worked for over a year with a local real estate agent to find a home that would be physically and financially appropriate for such a group home.on august,orp applied for an occupancy permit for a residential facility for six developmentally disabled or traumatically brain injured adults at north menomonee river parkway in milwaukee.in september,orp purchased the house for.during the application for an occupancy permit however,orp ran into a stumbling block.
as part of its zoning code,milwaukee restricts the placement of community living arrangements.milwaukee permits community living arrangements for not more than eight persons in single residence districts,subject to certain special conditions.milwaukee,code of ordinances.those conditions are as follows 
special conditions.group living facilities.small foster homes and community living arrangements shall not be located within feet of each other and their cumulative capacities shall not exceed one percent of the population of an aldermanic district.certificates of occupancy shall be issued only upon evidence that a facility has been licensed by either the state of wisconsin,milwaukee county or a child welfare agency.
id.at a.a community living arrangement is defined as follows 
residential facility.a facility where or more adults not related to the operator reside and are provided with care,treatment or services above the level of room and board but less than nursing care.such care must include supportive home care service unless contraindicated by the facility program,and may also include hours or less of prescribed personal care service per week,per resident.the term does not include nursing homes,prisons,jails,community correctional residential centers,convents or facilities owned or operated exclusively by and for members of a religious order,or educational institutions and related student housing.
relying on the milwaukee ordinance regarding the requirement,the city of milwaukee department of building inspection dbi refused to issue an occupancy permit to orp.by letter dated november,dbi returned orp application stating that orp could not operate a residential facility at that site without violating of the milwaukee ordinance,as there were already two other group homes operating within feet of the proposed home,one of which was operating within feet of the proposed home.in addition to its determination that the proposed home violated the spacing requirements,the dbi made several other observations in its letter.first,it noted that the proposed group home sits on the fringe of the flood plain of the menomonee river.it then expressed concerns about the volume of traffic on the road during the summer months,and the fact that the road does not have sidewalks for pedestrian traffic.dbi informed orp that it could seek a variance by appealing to boza.according to the milwaukee municipal code,dbi has no authority to grant a permanent variance for the occupancy of any building if the intended use and plans do not conform with the city ordinances.id.at a.
by the time orp received the letter from dbi,it had already applied to boza for a waiver of the rule.in its application,filed on october,orp submitted its plan of operation for a home with,staff.boza held a hearing on the variance request on january.
during the boza hearing,orp counsel argued that the variance was necessary as a reasonable accommodation under the fhaa.to support this claim,orp presented evidence regarding the need in the city and county of milwaukee for residential facilities for persons with traumatic brain injuries.specifically,orp presented evidence regarding the difficulties in locating resources and facilities to provide services to brain injured individuals in the least restrictive environment consistent with the needs of the disabled person as required by state statute.orp presented detailed information about the needs of the individual plaintiffs janet and valerie d.at the time of the hearing,both plaintiffs were living in a nursing home,though each was the subject of a court order requiring them to be placed in a less restrictive environment,such as a residential facility.each of the plaintiffs respective guardians desired that they be placed in the home at north menomonee river parkway.orp and milwaukee county had reviewed the placements of janet and valerie d and determined that they could be transferred to the proposed group home as soon as the facility could open.
orp presented evidence that,due to limited state funding,community services for persons with disabilities are available to only a limited number of persons each year.janet and valerie were eligible for and received one of only a few specialized brain injury waiver program slots for.
the prospective neighbors of the group home appeared at the hearing to lodge their concerns about the facility.neighbors expressed concern that the brain injured patients might become violent and threaten the safety of residents of the community.one neighbor objecting to the proposed variance testified that his wife and the wife of another objecting neighbor were both psychologists and could attest to the fact that brain injured patients can and do become violent.another objecting neighbor testified that between and he had a brain injured uncle who lived with the family,but who had to be removed to a mental institution when he become violent.other neighbors raised concerns about the amount of traffic on the parkway,parking restrictions that could constitute a hazard for the group home residents,the lack of sidewalks,particularly in relation to the amount and speed of the traffic on the parkway,and the potential for flooding.some were concerned that the inclined driveway of the home could present a danger to residents as they entered and exited vans.lee jensen,the commissioner of dbi,testified at the hearing in opposition to the variance,not in his official capacity,but as a prospective neighbor of the facility.
as part of the proceedings,the office of the city engineer issued a report to boza that concluded that the proposed residential facility would not have a significant adverse impact on traffic and parking conditions in the neighborhood.
an attorney for a number of neighbors opposing the variance presented evidence of orp history as a group home operator.the evidence included reports of various investigations by dhfs regarding allegations of errors,negligence,or wrongdoings by staff of orp corporate affiliates.the history included reports that one resident received a double dose of medication dhhs had determined that a staff member sexually assaulted a resident eight residents were left outside of a home without supervision for minutes one facility failed to report in a timely manner that a staff member had physically abused a resident another facility neglected a basement flooding problem,and had rotting and mold problems as a result staff of a facility for developmentally disabled adults failed to control noise coming from the residents police officers were called to respond to physical outbursts by residents of a facility for the developmentally disabled police officers were called on numerous occasions to another group home to respond to reports of combative assaults by a particular resident and an elderly resident of a group home was found in the menomonee river.
rather than making a decision immediately following the january,hearing,boza allowed the parties until february,to file written responses to the record.counsel for orp supplemented the record,responding to the allegations of orp failings as a group home operator.
on february,boza voted to deny the request for a variance.on march,boza issued its written decision denying the request.the decision stated that the variance request was a flagrant violation of the state distance requirement,noting that there is another facility located feet away,two others within feet,and two more just slightly outside of the boundary.boza decision also expressed concern for the safety of the residents due to the high traffic and lack of sidewalks on the menomonee river parkway.the decision stated that,based on the allegations of problems emanating from other orp facilities,the proposed facility could impose undue costs,expenses,or other burdens on the city.the decision went on to note that the city had done its fair share of providing community living arrangements and group homes,in part by granting variances to the spacing ordinance,and that the rest of milwaukee county had many sites available 
due to the delay caused by the hearing,milwaukee county staff obtained permission to allow janet and valerie to use their brain injury waiver slots in rather than in.after learning of boza denial,milwaukee county staff asked orp to provide alternative services to plaintiffs janet and valerie orp proposed to operate the north menomonee river parkway home as a adult family home to serve them on an interim basis pending the appeal of boza decision.
because slight modifications to the building were needed to accommodate the two women,orp hired a contractor and applied for a building permit.commissioner jensen,however,had a note placed in orp file that no permit could be issued for any work at north menomonee river parkway without his approval or that of another deputy commissioner.the city took the position that any use of the premises by orp would constitute an illegal business,even if only two persons lived at the home.
due to the impending expiration of janet and valerie brain injury waivers,the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on november.on november,by agreement of the parties,janet and valerie moved into the premises on an interim basis pending the resolution of this case the plaintiffs filed their motion for partial summary judgment on march,and the defendant filed a cross motion for summary judgment on april.
the case was assigned to a magistrate who filed a recommendation with the court on january.in that recommendation,the magistrate rejected the city argument that the current ordinance provides a reasonable accommodation for disabled persons who wish to live in community living arrangements found that the plaintiffs met their burden of showing that the requested accommodation did not impose undue financial or administrative burdens on the city or require a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program and therefore was a reasonable accommodation found that the plaintiffs met their burden of showing that the accommodation requested by the city was necessary to allow the plaintiffs to have an equal opportunity to live in a single family neighborhood in the city of milwaukee found that the city failed to submit sufficient evidence to establish that the variance would impose an undue financial or administrative burden and found that the city failed to reasonably accommodate the plaintiffs.
on march,the district court issued its order addressing the city objections and adopting the magistrate recommendation in full.after a trial on damages,on november,the district court awarded compensatory damages to orp in the amount of and to janet and valerie each in the amount of.the district court did not,however,enjoin the city from enforcing the spacing ordinance.
reasonable accommodation 
the plaintiffs maintain that the city refusal to grant them an exception to the rule violates both the fhaa and the ada.the fair housing act fha was enacted to provide,within constitutional limitations,for fair housing throughout the united states.the amendments to the fair housing act,contained in the fhaa,specifically prohibit discrimination in housing on the basis of disability.f.the fhaa makes it illegal 
to discriminate in the sale or rental,or to otherwise make unavailable or deny,a dwelling to any buyer or renter because of a handicap of a that buyer or renter,to discriminate against any person in the terms,conditions,or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling,or in the provision of services or facilities in connection with such dwelling,because of a handicap of a that person.
f.it is worded as a broad mandate to eliminate discrimination against and equalize housing opportunities for disabled individuals.bronk ineichen,cir.unlawful discrimination includes a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules,policies,practices,or services,when such accommodations may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.f b.the fhaa defines handicap as a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person major life activities,a record of having such an impairment,or being regarded as having such an impairment.h.

like the fhaa,the ada provide s a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.b.under the proscriptions of the ada,no qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,or activities of a public entity,or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.although the ada does not explicitly define services,programs,or activities,the regulations promulgated pursuant to the act state that title ii applies to anything a public entity does.pt,app.a.the courts to have considered the issue have held that the ada clearly encompasses zoning decisions by local government entities.regional econ.comty.action program,city of middletown,cir petition for cert.filed,may,bay area addiction research and treatment,city of antioch,cir.
the definition of a disability under the ada is substantively identical to that in the fhaa.furthermore,as with the fhaa,under the ada,a public entity must reasonably accommodate a qualified individual with a disability by making changes in rules,policies,practices,or services when needed.dadian village of wilmette,cir see also b stating in regulations interpreting title ii of the ada,a public entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies,practices,or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability,unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service,program or activity.the reasonable accommodation provision prohibits the enforcement of zoning ordinances and local housing policies in a manner that denies people with disabilities access to housing on par with that of those who are not disabled.hovsons,township of brick,cir internal citation omitted.
the fhaa requires accommodation if such accommodation is reasonable,and necessary,to afford a handicapped person the equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.f b see also howard city of beavercreek,cir,zoning bd.of adjustment,cir bryant woods inn,howard county,maryland,cir smith lee city of taylor,michigan,cir.the requirements for reasonable accommodation under the ada are the same as those under the fhaa.see also dadian,at analyzing the requirement to reasonably accommodate under the ada and fhaa as one and compare erdman city of fort atkinson,cir stating that the term reasonable accommodation in the fhaa is often interpreted by analogy with the same phrase in the rehabilitation act,with gile united airlines,cir noting that the definition of reasonable accommodation in the rehabilitation act is the same as that in the ada.
the burden is on the plaintiffs to show that the accommodation it seeks is reasonable on its face.us airways,barnett,d.once the plaintiffs have made this prima facie showing,the defendant must come forward to demonstrate unreasonableness or undue hardship in the particular circumstances.see also vande zande wisconsin dep t of,cir 
the city argues that the plaintiffs bear the burden of proof with respect to the issue of reasonable accommodation,citing both the fifth and fourth circuits in bryant woods inn,at and elderhaven,city of lubbock,texas,cir.the city,however,offers no reason for choosing this regime over the method used by the second,third,eighth,ninth,and tenth circuits which require a plaintiff to make an initial showing that an accommodation is reasonable,but then places the burden on the defendant to show that the accommodation is unreasonable.see,at vinson thomas,cir,petition for cert.filed,june,jackan new york state dep t of labor,cir,cert.denied,d fjellestad pizza hut of america,cir white york int l,cir.and though this court has never explicitly labeled the test it employs,in vande zande,at,we describe a process similar to that used by the second,third,eighth,ninth,and tenth circuits in evaluating the reasonableness of a requested accommodation under the fhaa 
the employee must show that the accommodation is reasonable in the sense both of efficacious and of proportional to costs.even if this prima facie showing is made,the employer has an opportunity to prove that upon more careful consideration the costs are excessive in relation either to the benefits of the accommodation or to the employer financial survival or health.
id.see also,us airways.at,d acknowledging the regime used by appellate courts.
we begin by focusing on the definitions of the three key elements of a reasonable accommodation reasonable,necessary,and equal opportunity.whether a requested accommodation is reasonable or not is a highly inquiry and requires balancing the needs of the parties.dadian,at.an accommodation is reasonable if it is both efficacious and proportional to the costs to implement it.vande zande,at.an accommodation is unreasonable if it imposes undue financial or administrative burdens or requires a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program.erdman,at internal citations omitted.in assessing costs,the court may look at both financial and administrative costs and burdens.bryant woods inn,at.a zoning waiver is unreasonable if it is so at odds with the purposes behind the rule that it would be a fundamental and unreasonable change.dadian,at.
whether the requested accommodation is necessary requires a showing that the desired accommodation will affirmatively enhance a disabled plaintiff quality of life by ameliorating the effects of the disability.dadian,at citing bronk,at.in other words,the plaintiffs must show that without the required accommodation they will be denied the equal opportunity to live in a residential neighborhood.
in this context,equal opportunity means the opportunity to choose to live in a residential neighborhood,at smith lee,at.the fhaa prohibits local governments from applying land use regulations in a manner that will give disabled people less opportunity to live in certain neighborhoods than people without disabilities.smith lee,at internal citation omitted.often,a residential facility provides the only means by which disabled persons can live in a residential neighborhood,either because they need more supportive services,for financial reasons,or both.erdman,at brandt village of chebanse,illinois,cir larkin,at hovsons,at smith lee,at.when a zoning authority refuses to reasonably accommodate these small group living facilities,it denies disabled persons an equal opportunity to live in the community of their choice.erdman,at.
turning to the facts in this case,the city argues that it reasonably accommodates group homes in two ways.first,it permits group homes in single family districts without qualification if they are not within feet of one another.for those that are less than feet from another group home,the ordinance allows the facility to apply for a waiver through boza hearing process.yet under no circumstances is boza required or even encouraged to grant a variance in favor of a group home.and the right to appeal to boza for a variance is not in and of itself an accommodation.as the district court pointed out,merely because a group home will have the right to open in limited cases is not an accommodation,however,it is merely good fortune.it is just as likely,as in the present case,that the proposed home will fall within feet of another group home rule and permit the municipality to veto the opening of the home in the first instance.oconomowoc residential programs,city of milwaukee,slip op.at.
since the city current system does not provide a reasonable accommodation,we look to see whether the accommodation requested by the plaintiffs is reasonable,and necessary,to allow them an equal opportunity to use and enjoy housing in the city.
the plaintiffs assert that the variance they request is a reasonable accommodation that would pose significant benefits to developmentally disabled and brain injured persons by allowing them to live together in a family setting in a residential community without imposing undue financial or administrative burdens on the city.the city counters that the variance requested by the plaintiffs would be unreasonable.as support for its proposition,the city focuses on orp history of problems operating othe
