defendant,superior bank fsb superior bank,appeals from the grant of summary judgment in favor of the trustee,james boyd,avoiding superior bank mortgage on the debtor real property as a preferential transfer pursuant to.superior bank argued that its mortgage was equitably subrogated to a prior recorded mortgage.after the appeal was filed in this court,superior bank challenged the subject matter jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court pursuant to the financial institution reform,recovery and enforcement act firrea.d d and j.after review of the record,the applicable law,and the arguments presented on appeal,we find that the bankruptcy court retained jurisdiction and affirm the grant of summary judgment.
in december,the debtor,kay lorraine lewis,purchased residential property in mancelona,michigan,with funds borrowed from empire national bank.empire national bank mortgage was recorded on december.
debtor thereafter quitclaimed the property to her son,ronald bigger,and her son fiancee,jessica depeel.when the debtor wanted to secure refinancing from superior bank to repay the empire national bank note,bigger and depeel quitclaimed the property to the debtor,bigger,and depeel.on september,the debtor executed a note to superior bank and the debtor,bigger,and depeel executed a mortgage on the property to secure the note.superior bank did not record the mortgage until april.
on may,less than a month after the mortgage was recorded,debtor filed for chapter bankruptcy and listed superior bank as a secured creditor.superior bank filed a motion for relief from automatic stay on the mortgaged property,which was subsequently withdrawn on october.on november,the trustee filed the complaint in this adversary action to avoid superior bank mortgage.
a little more than six months later,on july,superior bank was placed in receivership pursuant to the provisions of firrea on november,the bankruptcy court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the trustee and avoided superior bank mortgage after that judgment was affirmed by the district court on appeal,superior bank filed a notice of appeal in this court.
subsequently,the trustee filed in the bankruptcy court a notice of intent to sell the property.on march,superior bank filed objections and,nearly two years after the fdic was appointed as receiver,asserted for the first time that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction pursuant to firrea.after overruling superior bank objections,the bankruptcy court concluded that it could not rule on superior bank jurisdictional challenge because it was,in effect,a collateral attack on the judgment that was pending on appeal before this court.superior bank then filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction in this court.we denied the motion without prejudice and directed the parties to brief the jurisdictional issue in this appeal 
subject matter jurisdiction 
the existence of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time,by any party,or even sua sponte by the court itself.cmty.health plan of ohio mosser,cir.therefore,we will decide whether the bankruptcy court had subject matter jurisdiction even though this issue was not raised until after the appeal was filed.
the fdic,as receiver,has never appeared in this case.after oral argument,we provided an opportunity for the fdic to state its position on superior bank jurisdictional arguments.in its brief response,the fdic opined that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction under d d.the application of firrea to an action pending at the time a receiver is appointed presents an issue of first impression in this circuit.
firrea was enacted during the savings and loan insolvency crisis to enable the fdic and the resolution trust company rtc to efficiently and expeditiously wind up the affairs of hundreds of failed financial institutions.see freeman fdic.section of firrea establishes an administrative process for handling claims made against the assets of a failed bank that has been placed under receivership.before addressing the jurisdictional issues presented in this case,we will briefly review the administrative claims process under firrea.
section d a states that the fdic may,as receiver,determine claims in accordance with the requirements of this subsection and regulations prescribed under paragraph.d a.the fdic must publish and mail a notice to the bank creditors to present their claims by a specified date,which can not be less than days after publication of the notice.d b and c.
if a claim is filed with the fdic as receiver,the fdic has days to allow or disallow the claim and to notify the claimant of that determination.d a i.claims filed after the date specified in the notice must be disallowed unless the claimant did not receive notice of the appointment of the receiver in time to file such claim before such date.d c ii i.in such a case,the fdic may consider the claim provided the claim is filed in time to permit payment.d c ii ii.
if the fdic disallows a claim or fails to either allow or disallow the claim within the period,a claimant may,within days,request further administrative review or file suit on such claim in the district court located in the failed bank principal place of business or the district of columbia.d a.alternatively,a claimant can continue an action commenced before the appointment of the receiver.id.if the claimant does not seek either administrative review or judicial determination within that period,the claim is deemed disallowed and the disallowance shall be final,and the claimant shall have no further rights or remedies with respect to such claim.d b ii.
superior bank argues that j barred the bankruptcy court from avoiding the mortgage.section j provides 
j limitation on court action 
except as provided in this section,no court may take any action,except at the request of the board of directors by regulation or order,to restrain or affect the exercise of powers or functions of the corporation as a conservator or a receiver.
in freeman,at,the plaintiffs brought an action against the fdic as receiver for madison national bank seeking injunctive and declaratory relief to prevent foreclosure on their home.the circuit held that j barred the district court from granting the requested equitable relief.the court noted that in pursuing foreclosure,the fdic was exercising its statutory authority to collect all obligations and money due to madison national bank and proceed to realize upon that failed institution assets.d b.thus,j barred the court from restraining the foreclosure and rescinding the underlying loan because that would restrain or affect the fdic exercise of its powers or functions as madison national bank receiver.see also united liberty life ins.ryan,cir,where we reached the same result when a party challenged in a declaratory action the receiver acts in transferring assets of the failed institution.
in this case,there is no evidence that the fdic has sought to exercise any of its powers the debtor property.on this record,therefore,we can not say that the bankruptcy court avoidance of superior bank mortgage pursuant to the bankruptcy code restrained or affected the fdic exercise of its powers or functions as superior bank receiver in contravention of j.
superior bank also argues that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to avoid its mortgage pursuant to d d,which provides 
d limitation on judicial review 
except as otherwise provided in this subsection,no court shall have jurisdiction over 
i any claim or action for payment from,or any action seeking a determination of rights with respect to,the assets of any depository institution for which the corporation has been appointed receiver,including assets which the corporation may acquire from itself as such receiver or 
ii any claim relating to any act or omission of such institution or the corporation as receiver.
the trustee argues that d d does not apply in this case because firrea applies only to claims of a creditor of a bank in receivership and not to claims made by the bank debtors.see parker am.resolution trust,cir bankruptcy preference action was not resolvable through firrea administrative claims process because firrea,by its language and legislative history,applies only to claims by creditors,not debtors and fdic cont l fin,firrea was intended to apply only to creditors claims because it repeatedly refers to creditors and omits any reference to a bank debtors.
later circuit court cases,however,have consistently held that d d applies to debtor as well as creditor claims.in freeman,the circuit found 
nor does the statutory text suggest that the jurisdictional bar applies only to creditors on its face,it applies to anyone with a claim for payment or action seeking a determination of rights with respect to the failed institution assets.see lloyd fdic,at.concededly,the notice provisions of d b and c require that the fdic give notice of the claims period to a failed financial institution creditors,but as we noted in opeiu,local,at,firrea very text appears to contemplate claims beyond those by creditor s on the books to whom statutory notice must be sent.for example,d d says that any claim relating to an act or omission of the institution or the corporation as receiver is subject to the d exhaustion requirement.
freeman,at.
the same conclusion was reached in the eighth circuit 
we reject contention that,because the notice provisions of firrea apply only to creditors,d d exhaustion requirement should be similarly limited to creditors bringing claims.while the notice provisions do apply only to creditors,such limiting language is conspicuously absent in the jurisdictional bar provision.rather than mention creditors or limit its application to creditors,d d bars any claim or action for payment from,or any action seeking a determination of rights with respect to the failed institution assets emphasis added,unless administrative remedies have been exhausted.thus,firrea very text appears to contemplate claims beyond those by creditor s on the books to whom statutory notice must be sent.office professional employees int l union,local fdic.we assume congress meant what it said when it included a jurisdictional bar to any action,national union,at,and thus we conclude that d d was intended to apply to debtors as well as creditors.
hotels,fdic,cir footnote omitted.see also union fire ins.city.cir term any action includes actions by debtors as well as creditors lloyd fdic,cir suit by debtor seeking equitable reformation or cancellation of mortgage agreement is a determination of rights with respect to the failed institution assets subject to d d jurisdictional bar.
most circuits,including the ninth circuit,have limited the reasoning in parker to the bankruptcy setting.see mccarthy fdic,cir.the circuit specifically stated 
the concern underlying these cases is clear if bankruptcy courts are ousted of jurisdiction over a broad class of claims under the d jurisdictional bar,the unity of the bankruptcy process may be fractured and some claims would be determined,at least in the first instance,by fdic administrative tribunals,which it is argued have little expertise in bankruptcy matters.parker,at.for the reasons stated above,we do not think this construction of the d d jurisdictional bar quite squares with the statutory text.but even if d d is narrowly construed as a limitation on bankruptcy courts jurisdiction in order to effectuate the purposes of the bankruptcy code,parker,at,we decline to extend that approach to nonbankruptcy court contexts.
freeman,at.
we are troubled by the argument that the language in a statute has a different meaning when it is read in the context of a bankruptcy case than it has in the context of any other case.while the notice provisions of apply only to creditors,and there is no specific mention of a bank debtors,d d clearly applies to any action with respect to the failed institution assets.the fact that the claim is associated with a bankruptcy proceeding does not suddenly render the language ambiguous.we,therefore,decline to hold that d d does not apply simply because the person asserting the claim,in this case the trustee,is not a creditor of the bank.
but that does not end our inquiry,d d is not a complete jurisdictional bar.it allows for exceptions.one exception recognized by courts is the judicial review allowed under d a of a disallowed or undecided administratively filed claim.some courts have held that d d imposes a statutory exhaustion requirement in other words,a party must first exhaust the administrative complaint process with the fdic before a federal court can obtain jurisdiction over the party claim.see,freeman,at.superior bank relies upon these cases to argue that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction because the debtor the trustee did not submit a claim to the fdic under firrea administrative claims process.
the facts of freeman and the other cases cited by superior bank which were also referenced in the fdic response to our inquiry are different from the facts of the case before us.in those cases,the court action was commenced after the failed bank was placed in receivership.by contrast,in this case both the bankruptcy proceeding and the adversary action were commenced before superior bank was placed in receivership.thus,this was a preexisting or case as opposed to a case.
ordinarily,the subject matter jurisdiction of a court is tested as of the time the action is filed and subsequent changes will not operate to divest a court of its jurisdiction once it has been properly invoked.congress may override this time of filing rule if it so chooses,but there is an even greater need for clear and affirmative congressional action when it intends to do so.see holmes fin,resolution trust,cir.
the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to decide the avoidance issue at the time the adversary complaint was filed.b f,k,and o.we must determine,therefore,whether congress clearly and affirmatively chose to divest the bankruptcy court of that jurisdiction through d d of firrea.the first rule of statutory construction is that t he starting point for interpretation of a statute is the language of the statute itself.kaiser aluminum chem.bonjorno,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the plain meaning is conclusive except in the rare cases in which the literal application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intention of its drafters.united states ron pair,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.a review of d d and the other provisions of firrea convinces us that congress did not intend to strip the bankruptcy court of its jurisdiction in a context.
the e xcept as otherwise provided in this subsection language in d d applies to d as a whole.whatley resolution trust,cir.because congress did not state except as otherwise provided in d a,there logically may be other exceptions to the jurisdictional bar of d d besides the judicial review of an administratively filed claim allowed under d a.
section d a contains another exception.section d a ii of firrea provides that the receiver may request a stay of days in any judicial proceeding to which the bank in receivership is or becomes a party.any court with jurisdiction of such action or proceeding shall grant such stay as to all parties.d b.to interpret d d as stripping a court of jurisdiction in a action would render d a superfluous.there would be no need for a stay if a court automatically lost jurisdiction upon the appointment of a receiver.see whatley,at neither a request for a stay nor the failure to request a stay deprives the district court of jurisdiction praxis,colonial sav.bank.cir jurisdiction not lost by subsequent insolvency of thrift and takeover by rtc.
the question then becomes what happens if,as in this case,the receiver does not request a stay.in other words,can a court proceed to judgment in a case over which it has jurisdiction if the receiver has not requested a stay if the receiver elects not to request a stay,we find nothing in firrea which would restrain a court that acquired jurisdiction before the receiver was appointed from proceeding to decide the issues rightfully before it.if congress had meant for the administrative claims process to result in an automatic,mandatory stay of a preexisting action pending the resolution of a claim through the administrative claim process,it would have been a simple matter to do so.see whatley,at.it did not do so.instead,it provided a mechanism in d a for the receiver to decide whether to stay a preexisting action or to allow that action to proceed to judgment.see fdic lacentra trucking,cir firrea gives the receiver the authority to decide whether to require the claimant to exhaust administrative remedies or to allow the litigation to proceed to judgment whatley,at if the receiver does not seek a stay,judicial action will routinely proceed.
this conclusion is further supported by language in d f and d e which both state in subsection i that the filing of an administrative claim with the receiver has the legal effect of tolling the applicable statute of limitations for such claim.subsection ii states,however,that subject to paragraph subject to a stay obtained under d d,the filing of a claim with the receiver shall not prejudice any right of the claimant to continue any action which was filed before the appointment of the receiver.d f and d e ii.
we are aware that some circuits have reached a contrary conclusion,but we are not persuaded by the reasoning in those decisions.the ninth circuit decided that a court in a case can lose jurisdiction if the claimant does not file a claim with the receiver under firrea administrative claim process.intercontinental travel,fdic,cir.it saw no reason,in d or any other source why its prior decision in a case should not apply to actions.id.at.
section d d precludes a court from acquiring jurisdiction after the receiver is appointed.the only exception in such a case is d a,which confers jurisdiction upon a federal court in the district where the bank principal place of business is located or the circuit to hear a claim disallowed by the receiver through the administrative claim process.but d a shows that congress intended cases be treated differently.section d a,as well as d f and d e,recognize not only that a court retains jurisdiction in a preexisting action,but also that it may proceed to judgment in the absence of a stay.
in brady dev.resolution trust,cir,the fourth circuit held that litigants who have an action pending in court against a financial institution subsequently placed in receivership must exhaust firrea administrative claims process in order to continue their action in district court.the fourth circuit held that d d must be read in conjunction with firrea allowance of an action within days of a claim being denied by the receiver as provided for in d a.it held that together these sections mandate that a court can not hear any claim until it has been rejected by the rtc in its administrative review or until the administrative review period has expired.it concluded that congress envisioned that administrative and judicial review of claims could not take place simultaneously.the court found that permitting a action to proceed where the claimant had not filed an administrative claim with the rtc would thwart firrea purposes and permit creditors to evade the comprehensive administrative claims procedures envisioned by the statute.id.at.
a similar result was reached in bueford resolution trust,cir,where the eighth circuit examined d b,which provides that a claim is deemed to be disallowed such disallowance shall be final,and the claimant shall have no further rights or remedies with respect to such claim if,after a claim has been disallowed by the receiver,the claimant does not request administrative review,file suit,or continue an action already commenced before the appointment of a receiver.d b.because this section specifically mentions actions commenced prior to the appointment of the receiver,the eighth circuit concluded that the requirement for administrative exhaustion applies equally to cases bueford,at.see also resolution trust mustang partners,cir no interpretation is possible which would excuse the requirement for filing an administrative claim,or allow the filing of suit to substitute for the claim process.
again,we disagree with this reasoning.section d by its terms applies only to claims which have been submitted for determination by the receiver pursuant to d.it allows for agency review or judicial determination of a claim which was disallowed by the receiver or which was not decided within days after it was submitted to the receiver for decision.d a.it also provides that if such review is not sought,the claim,which was initially submitted to the receiver for decision,is deemed disallowed and such disallowance shall be final,and the claimant shall have no further rights or remedies with respect to such claim.d b.section d,however,does not itself mandate the filing of a claim with the receiver the only section which can be construed as mandating administrative processing of a claim is d d.as we discussed above,d d provides for exceptions.one of those is contained in d a,which explicitly recognizes the continued jurisdiction of a court in a case.in light of this explicit recognition of the jurisdiction of a court in a case,and in the absence of any language in firrea clearly and affirmatively stripping such courts of their jurisdiction,we conclude that the bankruptcy court retained jurisdiction to decide the avoidance issue in this case.
our conclusion is particularly compelling under the facts of this case.in lacentra trucking,at,the eleventh circuit reached the same result in a case with a very similar history 
rtc permitted the litigation to proceed and participated freely in it,dealing with claimant counsel as litigant.not only did the receiver not make known a choice to use administrative processes but for months it pursued a course of action consistent only with litigation.it defined the issues for litigation.it utilized the litigation to obtain information on the issues for the determination of which the case had been remanded.the parties were exposed to months of litigation and expense.the resources of the district court were needlessly dissipated.disposition of rtc assets received from the foreclosed property was delayed.then,on the eve of trial,rtc invoked the administrative processes it had heretofore eschewed as a vehicle to dispose of the case favorably to its position without trial or hearing.this the receiver could not do.this case is the antithesis of the orderly and prompt procedures contemplated by the statute.it stands the statute on its head.the choice given rtc to choose between litigation and administrative process means little if the receiver does not make known what its choice is so that the case,or the administrative process,can proceed accordingly.
the facts of the case before us are even more egregious.the fdic did not intervene and did not request a stay of this case after it was appointed receiver of superior bank instead,it elected to allow superior bank to proceed to litigate this case through final judgment.it was only after losing in the bankruptcy court,losing in an appeal to the district court,and then perfecting an appeal in this court,that superior bank attempted to invoke the provisions of firrea.we,therefore,find that the bankruptcy court retained jurisdiction to reach final judgment in this adversary action.
