these two cases,which were consolidated for oral argument,stem from a program under which the united states department of agriculture department reduced farmers debts to the government that were originally secured by mortgages on their farms.the department reduced or wrote down the appellants collectively,the farmers farm loan debts in return for the farmers entering into shared appreciation agreements of ten years duration,under which the farmers agreed to pay the government a part of any appreciation in the market value of their farmland.when the agreements expired,the value of the secured farmland in each case had substantially increased.the government then sought from the farmers a portion of the increase,and the farmers denied any obligation to make such payment.
the farmers contend that under the shared appreciation agreements,the obligation to pay the government a part of any increase in the value of the farmland ended when the agreements expired that the government should be estopped from seeking a part of the increase because local department officials told the farmers that if they continued to own and farm the property for the duration of the agreements,their obligation to share such appreciation would be forgiven and that the department administrative proceedings,in which the farmers unsuccessfully challenged the department claims,had various defects rendering those decisions arbitrary and capricious.in each case,the district court rejected the farmers contentions and granted summary judgment for the government.we affirm.
the underlying basic facts and legal issues in the two cases are substantially the same,although the dollar amounts involved are different.

the james estate unsuccessfully challenged the department ruling by invoking the department administrative review procedures,including an administrative hearing.the estate then filed suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee challenging the department decision.in a detailed opinion,the court,speaking through the magistrate judge to whom the case had been assigned for disposition,granted the government motion for summary judgment and dismissed the complaint.estate of elinor james united states dep t of.the estate also offered the department to settle the claim,an offer which the department rejected.although the estate unsuccessfully challenged the department rejection of its settlement offer in district court,the estate has not argued that point in its appeal and we therefore shall not discuss it.
