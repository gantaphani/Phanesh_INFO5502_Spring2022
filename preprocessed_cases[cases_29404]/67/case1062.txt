gary arnett,shelly arnett,and john paul arnett,by next friend gary arnett,brought this action pursuant to against gary myers,executive director of the tennessee wildlife resources agency twra,and the members of the tennessee wildlife resources commission twrc in their official capacities against harold hurst,gary cook,paul brown,and ronnie capps,employees of the twra,in their individual capacities and against robert baker,an employee of the tennessee department of environment and conservation tdec in his individual capacity.the sought declaratory and injunctive relief,contending that the removal of their duck blinds from reelfoot lake in obion county,tennessee by the employees of the twra denied them procedural due process,equal protection,and just compensation for a taking under the fifth,and fourteenth amendments denied them of their right to conduct a commercial aquaculture business and deprived them of their property rights under the fifth and fourteenth amendments and constituted retaliation for the exercise of gary arnett first amendment rights in criticizing the twra management of reelfoot lake.in two separate opinions,the district court granted summary judgment to the,holding that the claims under the fifth and fourteenth amendments were not ripe for review because the did not pursue available administrative remedies prior to filing suit in federal court alternatively,the were unable to demonstrate a constitutionally protected interest in the duck blind structures and that the did not provide sufficient evidence of a causal connection between gary arnett criticism of the twra management of reelfoot lake and the removal and destruction of the duck blinds to maintain a first amendment retaliation claim.
for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the district court dismissal of the first amendment claims and its holdings that the fifth and fourteenth amendment claims are not ripe for review and that the had no constitutionally protected interest in duck blinds.accordingly,we remand to the district court for further proceedings.
background 
reelfoot lake was formed in by an earthquake and the flow of the mississippi river.the result of the earthquake was to lower the lands upon which the waters of the lake rest several feet below the surrounding lands.the submergence of the land by the mississippi river carried down the forest timber growing upon it,and these timbers and their remains are still in the lake.state ex rel.cates west tennessee land.the state of tennessee owns approximately acres acres of water in and around the lake.the lake is known for its hunting,fishing,bird population,and as a major wintering area for migrating waterfowl and a winter home to eagles.
in,the tennessee supreme court held that reelfoot lake is a navigable stream in the strict technical legal sense,meaning that private ownership of either its waters or the land underlying them is not permitted.id.at.because it is navigable in the technical sense,the rights of the public attach to it,to its use,and to its fisheries,so that it is incapable of private ownership,and the state owns it in trust for all the people,and can not alienate it away.id.at.nevertheless,the court held that those landowners whose titles include land derived from the doherty grants from north carolina prior to the formation of reelfoot lake,land now submerged by the lake,would be entitled to its their land use and enjoyment as long as they can reasonably identify it and fix its boundaries.id.title and ownership over a doherty grant will carry with it the exclusive right of fishery in the waters over these grants.id.
acting as owner in trust of reelfoot lake,the state of tennessee has regulated its use.in,the tennessee general assembly designated reelfoot lake as a class i scenic recreational area under the natural areas preservation act,ann.see.pub.acts.all land surrounding the waters of reelfoot lake was designated a state wildlife management area.see ann.d.and,in,the legislature named the twra and the twrc as the primary agencies to administer activities at reelfoot lake.see.pub.acts codified at ann.d and.the legislature also has expressly directed and authorized the commissioner of the tdec to establish rules implementing the permitting system over any activities that may impair or obstruct the navigability of watercourses in tennessee,including reelfoot lake.see.pub.acts codified at ann.
gary arnett,his wife shelly arnett,and their minor son john paul arnett collectively,the arnetts each claim ownership of a separate duck blind on reelfoot lake in obion county,tennessee.gary arnett alleges ownership of a duck blind located in the cranetown area of reelfoot lake,having claimed it after it was abandoned by its previous owner,and repairing and refurbishing it in september of.shelly arnett claims ownership of a duck blind in the net raft timber area of reelfoot lake,having claimed and refurbished it in may of.john paul arnett claims ownership of a duck blind in the rushing pond area of reelfoot lake,having received the blind as a gift from his father,gary arnett,who obtained title to it,in turn,by conveyance from one wendell morris in may of.the arnetts made or intended to make personal and professional use of the blinds,using them personally to observe and hunt migratory waterfowl,fish,and engage in other family recreational activities,while using them professionally as part of a family guide business for hunters and fishermen.
the arnetts contend that each of the blinds continually existed in the same location on reelfoot lake from before july,until november of.between november and november,twra agents removed a total of nine duck blinds from reelfoot lake,including the three blinds allegedly owned by the arnetts,after determining that the blinds were unregistered,and therefore,unlawful.the twra is authorized to remove unregistered duck blinds from reelfoot lake under regulations promulgated by the twrc that provide,in pertinent part 
n o blind may be constructed,or repaired,or any floating blinds moved onto the area that has not met the deadline for registering the blind and displaying the registration number,as prescribed.unregistered unnumbered blinds are subject to removal at the discretion of the area manager or a designee of the tennessee wildlife resources agency 
comp,ch.c.after the blinds were removed by the twra agents,the twra and the tdec issued letters to the individuals claiming ownership of those blinds stating that those owners wishing to retrieve the structural materials of their blinds should call and make arrangements to pick them up.this was the first notice the arnetts had of the action taken by the twra.the arnetts allege that of all the blinds removed,only theirs were destroyed.
in march of,approximately eight months prior to the removal and destruction of the blinds to which they claim ownership,the arnetts sent a letter to harold hurst requesting official recognition by the twra of the duck blinds in their names,but this request was denied.in the same letter,gary arnett asked for permission to engage in commercial aquaculture off of his lake front property.this request was also denied.subsequently,the arnetts sent joint applications to the twra and tdec seeking permission to repair the duck blinds.in september,robert baker of the tdec replied by letter to these requests stating that the arnetts could repair the blinds without a navigation permit from the tdec provided that the work conducted was only repair,rehabilitation,or replacement of an existing structure authorized under tdec rules or that was constructed prior to july.after receiving this response,the arnetts contend that they spent considerable time and money repairing the blinds throughout september and october of.
in september of,the arnetts brought this lawsuit pursuant to in the western district of tennessee seeking injunctive and declaratory relief and attorney fees.the relief sought by the arnetts included a declaratory judgment that they owned the duck blind structures and had the right to rebuild and use those structures without interference a declaratory judgment declaring the twra registration system for duck blinds unconstitutional a declaratory judgment declaring twra permit program illegal because it deprived them of their riparian rights and allowed to use their doherty lake bed property a declaratory judgment that they have doherty riparian rights and a preliminary injunction protecting their rights to the duck blind sites that they claim.the district court ruled on several motions.first,the district court denied the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction.and,then,in response to two summary judgment motions,the court granted summary judgment in favor of the on all claims.the arnetts appeal the court summary judgment orders.
ii.analysis 
standard of review.
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see hartleip mcneilab,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.fed civ.c.the party may not rely on his pleadings alone,but must demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue for trial by pointing to specific facts that create such an issue.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.in making this determination,a judge may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence.see anderson liberty lobby,d.
first amendment retaliation.
the arnetts claim that the removal and destruction of their duck blinds by the twra were actions taken in retaliation for gary arnett criticism of the twra management of reelfoot lake,in violation of arnett first amendment rights.the record reflects that arnett had been an outspoken critic of the twra management practices in the year preceding the removal and destruction of the blinds,including several occasions of criticism between august,and october.for example,arnett criticized the twra at several informal meetings with twra officials,at a town hall meeting in tiptonville,lake county,tennessee,and even testified before the environment and conservation committee of the tennessee house of representatives regarding the twra alleged mismanagement of the reelfoot lake wildlife management area wma.
to maintain a claim under section for first amendment retaliation,a plaintiff must show that he or she engaged in protected conduct that an adverse action was taken against him or her that would deter a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in that conduct and that there is a causal connection between elements one and two,a plaintiff must show that the adverse action was motivated,at least in part,by his or her protected conduct.see blatter,cir.the district court held that the arnetts satisfied elements one and two above,but failed to show a causal connection between gary arnett criticism of the twra and the removal and destruction of his family duck blinds.
there is no doubt that the arnetts satisfied the first element of a retaliation claim.it is that the freedom to criticize public officials and expose their wrongdoing is a fundamental first amendment value,indeed,c ritcism of the government is at the very center of the constitutionally protected area of free discussion.rosenblatt baer,d.clearly,criticism of the twra management of reelfoot lake and the wma falls squarely within the ambit of the first amendment protections.
there is likewise little room to dispute that the action taken by the twra,allegedly in retaliation for arnett criticism of its management practices,was sufficiently adverse to be cognizable under section.it is not the case that every action,no matter how small,is constitutionally cognizable.see,at citing ingraham wright,d t here is,of course,a de minimis level of imposition with which the constitution is not concerned.however,the removal and destruction of the arnetts duck blinds constitutes more than de minimis adverse action,and if it is true that this action was taken in retaliation for arnett criticism of the twra,it is enough to chill or deter persons of ordinary firmness from exercising their first amendment rights in the future.accordingly,the arnetts satisfied the second element of a first amendment retaliation claim.
although the arnetts met the first and second elements above,the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants,holding that the arnetts failed to satisfy the third element of a retaliation claim because they failed to establish a causal connection between arnett protected conduct and the twra adverse action.to demonstrate this causal connection,a plaintiff is required to proffer evidence sufficient to raise the inference that his or her protected activity was a motivating factor for the adverse decision.see,at.circumstantial evidence,like the timing of events or the disparate treatment of similar individuals,may support this inference.see id.once a plaintiff has met his or her burden of establishing that his or her protected conduct was a motivating factor behind the adverse conduct,the burden of production shifts to the defendant.see id.if the defendant can demonstrate that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the protected activity,it has met its burden and is entitled to summary judgment if it can show affirmatively that there is no genuine issue in dispute.id.
to defeat a plaintiff claim of first amendment retaliation at trial,a defendant is required to show,by a preponderance of the evidence,that it would have taken the same action even in the absence of the protected conduct.see cockrel shelby county sch,cir.to defeat a plaintiff claim on a motion for summary judgment,however,a substantially higher hurdle must be surpassed,particularly where,as is the case here,the moving party bears the ultimate burden of persuasion on this issue at trial.id.citing james william moore et,moore federal practice,at ed if the moving party also bears the burden of persuasion at trial,the moving party initial summary judgment burden is higher in that it must show that the record contains evidence satisfying the burden of persuasion and that the evidence is so powerful that no reasonable jury would be free to disbelieve it.to prevail on their motion for summary judgment,the defendants may not simply bring forth enough evidence to allow a jury to find that they would have removed and destroyed the arnetts duck blinds regardless of arnett criticism of the twra management of reelfoot lake.in reviewing a motion for summary judgment,we must view the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,and s ummary judgment in favor of the party with the burden of persuasion is inappropriate when the evidence is susceptible of different interpretations or inferences by the trier of fact.hunt cromartie,d.thus,if a plaintiff establishes the elements of his or her claim for first amendment retaliation,summary judgment for the defendant is proper only if the evidence is such that every reasonable juror would conclude that the defendant met its burden of showing that it would have taken the same action even in the absence of the protected conduct.cockrel,at.
the arnetts presented circumstantial evidence in support of the requisite causal connection,noting that the duck blinds were removed only after arnett criticized the twra that other unregistered blinds were not removed from reelfoot lake and that of the nine blinds removed from the lake between november,and november,only their three blinds were destroyed.this evidence,though not conclusive,is sufficient to raise the inference that arnett protected activity was the likely reason for the removal and destruction of the arnetts duck blinds,and therefore,is enough to trigger the shift of the burden of production to the defendants.the defendants,in support of their contention that they would have taken the same action regardless of arnett criticism,note that arnett received an oral warning from twra officers in november,that unless he removed his unregistered duck blind from the cranestown area,it would be destroyed,predating his criticism of the twra approximately by nine months that arnett acknowledged in november,that he knew that the twra had a policy of removing and destroying illegal duck blind sites on reelfoot lake that in addition to the arnetts blinds,six other unregistered duck blinds were removed from reelfoot lake in november,and that the twra removed at least one unregistered duck blind from reelfoot lake in.
we are not persuaded that the evidence is such that every reasonable juror would conclude that the defendants met their burden of showing that they would have taken the same action in the absence of the protected conduct.rather,we believe that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether there is a causal connection between arnett protected conduct and the twra adverse action.whether the defendants have met their burden of production by a preponderance of the evidence is to be determined at trial.accordingly,the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the defendants as to the arnetts first amendment retaliation claim.
the district court granted summary judgment to the as to the fifth and fourteenth amendment claims,holding that because the had not pursued their available state administrative remedies prior to bringing suit,these claims were not ripe.article iii of the constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to consideration of actual cases and controversies,and federal courts are not permitted to render advisory opinions.see adcock firestone tire and rubber,cir.ripeness is more than a mere procedural question it is determinative of jurisdiction.if a claim is unripe,federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction and the complaint must be dismissed.bigelow michigan dep t of natural,cir quoting southern pac.transp.city of los angeles,cir.
the articulated claims for denial of procedural due process,equal protection,and just compensation for takings under the fifth and fourteenth amendments.in williamson county reg l planning comm hamilton bank,d,the supreme court declared that if a state provides an adequate procedure for seeking just compensation,the property owner can not claim a violation of the just compensation clause until it has used the procedure and been denied just compensation.id.at.at.if a plaintiff has not pursued available state remedies,the case is not ripe because the state action is not complete until the state fails to provide adequate compensation for the taking.id.thus,a plaintiff must demonstrate two things for a regulatory taking claim to be ripe that the government entity charged with implementing the regulations has reached a final decision regarding the application of the regulations to the property at issue and that if the state had a reasonable,certain and adequate provision for obtaining just compensation at the time of the taking,just compensation was sought and denied through that procedure.williamson,at.at.procedural due process and equal protection claims that are ancillary to taking claims are subject to the same williamson ripeness requirements,procedural due process and equal protection claims ancillary to taking claims are not ripe for review unless the plaintiff has met the two elements above.see bigelow,at.the district judge held that the arnetts failed to pursue administrative remedies available to them under ann.a v and a a for physical and regulatory takings,and therefore,their fifth and fourteenth amendment claims were not ripe.
applying the williamson analysis to this case,this court first must ask whether the removal and destruction of the duck blinds and the denial of alleged riparian rights constituted final agency decisions.t he finality requirement is concerned with whether the initial decisionmaker has arrived at a definitive position on the issue that inflicts an actual,concrete injury williamson,at.at.the removal and destruction of the arnetts duck blinds is more properly characterized as a physical taking than as a regulatory taking,and it is clear that the initial in this case,the twra,arrived at a definitive position inflicting an actual,concrete injury when its agents removed and destroyed the duck blinds.see kruse village of chagrin falls,cir.the denial of the arnetts alleged riparian rights also constitutes final decisions by initial,as the combined refusal by twra officials to allow the arnetts to engage in aquaculture in the water above their lake bed property,and the issuance of permits by the twrc authorizing to hunt and fish above the arnetts lake bed property are definitive positions that inflict actual,concrete injuries.accordingly,the arnetts meet the first williamson ripeness element 
in applying the second williamson ripeness element,this court must ask whether there existed in tennessee at the time of the taking a reasonable,certain,and adequate provision for obtaining just compensation,and if so,whether the arnetts sought and were denied just compensation for the takings under that provision.the district court was correct when it held that the provisions of ann.a provide reasonable,certain,and adequate procedures for obtaining just compensation,and if the alleged takings occurred today or,indeed,at any time after the enaction of this statute,the arnetts would be required to seek and be denied just compensation under its provisions before their claim under the just compensation clause would be cognizable in federal court.this statute,however,was not enacted by the state of tennessee until april,and williamson specifically instructs that the relevant time frame for determining the adequacy of state provisions for obtaining just compensation for an alleged taking is at the time of the taking.williamson,at.at.see also,kruse,at.the arnetts did not seek just compensation from the state under ann.a prior to filing suit,but they were not required to do so under the then prevailing ripeness analysis.the district court erred when it held that the arnetts failure to avail themselves of the compensation provisions of this statute rendered their claims under the fifth and fourteenth amendments not yet ripe for judicial review.
this court review of tennessee law has revealed no reasonable,certain,and adequate provision for obtaining just compensation that was available to the arnetts at the time of the alleged takings in this case.therefore,the arnetts meet the second prong of the williamson ripeness analysis.the arnetts fifth and fourteenth amendment claims were not premature and are ripe for review by the district court.
protected property interests.
the district court granted summary judgment to the as to the fifth and fourteenth amendment claims for the removal and destruction of the duck blinds on the alternative ground that the interests in the duck blind structures did not rise to the level of a constitutionally protected property interest.the district court noted that in,the twrc,as the agency directed and authorized to promulgate necessary rules and regulations for activities at reelfoot lake,began to regulate the number of permanent waterfowl blinds on reelfoot lake.see.comp,ch.c.pursuant to this objective,the twrc promulgated a regulation requiring all waterfowl blind sites to be registered.see id.between and,permanent waterfowl blinds could be registered only by an original registrant or his or her alternate.see id.during the registration period,either the registrant or the alternate was required to be declared as the site permanent registrant,and thereafter,only the permanent registrant was authorized to register the blind site.see id.an individual who properly registered his or her waterfowl blind between and,was allowed to retain the blind as a permanent blind site provided that he or she obtained from the twrc an annual waterfowl permit,timely registered the blind each year,and complied with other twrc regulations.see id.as previously mentioned,the regulations specifically provide that 
n o blind may be constructed,or repaired,or any floating blinds moved onto the area that has not met the deadline for registering the blind and displaying the registration number,as prescribed.unregistered unnumbered blinds are subject to removal at the discretion of the area manager or a designee of the tennessee w
