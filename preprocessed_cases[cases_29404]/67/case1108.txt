for several years the city of joliet,illinois,has been trying to acquire the evergreen terrace apartment complex,which the city believes is so that it constitutes a public nuisance.after the city commenced eminent domain proceedings in state court,new west,a partnership that owns the complex,removed the proceeding to federal court and filed a suit under seeking an injunction and damages.the district court put the condemnation on ice and dismissed the,we held in new west,joliet,cir.we directed the district court to take up the condemnation proceeding first,as its disposition could resolve some or all of the issues in the suit.
one of new west arguments in the suit was that,because it has accepted a federal subsidy under of the housing act of,federal law preempts the city proceeding.our opinion had this to say 
new west contends that and the fair housing act prevent condemnation of evergreen terrace,but it does not rely on any particular provision of that statute.section is a subsidy program,a carrot rather than a stick.hud regulations implementing the program contemplate the possibility of the parcel condemnation they do not purport to forbid condemnations.see.for its part,the fair housing act forbids discrimination in housing programs without providing that any given housing development has a right to continued existence.just as with,federal regulations implementing the fha cover the demolition of housing projects.part,and exempt condemned buildings from these rules,see.if joliet thinks that a given parcel of land should be put to a public use,such as a park,and is willing to foot the bill,it is hard to see any obstacle in federal law.
at.in the district court the department of housing and urban development intervened and contended that of the national housing act of as amended in and,and the multifamily assisted housing reform and affordability act of,note,block condemnation.the district court rejected that contention in reliance on our opinion,but,after concluding that hud was making new arguments that we had not addressed,certified the case for interlocutory appeal under b.we accepted the appeal,because we thought that hud was relying on particular language said to preempt state and local condemnation laws.now that the appeal has been fully briefed and argued,however,hud and the other parties acknowledge that neither of these statutes has any clause preempting state law.at this point we could stop and affirm,relying on the law of the case.but because hud was not a party to the first appeal,and has invoked two statutes that new west did not mention,we think it best to give the department a full hearing and plenary decision.
first,however,a word on jurisdiction.joliet contends that there is none,because when the case was removed hud was neither a party to the suit nor even a lender to new west.the eminent domain proceeding arises under state and local law.although new west raised preemption as a federal defense,it has long been understood that a federal defense does not support removal.see,metropolitan life insurance taylor,d gully first national bank.bennett southwest airlines,rehearing denied,cir.the exception for complete preemption,see franchise tax board of california construction laborers vacation trust,d,does not apply no one argues that federal law occupies the fields of housing or municipal powers.
still,the presence of the national government as a party with a security interest in the real estate supplies jurisdiction.it would be pointless to order this suit remanded,only to have hud it in a trice.the supreme court has held that,when a suit is removed prematurely,the district court may proceed if it has jurisdiction at the time it enters judgment.american fire casualty finn.grubbs general electric credit,d caterpillar lewis,d.this rule,coupled with the presence of hud and its desire to have the suit resolved in federal court,means that remand is unnecessary.
three federal statutes are involved in this proceeding,and hud contends that two of them preempt state and local law.the first statute,of the housing act,provides federal rent subsidies for tenants as we observed in,this statute does not preempt any state or local law.hud concurs.the second is of the national housing act.this statute creates a program under which the federal government insures mortgages on privately owned,multifamily properties,some tenants of which receive rent subsidies under.hud has established criteria that owners must meet before a loan is insured.hud also is authorized to pay off the private lenders and become a direct lender.for descriptions of this program,see cienega gardens united states,and geneva towers tenants organization federated mortgage investors,cir.the final statute,the multifamily assisted housing reform and affordability act of,note,allows hud to renegotiate mortgages insured or assumed under of the national housing act.high mortgage payments make it hard sometimes impossible for owners to offer rents to their tenants renegotiated mortgages with lower monthly payments cut the rents to the beneficiaries of the program.owners who seek lower mortgage payments under the act must promise to keep their rental properties available to tenants for years.
evergreen terrace,which has apartments,has participated in the and programs since the.by the late the owner was in default on its mortgage loans.hud paid off the lenders,became the mortgage holder,foreclosed,and took title to the complex.new west purchased part of the complex from hud in for,and the rest in for another.new west took out large mortgage loans,which hud insured under.new west promised both the lenders and hud that it will not permit or suffer the use of any of the property for any purpose other than the use for which the same was intended at the time this mortgage was executed.
in new west asked hud to restructure the mortgages under the act,reducing the monthly payments.both the illinois housing development authority and heskin signet partners reported to hud that the approximately residents of evergreen terrace lack other available options for housing.relying on these reports,hud approved the restructuring in,paid off the original lenders,and became the lender and mortgage holder itself.as part of the transaction,new west promised that,for the next years,the property shall be used solely as rental housing with no reduction in the number of residential units unless approved in writing by hud.new west simultaneously entered into new agreements with hud for subsidies to tenants.these agreements undertake not to transfer,assign,or encumber the property without hud approval.
when we agreed to hear this interlocutory appeal,we understood hud to argue that the contracts that new west had signed in themselves preempted any state and local powers of condemnation,and we directed the parties to address the question how new west could give away a governmental power that it never possessed.neither the city of joliet nor the state of illinois has made any promise to hud about the maintenance of evergreen terrace.hud appellate brief responded to our inquiry by disclaiming this theory of preemption.the contracts do not affect state or local powers,hud recognizes.owners such as new west must comply with all state and local,b specifies that recipients of federal assistance are bound by all a pplicable state and local laws,codes,ordinances,and regulations.
why is eminent domain among these applicable state and local laws hud answer is that condemnation would interfere with the purposes of and the act.both statutes are designed to enlarge,or at least preserve,the stock of housing available for tenants.the findings in of the act make this explicit.if joliet can condemn evergreen terrace,apartments for tenants will disappear,and these tenants do not have ready alternatives.that what the illinois housing development authority and heskin signet partners concluded.removing units from the housing stock could undermine achievement of the national purpose and so is preempted,the argument concludes.this line of argument implies that local government can not condemn any housing,whether or not the owner has
