following the conviction of charles mchan,for and related offenses,the district court determined,pursuant to a,that mchan was required to forfeit to the united states approximately million in proceeds obtained as a result of his criminal conduct.when mchan could not account for the whereabouts of these proceeds,the court entered,as part of mchan sentence,a preliminary order forfeiting substitute property of mchan in the form of real estate and other assets,pursuant to p.
mchan wife,martha,and his two sons,john and charles,the petitioners herein filed a petition in charles mchan,sentencing proceedings pursuant to n,asserting an interest in much of the property listed in the preliminary order of forfeiture.after a hearing on their petition,the district court amended the preliminary order of forfeiture to release some of the substitute property and issued a final order of forfeiture with respect to the remainder.
on their appeal,martha,john,and charles contend that under the due process clause they were entitled to be heard before the district court issued the preliminary order of forfeiture that the principle of c,which provides that a criminal forfeiture relates back to include property owned by the defendant at the time of the commission of the act giving rise to forfeiture,does not apply to the forfeiture of substitute property and that the district court violated the seventh amendment by denying their request to have the hearing of their petition conducted before a jury.they also make several challenges to determinations specific to assets that were not released from the forfeiture order.on,the united states contends that the district court erred in releasing certain assets from the forfeiture order.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand.
charles mchan,charles was charged in a indictment with drug trafficking in western north carolina between november and november.specifically,the indictment charged charles with,among other things,a conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute over kilograms of marijuana,in violation of and tax evasion and engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise with regard to marijuana distribution.count seventeen alleged that charles interest in property enumerated both in the indictment and in several appendices incorporated therein by reference was subject to forfeiture under,a statute authorizing the in personam criminal forfeiture of property used in connection with illegal drug activities.
after pleading guilty to counts of the indictment,charles was tried by a jury and convicted on counts and.thereafter,he waived a jury trial on count,the forfeiture count.following a bench trial,the district court found that charles received proceeds in the amount of as a result of illegal marijuana sales,and,after deducting charles expenses incurred to obtain those proceeds and a share of the proceeds,the court ordered forfeiture to the united states of.on appeal,we affirmed charles convictions but ruled,with respect to the forfeiture,that the district court should have forfeited the gross proceeds,not the net profits,from the illegal activities.united states mchan,cir.
on remand,the government moved for a preliminary order of forfeiture of substitute property because charles had refused to give credible information concerning the disposition of the.the district court granted the government motion,subject to any interests therein.charles and the three petitioners then objected to the preliminary order of forfeiture,arguing that most of the substitute property in fact belonged to martha,charles,and john because charles had conveyed the property to them.the district court ruled that this objection was out of order because the petitioners interests were adequately protected by n.martha,charles,and john then filed a petition under n for a hearing to adjudicate the validity of their interest in property preliminarily ordered forfeited.in their petition,the petitioners argued that a forfeiture of substitute property does not relate back to include property owned by the defendant at the time of the commission of the offense giving rise to forfeiture that much of the property was actually vested in martha at the time of charles criminal conduct pursuant to a written agreement between martha and charles the agreement and that,in any event,the petitioners obtained title to the property as bona fide purchasers for value by virtue of a series of three agreements entered into between charles and martha,dated july.the petitioners also requested that a jury find the facts on their petition.
the district court denied the petitioners request for a jury and conducted a hearing,taking testimony from several witnesses.following the hearing,the court concluded that the substitute property eligible for forfeiture related back to include property owned by charles at the time of the criminal acts giving rise to the forfeiture that martha failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the agreement provided her with a vested property interest that was superior to charles at the time of the acts which gave rise to the forfeiture of charles property under n a and that the transfers of property to the petitioners pursuant to the agreements dated july,were not arm length transactions and thus petitioners were not bona fide purchasers for value entitled to the property under n b.the district court also made several specific rulings as to particular property sought to be forfeited.following modifications to its decision made in response to the parties motions for reconsideration,the court entered a final order of forfeiture on september.
the petitioners appeal from the final order of forfeiture,contending that the district court erred in denying them an opportunity to be heard prior to the issuance of the preliminary order of forfeiture that forfeiture of substitute property does not relate back to the time of the commission of the acts that gave rise to forfeiture and that they were entitled to have a jury find the facts at the hearing on their petition to determine the validity of their interests in the property.in addition,the petitioners make several challenges to determinations made with respect to the forfeitability of specific assets.on,the government likewise challenges rulings on the forfeitability of several specific assets.
the criminal forfeiture statute at issue in this case,was enacted by congress as part of the criminal forfeiture act of,an amendment to the comprehensive drug abuse prevention and control act of.see,stat.prior to the enactment of,criminal forfeiture had to be obtained under either the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations rico statute,et,or the continuing criminal enterprise cce statute,at,reprinted in.there was no specific criminal forfeiture statute for drug trafficking.in practice,prosecutors seeking forfeiture of assets relied primarily on an in rem civil forfeiture procedure,which congress found particularly inefficient because the civil forfeiture procedure required the government to file separate suits in every judicial district in which the criminal defendant property was located.id.at,reprinted in at.moreover,even when the criminal forfeiture provisions of the rico and cce statutes were applicable,they did not provide means by which the government could forfeit property that a criminal defendant disposed of in anticipation of the criminal proceedings.id.at,reprinted in at.thus,when congress enacted the criminal forfeiture act of,it both amended rico criminal forfeiture procedure to address its deficiencies and created,which is,in nearly all respects,identical to the rico criminal forfeiture statute as amended,but applicable in all felony drug cases.id.at,reprinted in at.
section a provides that a ny person convicted of a violation of this subchapter control and enforcement or subchapter ii import and export of this chapter drug abuse prevention and control shall forfeit to the united states 
any property constituting,or derived from,any proceeds the person obtained,directly or indirectly,as the result of such violation 
any of the person property used,or intended to be used,in any manner or part,to commit,or to facilitate the commission of,such violation and 
in the case of a person convicted of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise in violation of section of this title,the person shall forfeit,in addition to any property described in paragraph or,any of his interest in,claims against,and property or contractual rights affording a source of control over,the continuing criminal enterprise.
the forfeiture of such property is the property title in the united states upon the commission of the act giving rise to forfeiture under this section.c.this relation back principle in c prevent s defendants from escaping the impact of forfeiture by transferring assets to third parties.united states reckmeyer,cir.
section d creates a rebuttable presumption that any property of a person convicted of a felony drug offense is subject to forfeiture if the government establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that such property was acquired by the defendant during the time period of the violation or a reasonable time thereafter and there was no likely source for the property other than the violation.if any of the forfeitable property can not be located by the government,has been transferred or sold to a third party,is beyond the court jurisdiction,or has been diminished in value or commingled beyond easy divisibility,the court must,pursuant to p,order the forfeiture of substitute property of the defendant up to the value of the forfeitable property.
to protect the property interests of third parties,n provides a process for the vindication of those interests.after entry of a forfeiture order,the united states is required to publish notice of the order and of its intent to dispose of the property and it also may directly contact those it knows to have alleged an interest in the property.n.within days of receiving notice,a ny person,other than the defendant,asserting a legal interest in the property may petition the court for a hearing to adjudicate the validity of his alleged interest in the property.id.n.the petition must be signed by the petitioner and must set forth the nature and extent of the petitioner property interest.id.n.t o the extent practicable and consistent with the interests of justice,the court is directed to hold a hearing within thirty days of the filing of the petition.id.n.at the hearing,the petitioners and the government may present witnesses and other evidence and may the witnesses.id.n.finally,if,after the hearing,the court determines that the petitioner has established by a preponderance of the evidence that he had a vested interest in the property or an interest superior to that of the defendant at the time of the commission of the acts giving rise to forfeiture,or he was a bona fide purchaser for value of the property and was at the time of purchase reasonably without cause to believe that the property was subject to forfeiture,the court is directed to amend the order of forfeiture in accordance with its determination.id.n.following the court disposition of all petitions filed by third parties,the order of forfeiture,as amended as a result of the disposition of all petitions,gives the united states clear title to property that is the subject of the order of forfeiture.id.n.
the petition authorized by n is the exclusive avenue through which a third party may protect his interest in property that has been subject to a forfeiture order.section k prohibits any person claiming an interest in property subject to forfeiture from intervening in the trial or appeal of a criminal case involving forfeiture of such property or commencing an action at law or equity against the united states concerning the validity of the third party alleged interest in the property.
this is the statutory scheme that the petitioners in this case challenge in several respects.
for their first assignment of error,the petitioners contend that they should have been given an opportunity to oppose the government motion for the preliminary order of forfeiture and the evidentiary basis thereof.they argue that the due process clause of the fifth amendment required that they receive notice of the government motion seeking the entry of the preliminary order of forfeiture and an opportunity to be heard at least soon entry of a preliminary order of forfeiture that would seriously impair their property rights.they assert that if they were given an opportunity to oppose the government motion for a preliminary order of forfeiture,they could have pointed out that many of the properties listed in the order of forfeiture were not owned at all or not wholly owned by charles,at the time of his arrest or subsequent thereto.
the petitioners argument misconstrues the nature of the forfeiture proceeding and their appropriate role in it.the petitioners were not defendants in the criminal trial charles mchan,was the defendant,and it was he who forfeited his property under.of course,charles had the opportunity at trial to oppose forfeiture before the preliminary order of forfeiture was entered as part of his sentence.see a libretti united states,d holding that is a sentencing statute,applied following conviction as punishment for the commission of various drug crimes and noting that imposes forfeiture in addition to any other sentence emphasis in original.but the statute provides that,until this sentence of forfeiture is entered,no party claiming an interest in the forfeited property may intervene in the criminal case.see k see also libretti,at.reaffirming that a n proceeding is the only means by which a third party may safeguard his rights in property ordered forfeited under,even where the complaint is that the forfeiture itself was unsupported by factual evidence.only after the sentence is entered by an order of forfeiture and notice is given to the public may any person assert an interest in forfeited property by filing a petition pursuant to n.see n.then after the petitions of third parties are resolved,a final order of forfeiture is entered.see id.n.
because the district court followed this procedure,the petitioners challenge under the due process clause must be a challenge to the statutory scheme.in essence,the petitioners are arguing that due process required that they,as third parties,be given an opportunity to interject themselves into the sentencing phase of the criminal case against charles because his sentence had the potential to affect their property interests.but they have no support for the proposition.see libretti,d.united states reckmeyer,at.in libretti,the supreme court rejected the defendant argument that a n proceeding inadequately protected third parties interests.the court emphasized that congress has determined that n provides the means by which rights must be vindicated.at.and in reckmeyer,while we acknowledged that serious due process concerns would be raised if third parties asserting an interest in forfeited assets were barred from challenging the validity of the forfeiture,at,we went on to hold that n is a means by which third persons who raise challenges to the validity of the forfeiture order could have their claims adjudicated,id.at see also id.at reading n to allow challenges to the validity of the forfeiture to avoid any possible constitutional infirmity.as we noted,congress was particularly aware that,unlike in a civil forfeiture case where all parties with an interest in the civilly forfeitable property may participate in judicial forfeiture proceedings,third parties with interests in criminally forfeitable property may not participate in the criminal trial.id.at quoting,at,reprinted in at discussing,a provision of the rico statute that is identical to n.we concluded that it was congress clear intention in passing n that third parties have an opportunity to be heard and to be awarded relief if they were to show a cognizable interest in the property preliminarily ordered forfeited.id.at.
the supreme court rejection in libretti of challenges similar to those made by petitioners in this case and our holding in reckmeyer require us to reject petitioners claims that the statutory scheme denies them due process.indeed,n provides all of the process due.it requires that the petitioners receive notice of the order of forfeiture before its final implementation that they be given a hearing that they be allowed to present witnesses and evidence and that they be permitted to any witnesses who appear at the hearing.due process does not require more.see mathews eldridge,d the fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner internal quotation marks omitted.
the petitioners also contend that the district court erred in construing the forfeiture statute to provide that the forfeiture of substitute property under p relates back to the time of the commission of the acts giving rise to the forfeiture.they assert that the principle of c applies only to the tainted property described in a and not to innocent substitute property described in p.based on this argument,they state that,when asserting a forfeiture interest in substitute property,the government can look only to property owned by charles at the time the criminal forfeiture judgment was entered,rather than at the time of the commission of the act giving rise to the forfeiture.
to support their position,the petitioners advance two arguments.first,they contend that c expressly limits the principle to the tainted assets described in a.second,they contend that as a matter of policy,if the principle applied to substitute property,innocent transferees of substitute assets would have no way to protect themselves from the government unforeseeable future legal claim to the substitute assets.as an alternative to their argument that the principle should be limited to the date of the criminal forfeiture judgment when substitute property is forfeited,they argue that common sense and sound policy reasons dictate that the forfeiture should relate back no further than the date of the indictment.in suggesting this alternative date,the petitioners place great weight on a department of justice legislative proposal that recognized the ambiguity surrounding the applicability of the c principle to substitute property and that recommended an amendment to the statute providing that substitute asset forfeitures relate back to the date of the indictment.
to address the petitioners first argument,we note that the express language of c,contrary to what the petitioners claim,does not preclude the application of the principle to substitute property.section c states that a ll right,title,and interest in property described in subsection a of this section vests in the united states upon the commission of the act giving rise to forfeiture under this section.c.while it is clear that all the property described in a property tainted by its relationship to criminal forfeited to the united states at the time of the criminal conduct giving rise to forfeiture,this does not preclude application of the principle to substitute property.indeed,the language of p suggests otherwise,stating,if any of the tainted property described in subsection a of this section has been placed beyond the reach of a forfeiture the court shall order the forfeiture of any other property of the defendant up to the value of the tainted property that is unavailable for forfeiture.id.p.this section thus seems to equate substitute property with tainted property when the tainted property has been placed beyond the reach of a forfeiture in that it can not be located,has been transferred to a third party,has been placed beyond the jurisdiction of the court,has been substantially diminished in value,or has been commingled with other property so that it can not be divided without difficulty.see id.
but any doubt about this construction should be eliminated by the statutory instruction to construe the statute liberally to effectuate its remedial purposes.o.the remedial purpose of both the provision and the substitute property provision is to thwart the defendant efforts to avoid the impact of a criminal forfeiture.
when congress enacted as part of the criminal forfeiture act of,it included the substitute asset provision to address one of the most serious impediments to significant criminal forfeitures,that a defendant may succeed in avoiding the forfeiture sanction simply by transferring his assets to another,placing them beyond the jurisdiction of the court,or taking other actions to render his forfeitable property unavailable at the time of conviction,at,reprinted in at,discussing the shared purpose of the substitute property provisions of and the analogous rico statute.describing this problem in substantial detail,congress noted 
unlike civil forfeitures,in which the government seizure of the asset occurs at or soon after the commencement of the forfeiture action,in criminal forfeitures,the assets generally remain in the custody of the defendant until the time of his conviction for the offense upon which the forfeiture is based.only after conviction does the government seize the asset.thus,a person who anticipates that some of his property may be subject to criminal forfeiture has not only an obvious incentive,but also ample opportunity,to transfer his assets or remove them from the jurisdiction of the court prior to trial and so shield them from any possibility of forfeiture the important economic impact of imposing the sanction of forfeiture against the defendant is thus lost.
id.at,reprinted in at.it is thus apparent that the remedial purpose of generally and p in particular was to thwart efforts by a defendant to circumvent the economic impact of an anticipated criminal forfeiture sentence.
given that the purpose of the provision in c was to prevent defendants from escaping the impact of forfeiture by transferring assets to third parties,reckmeyer,at,and the purpose of p was similarly to address this very impediment to significant criminal forfeitures,at,reprinted in at,the substitute property that is subject to forfeiture under p must be read to include all property of the defendant at the time of the commission of the acts giving rise to the forfeiture.see united states phillips,cir holding that all right,title,and interest in the substitute property that the defendant transferred to a third party on the eve of conviction vested in the united states upon the commission of the act giving rise to the forfeiture citing c in re billman,cir interpreting the analogous rico criminal forfeiture statute and holding that a defendant can not thwart the operation of forfeiture laws by absconding with rico proceeds and then transferring his substitute assets to a third person who does not qualify as a bona fide purchaser for value.to conclude otherwise would invite defendants who anticipate conviction for their unlawful activities to undertake the obvious step of transferring their assets or removing them from the court reach prior to indictment and conviction,thereby circumventing the important economic impact of forfeiture.
in support of their position,the petitioners make the policy argument that our interpretation would leave innocent transferees of substitute assets with no way to protect themselves from the government unforeseeable future legal claim to the substitute assets.but this argument fails to take into account the provisions of the statute that explicitly protect innocent transferees.a bona fide purchaser for value of the defendant property who was at the time of transfer reasonably without cause to believe that the defendant property was subject to forfeiture,n b,is given the right to file a n petition to have such substitute property removed from the forfeiture order,id.n allowing any person asserting a legal interest in property forfeited pursuant to this section to file a petition.
accordingly,we conclude that the forfeiture of substitute property pursuant to p relates back to the date of the acts giving rise to the forfeiture under.
the petitioners next contend that their petition filed under n in the criminal forfeiture judgment in this case initiated a proceeding to which the seventh amendment right to jury trial attaches.therefore,they contend that the district court erred in denying their request for a jury trial.because the statute itself provides that the hearing on the petitioners petition shall be held before the court alone,without a jury,n,the petitioners,in making this argument,are challenging the constitutionality of the statutory requirement that the hearing be conducted by the court without a jury.
the seventh amendment provides 
in suits at common law,where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars,the right of trial by jury shall be preserved,and no fact tried by a jury,shall be otherwise reexamined in any court of the united states,than according to the rules of the common law.
const.amend.vii.the phrase suits at common law has been construed to refer to cases tried prior to the adoption of the seventh amendment in courts of law in which jury trial was customary as distinguished from courts of equity or admiralty in which jury trial was not.atlas roofing occupational safety health comm n,d.accordingly,both parties agree that the seventh amendment right to jury trial exists only for actions of the sort enforced at common law when the bill of rights was ratified in.see curtis loether,d see also james moore et,moore fed.practice b ed.if the issue,in its modern context,is such that it would have been heard at common law in,then it is triable by a jury as of right,and that right is constitutionally protected.
in considering whether a jury trial must be provided in a proceeding created by statute,the question comes down to whether,where the legislature has created an action unheard of at common law,the rights and remedies involved are of the sort traditionally enforced in an action at common law.united states dudley,cir.elaborating the analytical framework for determining whether a seventh amendment jury trial attaches to a proceeding created by congressional enactment,the supreme court in tull united states,d,stated 
first,we compare the statutory action to actions brought in the courts of england prior to the merger of the courts of law and equity.second,we examine the remedy sought and determine whether it is legal or equitable in nature.
internal citations omitted.the task of identifying the nearest analog to a modern statutory cause of action often invites unsatisfying comparisons to distinguishable actions existing at common law in the eighteenth century.recognizing this,the supreme court has stated 
we need not rest our conclusion on what has been called an abstruse historical search for the nearest analog.we reiterate our previously expressed view that characterizing the relief sought is m ore important than finding a precisely analogous cause of action in determining whether the seventh amendment guarantees a jury trial.
id.at.citations omitted see also chauffeurs,teamsters helpers local terry,d the second inquiry examining the remedy sought to determine whether it is legal or equitable in nature is the more important in our analysis.
in this case,the petitioners filed their petition pursuant to n,and a n petition commences a hearing ancillary to sentencing in an existing criminal action.the criminal proceeding here was the jury trial of the several counts charged in the indictment against charles mchan.as in all criminal proceedings where a jury is not waived,a jury acts as the factfinder and makes the determination whether the defendant is criminally liable.in this case,charles was convicted by a jury on,or pled guilty to,all of the criminal acts giving rise to the forfeiture.and on the criminal forfeiture count itself,for which charles was entitled to a jury trial,see.b,he waived the right to have a jury make the relevant factual determination of the nexus between the property and the criminal offenses committed,submitting to a bench trial.once the court at the bench trial determined the relevant facts on the forfeiture count,it proceeded to enter a forfeiture order as part of charles sentence.the applicable statute so provides 
the court,in imposing sentence on such person,shall order,in addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant to this subchapter or subchapter ii of this chapter,that the person forfeit to the united states all property described in this subsection.
a see also libretti,at.noting that under a forfeiture is imposed in addition to any other sentence.the remaining provisions of address the process of implementing the sentence of a forfeiture,including its execution.see also.
as relevant to this case,c provides that any of the defendant property that is subject to forfeiture on account of the defendant conviction of a drug offense can not escape forfeiture simply because the defendant transfers the forfeited property to a third party 
all right,title,and interest in property described in subsection a of this section vests in the united states upon the commission of the act giving rise to forfeiture under this section.any such property that is subsequently transferred to a person other than the defendant may be the subject of a special verdict of forfeiture and thereafter shall be ordered forfeited to the united states.
c emphasis added.that same subsection authorizes a third party wishing to challenge the forfeiture of property transferred to him to file a petition ancillary to the sentencing proceeding to establish,at a hearing,that he is a bona fide purchaser for value of such property who at the time of purchase was reasonably without cause to believe that the property was subject to forfeiture under this section.id.the procedures governing the challenge to a forfeiture order are contained in n.
this entire process,however,involves the implementation of the sentence of forfeiture.because sentencing is distinct from the criminal liability phase of trial,any factfinding at sentencing,as well as in proceedings ancillary to sentencing,is conducted by the court,not a jury.see libretti,at.our cases have made abundantly clear that a defendant does not enjoy a constitutional right to a jury determination as to the appropriate sentence to be imposed see also harris united states,d t hough the sentencing facts may have a substantial impact on the sentence,they are not elements,and are thus not subject to the constitution indictment,jury,and proof requirements.and this is what the statute explicitly provides.see n the hearing on the third party petition shall be held before the court alone,without a jury.there is simply no jury trial right in criminal sentencings nor,by extension,in proceedings ancillary to criminal sentencings.
even if the hearing ancillary to the defendant sentencing proceeding were to be analogized to an independent action,as petitioners have attempted to do,it would be most analogous to an equitable petition to quiet title to the forfeited property for which no jury was traditionally available.section describes the petition as one to adjudicate the validity of the third party alleged interest in the forfeited property,n,and the only remedy available is an order to amend the order of forfeiture to exclude the third party interests from the sentence of forfeiture based on a superior property interest,id.n.the statute provides that after the court disposes of the petition to determine the validity of title,the united states shall have clear title to property that is the subject of the resulting order of forfeiture,in this case,the order against charles.the proceeding at bottom becomes a competition over ownership priority with the court determining the superior title.
like a n proceeding,the purpose of a quiet title action is to determine which named party has superior claim to a certain piece of property.cadorette united states,cir.and although there are,to be sure,differences between a quiet title action and a n proceeding,the relief offered to a complainant in a quiet title action is substantially the same relief offered to a n petitioner.see tull,at.emphasizing that characterizing the relief sought is m ore important than finding a precisely analogous cause of action internal citation omitted see also united states gilbert,cir holding that an ancillary hearing to litigate a third party interest in property forfeited under the analogous rico forfeiture statute is essentially a quiet title proceeding.and neither action could lead to any compensatory damage award.see monterey del monte dunes at monterey,d noting the general rule that monetary relief is legal and emphasizing the distinction between compensatory legal relief and equitable restitution and other monetary remedies available in equity teamsters,at.noting that g enerally,an action for money damages was the traditional form of relief offered in the courts of law citation omitted.rather,claims for the type of relief offered by a quiet title suit have always been equitable actions,brought in the courts of equity rather than courts of law.see,arndt griggs.stating that the proposition that an action to quiet title is a suit in equity is doubtless correct humble oil refining sun oil,cir a suit to quiet title is a purely equitable proceeding,and a federal court is not required to resort to a jury,nor could it do so except for advice,although the cause was carried to the federal court from a state court in a state granting the right to jury trials in such cases harlan sparks,cir noting that the complainant suit to quiet title was essentially one in equity and concluding,therefore,that the district court properly denied the demand for trial by jury under the seventh amendment see also united states henry,wl cir,unpublished holding that a seventh amendment right to a jury trial does not attach to an ancillary proceeding under n.
the petitioners argue that a hearing under n is more analogous to an independent in rem civil forfeiture action directed against them,for which a jury trial has been afforded.see hendry moore.but this argument fails on several grounds.first,neither the criminal forfeiture this case against charles the proceeding to determine the validity of the petitioners interests under n was in rem.the criminal proceeding was in personam against charles,and the hearing to determine the validity of the petitioners property interest was also in personam.cadorette,at noting that an equitable action to quiet title was an in personam action.
second,the forfeiture action in this case was not against the petitioners or their property,but against charles.because the government concluded that charles transferred forfeited property to the petitioners,the order of forfeiture against charles was implemented against the transferred property.the government did not seek to forfeit the petitioners property it alleged rather that the property in the petitioners hands belonged to charles and was transferred to them after it was forfeited.therefore,the government contended that it could reach the forfeited property as part of the sentence of forfeiture against charles.if the petitioners were successful in establishing a cognizable ownership interest in the property under n,then they could have the property excluded from charles sentence of forfeiture.but never has the government sought to forfeit property legally belonging to the petitioners.
and third,still assuming for purposes of the petitioners argument that the proceeding under n is an independent action,we nonetheless can not ignore that the n hearing is ancillary to a sentencing proceeding.and as we have already noted,no jury trial attaches to the predicate sentencing proceeding.see libretti,at.
for all of these reasons,we conclude that a petition filed under n ancillary to a forfeiture sentencing proceeding to determine the validity of a petitioner interest in property does not commence a proceeding for which a jury trial is afforded by the seventh amendment.
finally,the petitioners challenge several determinations made by the district court about the ownership of property and its inclusion in the order of forfeiture.we address these arguments seriatim.
first,martha mchan argues that the district court clearly erred when it found that a property agreement executed by her and charles,dated december,the agreement,did not establish her entitlement to the forfeited substitute property covered by the agreement.she contends that the agreement establishes,in satisfaction of n a,that at the time of the commission of the relevant criminal acts,she was a of the property.
the agreement provides in relevant part 
any personal property titled in either charles mchan or martha mchan shall be deemed to be equally owned by the other regardless of how titled.
charles mchan and martha mchan shall have no rights whatsoever to any real or personal property owned or held in trust for charles mchan or john mchan.
charles mchan and martha mchan sometimes take title to property as trustee.both shall have equal ownership in this type of ownership.
this contract or agreement shall be binding upon both parties and shall remain in effect unless further agreements and contracts are entered into changing the terms of such.
based on substantial contextual evidence,the district court found that the agreement was likely created by the defendant charles in order to avoid forfeiture and long after defendant testimony contra is not credible.the court also found that because the record in this particular case is replete with evidence that defendant charles falsified real estate records and transactions and engaged in money laundering and bank fraud,the agreement is entitled to little weight.
the record in this case amply supports the district court conclusion.the agreement was just one of a sea of fraudulent documents uncovered.we find no clear error in the determinations made by the district court in concluding that martha failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she had a title or interest in the properties covered by the agreement that was superior to charles title or interest at the time of his criminal conduct.
the petitioners also contend that property acquired by them both directly and indirectly by way of a series of three agreements,all dated july,between charles and martha mchan is not subject to forfeiture pursuant to n b because they are bona fide purchasers for value of the property and were reasonably without cause to believe that it was subject to forfeiture.the government contends that the record supports that the petitioners did not meet their burden under n b in two respects the petitioners failed to show that any transfers of property were for value,and they failed to demonstrate that they were without knowledge of the forfeiture.
the district court found that the petitioners were not bona fide purchasers for value because the agreements,even if authentic,were concededly not arm length transactions.the district court also inferred from the evidence that the agreements were,in fact,an attempt by the defendant charles to avoid forfeiture.it pointed particularly to the suspicious and convenient timing of the agreements 
notably,petitioners only tendered one part of the agreements during discovery.the other two parts of the agreement were not disclosed until july.in addition,petitioners never explained how or why the other two parts of the agreement were not disclosed earlier.the delay in recording the purported assignments is likewise significant.this court has also found that martha had little understanding of the agreement,relied exclusively on defendant to value the properties,equitably apportion them,and execute all transactions necessary to carry out the terms of the agreement.petitioners lack of knowledge was also evident by their reliance on defendant during the ancillary proceeding.in addition,this court has not reject ed the government argument that both the and agreements were shams.
addressing the government argument that the agreements dated july,represented fraudulent transfers,the district court found that the government has the better arguments and the better facts.
in the context of all the evidence contained in the record,we can not conclude that the district court clearly erred in finding that the agreements dated july,were not made at arm length and that they constituted a deliberate attempt by charles to avoid the economic impact of forfeiture.
martha mchan contends that it was clear error for the district court to find that of the accumulated and futu
