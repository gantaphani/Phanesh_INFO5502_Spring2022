the plaintiff,a real estate developer,brought suit for damages against the city of greenwood,indiana,under,charging violations of the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the city,and the developer has appealed.the facts,which concern events that occurred in,are not in dispute.the plaintiff had signed a contract to buy acres adjoining the city for development as a residential subdivision.for such development to be possible,the plaintiff had to get the city to annex the acreage and rezone it from agricultural to residential use.the contract was made conditional on the plaintiff obtaining these legal changes from the city.
the authority of the city council of greenwood to make such changes is not contested.the plaintiff had first,however,to submit its proposal to the city plan commission.the commission did like the proposal and recommended that the city council turn it down.the council convened a public hearing,and after discussion voted on the plaintiff proposal.the vote was.the council has seven members,but one was absent.state law provides that a mayor,although he shall preside at meetings of his city council,may vote only to break a tie.b.but since there was a tie,the mayor of greenwood grant the plaintiff application.a member of the council objected,pointing out that an ordinance of greenwood required a vote to overturn a recommendation of the plan commission.the state zoning statute,however,provides that a city council or other legislative body may take action only by a vote of at least a majority of all the elected members of the body.b.moreover,if there is a constitutional or statutory provision requiring a specific manner for exercising a power,a unit wanting to exercise the power must do so in that manner.a.
the council directed the city attorney to research the legality of the ordinance in light of these statutory provisions.she did so and advised the council that in her opinion the requirement was invalid because inconsistent with still another indiana statute,which provides that a majority vote of the legislative body is required to pass an ordinance,unless a greater vote is required by statute.a public hearing was convened at which the council debated the issue and concluded that the ordinance requirement was valid,noting among other reasons for so concluding that the state statute s could be interpreted as making a majority vote a floor rather than also a ceiling.yet having so concluded and having gone on to decide that since the requirement was valid the plaintiff application had been validly denied,the council forthwith repealed the requirement with respect to future decisions on recommendations of the plan commission approvals would henceforth require only a simple majority.
the mayor advised the plaintiff to make some changes in its application and resubmit it to the plan commission,which was done and this time the commission recommended that the council approve the plaintiff application.the council convened another public hearing to consider the matter.at this meeting the third on the plaintiff application,with all members present,the council voted down the application by a vote,precipitating this suit.as a result of the council action the contract lapsed and the plaintiff did get to develop the acres we learned at argument that another developer later received the approval that the plaintiff had sought and that the tract is now indeed a residential subdivision.
the city argues that the majority vote against the plaintiff application in the last meeting makes the lawsuit moot.since a majority of the council voted down the application when the plan commission had approved it and by a lopsided vote of,how likely is it that the council,had it not been for the absence of one of its members,would have approved it earlier when the plan commission had recommended against approval not as unlikely as may seem,because the council member who had missed the first vote voted in favor of the application at the final hearing and might have done so at the first meeting despite the adverse recommendation of the plan commission and the fact that the plaintiff had sweetened its application between the first and third hearings.but it does matter how likely or unlikely this was.for what the plaintiff is seeking is a determination that the first vote taken by the council,the one that approved the plaintiff application though by less than a vote,was valid,in which event there would have been no second,negative vote.in effect,there was a change in membership between the two votes the mayor,in the first vote,was replaced in the second vote by the member of the city council who had been absent when the first vote was taken,and the plaintiff is arguing that the change violated the fourteenth amendment and therefore should have no legal effect.and if it has no legal effect,only the vote approving the plaintiff application is in the picture.it is thus like a case in which the plaintiff loses a bench trial and argues that he was entitled to a jury trial his appeal is not moot even if the appellate court is confident that a jury would have come to the same conclusion as the trial judge.
so let us turn to the merits of the appeal,beginning with the due process issue.there is an initial question whether the plaintiff was deprived of property within the meaning of the due process clause when the city council turned down its application for annexation and rezoning.were the plaintiff complaining of being deprived of the acres that it had contracted to buy,the complaint might fail,as in bryan city of madison,cir,because a contract to buy something is not tantamount to ownership of the thing.but the plaintiff was deprived of a contract right,and so we must ask when does a contract right rise to the dignity of constitutional property it is settled that the right not to be fired without right that employment contracts terminable before the expiration of their term only for cause constitutional property.board of regents roth,d.but the status of other contract rights other than a contractual right merely to procedural protections,which has uniformly been held not to create constitutional property,campbell city of champaign,cir,and cases cited there is unsettled,though most cases to address the issue reject the position that all contract rights are constitutional property.glatt chicago park,cir bernard united township high school dist,cir construction housing authority of city of camden,cir martz incorporated village of valley stream,cir san bernardino physicians services medical group,county of san bernardino,cir but see general electric new york state of labor,cir.these cases reflect a natural reluctance to port the entire body of disputes arising from the public contracts of the states to federal court.the difficult question is where within the universe of such contracts to draw the line.waste systems,city of gary,cir.
as an original matter,one might suppose property limited to interests that the law protects by means of injunctions or criminal prosecutions,and of course the normal remedy for a breach of contract is merely an award of damages.the contract promisor is free to walk away from his contract,leaving the promisee with merely a money claim but he is not free to steal the promisee vase and say,it mine for keeps but you can sue me for the dollar value of it.the roth line of cases is based,however,on the idea of the new property that in a modern society a person principal assets are intangible and that one of the most valuable of these is the job security conferred by a contract of employment terminable before its term is up only for cause.at the opposite extreme would be a contract that had merely granted the plaintiff an right to assert a right and thus,it might be thought,an interest so tenuous as to be remote from property that one clings to because it is valuable or one is committed.in,board of commissioners,cir,we left open the question whether an option is constitutional property.
the plaintiff contract to buy the acres was not an option the plaintiff was com
