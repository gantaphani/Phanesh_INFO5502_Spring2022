plaintiff,sandra morris,appeals from the district court judgment granting the motion for judgment as a matter of law in favor of defendant,stores,at the close of plaintiff in this negligence action wherein plaintiff seeks damages from defendant for the injuries that she allegedly sustained as a result of a slip and fall on defendant premises.because we believe that when viewing the evidence and all permissible inferences most favorably for plaintiff,there is material evidence to support a verdict for plaintiff,we reverse the district court order and remand the case for trial.
background 
on september,plaintiff and her husband,michael morris morris,were shopping at defendant sam club store located in memphis,tennessee.morris was pushing the shopping cart and plaintiff was slightly behind morris on his left hand side.the two were walking through the freezer section of the store when,after rounding a corner,plaintiff slipped on a wet substance thought to be water and fell next to a small portable freezer known as a spot box.at the time of her fall,plaintiff was between morris and the spot box.morris noticed plaintiff feet go up as she fell while hitting the spot box and the cart that morris had been pushing.according to morris,in the course of the fall plaintiff struck her legs on the spot box and shopping cart,landed on her lower back and buttocks,and then lay completely flat.plaintiff attempted to pull herself up using the cart that morris was holding,but slipped up and fell a second time.plaintiff was allegedly screaming as these events occurred,and described the fall as violent.at.
some of defendant employees approached the scene to lend assistance.once plaintiff was finally standing up,she noticed that her clothes were soaked,including her shoes.plaintiff testified that she believed that the liquid in which she fell was water from the spot box freezer.plaintiff claimed that the water felt cold,but was unsure whether the cold feeling was attributable to the water temperature itself or to the surroundings inasmuch as she was in the freezer section of the store.one of the employees called for store manager kenneth kanizar,who arrived on the scene shortly thereafter.kanizar ordered an employee to get a mop and clean up the liquid.defendant employee betty baird testified that she was the individual who cleaned up the water after plaintiff fell.baird stated that she used some paper towels to clean up the water which,by that time,was about ten inches in diameter and r ight there under the drain of the freezer.at.
kanizar took a statement from plaintiff,which was written by morris and signed by plaintiff.the statement provided by plaintiff at the time of the fall was read into evidence at trial and provided turned corner in frozen food area and fall sic in water leaking from display.injured both knees,toes,back,hip,right hip,and swelling in both legs.at.
plaintiff testified that kanizar communicated to them that it was his belief that the liquid substance present on the floor was water that had leaked from the spot box freezer.kanizar pointed out to plaintiff and morris that the plug on the bottom of the spot box freezer was out.at.kanizar further communicated to plaintiff and morris that the spot box freezer was new and that he was afraid that it may not be functioning properly so he wanted it immediately removed from the floor,particularly since it had not been out but a very short period of time.at.
morris escorted plaintiff out of the store in a wheel chair provided by defendant,and took her to a hospital emergency room.plaintiff was discharged from the hospital after were taken and medication was prescribed for the pain.the following day plaintiff was severely bruised and could barely walk.at.she saw her doctor who advised plaintiff to stay in bed and off of her feet for a week plaintiff complied with her doctor advice.
plaintiff filed this negligence action against defendant in the circuit court of shelby county,tennessee on june,and defendant removed the matter to the united states district court for the western district of tennessee on august,on the basis of diversity of citizenship jurisdiction under a.thereafter,the parties consented to the case being tried by a united states magistrate judge pursuant to b,and the case proceeded to trial.following plaintiff,defendant moved for judgment as a matter of law,claiming that plaintiff failed to proffer evidence to show that defendant had notice,actual or constructive,of the water,and that plaintiff could not rely upon the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur inasmuch as plaintiff failed to demonstrate that defendant was in exclusive control of the spot box freezer.plaintiff argued that she was not attempting to show notice,and in fact admitted that she could not prove notice.rather,plaintiff claimed that she proffered evidence to show that defendant created the dangerous condition by placing the new spot box out without a plug in it,and also argued that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applied.the district court took defendant motion under advisement.
the next day,the district court granted defendant motion on the record finding that plaintiff failed to present sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that defendant created the dangerous condition,and that while the evidence did indicate that the spot box freezer had been in defendant control,the evidence did not demonstrate that the spot box had been in defendant exclusive control for purposes of invoking the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.judgment was entered in favor of defendant,and it is from this judgment dismissing plaintiff case upon defendant motion for judgment as a matter of law that plaintiff now appeals.
discussion 
in a diversity case,when a rule motion for judgment as a matter of law is based on a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence,we apply the standard of review used by the courts of the state whose substantive law governs the matter.morales am.honda motor,cir.here,tennessee law governs the substance of the matter,and under tennessee law,when considering a motion for a directed verdict in a jury case,the trial court must consider the evidence most favorably for the plaintiff,allow all reasonable inferences in plaintiff favor and disregard all counteracting evidence,and,so considered,if there is any material evidence to support a verdict for plaintiff,the court must deny the motion.city of columbia const.
to establish negligence,one must prove a duty of care owed by defendant to plaintiff conduct falling below the applicable standard of care that amounts to a breach of that duty an injury or loss cause in fact and proximate,or legal,cause.mcclung delta square,citing mccall wilder.in the context of a premises liability case,the tennessee courts have stated that a business owner breaches the duty of care owed to its customers when it allows a dangerous condition or defect to exist on the premises if that condition or defect was created by the owner,operator or his agent or,if the condition is created by someone else,when the business owner had actual or constructive notice that the dangerous condition or defect existed prior to the injury.see hardesty serv.merch,chambliss shoney,benson hill stores,jones zayre,paradiso kroger.
in the matter at hand,plaintiff counsel argued in response to defendant motion for judgment as a matter of law that plaintiff had presented sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to infer that defendant had breached its duty to plaintiff by creating the dangerous condition 
by putting out their sic new spot is in the a plug in is in the which directly there was an issue of water.that is in the record.my client did put it out there.we do know who put it out there.i think the jury can draw an inference from the testimony that it was new,that is sic was put out there without somebody checking the plug,which is exactly what i think they the jury would have drawn.
at.counsel for plaintiff went on to explain that 
this is a res ipsa case.it is a box in the exclusive control of the defendant,which had it been put out there with the standard of care required,would not have been dangerous.in other words,it caused,but for the negligence of the defendant,this normally dangerous product became a dangerous product.and that is the res ipsa instruction.i would submit that it is a res ipsa case.
at.simply stated,through the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur,plaintiff sought to prove that defendant breached the duty of care owed to her by creating the dangerous condition,the water on the floor in front of the open freezer plug,which thereby caused her injuries.
the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is well steeped in tennessee law.see casenburg lewis.the doctrine is a rule of evidence,not a rule of law.quinley cocke,overruled on other grounds,seavers methodist med.ctr.of oak ridge.that is,the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is intended to assist a plaintiff who has no direct evidence of a defendant negligence,provident life accident ins.prof l cleaning,by providing a specialized vehicle for considering circumstantial evidence in negligence cases.poor sisters of francis long,overruled on other grounds,seavers.the doctrine allows for an inference of negligence where the jury has a common knowledge or understanding that events which resulted in the plaintiff injury do not ordinarily occur unless someone was negligent.seavers,at citations omitted.the weight of any inference to be drawn from the evidence is for the determination of the jury.seavers,at citing franklin collins chapel connectional.
in seavers methodist medical center of oak ridge,the tennessee supreme court stated that in order to invoke the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur,the plaintiff must demonstrate that he or she was injured by an instrumentality that was within the defendant exclusive control and that the injury would not ordinarily have occurred in the absence of negligence.at citing provident life accident ins,at sullivan crabtree.however,over thirty years before seavers was decided,the tennessee supreme court strongly questioned the exclusive control element of the application of res ipsa loquitur.that is,in provident life accident,at hereinafter provident,the case upon which seavers relied,the tennessee supreme court did indeed provide the definition of res ipsa loquitur as requiring that the instrumentality be in the exclusive control of the defendant however,this definition was juxtaposed against a definition of res ipsa loquitur wherein exclusive control was not required in order for the doctrine to apply.see at.specifically,the provident court compared the definitions of res ipsa loquitur as follows 
the rule of res ipsa loquitur has been defined in our cases in two general ways.in north memphis savings bank union bridge construction,it was defined thusly 
where the evidence shows an injury inflicted,and also the physical thing inflicting it,and that thing does not usually,or in the ordinary course,produce such a result where due care is exercised by those in charge of it,it may be inferred that those so in charge of the thing inflicting the injury failed to exercise such due care that is,that they were guilty of negligence.
the second general definition is found in the case of sullivan crabtree,
w here the thing causing the harm is shown to be under the management of defendant or his servants,and the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the management use proper care,it affords reasonable evidence,in the absence of explanation by the defendants,that the accident arose from want of care.
provident,at alterations in provident.
significantly,after providing these two definitions,the provident court went on to note that many academicians such as prosser found fault with the word control when defining res ipsa loquitur,and specifically looked to the restatement second on torts in finding corroboration of prosser idea that control in the defendant is not a necessary element of the definition of res ipsa loquitur.provident,at.borrowing from the restatement second,the provident court opined 
it is not,however,necessary to the inference of negligence that the defendant have such exclusive control and exclusive control is merely one way of proving his responsibility.he may be responsible,and the inference may be drawn against him,where he shares control with another,where he is under a duty to the plaintiff which he can not delegate to another,and where he is under a duty to control the conduct of a third person it may be enough that the defendant was formally in control exclusive control is merely one fact which establishes the responsibility of the defendant and if it can be established otherwise,exclusive control is not essential to a res ipsa loquitur case.the essential question becomes one of whether the probable cause is one which the defendant was under a duty to the plaintiff to anticipate or guard against.
at quoting restatement second,torts.having recognized the two definitions of res ipsa loquitur,and specifically the distinction between the two defendant exclusive control over the instrumentality,the provident court embraced the following general rule 
the general rule for all cases of circumstantial ordinary cases and res ipsa loquitur that to make out his case,plaintiff does not have to eliminate all other possible causes or inferences than that of defendant negligence but it is enough if the evidence for him makes such negligence more probable than any other cause.

thus,although in seavers the tennessee supreme court decided to cite as controlling law one of the definitions of res ipsa loquitur provided in definition incorporating the requirement of exclusive control,it is clear that the exclusive control requirement was criticized by the provident court.see seavers,at provident,at.indeed,since seavers,while exclusive control has been recognized as a factor in the application of the res ipsa loquitur doctrine,it has also been noted that 
t he exclusive control element of the res ipsa loquitur doctrine,if read too literally,is overly restrictive.res ipsa loquitur can not be applied unless the circumstances surrounding the injury indicate that the causal negligence was probably the defendant,not that of another person.evidence that the plaintiff was injured by an instrumentality that was within the defendant exclusive control at the time is sufficient for this purpose.however,proving a defendant exclusive control of an instrumentality when an injury occurs is not the only way to demonstrate the defendant responsibility for the negligence tennessee courts do not view exclusive control as indispensable to the application of the res ipsa loquitur doctrine.
burton warren farmers,wl,at,citations omitted.
the burton court also recognized that t he res ipsa loquitur doctrine is primarily useful in jury trials inasmuch as it provides a trial court with the framework for determining whether the plaintiff evidence entitles him or her to get to the jury.id.citations omitted.in this regard,the court opined 
the role of the trial court is to determine whether the plaintiff evidence is sufficient to permit a reasonable person to infer from the circumstances that negligence attributable to the defendant caused the plaintiff injury.if the answer is no,the trial court may direct a verdict for the defendant.if the answer is yes,then the plaintiff can weather a motion for directed verdict,and the case will be submitted to the jury for it to decide whether to choose the inference of the defendant causal negligence or some other permissible or reasonable inference.
id.citations and footnotes omitted.the court further opined in this regard that a trial court may decline to submit a claim based on res ipsa loquitur theory to the jury if there is simply not enough experience to justify an inference that the defendant negligence,more probably than not,caused the plaintiff injury or if,in the court experience,it was not more probable that the plaintiff injury was caused by negligence.id.at citing dan dobbs,the law of torts,at.
against this backdrop of tennessee law,we conclude that the district court erred in granting defendant motion for judgment as matter of law at the close of plaintiff.when construing the evidence most favorably for plaintiff,material evidence was presented to support a verdict for plaintiff,and judgment as a matter of law therefore should not have been entered against her.see city of columbia,at.
as plaintiff argued before the district court,based upon the testimony presented at trial,a reasonable jury could conclude that defendant placed the new spot box freezer in the aisle without the plug properly secured thereby allowing water to leak from the freezer and thus creating the dangerous condition which lead to plaintiff fall and injury.for example,plaintiff testified that the substance likely was water,that it was directly in front of the freezer plug,and that it felt cold to the touch.testimony was also presented that manager kanizar communicated to plaintiff and morris that the substance on the floor likely was water and that it had leaked from the spot box freezer.the written statement provided by plaintiff and morris at the scene also supported the claim that the water upon which plaintiff slipped and fell had been leaking from the spot box freezer.kanizar further communicated to plaintiff and morris that the spot box freezer was new,that he feared that it may not be functioning properly,and that he was therefore going to immediately remove the box from the floor.finally,defendant employee baird,who wiped up the remaining water,stated that the puddle of water was about ten inches in diameter and r ight there under the drain of the freezer.at.
the district court failed to view this evidence and all of its permissible inferences most favorably for plaintiff when it granted defendant motion for judgment as a matter of law.for example,in concluding that plaintiff case failed inasmuch as plaintiff failed to demonstrate that the spot freezer had been in defendant exclusive control for purposes of invoking the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur,the district court looked to the universe of possibilities as to how the spot freezer may have been left unplugged and allowed to leak.the district court erred in this regard inasmuch as the provident court clearly instructs that 
t he general rule for all cases of circumstantial ordinary cases and res ipsa loquitur that to make out his case,plaintiff does not have to eliminate all other possible causes or inferences than that of defendant negligence but it is enough if the evidence for him makes such negligence more probable than any other cause.
at citations omitted emphasis added.and,as the burton court instructs,a trial court may not grant a defendant motion for directed verdict in a res ipsa loquitur case if the plaintiff evidence is sufficient to permit a reasonable person to infer from the circumstances that negligence attributable to the defendant caused the plaintiff injury.wl,at citing restatement second of torts.
as noted above,we find that plaintiff evidence,particularly when viewed most favorably for plaintiff,was sufficient allow a reasonable trier of fact to infer that defendant negligence in placing the new spot box freezer without the plug properly inserted,thus allowing water to leak therefrom,created the condition which caused plaintiff to fall and be injured.simply stated,the district court took an overly restrictive approach when deciding that the spot box was in the exclusive control of defendant,and failed to view the evidence in general most favorably for plaintiff.see id.of course,defendant is free to renew its motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of its proofs and,in light of evidence presented by defendant,it may be proper for the district court to grant the motion at that time.see id.at.however,at this point of the trial proceedings,we hold that the district court erred in granting defendant motion for judgment as a matter of law.
the negligence cases cited at length by the dissent are legally and factually distinguishable from the case before us,and thus do nothing to command a different outcome.specifically,the tennessee cases cited by the dissent support the proposition that exclusive control over an instrumentality is required in order to satisfy res ipsa loquitur.however,where the correctness of granting a motion for judgment as a matter of law is at issue,it is inappropriate to conclude that res ipsa loquitur does not apply when factual disputes remain as to how the accident occurred and whether the instrumentality was in the defendant control.because such factual disputes remain in this case,the application of res ipsa loquitur is a question for the jury to decide.
conclusion 
for the reasons,we reverse the district court judgment granting defendant motion for judgment as a matter of law,and remand the matter for trial.
in this slip and fall case,the panel majority has determined that sandra morris has proved negligence pursuant to the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur to reverse the district court award of judgment as a matter of law to.unfortunately,the majority conclusion disregards the controlling weight of existing tennessee law applying the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur to circumstances where the instrumentality that caused injury was purportedly under the exclusive control and management of the defendant and where the injury would not have occurred in the ordinary course of events if the defendant had used reasonable care and where the defendant failed to offer an explanation or proof that the injury was not caused by the defendant exercise of due care over an instrumentality it purportedly exclusively controlled.accordingly,i respectfully dissent.
morris averred that while shopping with her husband in the section of a sam club store she slipped and fell in water puddled near the open drain plug of a display cooler.the district court rejected as highly speculative the plaintiff assertion that the cooler,here in issue,which was located in a public area within a commercial space,was exclusively controlled by defendant,concluding that such causal uncertainty could not bring the claim within the orbit of res ipsa loquitur.specifically,plaintiff inability to prove that exercised exclusive control of the cooler was fatal to her prima facie case,disallowing the application of the reduced evidentiary burden afforded by the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.
relying on provident life acc.ins.professional cleaning service,the majority has argued that it is enough for the application of res ipsa loquitur that,more probably than not,controlled the instrumentality that caused morris injury.the majority reaches that conclusion without considering several decisions of the tennessee courts mandating a stringent proof requirement of exclusive control as a shield against unreasonable jury speculation in cases,such as the one before this appellate panel,predicated on scant circumstantial evidence of causal injury in a busy public arena.provident life is inapposite to the instant case,involving as it did the question of whether a cleaning service,the sole occupants of a closed office building at,had negligently started a fire in an elevator while performing its cleaning duties.contrary to the present dispute,the conclusion that the cleaning service in provident life had exclusive control of the involved no speculation.consequently,the majority application of provident life to the instant case has imprudently released morris from the necessary burden of proving a causal nexus between the offending cooler and defendant alleged negligence.
res ipsa loquitur is a form of circumstantial evidence allowing a plaintiff,upon proof of a prima facie case,to infer the defendant negligence from the occurrence of an injury.quinley cocke,considering the res ipsa doctrine as one of evidence and not of substantive law seavers methodist med.ctr.of oak ridge.however,a jury can not presume a defendant negligence from the fact of an injury alone.id.application of the doctrine requires the injury,to have been caused by some thing,under the exclusive control of the defendant,and,which by its nature does not ordinarily result in injury when managed carefully armes hulett,affirming summary judgment for defendant and finding res ipsa loquitur inapplicable where the defective pipe was not under the management or control of defendant plumber.if the plaintiff injury could reasonably have occurred even without the defendant negligence then the doctrine is inapplicable.cockrum state,brown university nursing home.
as a means of avoiding jury speculation tennessee courts have adhered to the rule that sole control by the defendant of the allegedly offending instrumentality is an essential element of the res ipsa loquitur doctrine.towle phillips,sustaining defendant motion for a directed verdict in an airplane accident in which the plane provided dual controls thus barring the application of res ipsa loquitur.within the context of res ipsa loquitur,
it is not necessary that the defendant have control of the object at the time of the injury,but it is sufficient if he had exclusive control when the acts apparently causing the injury occurred,provided the plaintiff show that the condition of the object or its contents had not been changed after it left the defendant possession.
boykin chase bottling works,declining to find exclusive control over a bottle that exploded when removed from an ice box in defendant restaurant as customers regularly served themselves from the icebox and third parties had access to the icebox and its contents.in the instant case,morris provided no evidence that had exclusive control over the cooler.
as in boykin,customers in the case sub judice,had full access to the cooler and its contents.morris averred no proof that excluded the possibility of third party interference in dislodging the cooler drain plug.morris had the burden of proving that either her actions or those of a third party did not contribute to or cause the alleged incident.appellant did not meet this burden and,consequently,the district court did not err in refusing to apply the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.southern bell,noting that res ipsa is not applicable to a slip and fall case and directing a verdict for the defendant.
from the plaintiff proffered evidence a jury could not reasonably infer that acted negligently.yet,bootstrapping such an inference as the majority has done by lowering the standard of proof necessary for res ipsa loquitur undermines the state system of tort liability based on fault.lamb state,no,wl.as the district court noted in oral hearing,morris testimony that he observed the plug to the cooler not completely closed,falls short of the necessary proof of exclusive control 
h ere the jury would have to speculate as to whether sam club or its employees removed the plug or failed to insert it properly.it is just as reasonable a conclusion that a customer could have removed it.this spot freezer was accessible to customers,the plug was near the base of the freezer.it was low to the ground.it was in the reach of children,children could have removed it.for all i know,it could have easily been bumped by a shopping cart when a customer turned the aisle and became dislodged in this manner.
tennessee courts have long maintained a consistent rule against jury speculation in their res ipsa loquitur decisions while juries may draw inferences,tennessee has recognized an inference can be drawn only from the facts in evidence,and can not be based on surmise,speculation,conjecture,or guess.benton snyder.n or is a jury permitted to speculate or guess as to the proximate cause of injury.moon johnston.valid and reasonable inferences must make the existence of the fact to be inferred more probable than the nonexistence of the fact.underwood hca health servs.of.when two equally possible inferences exist,a jury can not employ,as the majority opinion allows,guesswork,speculation,or conjecture to decide a case.stringer cooper.the plaintiff bears the burden of proving her case and when two probabilities are at most evenly balanced,the court must direct a verdict for the defendant.as the tennessee supreme court observed in lindsey miami dev,
the plaintiff must introduce evidence which affords a reasonable basis for the conclusion that it is more likely than not that the conduct of the defendant was a cause in fact of the result.a mere possibility of such causation is not enough and when the matter remains one of pure speculation or conjecture or the probabilities are at best evenly balanced,it becomes the duty of the court to direct a verdict for the defendant.

the record before this court indicated nothing more than the possibility that the defendant might have had control of the cooler.the plaintiff introduced no evidence to allay the district court reasonable concern for the equivalent possibility of alternative causes for the puddle of water that precipitated plaintiff injury.without addressing the possible contribution of customer conduct in the store the appellant could not develop the necessary proof of defendant control over the cooler and the district court determination merely acknowledged this legal inadequacy.contrary to the majority opinion,tennessee courts recognize that in instances such as the case sub judice,proof of causation equating to a possibility is not sufficient as a matter of law to establish the required nexus between the plaintiff injury and the defendant presumed tortious conduct by a preponderance of the evidence.lindsey,at.see also,white methodist hosp.south.causation in fact is a matter of probability and as the court in lindsey affirmed,a mere possibility is not an affirmative basis for a finding of fact in the language of the law of evidence,that which is merely possible,standing alone and not offered as auxiliary or rebuttal testimony is immaterial to the ascertainment of the fact and so is inadmissible as evidence of that fact.id.
in the instant case,the appellant did not call any associates to testify that the plug was not properly inserted,nor did she introduce any expert testimony in an effort to prove that failed to insure that the drain was properly plugged.moreover,the appellant did not provide evidence of the length of time the hazard was present on the store floor,or of prior or constructive knowledge among personnel.finally,morris produced no evidence that a customer could not have dislodged the plug prior to the incident.as a result,the district court properly concluded that a reasonable jury could not be permitted to speculate that negligence created the hazard.
the salient facts of the case sub judice are analogous to underwood hca health services of tennessee.underwood brought a negligence action against the defendant cafeteria alleging injury when an ice dispenser cover struck her.id.at.the court affirmed underwood directed verdict,because the plaintiff failed to introduce any proof that the defendant employees,rather than the customers accessing the ice dispenser,caused the panel to become dislodged.in a statement,echoed by the district court in the case sub judice,the underwood court noted that 
in order to determine that the hospital was negligent,the would be required to speculate whether the hospital employees created the condition or whether it was caused by cafeteria customers.if the condition was caused by customers,the fact finder would be required to speculate whether the condition had existed long enough to have been discovered and corrected had the hospital been maintaining the dispenser properly.
id.at.the district court,in the instant case,properly noted that res ipsa loquitur should not apply in the absence of evidence which would prevent a jury from having to speculate over whether the cooler drain plug had become dislodged by appellee,a customer,a child or a shopping ca
