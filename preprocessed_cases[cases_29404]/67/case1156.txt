the complaint is a hideous sprawling mess,pages in length with paragraphs of allegations.we have found it difficult and in many instances impossible to ascertain the nature of the charges.it would have been better had the defendants deferred their motion,and the district judge his ruling,until either the defendants served contention interrogatories designed to smoke out what exactly the plaintiffs are charging,or better,because quicker and cheaper,the judge told the plaintiffs to specify the acts of the defendants that they are complaining about so that he could decide how much of the complaint was preempted.still,the defendants can hardly be blamed for wanting to strangle the monster in its crib.
ocwen,the principal defendant and the only one we need discuss the other defendant is a law firm charged with having assisted ocwen in the misconduct of which the plaintiffs complain,was at the times relevant to this case a federal savings and loan association engaged in servicing home mortgages originated by other lenders.when a loan is secured by a mortgage,the borrower may be asked to sign various transfer agreements that allow the mortgagee to assign not only the mortgage itself but also or instead various rights that the mortgage grants the mortgagee,such as the rights to collect monthly payments from the mortgagor,collect late payments from him,foreclose in the event of default,or place the mortgagor payments for taxes and insurance premiums in escrow.the administration of these rights is called servicing the mortgage.if the firm doing the servicing,such as ocwen in this case,exceeds its rights under the transfer agreements,the mortgagor recourse is against that firm rather than against the original mortgagee or the current holder of the mortgage.see ots regulatory handbook thrift activities,www.ots.gov docs.pdf visited june,mortgage servicing rights traded like baseball cards,www.mortgage newsdaily.com asp visited june.
enacted in,hola is a product of the great depression of the,and was intended to provide emergency relief with respect to home mortgage indebtedness at a time when as many as half of all home loans in the country were in default.fidelity federal savings loan ass de la cuesta,d citations omitted.hola empowered what is now the office of thrift supervision in the treasury department to authorize the creation of federal savings and loan associations,to regulate them,and by its regulations to preempt conflicting state law.id.at.ocwen has given up its federal thrift charter but this does not affect its defense that when it committed the acts for which the plaintiffs are suing any claims based on those acts were preempted.

c state laws that are not preempted.state laws of the following types are not preempted to the extent that they only incidentally affect the lending operations of federal savings associations or are otherwise consistent with the purposes of paragraph a of this section 
contract and commercial law 
real property law 
homestead laws specified in f 
criminal law and 
any other law that ots,upon review,finds 
i furthers a vital state interest and 
ii either has only an incidental effect on lending operations or is not otherwise contrary to the purposes expressed in paragraph a of this section.
ocwen makes much of the fact that the office of thrift supervision has said that in applying the regulation a court should first decide whether the state law in question is listed in subsection b and,if so,ocwen argues,that is the end of the case.ots final rule.well,of course.and the ots statement further explains that subsection c,the list of laws that are not preempted,is designed merely to preserve the traditional infrastructure of basic state laws that undergird commercial transactions,not to open the door to state regulation of lending by federal savings associations.id.the list in subsection c is long and the categories it and commercial law,tort law,and so very broad.it would not do to let the broad standards characteristic of such fields morph into a scheme of state regulation of federal s ls.hence the statement in subsection c that state laws escape preemption only to the extent that they only incidentally affect the lending operations of federal savings associations or are otherwise consistent with the purposes of paragraph a of this section.see also bank of america city county of san francisco,cir haehl washington mutual bank,d,barnett bank of marion county,nelson,d.
the line between subsections b and c is both intuitive and reasonably clear.the office of thrift supervision has exclusive authority to regulate the savings and loan industry in the sense of fixing fees including penalties,setting licensing requirements,prescribing certain terms in mortgages,establishing requirements for disclosure of credit information to customers,and setting standards for processing and servicing mortgages.see,ots final rule,supra.at.but though it has some prosecutorial and adjudicatory powers ancillary to its regulatory functions,d simpson office of thrift supervision,cir,the office has no power to adjudicate disputes between the s ls and their customers.see ots,how to resolve a consumer complaint,www.ots.gov docs.pdf visited june.so it can not provide a remedy to persons injured by wrongful acts of savings and loan associations,and furthermore hola creates no private right to sue to enforce the provisions of the statute or the ots regulations.burns int l western savings loan ass n,cir.
against this background of limited remedial authority,we read subsection c to mean that ots assertion of plenary regulatory authority does not deprive persons harmed by the wrongful acts of savings and loan associations of their basic state remedies.suppose an s l signs a mortgage agreement with a homeowner that specifies an annual interest rate of percent and a year later bills the homeowner at a rate of percent and when the homeowner refuses to pay institutes foreclosure proceedings.it would be surprising for a federal regulation to forbid the homeowner state to give the homeowner a defense based on the mortgagee breach of contract.or if the mortgagee or a servicer like ocwen fraudulently represents to the mortgagor that it will forgive a default,and then forecloses,it would be surprising for a federal regulation to bar a suit for fraud.some federal laws do create such bars,notably erisa,see a,e,but this is recognized as exceptional.american airlines,wolens,d mcclendon,d.enforcement of state law in either of the examples above would complement rather than substitute for the federal regulatory scheme.
this is well explained in preemption of state laws applicable to credit card transactions iic opinion of ots chief counsel,wl 
state laws prohibiting deceptive acts and practices in the course of commerce are not included in the illustrative list of preempted laws in b the indiana dap deceptive acts and practices statute prohibits specified acts and representations in all consumer transactions without regard to whether the transaction involves an extension of credit.although not directly aimed at lenders,this law affects lending to the extent that it prohibits misleading statements and practices in loan transactions by a federal savings association.accordingly,a presumption arises that the dap statute would be preempted in connection with loans made by the association.
the ots has indicated,however,that it does not intend to preempt state laws that establish the basic norms that undergird commercial transactions the indiana dap falls within the category of traditional contract and commercial law under c.while the dap may affect lending relationships,the impact on lending appears to be only incidental to the primary purpose of the regulation of the ethical practices of all businesses engaged in commerce in indiana.there is no indication that the law is aimed at any state objective in conflict with the safe and sound regulation of federal savings associations,the best practices of thrift institutions in the united states,or any other federal objective identified in a.in fact,because federal thrifts are presumed to interact with their borrowers in a truthful manner,indiana general prohibition on deception should have no measurable impact on their lending operations.accordingly,we conclude that the indiana dap is not preempted by federal law.

we must decide,insofar as it is possible to do so with only the complaint to go on,which claims fall on the regulatory side of the ledger and which,for want of a better term,fall on the common law side.
the first pages of the complaint accuse ocwen of a variety of skullduggery,but do not indicate which bad acts are being charged as a violation of federal law and which as a violation of state law.beginning at the bottom of page,however,the complaint lists the actual claims and indicates,though murkily,which are federal and which are state law claims.the first apparent state law claim is the third on the list and is entitled fraudulent concealment.that term usually refers to a doctrine for tolling statutes of limitations,but the complaint seems to be using it to mean simply fraud.this claim alleges that ocwen concealed material facts from the plaintiffs and the other members of the class,including material terms of the loans.that sounds like a conventional fraud charge though an implausible can the material terms of the loan be concealed,when they are set forth in the loan documents,but there are also references to unauthorized charges,and it is not indicated whether they are unauthorized by the loan agreements or forbidden by state law.
the breach of contract allegations are elaborated in the fifth claim the fourth seeks restitution as a remedy for the third claim,the one we just been discussing.here we read that ocwen assumed the obligations in the plaintiffs loan agreements when it took over the loans for servicing,that the plaintiffs satisfied their obligations by making timely payments of principal and interest on their loans,but that nevertheless by charging late fees on payments that were not late,ocwen breached its contracts with plaintiffs and the class and also did so by increasing the monthly payment amount due without notice and demanding payment of attorneys fees in connection with legal proceedings that have not commenced have not yet been incurred meaning of course that the fees have not yet been incurred,though the literal antecedent is legal proceedings.
although these seem like conventional breach of contract allegations,ocwen argues that they are preempted by subsection b of the ots regulation processing,origination,servicing,sale or purchase of,or investment or participation in,mortgages emphasis added.at least so far as bears on this case,servicing refers to the exercise of rights that are conferred by a partial assignment of a mortgage by the mortgagee.instead of assigning the entire mortgage to ocwen,the mortgagee in this case assigned some of the rights created by the mortgage servicing rights to ocwen,which according to the complaint proceeded to violate its contractual obligations.it is no different than if the original mortgagee,or an assignee of the entire mortgage,had violated the terms of the mortgage or defrauded the mortgagor.we would have a different case if state law purported to forbid servicing or prescribe the terms of the a state tried to limit the rights that the assignment conferred on the servicing s l.but nothing like that is suggested here.if an original mortgagee can be sued under state law for breach of contract,so may the partial assignee if he violates the terms of the part of the mortgage contract that has been assigned to him.
the sixth claim is that ocwen violated a duty of good faith and fair dealing.most state laws impose a duty of good faith performance of contracts,meaning that a party to a contract can not engage in opportunistic behavior.martindell lake shore bank,hentze unverfehrt,d,lockwood int l,volm bag,cir wisconsin law original great american chocolate chip cookie river valley cookies,cir illinois law contract law imposes a duty to avoid taking advantage of gaps in a contract in order to exploit the vulnerabilities that arise when contractual performance is sequential rather than simultaneous.an example of such behavior,from the lockwood case,is a liability insurance company paying a person who has sued the insured to convert his claim to one not covered by the insurance policy.
the full name of the duty,both in the complaint and in the cases duty of good faith and fair dealing could be thought ominously.but the full name is merely what is called a doublet,a form of redundancy in which lawyers delight,as in cease and desist and free and clear.bryan garner,the redbook a manual on legal style f ed.fair dealing adds nothing to good faith.see,beraha baxter health care,cir illinois law restatement second of contracts.
the seventh claim charges ocwen with conversion of funds.if ocwen converted borrowers funds that it was holding in escrow to its own use,it would be guilty of the tort of conversion,but for all we can tell the claim may be nothing more than a rewording of the fraud claims.
the eighth claim is purely remedial it seeks injunctive relief.of course it is not a claim,that is,a cause of action,and should not have been labeled as such it is a further example of how poorly drafted the complaint is.
the ninth claim alleges vi
