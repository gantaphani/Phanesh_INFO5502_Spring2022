chris kohler appeals from a grant of summary judgment to defendant bed bath beyond of california bb b on kohler claims under title iii of the americans with disabilities act ada,and also appeals the award of attorneys fees and costs to bb b as a prevailing defendant.regarding summary judgment,kohler contends that the district court erred in concluding that the ada does not require wall space within the maneuvering clearance next to the frame of a restroom door that must be pulled open and that the district court erred in ruling that,bb b,as a tenant,was not liable for ada violations occurring in the parking lot outside of its store.kohler further contends that the district court erred in concluding that several of his claims warranted the award of attorneys fees to bb b and that the district court erred in its calculation of fees awarded.we have jurisdiction under.we conclude that kohler substantive claims related to maneuvering clearance and tenant liability must be rejected and accordingly we affirm summary judgment.however,we agree that bb b was not entitled to attorneys fees for any of kohler claims,and so we reverse the district court fee award.
kohler is disabled he is a paraplegic and requires the use of a wheelchair to move in public.several times in may,kohler visited the bb b store at the lake elsinore marketplace in lake elsinore,california.during those visits he encountered purported architectural barriers,both within the store and in the parking lot of the shopping center,that he claimed impeded his ability to fully use the store.kohler brought suit against bb b in the district court for the central district of california.kohler claimed violations of the ada,and related state law provisions.in his complaint,kohler alleged ten purported access barriers those relevant to this appeal relate to floor and wall space adjacent to the restroom door slopes and in the shopping center parking lot and the placement and operation of toilet paper and paper towel dispensers within the bb b restroom.
the parties filed for summary judgment.with respect to the claims of insufficient clearance next to the restroom door,the district court concluded that the ada accessibility guidelines guidelines,which set out the ada compliance requirements for physical structures,required only a minimum amount of floor space,rather than both floor and wall space on the pull side of a door.the district court also concluded that bb b did not own,lease or operate the shopping center parking lot,and therefore was not liable for any ada barriers occurring there.finally,the district court concluded that kohler had not asserted an actionable barrier with regard to the location of the toilet paper dispenser,as his complaint asserted only violations of state law,and that any violations related to the paper towel dispenser had been rendered moot when bb b installed a new,compliant dispenser on this basis,the district court denied kohler motion and granted bb b motion on all of kohler ada claims.the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over kohler state law claims and dismissed them without prejudice.
bb b thereafter moved for attorneys fees as the prevailing party under.the district court concluded that eight of kohler ten claims were,at a minimum,litigated without any foundation.regarding kohler maneuvering space claims,the district court noted that it had described the claims as illogical in its summary judgment order,and that kohler counsel had unsuccessfully litigated similar claims.regarding the parking lot claims,the district court held that kohler should have been aware that bb b did not own,lease or operate the parking lot for approximately the last year,as he had sued the shopping center landlord and settled with it over the parking lot violations in september.regarding the toilet paper dispenser claim,the district court concluded that it was frivolous because it alleged a violation of a requirement not found in the ada.finally,the district court also concluded that kohler paper towel dispenser claim was filed without any basis in law or fact,because kohler alleged that operating the dispenser required tight grasping,pinching or twisting of the wrist but it was undisputed that he had full use of his hands.the district court made adjustments to bb b claimed lodestar,reduced that amount by twenty percent to account for the proportional number of claims found frivolous,and awarded bb b fees of.
kohler timely appealed the district court judgment,which is now before us.

in appealing the summary judgment order,kohler addresses only two sets of claims those dealing with maneuvering clearance around the bb b restroom doors,and those dealing with the slopes and in the shopping center parking lot 
kohler argues that the guidelines require at least eighteen inches of clear wall length opposite the hinge side of a door that is pulled open.in kohler bed bath beyond of california,llc,we rejected the same claim as a matter of law,the guidelines do not require any length of wall space on the side of the doorframe opposite the hinges,slip op.at cir.we affirm the grant of summary judgment to bb b on this claim.
kohler claims that the district court erred in determining that bb b did not lease the parking lot at the shopping center,and that bb b should have been obligated to remediate purported access barriers occurring in the parking lot.further,he contends that bb b lease,which defined the parking lot as a common area and further stated that the landlord shall operate,maintain,repair and replace the common areas and shall comply with all applicable legal requirements,was an attempt to contract away its ada liability in violation of our decision in botosan paul mcnally,cir.however,kohler reliance on that case is misplaced our decision did not create liability for tenants,or landlords,where the ada did not already impose it.
in botosan,a landlord argued that it could not be held liable for ada violations on leased property because all ada compliance responsibility had been shifted to its tenants.see id.at.examining the text and history of the ada,as well as its implementing regulations,we concluded that the ada imposes concurrent obligations on landlords and tenants,and that a landlord,as an owner of the property,should be liable for ada compliance even on property leased to,and controlled by,a tenant.see id.at.the landlord could not contract away its responsibility under the ada.
here,kohler seeks to extend botosan to the inverse situation,to extend ada liability for tenants to those areas of the property controlled by the landlord.but such an extension undermines the fundamental logic of botosan.bb b has no liability to contract away on parts of the parking lot over which it has no control.absent a lease,a landlord remains in full control of an entire property,as its owner.the ada imposes compliance obligations on any person who owns,l
