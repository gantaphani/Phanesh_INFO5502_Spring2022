plaintiff appellant lord taylor,llc lord taylor has for many years operated a retail store connected to the white flint shopping center the mall,an enclosed shopping mall along rockville pike in montgomery county,maryland.in october,the montgomery county council approved plans to tear down the mall and redevelop the site into a,development as part of the county broader plan to revitalize the surrounding area.lord taylor filed this action to stop the mall owner,defendant appellee white flint,white flint,from going forward with the redevelopment.in addition to declaratory relief,lord taylor seeks a permanent injunction that would prohibit white flint from replacing the mall with the proposed town center.
the district court denied lord taylor request,concluding that an injunction would be unworkable in light of the already advanced stage of the project either the court would be required to supervise the repopulation and restoration of the largely vacant mall,or the effect of its order would be to suspend the site in its current unusable state.we see no grounds for disturbing the district court reasoned exercise of its equitable discretion,and therefore affirm.
in,white flint opened discussions with lord taylor and bloomingdale,a nonparty to this case,about development of what would become the mall.ultimately,lord taylor and bloomingdale agreed to lease land immediately adjacent to the mall and serve as retail anchor tenants.in exchange,white flint agreed that it would construct and then maintain a first class high fashion regional s hopping c enter,on the mall property.
the parties memorialized their understanding in a reciprocal easement agreement rea,committing white flint to continued operation of a,enclosed mall on the site,and detailing the layout of the mall and its surrounding internal roadways and parking areas.under the rea,most of the site may be used only for retail purposes,and white flint may build additional structures only with lord taylor consent.any changes to the mall,including alterations to its architectural design or appearance,also must be approved by lord taylor.all of these conditions are treated by the rea as restrictive covenants that run with the land,creating rights in real property.they remain operative at least through,and lord taylor may extend them until by exercising its final option.
the mall opened in and operated smoothly for many years.more recently,however,the mall began to experience a decline in business.where to place the blame for that decline is disputed by the parties.but whatever the cause,in,bloomingdale opted not to renew its lease at the mall site.by,percent of mall tenants,accounting for at least a third of the mall space,had left.since then,the bloomingdale building has been demolished and the remaining businesses have closed.the mall was shuttered permanently on january,and lord taylor alone remains open for business.
in november,white flint released a preliminary plan to redevelop the site the sketch plan,as part of montgomery county broader initiative to redevelop the surrounding area the sector plan.the sector plan is a massive publicprivate undertaking.once complete,it will transform the area,anchored by a station of the washington metropolitan area subway,into a acre urban center,with new residential units and million square feet of new space.execution of the sector plan is expected to involve billion in new public works and eventually to generate billion in additional tax revenue.
white flint sketch plan also is ambitious.the sketch plan would transform the mall site into the sort of development increasingly popular across the country,with a acre town center including apartment units,parks and schools,a hotel,and at least three office buildings.the lord taylor store would remain,but the enclosed mall would be demolished,along with portions of the parking lots and internal roadways surrounding lord taylor.montgomery county approved the plan in october,and considers it an essential component of the sector plan.
lord taylor objects to implementation of the sketch plan and the contemplated redevelopment of the mall site.according to lord taylor,what it was promised by white flint was a first class s hopping c enter,devoted to retail uses and consistent with the design specifications memorialized in the rea.the town center that white flint proposes to build around its store instead,lord taylor argues,violates the plain terms of the rea and will negatively affect the store business,disrupting customer access by destroying internal roads and parking areas and denying the store the benefit of foot traffic from mall customers.
negotiations between lord taylor and white flint reached an impasse in the spring of,and in july,lord taylor filed the complaint that is the basis for this lawsuit.count i,for declaratory relief,seeks a declaration that the rea precludes white flint from redeveloping the mall site as contemplated by the sketch plan and instead requires white flint to continue operation of a first class high fashion retail s hopping c enter.count ii the count at issue here seeks a permanent injunction compelling white flint to honor the terms of the rea.specifically,lord taylor asks the court to enjoin white flint from taking any steps to carry out or construct the redevelopment in a manner inconsistent with the rea and to require white flint to abide by its obligations under the rea to operate a first class high fashion regional retail s hopping c enter.
white flint moved for partial summary judgment with respect to count ii of the complaint.it argued,in part,that it would be infeasible for the district court to enforce an injunction requiring what was at the time a mostly empty mall to resume operations,and then to maintain its status as a first class high fashion shopping center until as late as.lord taylor,llc white flint,case cv rwt,ecf.white flint also argued that the equities of the case did not favor specific performance of the terms of the rea and a halt to the redevelopment because of the significant public interest in seeing the project go forward and the time and expense already devoted to the project.
the district court agreed and dismissed count ii of the complaint.it assumed for purposes of its decision that lord taylor could show under count i that the proposed redevelopment would breach the rea,and that lord taylor would be entitled to damages for any harm that resulted.it concluded,however,that injunctive relief would be infeasible under the circumstances.because of physical changes to the site most notably the demolition of the bloomingdale store and what was then a percent vacancy rate,the court reasoned,an injunction requiring white flint to operate the first class shopping center contemplated by the rea would require the court to supervise rebuilding and bringing tenants back in to the mall a task the court deemed outside its competence.f or me to enter into this case and try to enjoin an ongoing development project like this is just not feasible.
the district court subsequently denied lord taylor motion for a stay pending appeal and preliminary injunction.lord taylor,llc white flint,case cv rwt,ecf.the court reiterated its practical concerns,explaining that even maintaining the status quo was no longer feasible given the advanced stage of the project and the reality that the m all is almost completely vacant and partially demolished.lord taylor timely noted its appeal to this court.it also moved for a stay of the district court decision,which we denied.lord taylor,llc white flint,cir.
lord taylor first contention on appeal is that the district court erred by failing to apply the correct maryland law to its request for injunctive relief.we review this claim de novo,see woollard gallagher,cir de novo review governs district court decision on injunctive relief when contested issue is a question of law,and find it unpersuasive.
