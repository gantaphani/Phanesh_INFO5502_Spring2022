rambo associates,brought an action for breach of contract and unjust enrichment against the south tama county community school district.following a bench trial,the district court entered a judgment in favor of rambo on the breach of contract action and entered judgment for south tama on the unjust enrichment claim.rambo,south tama county cmty.sch,d.rambo appeals the judgment.we affirm the judgment with respect to the contract claim but vacate the judgment with respect to the unjust enrichment claim and remand for further proceedings regarding that claim.
rambo is an architectural firm and an consultant based in nebraska.south tama is a school district in eastern iowa.in,south tama was considering building a new school it had several older buildings,all built before.south tama superintendent,clarence lippert,contacted architectural firms to ask whether they were interested in conducting a study to determine what would be necessary to put south tama existing buildings in condition to provide its students with a quality education for the next thirty to fifty years and to determine what new construction might be needed.south tama identified rambo as a candidate for conducting the study,and rambo later made a presentation to the board of south tama about rambo services and its business model.the district court found that rambo differed from traditional architectural firms because it had many former educators and school administrators on its staff and had tremendous experience with the funding for public school projects and in the public relations necessary to be successful in a local school bond election.id.at.
in,after rambo sent south tama a proposed agreement and the parties agreed on some modifications to its terms,rambo and south tama entered into a contract for rambo to do the study.south tama maintains that the parties agreed only that rambo would prepare the study and assist the school district in passing a bond issue to fund a new school building that was included in the study.rambo,however,asserts that the contract obligated south tama either to use rambo services until the completion of any project in the study that south tama implemented or to compensate rambo for the reasonable value of all of the services that it provided.
initially,we note that the agreement here is as far from a model of clarity as any that we can recall ever having reviewed.the contract consisted of a first page titled standard agreement between owner and educational facilities consultant and two attachments.the first page included general terms,referred to the attachments,and was signed by the parties.attachment a described the work included in the study and the fees for that work.attachment b was a standard form contract between an architect and an owner,which the parties had modified.
the contract began with the following agreement 
the south tama and educational facilities consultant rambo agree to the scope of consultation work set forth below and in attachment a,and subsequent attachments jointly approved addressing school facilities incorporated in initial subsequent phases of educational facilities consultation.rambo,at the request of south tama,shall continue to provide services through further planning and implementation phases of facilities projects addressed in initial consultation phases.
the parties stated above their signatures that they entered into the agreement with endorsement of the work outlined in attachment a and authorization to proceed.
attachment a,after explaining what was included in the study phase one,provided that rambo would receive no more than in fees and in expenses for phase one the attachment also referred to the fee as a retainer for rambo work as outlined through presentation of the study to the board.
on the first page of the agreement,the parties referred to attachment b 
rambo services shall,at the request of south tama,specifically extend master planning completely through the funding or bond issue period,educational programming,schematic design and design development phases,and project management and cost management systems utilized.definitions of these services and other terms and conditions integral to this agreement are provided in attachment subsequent phases may be authorized by south tama for addressed projects or related portions or variations thereof or sic subject to the terms of attachment b unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing.
attachment b,which referred to rambo as the architect,rather than the educational facilities consultant,stated that it was an agreement between the parties f or the following project 
school facilities,including outdoor and other support facilities,through all educational consultation,planning,and construction phases addressed within this agreement.
this agreement applies to work on facilities projects or portions thereof addressed in educational facilities consultation and master planning by rambo.
attachment b did not use the term phase one but described the scope of rambo basic services during certain phases during the schematic design and design development phase s,rambo would provide planning and design services,and during the construction documents,bidding or negotiation,and construction phase s,rambo would provide technical architectural services.attach.b.additional services were also listed in attachment b,and the parties inserted the words see attachment a after three of the additional services analyses of the owner needs and programming the project requirements,financial feasibility or special studies,and planning surveys,site evaluations or comparative studies of prospective sites,which rambo president,merle rambo,testified were services that rambo agreed to perform as part of phase one.attachment b also referred to rambo assistance during fund preparation.the last page of the attachment was a fee schedule of recommended compensation for architectural services.after stating on the signature page of the agreement that south tama may authorize s ubsequent phases,the parties agreed that f or services to be completed by rambo,fees shall be negotiated as a lump sum or other basis appropriate to each project,with total compensation not to exceed those in the fee schedule in attachment 
after the contract was signed in,rambo began working with south tama on phase one and on an effort to get a bond issue passed to finance building the new school that was included in rambo study.in,however,the voters rejected the bond issue.before the election,south tama paid rambo,a sum that was calculated based on fees and expenses for phase one set out in attachment 
for most of the next three years,the parties had little contact with each other.in,lippert retired,and south tama hired a new superintendent,larry molacek,in july of that year.shortly afterward,a representative of rambo contacted molacek seeking to work with south tama on building the proposed school.rambo then did extensive work on developing a financing plan for the school and assisting south tama with another attempt to pass a bond issue.the unsuccessful bond issue was to be financed solely by increased property taxes this time,with rambo assistance,the school district decided to seek funding for the necessary bonds through a sales tax increase and a physical plant and equipment levy ppel funded,at least in part,by an income surtax,see iowa code ann.
molacek first asked rambo to prepare information to use to get support from the school board rambo prepared,inter alia,a tax management and facilities master plan that included charts illustrating how the ppel and funding would be blended.rambo also provided a sample budget for building the million school,which listed the cost of rambo services at.at molacek request,rambo led a finance workshop for the board in the summer of.according to the minutes of an october board meeting,rambo presented an overview of a tax management plan related to construction projects that the district was contemplating rambo described this meeting as an opening statement to tell the public and press about how funding could be obtained for a new school.rambo testified that south tama decided in november,to present the matter to the voters.in the election campaign that followed,rambo,in particular employee kelli,worked closely with the school district.rambo work for south tama during the period included other services,such as calculating the cost of altering the planned school building designed to house through so that grades six through eight could be added in the future.
in february,the increased sales tax was presented in a election,and the measure passed.but the next month,the school district voters narrowly defeated the bond issue,without which south tama could not use the funds passed in february to construct the school.after this latter election,began working on an effort to return the bond issue to the voters in october.but south tama board decided not to continue working with rambo and was negotiating an agreement with another architect,and with a construction manager as well.south tama informed rambo of the change in july.the district court found that after the march,election,south tama was left in the unusual position of having a funding mechanism for payment of bonds but no ability to issue bonds,but that the voters u ltimately understood that irony and passed the bond issue in october.rambo,d at.by the time of trial,south tama was in the midst of building a school designed by the new architect for through fifth grade.
when rambo first learned that another company might be hired,a rambo representative told south tama that it would have to pay to terminate rambo services.the representative later indicated that south tama would have to pay between and for termination he then raised the figure again,this time to.when the parties were unable to resolve the dispute,rambo initiated this lawsuit.south tama moved for summary judgment,contending that rambo was entitled to in compensation and had been paid in full.applying iowa law,the district court denied the motion,concluding that there was an ambiguity in the contract as to the scope of work initially authorized and how requests for additional services were to be authorized.id.at.
after a bench trial,the court again found an ambiguity in the contract as to the scope of work authorized,id.at it concluded,however,based on extrinsic evidence,that south tama authorized only the phase one work and services in the agreement and would not agree to more,id.at.it further found that south tama never intended to authorize rambo to provide other services except for assisting the school district in passing a bond issue,for which rambo fees were limited to under attachment b.id.at.
the parties agree that the contract authorized rambo to complete the study and that south tama authorized rambo assistance in obtaining funding.but the parties disagree both as to how much rambo should be compensated for its work and whether south tama authorized rambo to perform other services for which it should be paid.rambo claims that it is entitled to more than in additional compensation.
rambo maintains first that south tama agreed under the contract that if the school district decided to implement any project included in rambo study,rambo would work on that project through the construction phase.we disagree.
rambo does not take issue with the district court decision to apply iowa law to the agreement.under iowa jurisprudence,we generally review the construction and interpretation of a contract as a matter of law.hartig drug hartig,iowa.to interpret a contract,we give effect to the language of the entire contract in accordance with its commonly accepted and ordinary meaning.home fed.sav.loan ass of algona campney,iowa.if the contract is ambiguous and uncertain,extrinsic evidence can be considered to help determine the intent.hartig drug,at.an ambiguity exists if there is an uncertainty as to which of two reasonable interpretations is proper.id.in its opinion,the district court stated that the contract was ambiguous as to the scope of the work that south tama authorized.the question of whether an ambiguity exists is a question of law,which we review de novo.see id.we review the district court factual findings for clear error.see antolik saks,cir.
we agree with the district court that the contract obligated south tama to hire rambo only to perform the study,but we reach this conclusion based on the plain language of the agreement.here the first page of the contract includes language emphasizing the necessity of south tama authorizing work beyond the initial consultation phases before rambo could proceed with it.in the first paragraph,the contract states,rambo,at the request of south tama,shall continue to provide services through further planning and implementation phases of facilities projects addressed in initial consultation phases emphasis added.and the contract repeats the same language several paragraphs later when it states that rambo services shall,at the request of south tama,specifically extend master planning completely through the funding or bond issue period,educational programming,schematic design and design development phases,and project management emphasis added.
under iowa law,a contract should be interpreted so that none of its terms is rendered superfluous.see,dejong sioux center,iowa,cir.we thus read the phrase at the request of south tama as a necessary condition for rambo to do work beyond the study.and we note that the signature page similarly stated that f ees for and authorizations to proceed with professional services shall be established and approved by south tama for each phase or specific scope of services emphasis added.
our conclusion is bolstered by the statement above the parties signatures,which,as we have already said,endorses the work outlined in attachment notably,the statement refers only to attachment a,which describes the work to be performed on the study through its presentation to the board phase one,and does not mention attachment b,which describes other phases of work.as we have noted,the section of the signature page that refers to attachment b states that s ubsequent phases may be authorized by south tama.viewing the contract as a whole,see koenigs mitchell county bd.of supervisors,iowa,we conclude that the parties agreed to follow the terms set out in attachment b only if south tama established and approved f ees for and authorizations to proceed with other services beyond phase one.
for all of the above reasons,we reject rambo contention that the contract obligated south tama to employ rambo throughout the project once the school district decided to implement it.
the parties agree that south tama asked rambo for assistance in obtaining funding for the new school and that rambo was authorized to provide that assistance.but rambo maintains that the district court should not have limited its fee for this work to.
we think that the district court correctly concluded that the issue of compensation due to rambo for its help in obtaining funding is governed by of attachment b 
assistance during funding preparation 
should the district proceed with a bond issue or other funding to support financing for facilities,rambo shall provide sketches,narratives,assistance in development of the selected educational program,and assistance necessary for organization and communication of the bond issue within the district.
fees applicable to this work performed prior to funding shall be two thousand five hundred dollars should successive attempts be required for passage of a bond issue,rambo employment shall be continued with compensation and all other provisions above remaining the same.
rambo contends that is not applicable,and that we should rely instead on language in attachment a,which provides that w hile not included in the scope of this agreement and compensation therein,rambo may educate the community about the study as a public service.rambo argues that this provision of attachment a more specifically addresses rambo efforts in obtaining funding and therefore it,rather than,governs.but the plain language of requires rambo to perform a broad range of activities to assist south tama in getting funds for facilities,and it sets a limit on compensation for this work at.we c
