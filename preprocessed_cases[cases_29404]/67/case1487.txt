earl long owns property near the angostura reservoir,which is located south of hot springs,south dakota.the land used to create the reservoir and an adjoining park was condemned by the federal government in and subsequently leased to the state of south dakota.the reservoir and park are just west and south of long property see map attached to this opinion.
long sued under a to quiet title to a right of access to his property through the southern half of the park.long also claimed that the defendants,various state and federal officials and entities,were estopped from denying him the access that he sought.the district granted summary judgment to the defendants,holding that the statute of limitations under the quiet title act,see,see also f,barred the action and that estoppel was not available against the defendants.we affirm.
long first contends that he is entitled to gain access to his property through the southern half of the park because this means of access was not taken during the condemnation.until,access to the property from the south could be gained by using lithia road,a county road running north and south along the eastern edge of the property.lithia road also intersected county road near the northeast corner of the property,thus allowing access to the property from the north and east.
following the condemnation,part of lithia road became submerged beneath the reservoir,curtailing the southern access to long property.the remainder of lithia road remained a public road and was frequently used to reach the park from county road.lithia road was also used to travel between the northern and southern halves of the park,a use made possible by lander easement granted to the state in,which allowed access from lithia road to the northern half of the park.
in,at the state request and with long consent,fall river county vacated all of lithia road.as part of that action,the county created a dead end and turnaround at the west end of county road point a on the map,thus eliminating access to lithia road,as well as to long property,from county road.park users continued to use lithia road to travel between the northern and southern halves of the park.
after,long contends,the only way for him to gain access to his property was from the south.he would use the park road in the southern half of the park and then head north to his property on lithia road or,later,on the realigned road created to the east of lithia road.lithia road itself was blocked at the park boundary by a locked gate point b on the map following the creation of the realigned road,leaving the realigned road as long sole means of southern access to his property.in,however,the state placed a fence across the realigned road at the park boundary point c on the map.according to long,this action left his property landlocked.
the defendants contend that long can still gain access to his property from the north either by a road directly north of his property or by a public easement near the turnaround on county road point a,and from the south by using the locked gate to which he would be given a key on lithia road point b.long denies the usefulness of any of these routes.in view of our resolution of this case,however,we believe that it is unnecessary to determine which of these contentions is correct.
long maintains that his right to use lithia road to gain access to his property from the southern half of the park was never taken during the condemnation,and he now seeks to quiet title to that right.before we may reach the merits of his claim,however,we must determine whether the applicable limitations period has expired,as the defendants argue.the quiet title act provides for a limitations period,running from the time that the plaintiff or his knew or should have known of the government claim to the property.see g.in determining when the limitations period began to run,we look to when long or his predecessors should have had a reasonable awareness that the government claims some interest adverse to their own,state of north dakota block,cir.
the defendants contend that the limitations period expired in,twelve years after the property was condemned,while long contends that it did not begin to run until,when the state completely prevented him from gaining access to his property.we believe that both the condemnation action itself and the facts surrounding it should have given long,a party to the condemnation proceedings,a reasonable awareness in of the government claim.
the federal government condemned the land used to create the angostura reservoir pursuant to a declaration of taking.see.under that statute,once the declaration of taking is filed and money for compensation is deposited in the appropriate court,the title to the condemned property immediately vests in the government.furthermore,unless the declaration of taking states otherwise,and here it did not,the taking is considered to be in fee simple absolute.see id.as a result,once the government completed the procedural steps required,it owned the condemned property at issue here in fee simple absolute.
the condemnation,as one in fee simple absolute,resulted in the termination of the lithia road easement.ordinarily an unqualified taking in fee by eminent domain takes all interests the accurate view would seem to be that such an exercise of eminent domain founds a new title and extinguishes all previous rights,duckett and company united states.no qualifications were placed upon the taking in this case,and thus the condemnation proceeding took all previous rights and interests,including the right to use lithia road.see holdridge united states,cir.the condemnation created a new title with the federal government holding an absolute fee interest in the property free of nonpossessory encumbrances.
long reliance on patterson buffalo national river,cir,is misplaced.in that case,see id.at,we faced the question of whether a landowner who deeded property to the government retained a right to cross the deeded property on the only road to the landowner remaining property.in that situation,we determined that the deed did not place the landowner on notice of the government claim of a right to block access to his property,and thus that the statute of limitations under the quiet title act did not begin to run until the government restricted use of the road.id.the special circumstances of patterson,however,are not present here,because the declaration of taking clearly stated that the taking was in fee simple absolute.
long also maintains that the federal government did not validly condemn the county interest in lithia road because the county was not joined in the condemnation proceeding as the holder of that interest.even if the county received improper notice of the condemnation proceeding,however,that fact would not affect the government absolute ownership of the condemned land.in united states herring,cir,we determined that a fter providing for the taking and then for compensation,it appears clear that the declaration of taking act vests title in the government prior to any requirement to notify the owner of his right to compensation.because the government immediately receives title,a landowner who is improperly notified of a condemnation proceeding under the declaration of taking act,see through,retains only the right to receive just compensation,and has no right to challenge the condemnation itself.see herring,at.as the present declaration of taking appears to have been properly filed,title to all interests in the relevant land vested in the government immediately,regardless of the notice given to the county.the county right in lithia road was therefore lost as soon as the declaration of taking was filed.
long correctly notes that a taking that on its face is in fee simple absolute may leave a residual interest untaken when that interest is clearly inferable,holdridge,at.he asserts that either the government failure to assert dominion over the road immediately or the continued use of lithia road created such an interest and prevented him and his predecessors from discovering the government claim until.we do not believe,however,that the government nee
