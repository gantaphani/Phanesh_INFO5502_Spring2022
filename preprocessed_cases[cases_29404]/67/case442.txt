the issue before us is straightforward does columbia gas transmission,llc columbia,have the right of eminent domain to obtain easements over the land of objecting landowners,outside of the existing right of way,in order to replace deteriorating pipeline the answer is equally straightforward and clear yes.
the regulatory authority given to natural gas companies such as columbia actually anticipates replacement outside the existing right of way as we discuss below,and contains no adjacency requirement.the issue before us,then,whether columbia has a right to replace the pipeline outside of the existing right of way,is actually a.but,the district court put a peculiar spin on the regulations in question,finding them to be ambiguous by adopting its own definition of replace and concluding that a notice of proposed rulemaking for emergency reconstruction of interstate natural gas facilities promulgated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc after should somehow be viewed as resolving this ambiguity in the law.our dissenting colleague adopts this argument.however,we suggest that the statute and regulations are clear and the case before us is easily resolved.
columbia,an interstate natural gas company subject to the jurisdiction of ferc,seeks to replace a portion of a natural gas pipeline line that runs in and around york county,pennsylvania.because the original location of the pipeline has become heavily populated,the replacement will not track the original line but instead will be outside the existing right of way.app.in an effort to obtain easements necessary to complete construction of the replacement,in march,columbia filed complaints in condemnation against four couples the landowners in federal court.in may,columbia filed motions for partial summary judgment and for preliminary injunctions to acquire immediate possession of the easements.in june,the landowners also filed motions for summary judgment.the district court subsequently denied columbia motions and granted the landowners motions,holding that columbia did not have the right of eminent domain required to condemn the easements.the district court conclusion rested on the determination that the relevant ferc regulation,b i,was ambiguous.as a result,the court looked outside the regulations to a sentence in a notice of proposed rulemaking that it concluded set forth the agency interpretation.this was a mistake.the language of the governing regulations could not be more clear.for the reasons set forth below,we will reverse the judgments of the district court 
background 
line is over fifty years old,and columbia asserts that portions of the pipeline must be replaced to meet safety standards established by the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration.columbia has already replaced feet or of the pipeline but has been stalled in replacing the last feet because it lacks the remaining necessary easements that is,the easements on and across the landowners properties.columbia attempted to obtain these easements through negotiation,as it had the others it needed,but was unsuccessful accordingly,columbia filed a complaint in the district court,seeking condemnation of the remaining easements to which it was entitled pursuant to the natural gas act,h.before addressing the district court disposition of the case,we will set forth the statutory scheme that underpins columbia entitlement to the easements.
statutory scheme 
the natural gas act provides 
when any holder of a certificate of public convenience and necessity can not acquire by contract,or is unable to agree with the owner of property to the compensation to be paid for,the necessary to construct,operate,and maintain a pipe line or pipe lines for the transportation of natural gas it may acquire the same by the exercise of the right of eminent domain in the district court of the united states for the district in which such property may be located,or in the state courts.
h emphasis added.accordingly,a certificate of public convenience and necessity gives its holder the ability to obtain automatically the necessary right of way through eminent domain,with the only open issue being the compensation the landowner defendant will receive in return for the easement.in,ferc issued a blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity the ferc certificate to columbia that covers line.columbia ferc certificate states that columbia is authorized to conduct many routine activities and abandon facilities and service on a basis without further authorization by the commission.app.emphasis added in defining routine activities,the certificate references b.this regulation provides that blanket certificate holders have automatic authorization to engage in transactions described in certain other provisions,including a,which states,in relevant part 
if the project cost does not exceed the cost limitations set forth in column of table i,under paragraph d of this section,or if the project is required to restore service in an emergency,the certificate holder is authorized to make miscellaneous rearrangements of any facility,or acquire,construct,replace,or operate any eligible facility.
a emphasis added.costs limitations are not an issue in this case thus,if columbia is replacing an eligible facility,this constitutes a routine activity and columbia can conduct this activity on a selfimplementing basis without further authorization by the commission.app.
it is important to note that if columbia gas did not have a blanket certificate,and instead merely possessed a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing construction of a mainline,for instance,it would be able nonetheless to construct or extend facilities which constitute the replacement of existing facilities that have or will soon become physically deteriorated or obsolete,to the extent that replacement is deemed advisable,if t he replacement facilities will be located in the same or on the same site as the facilities being replaced b f c a.this provision is an exemption that relieves natural gas companies from the requirement of having to obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity.
however,with the instant blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity,authorizing routine activities on a basis,columbia is not limited to replacing within the same right of way,pursuant to section b.instead,as noted above,it can engage in any routine activity without further authorization including generally replac ing any eligible facility.a.the issue becomes is columbia replacing an eligible facility if so,it needs no further authorization.
section b i defines an eligible facility as including main line,lateral,and compressor replacements that do not qualify under b of this chapter because they will result in an incidental increase in the capacity of main line facilities,or because they will not satisfy the location or work space requirements of b.thus,by definition,this provision includes the replacement of facilities that can not be located in the same or on the same site as the facilities being replaced.b ii.accordingly,by their terms,sections b and a specifically and automatically authorize the main line replacement at issue here as a routine activity in connection with an eligible facility that can not be located in the same right of way or same site,which columbia gas has the right to without further authorization from ferc.app.
though not disputed here,even the right of blanket certificate holders to replace eligible facilities is not without limits.the dissent points out four such checks a reporting requirement,a notice requirement,an requirement,and monetary restrictions.dissent op.at.
other curbs significantly restrict the nature of replacement projects.certificate holders may not construct new delivery points under the guise of replacement.b ii e.also,in general,replacements for the primary purpose of creating additional main line capacity are not eligible facilities under blanket certificate authority.id.b i.that is,replacements must be done for sound engineering purposes.id.in clarifying this stricture,ferc underscore d that there must be a physical need to replace facilities,such that gas companies may not circumvent the general requirements for new pipeline construction simply by designating it replacement.revision of existing regulations under the natural gas act,codified at.ferc also encourages the enforcement of such regulations through the filing of complaints against companies that falsely claim the need to replace pipelines.id.again,none of these limitations are at issue here appellees do not challenge,for instance,that line is being replaced for sound engineering reasons.but the regulations ensure that gas companies do not possess unfettered discretion in constructing and siting replacement pipelines.
b.the district court opinions 
in october,the district court granted the landowners motions for summary judgment,holding that columbia did not have the right of eminent domain.the court reached this conclusion by turning to one dictionary definition of the word replace,and using it to read an adjacency requirement into part.in relevant part,the court stated 
columbia gas contention is that its certificate automatically authorizes relocation of replacement line literally anywhere on earth,so long as the replacement will not satisfy the location or work space requirements of b.but this interpretation of the regulations puts an excessively expansive gloss on the common meaning of replace,see webster third new international dictionary,unabridged,replace,accessed october,to place again restore to a former place,position,or condition,a term that generally does not imply significant relocation.moreover,columbia gas interpretation is seemingly contrary to the structure of the regulations,which equate the relocation of existing facilities with another defined term,miscellaneous rearrangement,see b,not with replacement,see b i.the meaning of replacements that do not qualify under b,is,at best,ambiguous as it relates to columbia gas replacement line.
app.having created this ambiguity,the district court turned to a notice of proposed rulemaking issued by ferc in in connection with emergency construction of natural gas pipelines after.the court viewed the notice of proposed rulemaking as a fairly definitive interpretation of the replacement provision contained in part.app.
the notice was issued in order to give pipeline companies greater flexibility to reconstruct pipelines during emergencies caused by deliberate effort s to disrupt the flow of natural gas.app.citations omitted.it states,in pertinent part 
p art,subpart f,permits replacement construction that uses temporary workspace beyond the bounds of the temporary workspace previously used to construct the original facilities as necessary to install replacement facilities.these regulations also permit locating a portion of mainline,lateral,or compressor replacement facilities outside,but presumably adjacent to,an existing where,for whatever reason,the new facilities could not be placed entirely within the original facilities existing.these regulations,however,do not appear to contemplate mainline construction over an entirely different route as may be necessary to circumvent the site of a disaster if immediate replacement is necessary before the original site is again available.
emergency reconstruction of interstate natural gas facilities under the natural gas act,proposed,to be codified at emphasis added 
the district court read the notice as imposing an adjacency requirement onto any replacement of a pipeline made under part.the court then also determined that since the replacement pipeline would be approximately a distant from the existing pipeline and thus,did not align with its definition of replace that required the same location,it could not be properly characterized as a replace ment of an eligible facility.app.
on november,however,ferc issued a final rule implementing changes to certain portions of part of title of the cfr,which governs the instant case the final rule included a footnote in which ferc identified a fact pattern essentially identical to the one at issue here that is,whether a company can rely on its blanket certificate to replace the capacity of a segment of an obsolete pipeline with a new pipeline that may need to be located a considerable distance from the old pipeline.see app.in it,ferc specifically states that part allows for such replacement even where the replacement is not adjacent to an existing right of way 
w hile the commission has indicated previously that it is contemplated that replacement facilities constructed under blanket authority would usually be located adjacent to,if not within,an existing,sections b and permit the construction of line facilities and main line facilities,respectively,without restriction on their location.
revisions to auxiliary installations,replacement facilities,and siting and maintenance regulations,to be codified at emphasis added.effectively,ferc repudiated the district court interpretation of the regulation at issue.
on december,columbia filed rule e motions to alter the judgment of the district court based on ferc recently issued final rule.on may,the district court denied columbia motions to alter,holding that the footnote in ferc final rule was not entitled to deference under auer robbins,holding that deference is owed to an agency interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation.the district court described ferc final rule as an app and explained that under christopher smithkline beecham corporation,it was not entitled to deference because it conflicted with ferc prior interpretation of part,as set forth in the notice of proposed rulemaking,and therefore did not reflect the fair and considered judgment of the agency.app see also christopher,auer deference does not apply where there is reason to suspect that the agency interpretation does not reflect the agency fair and considered judgment on the matter in question,such as where the agency interpretation conflicts with a prior interpretation internal quotation marks omitted.consequently,the district court denied the motion and reaffirmed its prior opinion denying columbia right of eminent domain.
columbia challenges the district court orders relating to the motions for summary judgment,the motions to alter,and the motions for preliminary injunctions.we address each matter in turn below.
a.the motions for summary judgment 
our review of the grant or denial of summary judgment is plenary,and we apply the same standard as the district court.mylan smithkline beecham,cir internal quotation marks omitted.summary judgment is appropriate where drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.lexington ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in reviewing for summary judgment,we view the facts contained in each motion in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.heffner murphy,cir.
we will reverse the district court orders granting the landowners motions for summary judgment and denying columbia motions for partial summary judgment because the court erred in reading an adjacency requirement into the provision regarding replacement pipelines in part of ferc regulations.the regulations are unambiguous.section b i defines an eligible facility as including main line,lateral,and compressor replacements that do not qualify under b of this chapter because they will result in an incidental increase in the capacity of main line facilities,or because they will not satisfy the location or work space requirements of b.section b covers replacement facilities that will be located in the same right of way or on the same site as the facilities being replaced,and will be constructed using the temporary work space used to construct the original facility.therefore,a mainline replacement,as in the case of line,is an eligible facility under part and covered under columbia certificate,by definition,because it involves construction outside of the existing right of way.
the district court erred in adopting its own definition of replace as meaning putting something back in the same place.the meaning of replace,as commonly understood,is not so limited.one replaces electrical wiring in a house,for example,by removing worn out or obsolete wires and putting in new ones,even if the new wires are routed differently from the original wires.the district court,and the dissent,omit the most relevant definitions of the word replace 
to take the place of serve as a substitute or successor of succeed,supplant 
to fill the place of supply an equivalent for a broken toy should not be immediately replaced 
webster third new international dictionary ed.put simply,in common parlance,replace can mean to substitute for,or it can mean to literally,to put back in the same position.because the regulations here concern replacing old pipeline,substituting new for old,the former definition is the only appropriate one.that definition of replace,to provide an equivalent or substitute,contains no inherent adjacency requirement.accordingly,the district court and the dissent,reading injects ambiguity into the regulation where none exists.the district court should have ended its analysis by concluding that the regulations unambiguously permitted columbia to complete the replacement of line outside the existing right of way with its existing ferc certificate.
the district court and our dissenting colleague would have a replacement not be a replacement,but rather a relocation if constructed in a different place than the original pipeline.but how can this square with section b i,which allows for replacements outside the existing right of way,so long as the gas company holds a blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity 
more importantly,however,the definition of replace put forward by the district court,and now described as the better reading by our dissenting colleague,dissent op.at,is simply incompatible with the statutory scheme and therefore not a reasonable interpretation of the word meaning in this context.the dissent agrees with the district court in concluding that the word replace should be read in the regulation to mean,to restore to a former place,position,or condition.dissent op.at.finding this definition to be favorable,the dissent argues that t he fact that there are at least two ways of understanding the word replacement shows that it is ambiguous dissent op.at.in fact there is no ambiguity because the definition proposed by the dissent is inapplicable here for two reasons.
first,as noted above,using the definition of replace supplied by the dissent would render portions of the statute nonsensical.even the dissent notes that,sound principles of interpretation dictate that a regulatory scheme should be read as a whole,so that effect is given to all its provisions.dissent op.at.quoting cumberland coal,lp fed.mine safety health review comm n,cir.in determining whether a statute is ambiguous,we 
account for both the specific context in which language is used and the broader context of the statute as a whole.a statutory provision that may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme because only one of the permissible meanings produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law.
utility air regulatory group.if replace were limited to restoring to a former place or position,why would section b specify that it applies only to replacements located in the same or on the same site as the facilities being replaced similarly,section b i defines an eligible facility,inter alia,as a replacement that will not satisfy the location or work space requirements of b,that is,a replacement that is situated outside the position of the previous pipeline.this conclusively proves that the plain meaning of replace in this context is not to restore to a former place or position.
if we were to apply the dissent suggested definition of the word replace to the regulation,the result would be absurd a replacement could never occur under part in the situation contemplated.where a replacement facility can not be located in the same or on the same site as the facilities being replaced,b,it clearly can not take the former place or position of the replaced facility.finally,the dissent definition would contravene section b ii b,which states that an eligible facility does not include a n extension of a main line,except replacement facilities covered under b i.thus,far from requiring replacements to take the place of the old pipeline,the regulations explicitly recognize that replacement pipelines may properly result in extensions of a main line 
second,a clear understanding of the definition adopted by the district court and the dissent shows its inapplicability to the statutory context here.to restore an object to a former place,dissent op.at necessarily implies that the object previously occupied a certain position,and that same object is being returned to that position.another way to understand this definition is by considering replace to mean literally,whereby an object is removed,possibly modified,and returned to its original location.for instance after dusting the vase,she replaced it on the shelf r eplace your boots on your bare feet,and paddle across waterway with feet replaced the card in the file.
in other words,an object is placed back in its former location one can not place back something which never was placed in that position to begin with.thus,the dissent definition necessarily allows columbia only to place the same pipeline back again in its former location.accordingly if columbia installed a new pipeline as part of a replacement project,even in the original right of way,it would automatically be in violation of the certificate,because it would not be replacing a pipeline back to its original site,it would not be restoring any pipe to its former position.thus,the definition favored by the district court and dissent is so stringent as to be absurd and can not govern here 
the district court also erred in relying on ferc post notice of proposed rulemaking,as requiring that replacements must be adjacent to replaced pipelines.this notice concerned the previously unaddressed situation of the restoration of gas service in the aftermath of a disaster.a close examination of the language of the notice makes manifest the error of relying on it as imposing or confirming an adjacency requirement in the law.for example,it states that replacement facilities contemplated under part would be outside,but presumably adjacent to,an existing right of way.emergency reconstruction of interstate natural gas facilities under the natural gas act.at emphasis added.there is nothing controversial or new in this statement.a replacement pipeline would presumably be adjacent to an existing pipeline for a number of practical reasons cost,environmental permitting limitations,capacity requirements,and convenience.this does not mean,however,that a replacement pipeline is required to be adjacent to an existing right of way.the other sentence noted by the dissent is similarly inconclusive t hese regulations,however,do not appear to contemplate mainline construction over an entirely different route as may be necessary to circumvent the site of a disaster id.emphasis added.again this is dicta,but even more it states the obvious regulations that speak to replacing physically deteriorated or obsolete pipeline indeed might not be viewed as contemplating completely changing the location of a totally obliterated pipeline to circumvent a disaster nowhere does the notice of proposed rulemaking state that replacement pipelines,in a context,must be located adjacent to the original right of way 
the notice of proposed rulemaking,in any event,is entirely consistent with the plain text of the regulations,authorizing replacements by outside the right of way without any explicit adjacency requirement.indeed,the final rule established that ferc views its regulation the same way.accordingly,we need not even consider principles of deference where the regulation is unambiguous.see christensen harris,auer deference is warranted only when the language of the regulation is ambiguous.the regulation speaks for itself,such that columbia is entitled to the easements necessary to complete the replacement of line.the district court erred in concluding otherwise.
for its part,the dissent contends that the regulations are ambiguous because of the different possible meanings of replace,the notice of proposed rulemaking is plainly in opposition to the final rule,and therefore the final rule is not entitled to auer deference.dissent op.at christopher smithkline beecham,noting that auer deference may not be appropriate where an agency interpretation conflicts with a prior interpretation even putting aside the fact that the meaning of replace is unambiguous,as noted above,the caveats,vague language,and highly specific nature of the situation dealt with in the notice of proposed rulemaking establish that there is no conflict with the final rule.further,the final rule itself recognizes,and perfectly harmonizes with,the language of the previous notice w hile the commission has indicated previously that it is contemplated that replacement facilities constructed under blanket authority would usually be located adjacent to,if not within,an existing right of way,sections b and permit the construction of line facilities and main line facilities,respectively,without restriction on their location.at emphasis added.
even if we were to assume that the regulations are ambiguous,the interpretation of the final rule would still control.that is because the final rule is fully consistent with the notice,and,as an agency interpretation of its own regulation,it is deserving of deference.decker nw.envtl.def,it is well established that an agency interpretation need not be the only possible reading of a even the best prevail.when an agency interprets its own regulation,the court,as a general rule,defers to it unless that interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.internal quotations omitted.thus,even if we accepted the dissent purported ambiguity in the regulations,ferc interpretation in the final rule should control,and columbia would remain entitled to the sought easements.
the dissent also claims that the final rule is simply a post hoc rationalization on the part of ferc,and therefore not deserving of auer deference.dissent op.at.we acknowledge that auer deference may not be appropriate where an interpretation constitutes a post hoc rationalizatio n advanced by an agency seeking to defend past agency action against attack.christopher.at emphasis added.but in this case,there is no past agency action that ferc is seeking to defend.columbia simply replaced its pipeline under its blanket certificate outside the original right of way,and ferc later made clear in the final rule that columbia had the authority under the applicable regulations to do so.ferc is not a party to this action,nor does it have any reason to favor columbia interpretation over the landowners,but,we submit,only desires to make clear what the regulations provide.the final rule accordingly should not be read as any type of rationalization.
in the end,the dissent reading appears to be aimed primarily at avoiding what it perceives to be constitutional problems,namely a grant of limitless authority.dissent op.at.as set forth above,blanket do not possess unfettered discretion to replace pipeline.they are constrained by cost limitations,here waived by ferc because of columbia good faith attempts at compliance,as well as notice requirements and environmental impact further,replacements may not be installed simply because a company wishes to increase a pipeline capacity.rather,such projects may only be undertaken for sound engineering purposes.b i.appellees do not claim that the replacement project was undertaken for anything other than sound engineering purposes.further,even if constitutional issues might be implicated in a facial challenge,that would be an issue for another case,but that is not this case.we note that this constitutional argument was never raised by appellees,has not been briefed,and therefore is not properly before us.
lastly,the landowners argue that the miscellaneous rearrangement provision of part limits columbia ability to replace the pipeline.this is incorrect.miscellaneous rearrangement is defined,in part,as any rearrangement of a facility,excluding underground storage wells,that does not result in any change of service rendered by means of the facilities involved,including changes in existing field operations or relocation of existing facilities.b.the landowners claim that such a relocation may only take place o n the same property.id.b i.as the district court noted,however,section b lists the three characteristics of miscellaneous rearrangements in the disjunctive.app.thus a relocation may take place on the same property,or it could occur,inter alia,w hen required by encroachment of residential,commercial,or industrial areas.id.b ii.
but this is beside the point.the fact that the miscellaneous rearrangement provision contemplates a scenario in which a pipeline must be relocated due to encroaching residential developments actually only goes to show that this is referring to a relocation,and not a replacement.thus,relocation,as used here,involves moving an existing entity to a new location,whereas replacement would involve a substitution of new for old.accordingly,section a treats miscellaneous rearrangements as something different from replacements of eligible facilities.here,columbia does not seek to move the existing pipeline to a new location.rather,columbia will construct a new facility to serve in place of the deteriorating one.thus,as columbia argues,it is replacing line,not relocating it 
under the plain language of ferc regulations,columbia is automatically authorized to replace line according to its proposed plan.pursuant to its ferc certificate,columbia has the right of eminent domain over the easements that it seeks from the landowners.accordingly,we will reverse the orders of the district court granting the landowners motions for summary judgment and denying columbia motions for partial summary judgment 
motions for immediate possession 
columbia argues that we should grant it immediate possession of the easements by entering preliminary injunctions.it urges that further delay will be harmful to it and the public.if it is not able to begin replacement of line until the determination of just compensation,the timely completion of the project will be jeopardized.the district court ruling that columbia had not established the right to condemn the necessary easements obviously doomed columbia request.given our ruling that recognizes columbia right of eminent domain,the issue of the preliminary injunction is properly before us.we believe that we can easily decide this issue in the first instance,such that remand,with its attendant delay,is unnecessary.this is not a normal preliminary injunction,where the merits await another day.in those situations,the probability of success is not a certainty such that weighing the other factors is paramount.here,there is no remaining merits issue we have ruled that columbia has the right to the easements by eminent domain.the only issue is the amount of compensation which will definitely be determined on remand,but the result of which can have no affect on columbia rights to the easements.that columbia entitlement to relief comes in the form of injunctive relief should not dictate that we impose similar constraints on our grant of that relief in this context.nonetheless for the sake of completeness and because the district court and dissent seek to limit columbia entitlement we will examine the other factors.we believe they weigh in favor of granting the preliminary injunctions to which columbia is entitled.
in determining whether a party is entitled to a preliminary injunction,we normally consider four factors whether the movant has shown a reasonable probability of success on the merits whether the movant will be irreparably injured by denial of the relief whether granting preliminary relief will result in even greater harm to the nonmoving party and whether granting preliminary relief will be in the public interest.am.express travel related servs.sidamon eristoff,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
having already determined that columbia has succeeded on the merits,we now examine whether columbia will suffer irreparable injury if it is denied relief.columbia explains that pipeline construction season is relatively short and late to begin the weather from november through february generally makes construction impractical and expensive columbia states that if construction on the properties does not begin by now actually september,weather events could have a significant disruptive effect and potentially delay the replacement of the pipeline until.columbia explains that there are safety concerns associated with an aging,unreliable pipeline,and that delay in possession of the easements will likely cause it to miss the inservice deadline in time for the beginning of the heating season on november.if columbia misses the inservice deadline,it will lose the right to seek reimbursement from its customers.thus the harm to columbia appears to involve its safety,reputation,and economic interests.
columbia points to the fourth circuit opinion in east tennessee natural gas company sage,cir,in arguing that a preliminary injunction is warranted where a delay in construction of a pipeline would cause significant financial harm to both a gas company and its customers.id.at.the fourth circuit explained that east tennessee natural gas company would be forced to breach certain contractual obligations if it were forced to delay construction in order to hold hearings on just compensation.id.the landowners argue that sage is inapposite because columbia has not shown that it will lose more than million which was the estimated loss in sage.the landowners also point to third circuit precedent stating that a purely economic injury,compensable in money,can not satisfy the irreparable injury requirement,except where the potential economic loss is so great as to threaten the existence of the movant business.minard run oil united states forest,cir internal quotation marks omitted.although columbia has not cited a specific dollar amount for the financial harm it faces were we to deny relief,the harm alleged is not one of purely economic injury.here,there are also safety and potential liability concerns caused by an inability to meet the heating deadline.
moreover,the harm to the landowners that will result if we grant columbia preliminary injunctions is minimal.since we have already determined that columbia has the right of eminent domain,it is a certainty that the requested easements will be granted.the fifth amendment also guarantees that the landowners will be justly compensated.the landowners have not stated any concrete injury other than the loss of the easements over their land,which will definitely occur,whether or not we grant columbia immediate possession of the easements.
finally,we examine the public interest involved in columbia obtaining relief it is this factor that overwhelmingly weighs in favor of granting columbia preliminary injunctions.the landowners state,summarily,that while the public does have an interest in the pipeline being replaced for safety reasons,an additional delay in replacement of line will not result in any substantial harm to the public.landowners br.columbia has explained,however,that the safety risks associated with a delay in the replacement work and acquisition of the easements will increase daily.in his affidavit,jacob frederick elaborated upon the safety risks the pipeline may fail,collapse,explode,or leak,causing bodily and property injury or death leaving the residents of york county without gas service.frederick aff.in addition to these safety concerns,columbia has made it clear that the residents of york county could possibly be without heat the entire winter if construction of the replacement does not begin soon.
weighing all of the relevant factors,we conclude that columbia is entitled to injunctive relief and therefore will be granted immediate possession of the easements.
iii.conclusion 
in sum,we will reverse the orders of the district court granting the landowners motions for summary judgment,and denying columbia motions for partial summary judgment and for preliminary injunctions.we will dismiss the appeal of the order concerning the motions to alter as moot.finally,we will remand to the district court to enter the preliminary injunctions and conduct further proceedings.
the majority interprets the pertinent regulations to unambiguously allow private gas companies to replace a pipeline anywhere,on anybody property,without any type of formal administrative review.in deciding that the federal energy regulatory commission ferc has extended such a broad grant of the sovereign power of eminent domain to private companies,the majority relies on a definition of replacement not provided in the text of the regulations but supplied by columbia,even though it is at odds with what columbia admits is the common understanding of what constitutes a replacement and despite the fact that ferc had never adopted that definition until,in the middle of an unrelated rulemaking,the agency crafted a footnote in reaction to the district court decision in this case.in my view,the majority limitless reading of the regulations is deeply problematic and renders them constitutionally suspect.to avoid logical difficulties within the regulations,as well as to avoid constitutional concerns,some sort of locational limitation must serve as a constraint on pipeline replacement outside of an original.
i agree with the district court that the regulations are ambiguous and therefore resort to ferc interpretations is in order.but ferc has been inconsistent in its explanations of the regulations,and the agency most recent interpretation does not warrant deference.ferc previous interpretation,before it issued its footnoted reaction,reasonably indicated that there is indeed a locational limitation on pipeline replacements outside of an original.because the pipeline project at issue here does not adhere to any locational limitation at all,it is not a replacement within the meaning of that term in the regulations.as a consequence,columbia should be required to petition ferc for a new certificate of public convenience and necessity before being permitted to condemn easements on property previously unaffected by columbia pipeline.i therefore respectfully dissent.
background 
on january,columbia obtained a blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity the certificate that authorized the company to construct and operate a natural gas pipeline,known as line,at the location specified in the application.the certificate continues to authorize the company to engage in limited,routine activities with regard to that facility,as expressly identified in ferc regulations.but,f or other categories of activities,which may potentially require more scrutiny and opportunity for public participation,the certificate calls for the company to submit to further regulatory procedures.app.at footnote omitted.columbia now seeks to use its certificate to construct a replacement pipeline up to a mile away from the original line and on the lawns of the homes of dwayne and ann brown,bradley and elizabeth herr,myron and mary jo herr,and douglas and tessa hilyard collectively,the landowners.appellee br.at.
columbia attempted at first to negotiate easements across the landowners properties but was refused.it warned the landowners that the offers it had made do not represent columbia view of the impact of the project on the fair market value of the properties.to the contrary,columbia believes that the impact on fair market value will be much less app.at.if the landowners declined columbia initial offers,it threatened,columbia w ould pursue the alternate acquisition process provided to natural gas companies by the natural gas act.app.at.in other words,interpreting its certificate to be a blank check for land condemnation,columbia negotiated with an implicit threat take our offers now or forfeit your property rights later,for considerably less money,in a condemnation proceeding after the landowners maintained their rejection of columbia offers,the company sought to make good on that threat by filing the eminent domain suit now on appeal.
the district court granted the landowners motions for summary judgment on the question of columbia asserted right to the easements.in denying columbia motion for partial summary judgment on the same issue,the district court held that the project is not automatically authorized as a replace ment of an eligible facility pursuant to b i a.app.at.columbia petitioned to alter or amend the judgment,which was denied.the court observed that columbia attack does not point to an actual error in reasoning behind the court judgment.instead,columbia asserts that the court should wholly defer to an agency interpretation that according to precedent that columbia ignores is properly due very little deference,if any beyond its power to persuade.app.at.the court reference to an agency interpretation is to ferc app.at,discussed below,on whether a locational limitation restricts where a replacement pipeline can be put.
ii.discussion 
until recently,columbia would not have been able to construct pipeline on a new route,as they are attempting to do in the proposed line project,without seeking a new certificate of public convenience and necessity associated with the new.at least not according to ferc.in,that agency issued a notice entitled emergency reconstruction of interstate natural gas facilities under the natural gas act,proposed,to be codified at pt.hereinafter emergency reconstruction notice or notice in which it discussed at length its interpretation of the regulations now in question,particularly title,part of the code of federal regulations,which governs eligible facilities.an eligible facility is a installation,such as a pipeline,eligible for alteration,such as replacement,under the original certificate granted for the development of that facility.b ferc apparently saw a shortcoming in the regulations,namely that they do not allow companies to effectively respond to an emergency that might require a pipeline to be moved or new pipeline to be installed on a route that varies significantly from the contemplated in an certificate.id.at.for example,in the emergency reconstruction notice,ferc indicates that of the regulations which governs replacement projects within an authorized,is insufficient to address an emergency situation because it does not allow for construction outside the footprint of existing facilities.id.at.
the notice also says that p art provides a vehicle for reconstruction of facilities but this authority is limited.id.at.it goes on to explain that,a cting under blanket authority,the authority under part conferred by a certificate,a pipeline may install new facilities on a new,which may be acquired through the pipeline exercise of eminent domain.id.that authority permit s locating a portion of mainline replacement facilities outside,but presumably adjacent to,an existing id.at emphasis added.ferc further recognized this locational limitation on part authority by saying that t hese regulations do not appear to contemplate mainline construction over an entirely different route as may be necessary to circumvent the site of a disaster if immediate replacement is necessary before the original site is again available.id.emphasis added.
i understand that language to mean,as the district court did,that part authorizes replacements that may involve placing a pipeline some minimal distance from its original but that such a project must indeed involve only a very limited deviation from that route.the majority,at columbia urging,sees the matter quite differently.as columbia put it in argument before the district court,when it comes to replacements,u nder there is no location restriction.there is no proximity restriction.app.at.
what there is,in short,is an ambiguity in the use of the word replacement in the regulations.see in re phila.newspapers,llc,cir stating that a regulatory provision is ambiguous where the disputed language is reasonably susceptible of different interpretations citation and internal quotation marks omitted.despite the majority assertion to the contrary,the meaning of that term is not clear,and we are left to dispute whether a pipeline replacement outside of an original includes a locational limitation or is instead a concept without physical limits.that ambiguity is the first of two related problems in this case.the second is that the alternative interpretations of the ambiguous regulation are not equally innocuous.the one advocated by columbia and adopted by the majority raises internal inconsistencies and constitutional issues that can and ought to be avoided.i discuss both of those problems in turn.
ambiguity deference 
the majority concludes that the regulations are unambiguous primarily by relying on the interplay between the locational limitation in b and the lack of an express locational limitation in the definition of eligible facility in b i.for two reasons,i disagree with the conclusion my colleagues draw from that difference.first,sound principles of interpretation dictate that a regulatory scheme should be read as a whole,so that effect is given to all its provisions.cumberland coal,lp fed.mine safety health review comm n,cir internal quotation marks omitted.as described in more detail herein,the majority approach fails to do that it conflates replacement and relocation,even though each has a specific and unique meaning in the regulations.also,by interpreting the term replacement so broadly,it undermines b because it leaves practically no limitation for replacement projects outside of an existing.further,it allows gas companies to circumvent the important notice and hearing requirements of and,which necessitate providing notice to both directly and indirectly affected property owners and an opportunity to participate in a regulatory hearing regarding certificate petitions 
second,the phrase replacements that do not qualify under b because they will not satisfy the location or work space requirements of b,b i,is ambiguous because part use of replacement is reasonably susceptible to at least two different interpretations.the district court,relying on the dictionary,defined replace as to place again restore to a former place,position,or condition,which,as the court noted,suggests either no relocation or an insignificant relocation.app.at.the majority,however,disagrees with that definition and says that,p ut simply,in common parlance,replace can mean to substitute for.op.at.that is one reading of replace.but,although my colleagues think their selected definition is the only applicable one,another and better reading in this context,which involves locational issues,is the one chosen by the district court 
the majority preferred reading of replace leads it to declare that applying a definition of the term is absurd.id.at.it asserts that the position taken by the district court and that i am advocating requires the replacement pipeline to be in exactly the same spot as the original.that is not so,and ordinary speech is not so rigid,as one of the majority own examples indicates after dusting the vase,she replaced it on the shelf.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.when the vase makes it back onto the shelf,it has been replaced there,whether it is an inch or two to the left or right of where it had been.the location for the replacement is not a matter of pinpoint accuracy,but there is a limit.no one would describe the action as replacing the vase if it were put in another room.the majority certitude can not mask the fundamental problem with its view.if the only requirement for a replacement is that it substititut es new for old op.at,then a gas company may now replace pipeline originally located in york,pennsylvania,anywhere in the united states,from portland to poughkeepsie,as long as that original pipeline is somehow old and the replacement pipeline is somehow new.whatever the interpretation of replace,that hardly seems the correct one,let alone the only plausible one.as the district court said,that reading puts an excessively expansive gloss on the common meaning of the word.app.at.at the very least,replacement is ambiguous in this context,and so is the regulatory provision of which that term is a part.
columbia tries to avoid that conclusion by asserting that the term replacement has a specific meaning under the code of federal regulations appellant opening br.at that is entirely different than in everyday parlance appellant reply br.at.in other words,columbia acknowledges that its proposed definition of replacement is not the only or even the most common interpretation.one might expect that,since columbia and the majority are rejecting everyday parlance,their very different understanding of the word replacement would be rooted in some clear language in the code of federal regulations delineating a specialized meaning.rowland cal.men colony,c ourts would hardly need direction where congress had thought to include an express,specialized definition for the purpose of a particular act.but it is not.the specialized,definition they rely on is nowhere to be found in the regulations themselves nor is it in any agency interpretation the district court decision.instead,in deciding that the word is unambiguous,the majority relies on columbia favored definition,which the majority says is dictated by clear understanding.op.at.despite columbia admission about everyday parlance appellant reply br.at,and despite the majority own admission that replace can mean to substitute for,or it can mean to put back in the same position op.at emphasis added,the majority proclaims that the only appropriate definition is the one contain ing no inherent adjacency requirement.id.at.if assertion were argument,that might be more persuasive,but declaring that something is unambiguous does not make it so.
fortunately,we do not,in this setting,need to choose between different dictionary definitions.the fact that there are at least two ways of understanding the word replacement shows that it is ambiguous,which requires us to consider how ferc has interpreted the word.see christensen harris,auer deference is warranted only when the language of the regulation is ambiguous.that effort raises its own choices.
as noted earlier,ferc looked at the issue of replacement when it considered the emergency reconstruction notice.although the notice is just that a notice of proposed rulemaking it answered the question of whether an additional limiting principle is necessary for replacements outside of a authorized in a certificate.ferc published the notice for the very reason that there was no authority under part to replace a pipeline in a location other than an existing or outside,but presumably adjacent to,an existing,even in an emergency.emergency reconstruction notice.at.ferc itself acknowledged the locational limitation on pipeline replacement,saying the regulation do es not appear to contemplate mainline construction over an entirely different route as may be necessary to circumvent the site of a disaster.id.
for a decade that was the last word on the matter,but one should never underestimate the continuing malleability of words.despite ferc and plainly stated insight about the locational limitations in part,the agency made a degree turn one week after the district court issued its opinion in this case and decided that mainline construction really is a exercise after all.in a rule published on november,revisions to auxiliary installations,replacement facilities,and siting and maintenance regulations,to be codified at pts,hereinafter revisions to auxiliary installations,ferc inserted a footnote designed to e ffectively repudiate the district court interpretation of the regulation at issue op.at.in that footnote,number to be precise,ferc gave what amounts to an approval of the line project by stating that the part blanket certificate regulations impose no limitations on the placement of the facilities.revisions to auxiliary installations.at.this new footnote rule,as i will refer to it for convenience,is directly contrary to the interpretation provided in the emergency reconstruction notice.id.the question then arises which ferc interpretation should be heeded 
a choice has to be made because an agency interpretations of its own ambiguous regulations are,under supreme court precedent,entitled a degree of deference.the direction given in auer robbins,is that the agency interpretation is controlling unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.nevertheless,in christopher smithkline beecham corp,the court recently cautioned that this general rule of deference does not apply in all cases,see also harry edwards et,federal standards of review,ch.xiv t he deference afforded an agency interpretation of its own regulations is significant,but it is not without limits.christopher teaches that,once a regulation has been determined to be ambiguous,two questions should be considered in deciding whether an agency new interpretation of the ambiguous provision is entitled to auer deference whether the new interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation,and whether the interpretation reflect s the agency fair and considered judgment on the matter in question.christopher.at internal quotation marks omitted.an interpretation does not reflect fair and considered judgment if,for example,it conflicts with a prior interpretation,or is nothing more than a convenient litigating position,or is a post hoc rationalizatio n advanced by an agency seeking to defend past agency action against attack,or if deference would seriously undermine the principle that agencies should provide regulated parties fair warning of the conduct a regulation prohibits or requires.id.at alterations in original citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
christopher also expressed a concern that agencies may take improper advantage of the deference extended to them under auer our practice of deferring to an agency interpretation of its own ambiguous regulations undoubtedly has important advantages,but this practice also creates a risk that agencies will promulgate vague and regulations that they can later interpret as they see fit,thereby frustrat ing the notice and predictability purposes of rulemaking.id.at alteration in original footnote omitted quoting talk.bell,scalia,concurring.
if a court finds that either the plainly erroneous or fair and considered judgment factor cuts against the agency interpretation,that interpretation is reviewed not under auer,but rather under the supreme court decision in skidmore swift.see,christopher.at turning to the skidmore standard after concluding that whatever the general merits of auer deference,it is unwarranted here.under skidmore,deference is proper only if the agency view has the power to persuade,which depend s upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,and its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements.vance ball state,second and third alterations in original.in short,skidmore deference is a lesser degree of deference than is given under auer because it considers the interpretation as having at most the power to persuade,not the power to control.hagans commn r of soc,
with that guidance in mind,i turn to the emergency reconstruction notice and the footnote rule.the interpretation in the notice acknowledges a constraint on how far a replacement project can stray from an original.the notice instructs that part does not authorize a pipeline replacement that proceeds on an entirely new route or is beyond what may fairly be characterized as being on or adjacent to the original.if the proposed replacement pipeline does not fall within those limitations,the gas company must approach ferc for a new certificate.nothing about the notice indicates that the interpretation it provides is plainly erroneous or fails to reflect ferc fair and considered judgment.it would seem,then,to be guidance of the kind suited for auer deference.
my colleagues,however,endeavor to downplay the importance of the notice.they read its statement that part permit s locating a portion of mainline replacement facilities outside,but presumably adjacent to,an existing,emergency reconstruction notice.at,as meaning that,while practical considerations will generally prompt gas companies to build on the same or an adjacent route,those utilities need not do so.the word that the majority uses to turn language of limitation upside down is presumably.but such heavy reliance on that word to undo the express limitation in the notice is misplaced.in the very next sentence of the notice,ferc made clear that the regulations do not appear to contemplate mainline construction over an entirely different route.id.the notice thus states and restates the necessary principle that should be guiding our instruction to columbia today if you want to take someone else property for your pipeline,stay near your and do not construct along a new route otherwise,come back for a new certificate.
the majority deems the advice in the emergency reconstruction notice to be irrelevant because it dealt specifically with emergencies such as a sudden unanticipated loss of natural gas or capacity,not deteriorating pipelines.op.at.although it is true that the notice advocated adoption of certain new regulations focused on how to better deal with emergency situations,that does not mean that the interpretation it provides of the existing regulations in part is of no consequence.the interpretation provided in the notice is very relevant indeed,being,as it is,a ferc statement about the meaning of part that can rightly be called just and considered.it gives guidance on what part authorizes and what its restrictions are,without limiting those restrictions to emergency situations.see emergency reconstruction notice.at p art,subpart f,permits replacement construction that uses temporary workspace beyond the bounds of the temporary workspace previously used to construct the original facilities as necessary to install replacement facilities.these regulations also permit locating a portion of mainline,lateral,or compressor replacement facilities outside,but presumably adjacent to,an existing where,for whatever reason,the new facilities could not be placed entirely within the original facilities existing.emphasis added.the interpretation advanced in the notice is therefore generally applicable here.
the footnote rule,by contrast,is a textbook example of an agency shooting from the hip rather than giving a question fair and considered judgment.despite the majority comments to the contrary,ferc creation of footnote one week after the district court opinion shows it to be a hastily decision,devoid of the hallmarks of an agency interpretation deserving deference.the timing reveals the footnote rule as a post hoc rationalization meant to defend a past action,in this case columbia attempt to obtain property outside of the allowed in its certificate.christopher.at noting that regulatory changes reflecting post hoc rationalization do not receive auer deference.moreover,the insertion of the new interpretation in a footnote in the middle of an unrelated about auxiliary facilities emphasizes ferc eagerness to get it out as rapidly as possible,with the aim of undoing the district court decision.again,that serves to highlight the interpretation as a post hoc rationalization of columbia asserted condemnation power.martin occupational safety health review comm n,declining to defer to post hoc rationalizations advanced for the first time in the reviewing court 
the majority endeavors to pass off the new interpretation in the footnote rule as perfectly harmoni ous with what was previously said in the emergency reconstruction notice op.at,but that ignores the warning in the notice that part does not appear to contemplate mainline construction over an entirely different route as may be necessary to circumvent the site of a disaster if immediate replacement is necessary before the original site is again available,emergency reconstruction notice.at.because ferc opined that part does not allow new routing for a replacement pipeline even in the event of an emergency,there is precious little logic and no consistency in saying that new routing is permitted in the absence of an emergency.it is thus not harmonious to assert,as the footnote rule does,that part regulations impose no limitations on the placement of replacement facilities.revisions to auxiliary installations.at.ferc at first interpreted part to include a geographic limitation on replacement projects.the footnote rule,issued with no notice and within a week of the judicial action to which it was a reaction,purports to completely do away with that limitation.the two interpretations are plainly in opposition.
ferc itself tacitly admits as much in footnote.it says,w hile the commission has indicated previously that it is contemplated that replacement facilities constructed under blanket authority,pursuant to a certificate,would usually be located adjacent to,if not within,an existing,part permit s the construction of line facilities and main line facilities without restriction on their location.id.no one,not even those in the majority,can claim that what ferc was doing in that passage was saying how consistent its newly announced position is with its past statements.the evident purpose in giving a nod to what was said previously was to acknowledge but minimize the change in position.the locution hangs a bell on the difference.
that does not alter my colleagues approach,though.they look to the use of the word usually a replacement will usually be adjacent to or within an existing and they conclude that it must mean ferc never really laid down an interpretation that restricts the location of a replacement pipeline.see op.at.like the word presumably in the notice,however,the word usually in the footnote rule can not carry the analytical weight the majority puts on it.rather than showing there is no rule,usually and presumably are words indicating that there is in actuality a standard way of proceeding a rule,so to speak one to which occasional exceptions may be found but a rule nonetheless.a statement that repudiates what had been the rule can not rightly be labeled as being in harmony with the rule.
there is yet another reason to reject footnote as the product of fair and considered judgment.in christopher,the supreme court noted that,where an agency announcement of its interpretation is preceded by a very lengthy period of conspicuous inaction,the potential for unfair surprise is acute.at.here,ferc issued the footnote rule in november,over a decade after it published the emergency construction notice.anyone paying attention would certainly be surprised to find that what had been,by the agency own interpretation,a presumptive limitation on where a pipeline could be replaced was suddenly no limitation at all.deference to the footnote rule under such circumstances serves to foster cynicism and to subvert the purpose of formal rulemaking 
ferc new interpretation of part thus ought not receive the benefit of auer deference,and it is no more salvageable under skidmore.footnote is unpersuasive for all of the points already discussed.of.sw.med.ctr.nassar,noting an agency explanations lack the persuasive force that is a necessary precondition to deference under skidmore.it fails to persuade on another ground as well it is inconsistent with part itself.if i understand the majority correctly,columbia project can be considered as both a relocation and a replacement.that at least appears to be what columbia believes,as shown in comments before the district court.at a single hearing,it referred to the proposed line construction interchangeably as a replacement and a relocation.compare app.at the pipeline itself is an eight inch gas main.the gas main is going to be relocated,and app.at we are not rerouting.we are relocating,with app.at we have the right to construct a replacement main that would not qualify under a analysis.
the words replacement and relocation are not intrinsically incompatible as synonyms.part,though,treats them differently,as denoting separate methods of authorizing pipeline construction,with different requirements applicable to each.when we examine a statute,w e generally seek to respect congress decision to use different terms to describe different categories of people or thin
