green acres enterprises,green acres land cattle,and the individual owners of each entity collectively,the landowners appeal from the district court grant of the government motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.we affirm.
the landowners are the former owners of two large properties located along the marmaton known as the little osage missouri the green acres farm and the richter farm.until april,the landowners farmed portions of both properties and leased other portions to farmers,who planted and harvested the crops on the leased land for themselves.since the,each property had been protected from flooding by two large levee systems,which were each composed of the levees themselves,a system of internal drainage ditches,and large pumps that served to draw water from the farms and drainage ditches to the river through pipes embedded in the levees.
both levee systems,however,suffered extensive damage in the great flood of.the landowners subsequently commenced repairs to the levee systems in the spring of.the government,claiming that such repairs violated the terms of easements granted in favor of the united states army corps of engineers corps,obtained an injunction prohibiting the landowners from carrying out the repairs.the landowners appealed,and we held that the easements did not require the landowners to obtain the corps consent prior to repairing the levee systems.united states green acres,cir green acres i.accordingly,we reversed and remanded the case to the district court with instructions to vacate the injunction id.
in late,the landowners sought to continue with and complete the repairs to the green acres farm levee.the proposed repairs consisted of excavation of the area surrounding a pump intake to allow the intake to operate properly excavation of a drainage ditch system to remove silt and sediment deposited there by flooding expansion of the levee at the pump station to enable vehicles to turn around when fueling the pump and restoration of various damaged portions of the levee to return them to height.the landowners requested a formal determination from the to a that the repairs would not be subject to or would otherwise be exempted from the clean water act,et 
in february,the corps sent a letter responding to the landowners request the february letter and determined that a portion of the proposed work would require a specific clean water act permit known as a section permit because,in the corps opinion,the work would involve a discharge of dredged or fill material into the wetlands surrounding the levee system.see dredged and fill material discharge permits a waters of the united states include wetlands adjacent to protected waters.the corps also determined that a number of nationwide permits covering activities for which the landowners would not be required to seek individual approval were inapplicable to the proposed work and that most of the proposed work was ineligible for either the clean water act levee maintenance exception,see f b,or its ditch maintenance exception,see f c 
the february letter sparked an extended and increasingly contentious series of correspondence between the landowners and the corps.in their initial response to the february letter,the landowners disputed that the nationwide permits and the ditch maintenance exception were inapplicable.more importantly,the landowners argued that the corps determination that a permit was required for the proposed work was squarely in violation of a nationwide injunction entered against the corps by the united states district court for the district of columbia in american mining congress united states army corps of engineers.american mining congress i.the injunction prohibited the corps from enforcing the tulloch rule,which had previously allowed the corps to exercise clean water act jurisdiction over all excavation activities,including those that resulted only in incidental fallback,on the theory that such activities almost always resulted in a discharge into waters of the united states id.at.
the landowners contended that the february letter violated the injunction both generally by asserting clean water act jurisdiction over the proposed work in the first instance and specifically by making the following statement 
as you may know,because of a recent federal case american mining congress i,the corps has been directed to suspend enforcement of the tulloch rule until the issue is ultimately settled in the courts.however,until the courts rule on the efficacy of the tulloch rule,we advise you to not perform any work which would be considered a discharge under the tulloch rule.
the landowners asserted that these acts showed a conscious decision on the part of the corps to disregard the american mining congress i injunction.the corps clarified its position regarding the injunction in a subsequent letter the march letter 
o ur february,letter states the corps has been directed to suspend enforcement of the tulloch rule until the issue is ultimately settled in the courts.that remains our position.our next statement we advise you to not perform any work which would be considered a discharge under the tulloch rule is ambiguous and we will clarify it.
potential permit activities proposing activities involving only incidental fallback,will not be required to obtain individual permits.
our past experience with the work performed at the green acres and richter farms is that it has involved bulldozer work where soil was redeposited from one place to another in waters of the united states by bulldozer blades,while trees,limbs,vegetation,root wads and brush were pushed into stockpiles,and land was leveled.these kinds of activities result in more than incidental fallback.
correspondence between the landowners and the corps continued for eight months,with the landowners arguing that the corps assertion of jurisdiction violated the american mining congress i injunction and the corps maintaining that its actions fully comported with the injunction and,accordingly,that the proposed projects on both the green acres farm and the richter the landowners detailed in another request for a a properly subject to the clean water act.finally,in november,the landowners agreed to sell both properties to the missouri department of conservation.the sale was consummated in april.
in june,the landowners filed suit against the government in the united states district court for the western district of missouri,pursuant to the federal tort claims act ftca.their complaint sought monetary relief on four counts trespass nuisance substantive due process violations and inverse condemnation.the government moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,or,in the alternative,to dismiss for failure to state a claim or to grant summary judgment.the district court found that counts and failed the ftca private analogue requirement,see b,and were further barred by the ftca discretionary function exception,see a.it therefore concluded that it did not have jurisdiction to hear those claims and granted the government motion to dismiss see also.b dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
