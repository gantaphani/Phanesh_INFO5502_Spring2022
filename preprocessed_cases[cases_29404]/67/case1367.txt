in august,ocwen notified the quinns that their account was transferred to ocwen early intervention department,and if necessary,the loan may transfer to the foreclosure department.the quinns did not dispute the validity of the debt,but notified ocwen that they would make no further payments unless ocwen used the ach authorization previously executed naming provident,or its successors and assigns.correspondence continued throughout the fall.
by november,no mortgage payment had been made by ach withdraw or by check since june.the mortgagee,wells fargo,by its counsel,wilson associates wilson,notified the quinns that a foreclosure sale would take place in december.additionally,pursuant to the arkansas foreclosure statute,wilson,on behalf of wells fargo,filed a notice of default and intention to sell.later,the foreclosure sale was cancelled,and the quinns refinanced their mortgage with another lender.

breach of contract under arkansas law.
the original ach authorization between the quinns and provident is clear.it authorizes provident,or its successors and assigns,to withdraw the monthly mortgage payment from the quinns bank account.in the ach authorization document,provident makes no promise to transfer the authorization to a buyer or assignee of the mortgage.williamson sanofi winthrop,it is well settled that in order to make a contract there must be a meeting of the minds as to all terms,using objective indicators.
in the ach authorization document,the account holder the quinns assume certain duties.the quinns agree i will provide the financial institution with all documents that the financial institution may require to implement the automatic deduction of my monthly payments.additionally,the quinns accept responsibility for making payments on the note by other means if my payment is not drafted on the day specified no matter the cause.provident,by the terms of the ach authorization,had no duty to assign the authorization to a buyer or assignee of the mortgage.
the quinns claim that they have a contract with wells fargo servicing agent,ocwen,that constitutes an ach authorization.the district court ruled that there was no contract under arkansas law,because there was no mutual assent between ocwen and the quinns to an ach authorization,and because the correspondence and discussions did not produce a new agreement.see quinn ocwen fed.bank,fsb.
there is no express ach authorization between the quinns and ocwen.the quinns emphasize ocwen letter of january,which does state that the loan has been set up on the ach program.however,the quinns ignore the later sentences of the same paragraph of the january letter 
when the servicing of a loan is transferred to ocwen,automatic draft information is not transferred with the loan.a new application is necessary to begin an automatic draft program with ocwen.
as the complaint says 
while ocwen advised that a new ach automatic draft application was necessary to begin the automatic draft program with ocwen,the quinns had advised ocwen that they would not be executing a new ach authorization since the ach authorization the quinns executed in favor of provident had already been assigned to ocwen.
because the quinns can not show the existence of a valid contract with ocwen,they can prove no set of facts entitling them to relief,and the district court properly dismissed their breach of contract claim.
negligence under arkansas law.
the quinns assert ocwen owed a duty to draft their bank account and negligently failed to do so,pursuant to the ach authorization.in order to prove negligence,there must be a failure to exercise proper care in the performance of a legal duty that the defendant owed the plaintiff under the circumstances surrounding them.s
