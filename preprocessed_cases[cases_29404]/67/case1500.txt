we have jurisdiction over this timely appeal pursuant to.we reverse and remand.
in reviewing de novo the district court decision,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.olson idaho state bd.of,cir.
in,mahin oskoui,a registered nurse,purchased a home for herself in los angeles,california.her down payment on the property was.in,the appraised value of the property was.on march,she refinanced her acquisition with a loan from washington mutual bank wamu.as security,she executed a promissory note and a deed of trust securing the note with the property.at that time,wamu was the united states largest savings and loan association until it imploded in during the subprime mortgage crisis and the collapse of the housing bubble.in turn,this debacle triggered massive loan defaults and a severe national economic recession.the office of thrift supervision closed wamu on september,naming the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic as wamu receiver.on september,the fdic transferred wamu assets to defendant chase.
in november,oskoui missed a loan payment,as did many homeowners in similar dire straits.in january,not knowing about wamu demise,she applied to wamu for a loan modification.on may,chase sent her a letter offering her a trial plan agreement.the letter did not advise her of what was required of a borrower or of a loan for approval under the applicable modification rules,regulations,and guidelines.the letter did advise her that i f you comply with all the terms of this agreement,we consider a permanent workout solution for your loan once the trial plan has been completed.the only specified term of the agreement was that oskoui remit three equal payments of to chase between july and september.oskoui signed the agreement on june.
oskoui fully complied with the agreement payment term by timely sending to chase,only to be informed on november,that she did not qualify at this time for a modification under either the federal making home affordable program hamp,a,or the chase modification program champ because y our income is insufficient for the amount of credit you have requested.her monthly income during that period was.chase gave oskoui no additional reasons for its denial even though its internal paperwork reveals two others,each apparently fatal to her attempt to modify her loan.one barrier was the unpaid principal balance on the loan which was higher than the amount allowed under the hamp guidelines.this factor rendered her ineligible for a hamp modification.the other barrier,which made her ineligible for champ relief,was the loan failure to satisfy chase net present value test npv.chase internal modification documents reveal that a person identified as chang determined on november,that oskoui application should be rejected.the document says,denied income insufficient and did not pass the npv calc test.
this test,which chase did not reveal or explain in its november,letter,compares the npv expected from a modification to the npv of the unmodified loan.the test compares cash flow from the modification to the cash flow expected from the absence of a modification.if the cash flow from a viable modification exceeds that of a loan,hamp requires a servicer to offer a modification to a borrower.if the npv test generates a negative result,modification is optional.
not only did chase fail to advise oskoui that she was not eligible for these modifications,it told her instead that we may be able to offer other alternatives to help avoid the negative impact of foreclosure and a deficiency judgment.chase failed to explain what its other alternatives were or what oskoui would be required to demonstrate to qualify for them.
given this enticing invitation,oskoui tried again,by submitting in january another application for a loan modification.she had no inkling that chase had already determined that she was not eligible because of the amount of the unpaid balance of the loan and the npv problems with it.
on march,chase responded by letter to oskoui new application.this letter said chase wants to help you stay in your home and confirmed receipt and review of your verification of income documentation.included with the letter were three payment coupons and three return envelopes,each coupon in the amount of,and due on april,may,and june.the march,letter also stated on the first page after successful completion of the trial period plan,chase will send you a modification agreement for your signature which will modify the loan as necessary to reflect this new payment amount.emphasis added.chase said not a word about any concerns about her income and did not specify anything in that regard as a condition precedent to a modification.the march,letter says on page,however,that i f all payments are made as scheduled,we will consider a permanent workout solution for your loan.this language on page,which is followed by bold type detailing the manner in which she should remit her payments,when read in the light of chase promise on page creates at best a misleading ambiguity.page attempts to temper what chase offered and promised on page a modification agreement for her signature.once again,as with chase november,letter,its march,letter,which oskoui appended to her complaint as exhibit a,failed to alert her to her apparent ineligibility for a modification.
the next event in this process came as quickly as night extinguishes the day.on march,one day after chase letter welcoming oskoui for a second time to its trial period plan tpp and acknowledging receipt of her income verification documents,chase sent her another letter telling her for the first time that she was not eligible for a federal hamp modification because the current unpaid principal balance on your loan is higher than the program limit not only did the letter omit any reference to the fatal npv test,it said that chase was happy to tell oskoui that she may be eligible for other modification programs and that chase may be able to offer other alternatives to stave off the negative impact a possible foreclosure may have on her credit rating,the risk of a deficiency judgment and the possible adverse tax effects of a foreclosure oskoui took these consequences as menacing threats,not friendly legal advice.chase letter did not explain what its other alternatives were or what it would take to qualify for them.also,chase made no mention of the payments it had requested the previous day in its march,letter.because
