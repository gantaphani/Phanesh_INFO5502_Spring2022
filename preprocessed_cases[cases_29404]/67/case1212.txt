mark bell owns a vacation home on the shoreline of lake michigan green bay in door county,wisconsin.in,bell obtained a permit from the wisconsin department of natural resources dnr in order to construct a private pier into the bay.in,bell decided to expand his pier.he therefore attempted to obtain a permit from the dnr so he could build a extension onto his existing pier,a rubble mound breakwater that was feet long and feet wide,and a temporary road on the lakebed to aid construction.the dnr objected to bell permit application and required that bell proceed with an administrative hearing on the issue.instead of proceeding with the administrative hearing,bell filed suit alleging that the dnr violated his rights under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.the district court granted summary judgment to the dnr agent,tere duperrault,and bell now appeals.for the reasons stated herein,we affirm.
background 
under wisconsin law,landowners may not build structures in navigable waters without a permit from the dnr.see.stat.upon receiving a permit application,the dnr either proceeds without a hearing,or if a substantive written objection to issuance of the permit has been received,schedules a public hearing.see.stat.a substantive written objection is a written statement giving specific reasons why a proposed project may violate the statutory provisions applicable to the project and specifying that the person making the objection will appear and present information supporting the objection in a contested case hearing.stat.the dnr itself can object to a permit application even if no member of the public has objected.
beginning in the late,the dnr became concerned about the environmental impact of private structures filling the waterways.therefore,in the dnr put all pending applications on hold while it engaged in an environmental assessment of such structures.the dnr assessment was completed in april and prompted a shift in policy under which permit applications were subjected to increasingly rigorous scrutiny.of the applications pending from,only permits were granted.since,no permits have been issued for new private solid piers or breakwalls.
bell problems with the dnr began on february,when he filed his application to extend his pier and build a breakwater,bell permit application was assigned to tere duperrault,who was then the dnr water management specialist for door county.duperrault reviewed bell application,visited bell property for a field inspection,and met with bell on several occasions.during one of these meetings,duperrault kept bell waiting in her office for approximately thirty minutes while she engaged in a personal phone call with her feet propped on the windowsill.the meeting did not result in any resolution of the application,which frustrated bell who had driven for six hours to attend the meeting.even worse from bell perspective was that the meeting was futile because duperrault had already decided to oppose bell application on behalf of the dnr.
the dnr was not the only party opposed to bell application,however.bell permit application also received public objections from the door county environmental council,the gibraltar preservation council,and an individual citizen,kurt pagel.duperrault determined that all three objections were timely and substantive.
in february bell filed an amended application with the dnr reducing the size of his pier extension and temporary road and adding plans for dredging.bell amended application was nearly identical to the application of one of his neighbors,john hockers,who had been granted a permit without a hearing in.however,in june duperrault informed bell that the dnr was opposing his application.she stated that his proposal would negatively impact fisheries,water quality and aquatic habitat,as well as natural scenic beauty.moreover,bell amended application was still objected to by kurt pagel and the door county environmental council.bell case was therefore scheduled for an administrative hearing.
rather than proceeding with the hearing,bell filed suit against the dnr in federal court.bell complaint alleges that the dnr,and specifically its agent,tere duperrault,violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment when bell was denied a permit unless he participated in an administrative hearing.bell argues that many of his neighbors had been granted permits without hearings,and that he was treated unequally for no legitimate reason.the dnr replies that none of the neighbors were similarly situated to bell,either because of the timing or nature of their applications.
the first of the neighbors that bell asserts was similarly situated is john hockers.hockers applied for a pier extension on february,which was the same filing date as bell original application.bell acknowledges that hockers planned structure was less extensive than bell original proposed pier.but bell contends that his amended application was nearly identical to hockers application and therefore should have been granted.the dnr responds that although bell second application was similar to hockers,it was filed more than a year later when the dnr standards had become much more strict.
the second allegedly similarly situated individual was john koehn,who filed an application for a new pier in march.koehn permit was granted without a hearing in september,despite objections from kurt pagel and the door county planning department.however,the dnr argues that koehn pier was significantly different from bell pier extension because the koehn pier had an section.large allow the free movement of water and materials along the shoreline,and the dnr considers them to be ecologically advantageous.neither of bell proposals included a.
the last two individuals whose plans were allegedly similarly situated to bell were tim halbrook and marc pescheret.both filed applications for permits for reconstruction in which were granted without hearings.the dnr contends that these individuals were not similarly situated to bell because the dnr treats applications to replace dilapidated older structures with new ones more favorably than applications to build entirely new structures.the dnr reasons that replacing old structures provides a net gain for the environment.indeed,both the halbrook and pescheret applications were for the replacement of old piers that did not have with piers that did have.
ii.discussion 
this court reviews the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of duperrault de novo.see basith cook county,cir.in so doing,we must construe all facts in the light most favorable to bell,the nonmoving party.see mccoy harrison,cir.however,we are not required to draw every conceivable inference from the record.id.inferences that are supported by only speculation or conjecture will not defeat a summary judgment motion.id.
with these standards in mind,we proceed to address the merits of bell equal protection claim.typically equal protection claims involve charges of singling out members of a vulnerable group for unequal treatment or charges that a law or policy makes irrational distinctions between groups of people.see esmail macrane,cir.however,equal protection claims may also involve a class of one,where the plaintiff alleges that only he has been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment.village of willowbrook olech,d.the class of one plaintiff bears the burden of proving that he has suffered intentional,irrational,and arbitrary discrimination.see id.at.he can do so either by showing that he was treated differently from identically situated persons for no rational reason,or that he was treated worse than less deserving individuals for no rational reason.see esmail,at stating that equal protection does not just mean treating identically situated persons identically.if a bad person is treated better than a good person,this is just as much an example of unequal treatment.bell argues that he was in such a class of one when the dnr denied his permit application unless he took part in a hearing while granting permits to other similarly situated individuals without a hearing.
unfortunately for bell,his argument fails because he has not shown that others were actually similarly situated.bell has provided no facts disputing that the dnr applied increasingly rigorous scrutiny to permit applications beginning in and continuing over the next several years due to environmental concerns.therefore,bell amended proposal,filed in february,was not similarly situated to hockers proposal which was filed in february.it is also undisputed that after the environmental assessment was released in april,the dnr began emphasizing the importance of structures which would allow littoral currents to flow freely.for this reason,bell proposal which lacked a was not similar to koehn,halbrook,or pescheret proposals which all included.additionally,koehn application was filed in march,eleven months before bell amended proposal.and while halbrook and pescheret did not apply for permits until,they were both replacing already existing structures rather than creating entirely new structures.the dnr argues that such renovations receive preference over applications for new structures because of the net gain to the environment when dilapidated older structures are replaced.
bell of course contests that these applicants were similarly situated to himself.he asserts that since the environmental assessment was completed in april,all permits reviewed after april should have been treated equally.he further points to various elements of the proposed renovation projects that actually made them much more destructive than his own proposal.finally,he argues that no one informed him that were important factors,and therefore it is a reasonable inference that were not important factors.
none of these arguments enables bell to carry the very significant burden of a class of one plaintiff.see discovery house,consolidated city of indianapolis,cir.it is not enough that the dnr acted in a way that bell believes to be ineffective or even destructive.rather,bell must eliminate any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.id.at internal quotation omitted.he has not done so.the evidence shows that the dnr decided to increasingly scrutinize applications beginning in because of environmental concerns.this policy decision is a rational one.also rational is the dnr preference for structures that allow currents to flow naturally and for older structures to be renovated when they become.furthermore,the dnr did not have any obligation to inform bell of its reasoning in.see id.it is possible,of course,that had bell proceeded with his administrative hearing and created a more fulsome record on this issue,he may have discovered evidence that the dnr had no basis for these policies or that the policies were completely irrational.we find it puzzling that bell chose to withdraw his permit application and file suit in federal court rather than attempt to eliminate the problem or at least develop the record with a simple administrative hearing.but on this record,we are left with nothing more than bell speculation and conjecture that a jury could have disbelieved all of the dnr evidence.this is not enough to survive a summary judgment motion.
nor does bell claim succeed when his arguments regarding duperrault alleged discriminatory animus are added into the mix.specifically,bell argues that duperrault demonstrated personal hostility toward him which indicates that she deliberately sought to deprive him of equal protection of the laws bell evidence on this point consists of evidence that duperrault refused to reschedule a meeting although bell informed her that his wife was ill,that bell then drove six hours to attend the meeting which duperrault postponed for thirty minutes while she engaged in a personal phone call with her feet on the windowsill,and that the meeting did not result in any resolution of bell application.bell further notes that duperrault had in fact already decided to oppose bell application,but did not inform him of this decision until several months later.
while duperrault alleged behavior was perhaps inconsiderate or inappropriate,it does not demonstrate the type of animosity that this court has found to support an equal protection claim.see esmail,at.such animosity occurs when a powerful public official pick s on a person out of sheer vindictiveness,or when an official acts for the sole and exclusive purpose of exacting retaliation and vengeance against the plaintiff.id.bureaucratic inefficiencies and even downright rudeness do not rise to this level.were our decision to the contrary,the judicial system would overflow with equal protection claimants seeking damages for the discourteous treatment they received from various public servants.therefore,bell can not establish a genuine issue of material fact that duperrault violated his rights under the equal protection clause when she required him to proceed with his permit application by attending an administrative hearing.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant is affirmed.
i join the majority opinion,but write separately in an effort to clarify the standard on which the majority opinion is prudently noncommittal applicable to class of one equal protection cases.the lack of clarity has been remarked by commentators.robert farrell,classes,persons,equal protection,and village of willowbrook olech,michael mcguinness,the impact of village of willowbrook olech on disparate treatment claims,touro,timothy zick,angry white males the equal protection clause and classes of one,shaun gehan,comment,with malice toward one malice and the substantive law in class of one equal protection claims in the wake of village of willowbrook olech,me,nicole richter,note,a standard for class of one claims under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment protecting victims of based discrimination from vindictive state action,val.it has been a cause of justifiable concern to the judges who have to decide these cases.see,northwestern university city of evanston,wl,at.
in the usual equal protection case,including cases of selective prosecution,which are the converse of cases such as the present one,the plaintiff is complaining about discrimination against a group to which he belongs,such as a racial,religious,or ethnic minority though it need be a minority witness cases.see,united states armstrong,d desi pizza,city of,cir.it has long been apparent,however,that there could be a denial of equal protection even though the victim did not belong to a class larger than himself,city of new orleans dukes,d per curiam indiana state teachers ass board of school comm rs,cir esmail macrane,cir ciechon city of chicago,cir rubinovitz rogato,cir yerardi moody street restaurant lounge,board of selectmen,cir.the troubling question is what exactly the plaintiff in such a case must prove in order to make out a prima facie case.in village of willowbrook olech,d per curiam,the supreme court held that it is enough to allege irrational and wholly arbitrary treatment.id.at.did the court mean to suggest by its choice of words that the rational purpose test used standardly in equal protection jurisprudence for cases not involving fundamental rights also rules cases that is a frightening thought,because,as we noted in milner apfel,cir,the rational purpose test is no longer as toothless as it once seemed,see,romer evans,d city of cleburne cleburne living center,d united states of agriculture moreno,d lawrence texas,d,concurring,and anyone can be a plaintiff.or should irrational and wholly arbitrary be understood as a more stringent test but if so,what is its precise meaning and what significance should be attached to the fact that the case had been decided on the pleadings 
the court in olech was affirming a decision of this court in which we had said that a plaintiff in a case has to prove that the cause of the differential treatment of which he complains was a totally illegitimate animus toward the plaintiff by the defendant,cir.justice breyer concurring opinion in the supreme court endorsed our formul
