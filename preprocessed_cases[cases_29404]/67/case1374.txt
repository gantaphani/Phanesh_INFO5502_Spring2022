on or about november,pipe which was part of the warehouse refrigeration system ruptured,fell,and leaked ammonia causing damage to the warehouse and its contents.this occurred when part of the pipe support system detached from the ceiling due to the weight of ice accumulating on the pipe.macheca notified philadelphia of the loss on november,and made a claim for coverage under the policy.an engineer retained by philadelphia inspected the warehouse on january.by letter,dated february,philadelphia denied macheca claim stating a covered cause of loss had not occurred.the letter also stated a copy of the engineer report was attached.
on april,horvath,counsel for macheca,wrote to philadelphia stating macheca either had not received the engineer report or had misplaced it,and he asked that another copy be sent.he repeated this request in letters to philadelphia dated april,april,june,and september,and in a phone conversation on may.on october,horvath acknowledged receipt of a copy of the engineer report.
on december,macheca filed suit against philadelphia in missouri state court for breach of insurance contract and vexatious refusal to pay.philadelphia removed the case to federal court.in federal court,macheca filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the breach of contract issue.in its memorandum in support of partial summary judgment,macheca advanced and developed the same two theories for coverage it advanced in a letter sent to philadelphia on june.namely,that the loss was covered under the exception to certain exclusions for the specified causes of loss for weight of ice,and the additional coverage macheca purchased for collapse.philadelphia filed a cross motion for summary judgment contending macheca loss was not covered by the policy.philadelphia also filed a motion to disqualify horvath as macheca counsel under rule of the missouri supreme court rules of professional conduct,claiming he would be a necessary witness for macheca vexatious refusal to pay claim 
the district court granted the motion to disqualify horvath as macheca counsel,concluding his communications with philadelphia were relevant in determining whether the refusal to pay macheca claim was willful and without reasonable cause at the time the refusal was made.the district court also granted philadelphia motion for summary judgment and denied macheca motion for partial summary judgment,but failed to address macheca claim the loss was covered under the exception to certain exclusions for the specified causes of loss for weight of ice.rather,the district court addressed philadelphia contention the policy limited coverage for loss to the interior of any building or to personal property in the building caused by or resulting from ice,referring to this provision as an exclusion rather than a limitation on coverage.the district court interpreted the limitation in macheca favor,concluding the limitation referred to ice as an element of the weather,because it was within a list of items solely related to the weather.as such,philadelphia could not limit coverage under this provision of the policy because the ice at issue was not weather related.
the district court then addressed macheca contention the collapse of the ammonia pipe was covered under the additional provision of the policy.referring to missouri court of appeals cases which recognize a collapse only when there is an entire falling or reduction of a structure to a flattened form or rubble,the district court determined the term was not ambiguous,and the pipes had not collapsed.see williams state farm and cas,eaglestein pac.fire ins.
on september,macheca filed a motion for reconsideration of the district court order,noting the court failed to address its primary argument that the loss was covered under the exception to certain exclusions for the specified causes of loss for weight of ice.macheca called the court attention to the argument in its original memorandum in support of partial summary judgment,specifically stating t his coverage argument is also a completely separate basis for coverage from the additional argument on which this court judgment is based.on september,the district court denied the motion for reconsideration without comment.
macheca filed a timely appeal of the district court order granting philadelphia motion for summary judgment and the order granting the motion to disqualify horvath as macheca counsel.

macheca argues the district court erroneously granted summary judgment in favor of philadelphia without considering its argument for coverage under the exception to certain exclusions for the specified causes of loss for weight of ice.philadelphia contends macheca only claimed coverage under the additional provision of the policy,and during the summary judgment proceedings recast its claim by making a second claim implicating coverage for a loss due to the weight of snow and ice under the specified causes of loss provision of the policy.philadelphia further argues this is an attempt by macheca to expand its basis of recovery beyond those previously asserted in its petition complaint and should not be condoned.we disagree.
macheca clearly made a claim in the district court under the exception to certain exclusions for the specified causes o
