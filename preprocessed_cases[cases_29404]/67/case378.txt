defendant francis boccagna pleaded guilty in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york joanna seybert,judge to one count of making a false statement to a federally insured lending institution in violation of.sentenced to a term of three years probation,boccagna appeals only from the part of his judgment of conviction that,pursuant to the mandatory victims restitution act of mvra,stat,codified principally at and,orders him to pay in restitution to the united states department of housing and urban development hud,the guarantor on various defaulted loans obtained pursuant to the charged criminal scheme.boccagna challenges his restitution order on three grounds.first,he asserts that the order violates the sixth amendment as construed in united states booker,d,because the award is based on facts that were neither proved beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury nor admitted by him in his plea allocution.second,boccagna argues that hud was,in any event,not entitled to any restitution because its claimed losses were more than offset by the fair market value of the foreclosed collateral that it acquired upon payment of the defaulted loans.see b b ii.boccagna asserts that the district court erred as a matter of law in calculating offset value by reference to the nominal sale price at which hud subsequently transferred title to the collateral to a city development agency.finally,boccagna submits that the district court inclusion in its restitution order of certain expenses incurred by hud in order to acquire title to the foreclosed collateral impermissibly compensated hud for consequential damages.
our recent decision in united states reifler,cir,conclusively resolves the first of these issues.reifler holds that judicial factfinding relevant to an mvra restitution order does not implicate sixth amendment rights.see id.at.accordingly,without further discussion,we hereby reject as without merit boccagna constitutional challenge to the restitution order.
insofar as boccagna also challenges the district court valuation of real property to be offset against hud loss,we observe that,for purposes of valuing lost or the mvra,fair market value will generally provide the best measure to ensure restitution in the full amount of the victim loss.f a.at the same time,however,we recognize that,in some circumstances,for example,where property is unique or where no active market exists for its purchase,other measures of value may better serve the mvra compensatory purpose.for this reason,we decline to hold that,as a matter of law,only fair market value may be used in calculating property values under the mvra.nevertheless,we conclude that the nominal sale price of property with a higher fair market value can not be used to calculate offset value because such a calculation impermissibly awards a victim restitution in excess of its compensable loss.see united states nucci,cir.accordingly,we hereby vacate so much of the judgment of conviction as orders boccagna to pay hud in restitution,and we remand for recalculation of restitution in a manner consistent with this opinion.
factual background 
k mortgage loans 
from november through december,francis boccagna and various confederates participated in an elaborate scheme fraudulently to obtain millions of dollars through private real estate mortgage loans insured by hud under its k loan program.see,et.the k program is hud primary vehicle for stimulating the private rehabilitation and development of residential properties,consistent with hud stated mission to increase home ownership,support community development and increase access to affordable housing free from discrimination.appellee br.
to procure a k loan,a prospective buyer must submit both a mortgage application to an approved private lender and a k application to hud.the private lender grants the mortgage contingent on hud approving the k application and agreeing to guarantee the loan.once hud approval is secured,the private lender disburses money to the buyer in two steps.at step one,the buyer directly receives the amount of money necessary to purchase the residence at issue.at step two,another sum of money is placed into an escrow account,from which the buyer is authorized to make withdrawals to pay for the accrued costs of rehabilitation work.the regulations effectively limit the number of properties an individual such as boccagna can acquire and rehabilitate through the k loan program.no such limitation,however,applies to organizations,which can be awarded multiple k loans to acquire and rehabilitate numerous income properties.
b.the fraud scheme 
in the late,boccagna surveyed the new york city residential real estate market in search of undervalued distressed properties.purchasing a host of these properties in his own name,boccagna proceeded to sell them to organizations at inflated prices in the period from january to december,boccagna flipped residential properties,most located in harlem,to organizations.
in fact,the transactions were shams.the organizations were mere nominal purchasers complicit with boccagna and his confederates in a scheme to obtain millions of dollars in k loans under false pretenses.for each property purchased by a,boccagna generally paid representatives of that organization to in kickbacks.thereafter,boccagna assumed sole responsibility for the maintenance and contracting costs on the acquired properties,as well as for repayment of the k mortgage loans.boccagna original plan was to use this loan money to rehabilitate the properties quickly and to sell them in the open market for a profit to be split between boccagna and the nominal owners.the scheme soon ran into an insurmountable hurdle new york city zoning bureaucracy.unable to secure the certificates required to effect a quick rehabilitation and resale of the properties,boccagna instead found himself carrying high mortgage and maintenance costs on unprofitable realty.by early,with his assets almost depleted,boccagna decided to contact government authorities and to confess his misdeeds.
hud acquisition and disposition of certain mortgaged properties 
at some unspecified point after boccagna approached the government,of the fraudulently acquired properties were in foreclosure proceedings.as guarantor of the k mortgage loans,hud eventually acquired title to of these properties the foreclosure properties by paying down the accelerated loan balances,as well as outstanding taxes,maintenance fees,and associated expenses.this resulting loss to hud totaled.
to dispose of the foreclosure properties in a manner consistent with its mission,hud,in january,entered into a memorandum of understanding with the new york city department of housing preservation and development hpd whereby hpd agreed to purchase the foreclosure properties for what the government concedes were essentially nominal prices ranging from to,for a total of.it was further agreed that hud and hpd would jointly undertake to repair a total of dwelling units in the foreclosure properties.hud would pay relocation expenses for families that had to move during the renovation.meanwhile,hpd agreed to afford all existing tenants in the foreclosure properties the opportunity to purchase renovated dwelling units at affordable prices to provide federally funded rental assistance to qualifying tenants.
boccagna plea and sentencing 
meanwhile,on march,boccagna pleaded guilty to one count of making false statements for the purpose of influencing the lending decisions of federally insured financial institutions,for which crime he faced a statutory maximum prison sentence of thirty years.see.pursuant to the mvra,the district court was required,in sentencing boccagna,to order him to pay restitution to any victim of his scheme that had sustained a pecuniary loss.see id.
in its presentence report psr to the district court,the probation department recommended that boccagna be held accountable,both for purposes of guidelines calculation,see b,and restitution,for a loss to hud.although the probation department did not provide the court with numerical calculations supporting its recommendation,it stated that the reported loss represent s the difference between the amounts paid out by hud and the sales prices of the properties to the third parties.psr.both the defendant and the government filed written submissions with the district court challenging this calculation.
in an august,letter,boccagna counsel submitted that hud had sustained no loss either for purposes of guidelines calculation or restitution.he noted that the defense had not been provided with any documentation to support the loss amount recommended in the psr.in any event,he submitted that,if the court were to consider the fair market value of the foreclosure properties at the time of sentence,that offset value would exceed the outlays made by hud.rosenberg letter at.
in its august,submission to the court,the government contended that the psr overstated the loss amount relevant to the calculation of boccagna sentencing guidelines range and understated the loss relevant to restitution.it argued that,for guidelines purposes,hud loss should be calculated not by reference to its outlays with respect to all of the foreclosure properties,but only with respect to the eleven properties whose sale to hpd was final at the time of sentencing.see,application note e ii.thus,it proposed a guidelines loss figure of,representing hud total payments of in connection with these properties minus the total purchase price paid by hpd.with respect to restitution,however,the government argued that the court was required to order boccagna to pay hud,representing hud loss reduced by the it expected to realize when the sales of all foreclosure properties to hpd were finalized.
in an addendum to the original psr,the probation department adopted the government actual loss figure of to recalculate boccagna guidelines,resulting in a recommended month prison range.probation further urged that restitution to hud be limited to this same amount,explaining that recent appraisals of the foreclosure properties whose sale to hpd had not yet been finalized had been determined by the government to be equivalent to hud loss.psr addendum at.thus,because the possibility exists that the remaining foreclosure properties could be sold at higher prices than those agreed to by hpd and thus could effectively cancel out any remaining restitution,probation recommended an award of,representing the final actual loss amount at the time of sentence.id.in an apparent reference to d affording victim sixty days after discovery of further losses to petition court for amended restitution order,probation noted that s hould this figure rise in the future,the restitution order may need to be modified.id.
when boccagna appeared for sentencing on august,the parties primary focus was understandably on circumstances that might support a sentence.after the district court stated its intent to impose a probationary sentence,however,they shifted their attention to the calculation of restitution.the government renewed its written request for an restitution order,explaining that hud expected to recover only of its loss through the sale of foreclosure properties to hpd.similarly,defense counsel reiterated his complaint about the lack of documentation to support the government restitution calculation and repeated his request to use the fair market value of the foreclosure properties to offset hud loss.noting simply that boccagna early plea likely afforded him an advantage in the calculation of hud loss,see sentencing tr.at you come in early on,you get a much better number because there are that many properties in default,the district court ordered restitution in the full amount requested by the government,that amount to be paid by boccagna jointly and severally with ten other persons prosecuted separately for their participation in the same fraud scheme.
ii.discussion 
boccagna challenge and the standard of review 
the mvra mandates that n otwithstanding any other provision of law,a sentencing court shall order defendants convicted of certain crimes to make restitution to their victims.a see united states reifler,at.in the case of a crime resulting in damage to or loss or destruction of property of a victim,the statute further provides that the order of restitution shall require the defendant to 
a return the property to the owner of the property or someone designated by the owner or 
b if return of the property under subparagraph a is impossible,impracticable,or inadequate,pay an amount equal to 
i the greater of 
i the value of the property on the date of the damage,loss,or destruction or 
ii the value of the property on the date of sentencing,less 
ii the value as of the date the property is returned of any part of the property that is returned.
id.b.on this appeal,we focus primarily on subpart b of this mvra provision.
in challenging the restitution order in his case,boccagna does not dispute that his fraud crime of conviction falls within the mvra mandate.see id.c a ii stating that mvra applies in all sentencing proceedings involving an offense against property under this title,including any offense committed by fraud or deceit.nor does he challenge hud status as a victim of his offense that incurred loss.see id.a defining victim.instead,he claims that hud is not entitled to any restitution award because its loss was fully compensated by the fair market value of the foreclosure properties to which it acquired title.see id.b b ii.in opposing this argument,the government does not dispute that,pursuant to b b ii,hud loss was appropriately offset by recouped collateral it submits simply that the district court acted within its discretion in valuing this collateral at hud nominal resale price to hpd without regard to its fair market value.
in general,we review an mvra order of restitution deferentially,and we will reverse only for abuse of discretion.united states reifler,at united states harris,cir per curiam.to identify such abuse,we must conclude that a challenged ruling rests on an error of law,a clearly erroneous finding of fact,or otherwise can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.united states gonzalez,cir internal quotation marks omitted.to the extent boccagna contends that the district court erred as a matter of law in using a nominal resale price rather than fair market value to calculate offset value in this case or in including collateral damages within hud loss,he raises questions of law that we review de novo.see united states reifler,at united states ekanem,cir see also united states simmonds,cir reviewing de novo district court use of replacement value to measure loss under mvra united states shugart,cir same.
boccagna fails to identify the fair market value of the foreclosure properties on the date of hud acquisition 
before discussing boccagna argument that the district court was obliged to calculate the offset value of the foreclosure properties by reference to their fair market value,we note that he fails to identify that value in the record.although the august,addendum to boccagna psr states that recent appraisals conclude that the value of the foreclosure properties equals hud loss,psr addendum at,these appraisals are not available for our review because they are not part of the record on appeal.in any event,because they appear not to have been conducted until sometime in,their relevancy to a determination of offset value is questionable.
the mvra plainly states that offset value must be determined as of the date property is recouped by the victim.see b b ii requiring offset value to be determined as of the date the property is returned.because hud acquisition of the foreclosure properties preceded the referenced appraisals by several years,it is by no means obvious that the appraisals provide a reliable measure of the properties fair market value as of the date specified in the mvra.thus,to the extent the district court,on remand,will need to consider the fair market value of the foreclosure properties in calculating an offset against loss,the parties should be prepared to produce evidence of fair market value on the date when title passed to hud.
although the mvra does not mandate the use of fair market value to value property,nominal resale price can not be used as the measure of property value 
the plain language of the mvra does not mandate a single measure of property value 
in considering whether the mvra requires property to be valued by reference to fair market value,we begin with the text of the statute.see robinson shell oil,d marvel characters,simon,cir.if the statutory language is unambiguous on this point,and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent,no further inquiry is required.robinson shell oil,at.internal quotation marks omitted.in determining whether statutory language is unambiguous,we reference the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.id.at.accord daniel am.bd.of emergency medicine,cir.only if we conclude that statutory language is ambiguous do we resort to canons of construction and,if the meaning still remains ambiguous,to legislative history.daniel am.bd.of emergency medicine,at.
the mvra employs the term value in two separate,but interrelated,clauses necessary to the calculation of a restitution award.title b b i references the value of the victim property that was damaged,lost,or destroyed as a result of the crime of conviction.b b i emphasis added.subsection ii references the value of any part of the property that is returned,in other words,the offset value.id.b b ii emphasis added.thus,the mvra unambiguously tells a court what to value the property lost the property returned and even when to value it in the case of the loss value,property is evaluated on the date of the damage,loss,or destruction,id.b b i i,or on the date of sentencing,id.b b i ii,whichever is greater in the case of offset value,property is evaluated as of the date the property is returned,id.b b ii.the statute is silent,however,on the question of how the referenced property is to be valued.see united states simmonds,at observing that mvra is silent as to which measure should be used to determine the value of the property associates commercial rash,d observing that a of the bankruptcy code does speak to the how question of valuation for specified property emphasis in original.notably,nowhere does the statute reference fair market value as the only measure to be used in making the restitution calculations contemplated by b b.bfp resolution trust,d declining,in bankruptcy context,to use fair market value as measure of property value,noting that the term did not appear in the relevant statute although it was referenced in other provisions of law.rather,the law appears to contemplate the exercise of discretion by sentencing courts in determining the measure of value appropriate to restitution calculation in a given case.title f a states that a court shall order restitution to each victim in the full amount of each victim losses as determined by the court and without consideration of the economic circumstances of the defendant.emphasis added.accordingly,because the law recognizes a number of reasonable measures of property value,see bfp resolution trust,at.discussing use of foreclosure price as measure of value in bankruptcy proceeding united states simmonds,at using replacement value rather than fair market value in calculating restitution,we construe value as used in the mvra to be a flexible concept to be calculated by a district court by the measure that best serves congress statutory purpose,see generally sutton united air lines,d holding that statutory language should be construed in light of the purposes congress sought to serve united states duverge perez,cir a district judge has broad discretion as to what types of procedure are needed at a sentencing proceeding for determination of relevant disputed facts.internal quotation marks omitted.
value determinations must serve the compensatory purpose of the mvra 
fair market value determinations will generally best serve the mvra compensatory purpose 
in determining the appropriate measure of value for property relevant to restitution,a district court must consider that the purpose of restitution is essentially compensatory to restore a victim,to the extent money can do so,to the position he occupied before sustaining injury.see hughey states,d observing that the meaning of restitution is restoring someone to a position he occupied before a particular event united states coriaty,cir holding that statutory focus of the mvra is upon making victims whole.because the mvra mandates that restitution be ordered to crime victims for the full amount of losses caused by a defendant criminal conduct,see f a united states reifler,at remanding where calculation errors violated the mvra requirement that the order of restitution award restitution in the full amount of the victims losses,it can fairly be said that the primary and overarching purpose of the mvra is to make victims of crime whole,to fully compensate these victims for their losses and to restore these victims to their original state of.united states simmonds,at.
in most circumstances,fair market value will be the measure most apt to serve this statutory purpose.fair market value is defined as the price that a seller is willing to accept and a buyer is willing to pay on the open market and in an arm length transaction.black law dictionary ed see also gillespie united states,cir defining fair market value as the price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller quoting united states cartwright,d restatement of restitution cmt.b defining value of property acquired by consciously tortious conduct as the amount for which it could be exchanged if there were an open market with a wide opportunity for buyers.because this price reflects the value of property greatest economic use,it generally provides the most reliable measure of both the full loss sustained by a victim when his property is damaged,lost,or destroyed,and the degree to which that loss is mitigated by recouped property.
b.other measures of value can sometimes better serve the statute compensatory purpose 
notwithstanding the general reliability of fair market value as a measure of property value,in some circumstances other measures of value may more accurately serve the statutory purpose to ensure a crime victim recovery of the full amount of his loss.
for example,when the actual cash value of the damaged,lost,or destroyed property is difficult to an item is unique,or because there is not a broad and active market for it,replacement cost rather than fair market value may better compensate a victim for the full amount of his loss.united states shugart,at.in shugart,the property at issue was a georgia church destroyed by arson.as the eleventh circuit noted,a church is hardly a fungible commodity for which congregations may trade in an active market.id.rather,a church is a unique property,valued by its members precisely because of its location,its design,and the memories it evokes.id.because the market would not necessarily factor all these considerations into its determination of value,shugart concluded that the only effective way to return to the victims the fair equivalent of what they lost was to award restitution by reference to replacement value so that the congregation could rebuild a church comparable in size and design on the same lot where the original church stood.id.
following shugart,the third circuit has also used replacement rather than fair market value in awarding restitution to an arson victim for the loss of residential furniture.see united states simmonds,at.although the furniture was not unique,the court concluded that it had a personal value to its owners that could not be captured or accurately estimated by simply determining its market value.id.at.
obviously,a concern for the unique or personal value of property is more apt to arise with respect to property lost,rather than substitute property recouped,by the victim.because substitute property is recouped by a crime victim in lieu of the cash compensation to which he would otherwise be entitled as restitution for his loss,see generally united states oren,cir observing that if victim declines to accept land offered in compensation for loss,defendant must pay restitution without benefit of an offset,the offset value of such property is generally best determined by reference to the cash it would bring the victim in a sale on the open market.we recognize that,in some circumstances,the market for recouped property may be poorly developed or.for example,where collateral is subject to foreclosure proceedings,a sentencing court may consider whether a price most accurately represents its fair market value on the date of acquisition.bfp resolution trust,at.noting that property that must be sold within foreclosure strictures is simply worth less emphasis in original 
in any event,because the mvra does not,in haec verba,require a district court to value property only by reference to fair market value,and because other measures of value may,in appropriate circumstances,provide a more accurate measure of the full amount of a victim loss,we decline to hold that,as a matter of law,district courts may only use fair market value in making the property calculations contemplated by b b.
a nominal sale price can not be used to measure offset value because it affords the victim a windfall 
although we recognize a sentencing court discretion,when fashioning a restitution award,to value property by reference to measures other than fair market value,that discretion is necessarily circumscribed by an important caveat the mvra does not permit awards in excess of the amount of the victim loss.united states nucci,at see also id.observing that reading the mvra to provide recovery in excess of the amount of the loss would be in derogation of the common law,which congress has not clearly and unequivocally authorize d.in short,a sentencing court can not order restitution that goes beyond making the victim whole.united states gordon,cir united states dawson,cir holding that victim should not receive anything more in restitution than is required to make it whole.it can not award the victim a windfall,more in restitution than he actually lost.united states arutunoff,cir see united states stanley,cir holding mvra does not allow double recovery by a victim.
mindful of this principle,we conclude that when recouped property is resold at a nominal price,a court abuses its discretion in using that price to calculate offset value because such a calculation necessarily exceeds the amount necessary to make the victim whole it effectively awards the victim both restitution in the full amount of loss offset only by the nominal sale price and the benefit of the recouped property to the extent that the victim is able to make a gift to a putative purchaser in an amount equal to the difference between the property fair market value and the nominal sale price.such a valuation method does not put the victim in the same position he would have been in but for the defendant criminal conduct it puts him in a better position.
a concrete example illustrates the point.if a theft victim suffered the loss of a jewel with a fair market value of,and if he thereafter recouped from the defendant a substitute jewel with a market value of,and if the victim sold the substitute jewel to his son for,the use of that nominal sale price as offset value would allow the victim to receive the benefit of both a gift to his son,and in restitution from the defendant,for a total recovery of on his loss.plainly,such a restitution calculation would put the victim in a significantly better position than he was in before the theft 
the government submits that hud transfers of foreclosure properties to hpd are distinguishable because the challenged nominal sale prices were agreed to pursuant to the agency mission to promote affordable low income housing.as hud explains in its brief 
hud sales to hpd were made pursuant to a program designed to further the agency mission in accordance with this purpose it conveyed the properties to hpd at nominal amounts that furthered the program goals of protecting tenants,ensuring quality restoration of the buildings,and creating affordable housing opportunities.
if hud had been required simply to sell to the highest bidder,there would have been no guarantee that these properties would actually be developed or that they would be used as affordable housing u nder the circumstances,the only reasonable option available to hud was to convey the properties to hpd.
appellee br.
however laudable hud motives in entering into its agreement with hpd,that fact does not help us resolve this appeal.the issue before us is not,after all,whether the district court could insist that hud sell the foreclosure properties to the highest bidder.it could not.the issue is whether hud voluntary decision to sell the foreclosure properties at a nominal rather than fair market price entitles it to recoup the difference between these two amounts as part of a restitution award against boccagna.
preliminary to answering this precise question,we reiterate our earlier observation that the mvra requires recouped property to be valued as of the date it is received by the victim.see b b ii.because hud did not reach a sale agreement with hpd until january,some time after hud itself acquired title to the foreclosure properties,its resale price to nominal or not appear to be a timely measure of value 
more to the point,although hud is a government entity,nothing in the plain language of the mvra draws a distinction between government and private victims for purposes of calculating restitution.because no victim can recover restitution in an amount that exceeds its loss,we necessarily conclude that calculating offset value by reference to a nominal sale price is no more permissible when the victim is a government agency than when the victim is an individual or private entity because such a calculation inevitably results in a windfall to the victim.
by taking title to the foreclosure properties,hud acquired the ability to defray its loss by whatever dollar amount the highest bidder would have paid for those properties in an arm length market transaction conducted contemporaneous to the transfer.that dollar amount represents the reasonable offset value of the properties.the difference if any between and that sale dollar amount represents the restitution award necessary to compensate hud in the full amount of its loss.
when,instead of selling the foreclosure properties on the open market,hud opted to transfer the properties to hpd,the properties value was not thereby reduced to the nominal price.indeed,if the properties had been destroyed by arson on the eve of transfer to hpd,we expect hud would vigorously challenge the arsonist argument that the nominal price represents the value of the property for purposes of calculating his restitution obligations to hud.in any event,the nominal price was not the only value hud received for the properties.it also obtained hpd guarantee that the properties would be developed as income residences.like the recouped jewel in our earlier hypothetical,this guarantee had a value to hud equal,at least,to the market price that it decided to forego.a sentencing court can not allow hud to receive both the benefit of this development guarantee and a restitution award offset only by a nominal sale price.to do so would place it in a better position than it was in before it agreed to guarantee the k loans.it would obligate boccagna both to compensate hud for the full amount of its loss less only hpd nominal payments and to subsidize the sale to hpd at least in the amount for which the fair market value of the property exceeded what hpd paid 
in urging a contrary conclusion,hud submits that its fraudulently induced k loan guarantees were premised on the borrowers promise to develop the properties as income residences.in short,it argues that it obtained nothing more from hpd than it had expected from the deceitful borrowers.hud may well be entitled to sue the borrowers and their confederates for the benefit of its guarantee bargain,but the mvra is not the vehicle to obtain what would,in effect,be expectation damages.
expectation damages strive to place an aggrieved party in the same economic position it would have been
