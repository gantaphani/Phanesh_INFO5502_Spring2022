mortgage electronic registration systems,mers,a subsidiary of merscorp,operates an electronic mortgage registration system the mers system.mers is distinct from the mers system.the mers system is a private electronic database that records the ownership of and servicing rights in home loans.various financial institutions are members of the mers system.we described the operation of the system in our recent decision in cervantes countrywide home loans,cir.we have before us an appeal from an order of the district court dismissing plaintiffs claims related to the formation and operation of the mers system.we dismiss in part,affirm in part,and reverse in part.
background 
under the mers system,the lender owns the home loan borrower or mortgagor promissory note.mers,as the nominee of the lender and of any assignee of the lender,is designated in the deed of trust or mortgage as the beneficiary or mortgagee under the deed of trust.for convenience,we will use the terms borrower,deed of trust,and beneficiary,rather than mortgagor,mortgage,and mortgagee.mers rather than the lender or lender assignee is recorded as the beneficiary under the deed of trust in the recording system of the county where the property is located.
use of the mers system typically begins when a borrower from a mers member signs a promissory note and a deed of trust.the mers member takes possession of the note,and mers is recorded as the beneficiary under the deed of trust.the note is almost always assigned to others,often several times over.if the note is assigned to a mers member,mers remains the beneficiary under the deed of trust.mers contends that there is no need to record the assignment of the note so long as the assignee is a mers member.however,when an assignment is made to a nonmember of mers,the identity of the assignee is recorded.about half of the residential mortgages in the united states are now recorded with mers named as the beneficiary under the deed of trust.see,chain of title,loss mitigation,and other issues in mortgage servicing hearing before the subcomm.on hous.and cmty.opportunity of the comm.on fin,cong.statement of arnold,president and ceo,merscorp,see also jesse hamilton,regulators examining departures at mortgage registry,bloomberg,pm,http.s reg.
the mers system has been sharply criticized.see,tanya marsh,foreclosures and the failure of the american land title recording system,colum.sidebar,noting that mers has been a controversial innovation and highlighting that the system inherent opaqueness may conceal shoddy recordkeeping practices christopher peterson,foreclosure,subprime mortgage lending,and the mortgage electronic registration system,cin,outlining mers q uestionable legal foundations and arguing that t he shift away from recording loans in the name of actual mortgagees and assignees represents an important policy change that erodes not only the tax base of local governments,but also the usefulness of the public land title information infrastructure christopher peterson,two faces demystifying the mortgage electronic registration system land title theory,mary,criticizing the incoherence of mers legal position regarding mers status with respect to mortgages registered in the mers system,which is exacerbated by a corporate structure that is so unorthodox as to be considered arguably fraudulent,and criticizing the unreliability of the mers database david weber,the magic of the mortgage electronic registration system it is and it is,am,describing mers imperfect implementation and lack of transparency see also michael powell gretchen morgenson,mers it may have swallowed your loan,times,march,http describing the mounting legal challenges facing mers.
the obvious advantage of the mers system is that it allows residential lenders to avoid the bother and expense of recording every change of ownership of promissory notes.see,phyllis slesinger daniel mclaughlin,mortgage electronic registration system,idaho,about us,mers,last visited may,stating that mers was created by the mortgage banking industry to streamline the mortgage process.critics have pointed out,however,that this advantage accrues almost exclusively to financial institutions,and that the mers system has a number of disadvantages it has substantially undermined what had been a comprehensive,stable,and relatively reliable public system of recording interests in residential real estate.ownership of notes for residential loans that are processed through the mers system is now recorded in the system electronic database,but that information is not available to the general public.it is impossible to determine from an inspection of county records who is the actual owner of any note secured by a deed of trust for which mers is named as the beneficiary.the familiar public recording system has thus been replaced,in significant part,by a largely invisible and not always reliable system of voluntary by mers members.see,alan white,losing the paper mortgage assignments,note transfers,and consumer protection,loy.consumer.further,because the identities of the actual owners of the notes and beneficiaries of the deeds of trust are not public knowledge,renegotiation of mortgage loans processed through the mers system is very difficult,often impossible.the mers system has also facilitated the bundling of promissory notes into investment pools,and the sale of interests in those pools to downstream investors.before the mortgage loan crisis in,the bundling of notes and sale of interests to investors greatly encouraged the flow of money into the overheated residential mortgage market.
some states have enacted legislation to mitigate the difficulties created by the widespread use of the mers system.many of these statutes seek to increase transparency in the foreclosure process by requiring that foreclosure notices provide more information to the homeowner about the parties involved in the foreclosure proceedings.see generally john rao et,consumer law,foreclosures ed compiling laws in california,colorado,georgia,maine,maryland,massachusetts,new jersey,and north carolina.california,under whose law a number of claims in this case arise,has recently enacted the homeowner bill of rights.among other things,the new california statute seeks to ensure that borrowers who may qualify for a foreclosure alternative are considered for,and have a meaningful opportunity to obtain,available loss mitigation options,including by streamlining communication between the distressed borrower and foreclosing party.see assemb,reg.sess.cal,reg.sess.cal.
there has been a wave of litigation in state and federal courts challenging various aspects of the mers system.almost all of the relevant law is state rather than federal.the results under state law have been inconsistent.see weber,supra,at cataloguing the schizophrenic position of state courts on issues relating to the mers system.some state supreme courts have upheld the mers system on issues ranging from foreclosure authority to recording requirements.see,renshaw mortg.registration,idaho holding that mers may be a beneficiary as nominee for the lender,that assignments of the deed of trust between mers members need not be recorded,that mers was not liable to the borrower in negligence,and that the idaho consumer protection act did not provide a cause of action to the borrower jackson mortg.registration,holding that minnesota law does not require recording of assignments of promissory notes among mers members edelstein bank of mellon,stating that,although a split note and deed are not enforceable,under nevada law any split is cured when the promissory note and the deed of trust are reunified bucci lehman.bank,fsb,holding that mers had the contractual authority to invoke the power of sale and the right to foreclose and that rhode island law did not preclude foreclosure where the noteholder and the mortgagee were not the same entity.
other state supreme courts have reached essentially opposite conclusions.see,mortg.registration,sw.homes of,holding that,because mers receives no payments on the debt,it is not the beneficiary,even though it is so designated in the deed of trust landmark bank kesler,i n the event that a mortgage loan somehow separates interests of the note and the deed of trust,with the deed of trust lying with some independent entity,the mortgage may become unenforceable.mortg.registration,saunders,me holding that mers lacked standing to foreclose as the lender nominee cpt asset backed certificates,series cin kham,holding that the putative noteholder lacked standing to foreclose because mers lacked authority to assign the note,though it arguably had authority to assign the mortgage brandrup recontrust,or en banc holding that mers was not the beneficiary of a deed of trust under the oregon trust deed act absent conveyance to mers of the beneficial right to repayment,and that mers could not hold or transfer legal title to the deed as the lender nominee bain metro.mortg,en banc holding that mers is an ineligible beneficiary within the terms of the washington deed of trust act if it never held the promissory note or other debt instrument secured by the deed of trust,and that characterizing mers as the beneficiary has the capacity to deceive and may give rise to an action under the consumer protection act see also merscorp,romaine,kaye,dissenting in part identifying concerns with the mers system and at least a disparity between the relevant statute and the burgeoning electronic mortgage industry.
federal courts,applying state law,have reached similarly disparate results.compare,montgomery,merscorp,d,applying pennsylvania law and holding that the county allegations that mers violated recording statutes by failing to record assignments stated a claim for relief,in re thomas,applying massachusetts law and holding that w hile the assignment purports to assign both the mortgage and the note,mers was never the holder of the note,and therefore lacked the right to assign it mers is never the owner of the obligation secured by the mortgage for which it is the mortgagee of record,and in re wilhelm,applying idaho law and holding that mers is not authorized either expressly or by implication to transfer notes as the nominal beneficiary of the lender,with town of johnston merscorp,d,holding rhode island law does not require recording of assignments among mers members defranceschi wells fargo bank,d,granting summary judgment to defendants on plaintiffs claims that assignments by mers were invalid and rendered foreclosure defective,and moore mccalla raymer,llc,d,applying georgia law and holding that,even assuming the plaintiff had standing to challenge the foreclosure on the theory that mers assignments were invalid,that theory did not provide a basis for a wrongful foreclosure claim.
a number of federal lawsuits challenging the formation and operation of the mers system were consolidated by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation the jpml and transferred in part to a multidistrict litigation court the mdl court in the district of arizona.the jpml remanded to the respective transferor courts claims unrelated to the formation operation of the mers system.judge teilborg of the mdl court issued a series of orders determining which claims had been transferred to the mdl court,and which had been remanded to the transferor courts.in an early order on the merits,the mdl court dismissed several of the transferred actions.we affirmed that dismissal in cervantes.
plaintiffs in the remaining actions before the mdl court filed a single consolidated amended complaint cac.plaintiffs are borrowers who reside in arizona,california,nevada,oregon,and south carolina,and whose notes and deeds of trust were processed through the mers system.defendants are various financial institutions who have,or have had,interests in the notes and deeds of trust,or who have otherwise been involved in the operation of the mers system.the mdl court dismissed the cac with prejudice,and plaintiffs timely appealed.
for the reasons that follow,we dismiss in part,affirm in part,and reverse in part.
ii.standard of review 
we review orders of the jpml only by writ of mandamus.e see id.a.we review de novo the district court dismissal of a complaint under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.lacey maricopa,cir en banc.the district court denial of leave to amend is reviewed for abuse of discretion.drew equifax info,llc,cir.
iii.discussion 
jpml order 
appellants contend on appeal that the jpml erred in transferring the cases to the mdl court for consolidated pretrial litigation.mandamus is the exclusive mechanism for reviewing jpml orders.e see in re wilson,cir in re food lion,fair labor standards act effective scheduling,cir.appellants have not sought a writ of mandamus,and we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction their appeal of the jpml order.
mdl court remand orders 
appellants contend that the mdl court erred in determining which claims were remanded to the transferor courts under the jpml order.they argue that the mdl court exceeded its authority in deciding which claims were remanded.they also argue that the mdl court was inconsistent in determining which claims were remanded to the transferor courts under the jpml order.they made neither argument to the mdl court.
generally,arguments not raised in the district court will not be considered for the first time on appeal.exxon shipping baker,see also pinney nokia,cir holding that plaintiffs had waived the issue of remand by failing to raise it with the jpml or the district court.we see no reason to depart from our general practice here.we hold that appellants have waived their arguments regarding the mdl court remand orders.
summary judgment 
appellants contend that the mdl court improperly converted defendants motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim into a motion for summary judgment.we disagree.
the federal rules provide for sua sponte conversion of a rule b motion to dismiss to a rule motion for summary judgment if matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court.d.the district court must notify the parties before taking such action,in order to provide to the parties a fair opportunity to present material relevant to summary judgment.garaux pulley,cir.
nothing in the record suggests that the mdl court considered extraneous materials in ruling on defendants motion to dismiss under rule b.the record makes clear that the mdl court dismissed the cac based only on the deficiencies in the cac.see mendiondo centinela hosp.med,cir explaining that rule b provides for dismissal where the complaint lacks a cognizable legal theory or sufficient facts to support a cognizable legal theory.
dismissal of the complaint 
the mdl court dismissed with prejudice all claims in the cac.the cac is long and somewhat diffuse,not always making clear the state whose law is at issue.further,appellants brief on appeal does not specify with complete clarity which claims in the cac they contend were improperly dismissed.as best we can determine,appellants appeal the dismissals of count i violation of.false documents count ii wrongful foreclosure under arizona,california,and nevada law count iii violation of.nonjudicial foreclosure count v aiding and abetting wrongful foreclosure under arizona,california,and nevada law and count vi aiding and abetting predatory lending under arizona,california,and nevada law.some of these claims were brought against fewer than all of the defendants.claims brought under oregon law were withdrawn in the mdl court,and claims brought under south carolina law were not raised in appellants opening brief.the appeal from the dismissal of claims brought against cal western reconveyance corporation has been automatically stayed,under a separate order,because of the pendency of cal western bankruptcy proceeding.
the cac seeks damages and declaratory relief based on alleged violations of arizona false documents statute.the statute provides in relevant part 
a.a person purporting to claim an interest in,or a lien or encumbrance against,real property,who causes a document asserting such claim to be recorded in the office of the county recorder,knowing or having reason to know that the document is forged,groundless,contains a material misstatement or false claim or is otherwise invalid is li
