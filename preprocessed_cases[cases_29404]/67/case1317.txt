this appeal involves a dispute between a lender,rand corporation,and two borrowers,yer song moua and manisy moua,over the right to rescind a loan secured by a mortgage on their home.the core issue is whether the mouas had a than in which to rescind the transaction.they contend the normal rescission period was extended to three years by rand failure to make material disclosures required by the truth in lending act tila,a,and the home ownership and equity protection act hoepa,b,failure to provide clear and conspicuous notice of tila right to cancel,and inclusion of a prepayment penalty expressly prohibited by hoepa.the district court granted summary judgment in rand favor.we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
yer song moua and manisy moua are husband and wife.for six years,they owned and lived in a house located at arlington avenue east,maplewood,minnesota.the mouas initially obtained a loan for the home from mortgage electronic registration system,mers,but fell behind on loan payments and mers commenced foreclosure.a sheriff foreclosure sale occurred on december,subject to a redemption period expiring june.
during the redemption period,the mouas met pat aylward,a realtor,who offered to help them out of foreclosure by obtaining a loan with lower payments.on january,the mouas met aylward at a rand office and applied for a loan with rand to refinance their existing loan and redeem from the sheriff foreclosure sale.
on april,the mouas closed on the loan and secured it with a mortgage on their primary residence.rand hired excel title to conduct the closing.the mouas executed a promissory note in the amount of,listing the interest as until may,at which time i will pay yearly.the amount of monthly payments was listed as until june,at which time my payment will increase to until july.
rand contends that on april,it provided the mouas with all required disclosures pursuant to tila and hoepa the mouas claim they did not get a advance hoepa disclosure from rand before the april,closing.before the district court,rand alleged the mouas chose to waive the advance disclosure period based upon a bona fide personal financial emergency.it contended that unsuccessful attempts were made earlier in april to close the loan but the ramsey county sheriff failed to timely provide redemption payoffs.according to rand,d ue to the pending redemption period set to expire in days,the need to redo all loan documents,update all payoffs with other creditors,and the risk of losing loan approval if the closing were rescheduled past april,the mouas decided on april,to proceed with closing on april.
at the closing,manisy claims the closer told her to copy a typed statement in her own handwriting.she contends she did not understand the statement and did not know why she was asked to copy it.the typed statement,which manisy copied in her own handwriting,read 
we are aware that we are entitled to a day review of the disclosures prior to closing of this transaction.because we are aware that the county has not been timely in returning the payoff statement on our mortgage and the current foreclosure proceedings we request that this day review period be waived.
we are further aware that we have a day recession sic after signing the closing docs to review all the final documents.we feel that this will allow us time to address any concerns or questions.
please accept our request to waive the day review period 
additionally,the mouas were given a notice of right to cancel notice at the closing,which advised them they had until midnight on april,to cancel the transaction.there are two versions of the notice on one version,the mouas signed and dated the section entitled receipt,acknowledging they received the notice.on the other version,the mouas signed and dated the receipt section as well as a section entitled confirmation which states more than business days have elapsed since the date of the new transaction and received this notice and disclosures with regard to the new transaction.certify that the new transaction has not been rescinded.the mouas contend they signed the receipt and confirmation sections simultaneously.their assertion is borne out by the fact all the signatures are dated april.rand does not dispute the confirmation section was signed before the rescission period expired.rather,it contends the mouas were directed to sign it by excel title,without authorization or direction from rand 
after the closing,the mouas returned home and reviewed the loan documents with their son.the mouas allege they learned then the new loan payments were much higher than their previous payments,they had waived their right to the advance hoepa disclosures,and had forfeited the opportunity to cancel by signing the confirmation portion of the notice.
on december,the mouas failed to make their monthly loan payment and have not since made any payments.on march,rand commenced foreclosure.on april,the mouas sent rand a letter stating we hereby cancel and rescind the mortgage we obtained from rand corporation dated april,in the original amount of.on may,rand counsel wrote to the mouas denying their rescission request on the basis the mouas had received notice of their rescission rights and chose not to exercise them before they expired on april.
on may,the mouas home was sold at a sheriff sale to rand for.on november,the redemption period expired without the mouas exercising their redemption rights,and on january,rand filed the instant lawsuit against the mouas.the mouas failed to appear at an eviction hearing on january,and the court determined rand was entitled to lawful possession of the property.a date was scheduled for february.on february,the mouas filed a motion for a temporary restraining order tro,which was granted by the district court pending resolution of this action.the was postponed and the mouas continued to live in the home and made no payments on the loan.see rand yer song moua,wl.may.
in addition to moving for a tro,the mouas brought a counterclaim against rand alleging it violated tila,hoepa,and the minnesota prevention of consumer fraud act cfa,subd.as relevant to this appeal,the mouas alleged rand violated tila and hoepa by failing to provide an early warning notice three days in advance of the loan closing,thereby triggering a statutory right to rescind the transaction within a period.the mouas further alleged the handwritten notice they signed at the closing was ineffective to waive this requirement or,at a minimum,disputed issues of fact exist about whether the statutory requirements for the waiver were present.the mouas also alleged the notice of right to cancel did not comply with tila requirements and also triggered an extended rescission period.finally,the mouas alleged rand inclusion of a prepayment penalty was expressly prohibited by hoepa.
the district court granted rand motion for summary judgment.with respect to the claimed failure to provide the advance notice,the district court determined there was no tila violation because rand ultimately made the disclosures.with respect to the claimed failure to provide a notice of right to cancel that complied with tila,the district court determined the mouas were provided clear and conspicuous notice of their right to cancel in accordance with tila.the district court order did not address the mouas claim that rand inclusion of a prepayment penalty was expressly prohibited by hoepa,and the mouas motion for reconsideration of the issue was denied 
the mouas now appeal,arguing the failure to provide the advance notice triggered a rescission right,and their purported waiver of the advance notice was insufficient.they further argue the notice of right to cancel did not comply with tila.finally,they argue rand inclusion of a prepayment penalty violated hoepa.
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.summary judgment is proper if there exists no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.when ruling on a summary judgment motion,a court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.sap
