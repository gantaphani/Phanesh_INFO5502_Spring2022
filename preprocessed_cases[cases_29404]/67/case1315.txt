deanthony thomas,susan,and steven rich collectively thomas brought claims in missouri state court against a number of banks and lending institutions collectively the lenders alleging violations of the missouri second mortgage loans act msmla,arising out of loans originated by firstplus bank a california lending institution which is now defunct and subsequently purchased by the lenders.the lenders removed the case to federal court arguing the state law claims were completely preempted by the depository institutions deregulation and monetary control act dida.agreeing with the lenders,the district court denied thomas motion to remand to state court and then dismissed the claims.thomas now appeals.we reverse with instructions to remand this case to state court.
thomas and the other appellants are missouri homeowners who obtained high second mortgages reflecting a total debt of of the appraised value on their homes from firstplus bank.firstplus bank was a federally insured,bank when the loans were made.firstplus bank became defunct,and the loans were purchased or assumed by other banks as assignees,including some national banks.
in june,thomas brought suit in missouri state court on behalf of himself and others similarly situated against assignee banks of firstplus alleging the loans they had received violated the msmla,which places limits on the type and amount of closing costs and fees a lender can charge on residential second mortgage loans secured by missouri real estate 
specifically,thomas alleged the subject loans violated missouri law because the borrowers were charged nonrefundable finder fees or broker fees which were not allowed by or in excess of the fees allowed by the msmla and firstplus charged certain closing costs and fees on behalf of third parties which were in excess of the costs actually charged by those third parties and then retained the difference.thomas sought to recover the interest paid on the allegedly unlawful second mortgage loans and an order barring the collection of additional interest.notably,none of the subject loans violated missouri law with respect to the maximum interest rate chargeable on a second mortgage loan,which exceeded the rate allowed by federal law pursuant to dida.
in august,the defendant banks removed the case to federal district court.the banks alleged removal was proper because firstplus,the originator of the loans,was a,bank and dida which applies to,banks completely preempted the state law claims brought under the msmla.the banks relied primarily upon the supreme court decision in beneficial national bank anderson,d,which held that the national bank act nba,completely preempted state law usury claims against national banks.id.at.the banks alleged the similarity in language between dida and the nba compelled the conclusion that dida,like the nba,created the exclusive federal remedy for usury claims against,banks.
thomas filed a motion to remand the case to state court.he argued the language of dida differed in material respects from the language in the nba,and dida only preempted state usury laws in limited circumstances,that is,when the state laws set a lower allowable interest rate than that allowed by federal law.because missouri law allowed a higher allowable interest rate than the rate set forth in dida,preemption was not triggered.the district court disagreed and denied the motion to remand,concluding dida provided the exclusive remedy for usury claims against,banks.thereafter the banks brought a motion to dismiss the case,which the district court granted.
thomas filed a timely appeal.on appeal,he renews his argument that dida differs in material respect from the language of the nba,and preemption does not apply in circumstances where state law allows a higher interest rate than the interest rate set forth in dida.the banks renew their claim as to the statutory language in dida being the same as the nba,and federal law completely preempts the state law claims brought here.the national bank defendants alternatively argue that the nba should apply whether they are the originator of a loan or purchase a loan as an assignee,and therefore completely preempts the claims brought against them even if dida does not.finally,some of the assignee banks argue the named plaintiffs lacked standing to sue them because none of the named plaintiffs as opposed to unnamed class member plaintiffs have loans that have been assigned to them.
the district court denial of the motion to remand the case to state court is reviewed de novo,menz new holland,cir,as is the district court dismissal of the case,harris v.the epoch group,cir.
the general rule is when a claim filed in state court alleges only state law claims,the existence of a federal defense,preemption,is not enough to support the removal of the case to federal court.rivet regions bank of,d.an exception to this rule is when the preemptive force of a federal statute completely displaces state law and it is clear congress meant the federal statute to be the exclusive cause of action for the type of claim asserted.beneficial bank,at.complete preemption,as opposed to ordinary or conflict preemption,is rare,however,and only applies if the federal statutes at issue provide the exclusive cause of action for the claim asserted and also set forth procedures and remedies governing that cause of action.id.
complete preemption does not exist here because the language of dida,unlike the nba,does not reflect congress intent to provide the exclusive cause of action for a usury claim against a bank.to the contrary,a close examination of the statutory language indicates congress very clearly intended the preemptive scope of dida to be limited to particular circumstances.
two provisions of dida are at subsection discussing the circumstances under which a bank may charge the interest rate allowed by federal law notwithstanding state law to the contrary,a the substantive provision,and the subsection setting forth a consumer remedy when a bank charges interest in excess of that allowed by dida,b the remedy provision.the substantive provision is set forth as follows 
in order to prevent discrimination against insured depository institutions,including insured savings banks,or insured branches of foreign banks with respect to interest rates,if the applicable rate prescribed in this subsection exceeds the rate such state bank or insured branch of a foreign bank would be permitted to charge in the absence of this subsection,such state bank or such insured branch of a foreign bank may,notwithstanding any state constitution or statute which is hereby preempted for the purposes of this section,take,receive,reserve,and charge on any loan or discount made,or upon any note,bill of exchange,or other evidence of debt,interest at a rate of not more than per centum in excess of the discount rate on commercial paper in effect at the federal reserve bank in the federal reserve district where such state bank or such insured branch of a foreign bank is located or at the rate allowed by the laws of the state,territory,or district where the bank is located,whichever may be greater.
the plain language of the statute clearly indicates the interest rate allowed by federal law only comes into play if the applicable rate prescribed in this subsection exceeds the rate such state bank or insured branch of a foreign bank would be permitted to charge in the absence of this subsection.id.emphasis added.in other words,when the interest rate allowed by state law exceeds the interest rate set forth in dida,the federal statute does not apply.the limited nature of the preemptive effect the federal statute has on state law is emphasized by the qualifying phrase added to the statute preemption language notwithstanding any state constitution or statute which is hereby preempted for the purposes of this section.id.emphasis added.in other words,conflicting state constitutions or statutes are not preempted for every and all purposes,but only for purposes of this section.
the remedy provision is set forth as follows 
if the rate prescribed in subsection a of this section exceeds the rate such state bank or such i
