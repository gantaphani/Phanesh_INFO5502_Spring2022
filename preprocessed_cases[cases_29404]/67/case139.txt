in this case a wireless carrier was denied a variance and special use permit by the cranston zoning board of review to build a wireless communications tower in cranston,rhode island.the carrier had so applied in order to remedy a significant gap it found in coverage.
when the carrier sought federal court review of the denial,the city and zoning board countered that the zoning board decision was not a final action because limited state court review was available.the district court rejected the argument.omnipoint holdings,city of cranston,wl,at july,order denying motion to dismiss city of cranston i.after a bench trial,the court granted judgment for the plaintiff.omnipoint holdings,city of cranston,slip op.at,city of cranston ii.it held that the town denial of the permits constituted an effective prohibition of service in violation of c b i ii of the telecommunications act of tca,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of.id.at.

we recite the facts in the trial record in the light most favorable to the verdict.marcano rivera turabo medical center,cir.
usa,has a federal communications commission fcc license to operate a digital personal communications service pcs wireless network at megahertz in rhode island under which omnipoint,wholly owned subsidiary,operates.omnipoint provides wireless service to customers through a network of antennae mounted on towers or other structures,often called wireless facilities,that broadcast signals between towers and to customers wireless phones and devices.when omnipoint realizes that an area within its network lacks sufficient coverage for customers to make and maintain calls reliably,it tries to remedy the coverage gap by building a new facility.
the key to coverage is having a signal level for customers to maintain contact with the network so they can make and maintain calls.signal level,the strength of the radio signal customers devices receive,is measured in negative decibels per milliwatt dbm the nature of omnipoint digital pcs network makes keeping signal levels strong more difficult than if it had provided cellular service.pcs towers broadcast lower signals at a much higher frequency,so those signals cover a smaller area,usually about miles.consequently,pcs providers must build a network of towers relatively near each other,creating an overlapping grid of signals from the towers resembling a honeycomb.for example,omnipoint has at least sixteen towers within four miles of the proposed tower at issue in this case.
because its customers value reliable network coverage,omnipoint has established a national goal of percent reliability for the network,meaning that customers should be able to make and maintain percent of their calls.to meet this goal,omnipoint has established dbm as its minimum signal strength for coverage nationwide.federal law does not require any specific signal level omnipoint has set high standards to satisfy its customers.
omnipoint first determined that signal levels around phenix avenue in cranston fell below dbm through a propagation study,a computer program that predicts signal levels.phenix avenue is heavily traveled because it is a main road connecting cranston to the nearby towns of warwick and coventry.a consulting engineer for omnipoint,elijah luutu,determined that omnipoint likely needed a new facility in the area to service this traffic.later he conducted a drive test,during which he drove a wireless device around the area and mapped the signals it was receiving,which confirmed this conclusion.based on the propagation study,luutu designed a search ring for omnipoint staff to find potential locations for the new facility around november.factoring in topography and the height of the area tree canopy,luutu calculated that omnipoint needed to build or find a pole for the new facility.
omnipoint employees examined the search ring for suitable sites.they looked,in order of preference,for existing towers belonging to other wireless companies,existing structures to mount a facility on,and raw land to construct a facility on.they also considered the ease of building a new facility,the radio frequency needs of the area,and zoning issues when evaluating candidates.an employee searched the area and fcc databases and did not find suitable existing towers,so that option was excluded.he identified four potential sites the cranston fire department museum,two different sites at the cranston country club,and the solid rock church.no other structures in the search ring were tall enough to meet omnipoint radio frequency requirements.luutu rejected the museum site because it would provide largely redundant coverage with another tower without covering most of the gap.
with the exclusion of the museum site,omnipoint came down to three options an extant utility pole or raw land to put up a pole on the country club property,or land on the property of the solid rock church in cranston.omnipoint first negotiated with the country club.omnipoint needed an easement to install power lines to the proposed facility on the country club utility pole,so it offered the country club first its standard rate of and then its enhanced lease rate of per month.the club rejected both offers on the ground that installing power lines could damage its golf course fairways.omnipoint then offered the country club both the and lease rates to build a facility on the club raw land.when the club three owners could not agree whether to pay the lease proceeds to themselves or to the club,omnipoint offered a payment of in addition to the monthly rate to whichever owner would agree to the other side position.the owners refused to compromise,however,and omnipoint abandoned negotiations with the country club 
omnipoint then turned to the property of the solid rock church and offered per month to lease the raw land to construct a tower disguised as a flagpole.the church accepted.it is this site which is the subject of this controversy.the pole was not in conformance with cranston zoning ordinances because,given its height,it was too close to the property southern border.omnipoint and solid rock church jointly applied for a variance and special use permit on september,almost two years after omnipoint began searching for a site.
on november,the city of cranston planning commission,which may offer nonbinding recommendations to the zoning board,held a public hearing and issued a written recommendation that the board deny omnipoint application because omnipoint did not demonstrate that existing nearby facilities c ould not accommodate the service need.the cranston zoning board of review then conducted two public hearings on april,and september.the board issued a written decision on november,denying omnipoint application without then giving a statement of the reasons for its decision.
omnipoint sued the city,the zoning board,and all five members of the zoning board collectively cranston in federal district court on december,under the tca.it claimed that cranston had violated the tca because it had effectively prohibited the provision of personal wireless services by refusing to grant omnipoint application omnipoint sought an injunction requiring the board to grant omnipoint request for a variance and special use permit and an injunction and order of mandamus ordering the city of cranston to issue a building permit for constructing the tower.
cranston moved to dismiss omnipoint complaint,arguing that the district court lacked what it referred to as subject matter jurisdiction.because rhode island law permits parties to petition the state superior court for limited review of a zoning board decision,cranston contended,the zoning board decision was not a final action creating federal jurisdiction under c b v.the district court rejected the argument and held the board decision was a final action and that the tca permitted omnipoint to bypass rhode island state court review.city of cranston i,wl,at.
the district court held a bench trial on june and july,and heard five witnesses.gerald marquis,a real estate manager for omnipoint,testified that omnipoint held an fcc license to operate at megahertz and explained that omnipoint sets a percent nationwide reliability standard to satisfy customers.marquis also testified to omnipoint process for identifying and remedying gaps in coverage.two omnipoint employees described their efforts to find a location for the new facility around phenix avenue.
elijah luutu,who has designed wireless networks as a radio frequency engineer for twelve years,testified as an expert witness for omnipoint.luutu detailed how omnipoint calculated dbm as its minimum signal level in vehicles.it began with a receiver is,the minimum decibel levels that mobile devices and base stations need for people to understand someone on the other dbm based on industry standards.omnipoint added attenuation from obstructions that could block a signal,such as bodies,trees,and buildings,which produced the dbm figure.according to luutu,the dbm standard ensured omnipoint met its goal of percent reliability.
luutu also explained how he created a search ring and evaluated candidates for a facility around phenix avenue based on omnipoint specifications.he acknowledged he could have studied building multiple,smaller sites to cover the gap,but luutu only considered building a single tower because omnipoint instructed him to.although no proposed site would fully remedy the coverage gap around phenix avenue,luutu,accepting that the country club was unavailable,concluded a tower on the property of the solid rock church was omnipoint best alternative.
cranston presented only one witness,david maxson,whom it presented as a purported expert.maxson had never built a wireless network and most of his training and experience was in radio broadcasting.he had,however,worked for a wireless company and had advised municipalities on regulating wireless facilities.maxson testimony went to two points he contended there was no gap and,if there were,omnipoint had alternative solutions.these conclusions were generally consistent with an earlier affidavit he had filed.but he admitted that when he assembled that affidavit,he had never visited the area around solid rock church,had performed no tests there,and had made no computer studies to support his opinions in the affidavit.
maxson attacked how omnipoint established its standard for reliable network coverage.he contended that mobile devices receive reliable signals below dbm,but omnipoint used that overly conservative figure primarily because its calculations were based on an outdated figure for receiver sensitivity and because it signal loss from a user body.maxson opined that omnipoint could achieve reliable coverage using a lower signal standard.but he relied only on tests he had performed on omnipoint networks in other areas.and maxson never proposed an alternative figure for reliable coverage.
maxson next said there were several alternatives to building a tower on church property,including placing antennae on other utility poles around phenix avenue or another carrier tower located in a west warwick neighborhood omnipoint employees had never heard of.he primarily opined that omnipont should have considered building more than one facility to cover the phenix avenue gap.maxson proposed three multisite solutions building one smaller tower and a series of smaller facilities,called microcells,to supplement coverage building a series of microcells and building a distributed antenna system das,in which fiberoptic cables connect a series of antennae mounted on utility poles.
maxson gave vague details on the feasibility of these proposals,however.he did not reconcile his proposals with technology omnipoint currently uses.on cross examination he acknowledged the das mode is not requires no das systems existed in the phenix avenue area.he also did not explain how the microcell solutions would work with omnipoint current grid of towers or with the lower pcs signal.and maxson conceded that he did not investigate whether other sites he suggested were available to omnipoint or could even support the infrastructure he was envisioning.he identified only general locations to build facilities,such as near the golf course,on any of a number of those transmission line poles,and on the other side of the ridge from solid rock church.and maxson performed no testing to show whether these alternative designs actually would cover the gap around phenix avenue.
on october,the district court entered judgment for omnipoint.city of cranston ii,slip op.at.the court explained that omnipoint had met its burden to show that cranston zoning decision prevented omnipoint from closing a significant gap in coverage and that further reasonable efforts to find an alternative solution would be fruitless.id.at.the court rejected maxson testimony taking into account maxon sic dearth of experience in designing wireless networks and his failure to conduct any testing before rendering his opinions,it found that maxson conclusions were completely unreliable and unpersuasive.id.at.the court then made two findings of fact 
there is a significant gap in plaintiff coverage area along phenix avenue in cranston as mapped and tested by luutu.
the only feasible site available to plaintiff is the site at the solid rock church where the construction of a foot monopole will provide coverage in the gap area.
id.cranston timely appealed to this court,and we affirm.
a.the zoning board decision was a final action under the tca 
cranston makes a novel argument that the zoning board decision is not a final action by a state or local government under c b v of the tca we review the district court decision de novo because it is an issue of law,daggett comm on governmental ethics and election practices,cir,and we affirm.
section c of the tca,entitled preservation of local zoning authority,allows state and local governments to apply their zoning regulations to the construction of wireless facilities,subject to five substantive and procedural limitations.c see also tower,llc plainville zoning bd.of appeals,cir listing these limitations.it creates a federal cause of action any person adversely affected by any final action or failure to act by a state or local government or any instrumentality thereof that is inconsistent with those five limitations may sue in state or federal court within thirty days to enforce the tca provisions.c b v.
cranston implicitly concedes that zoning board decisions often would be final actions under the tca.but it argues that a rhode island law permitting state court review of zoning board decisions creates an exception to that rule precisely because the statute limits the scope of court review and does not provide full court review of zoning board decisions cranston argues that such limited review makes state court proceedings part of a comprehensive statutory scheme for state zoning decisions that is not final until after state court review finishes.omnipoint rejoins that it did not need to sue in state court because the zoning board decision was a final action by an instrumentality of a local government.
the tca does not define final action.the parties do not dispute the cranston zoning board of review is a state or local government or any instrumentality thereof.see black law dictionary ed defining local government as t he government of a particular locality,such as a city id.at defining instrumentality as a means or agency through which a function of another entity is accomplished,such as a governing body.
when interpreting terms within the tca,we consider its plain text and design,structure,and purpose.cablevision of boston,pub.improvement comm n,cir quoting shalala,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the cranston zoning board of review decision falls within the usual meaning of final action set forth in the language of c b v.the terms final and final action have special meaning in the law,and we assume congress knew the content of background law when legislating.in re rivera torres,cir.generally a decision is final if it is concluded that is,if it does not requir e any further judicial action by the court that rendered the judgment to determine the matter litigated and the decision can be appealed.black law dictionary ed.
the rule in administrative law is that a final agency action is one that mark s the consummation of the agency decisionmaking process.whitman am.trucking ass ns,d emphasis added quoting bennett spear,d internal quotation marks omitted.it means a final determination in a case by an administrative agency that is,whether the agency rendered its last word on the matter.harrison ppg,d interpreting what is a final action by the environmental protection agency under the clean air act accord whitman,at.same.only after an agency final action may courts review the agency decision.ass of home builders defenders of wildlife,d.
a final action by a local government or any instrumentality thereof must be one that marks the consummation of the instrumentality decisionmaking process.in this case there is no dispute that the zoning board is a discrete instrumentality of cranston,separate and distinct from the rhode island superior court.the parties agree cranston zoning board had concluded its decisionmaking process before that instrumentality and could take no further action.the zoning board decision was final.
sprint spectrum city of carmel,cir,on which cranston relies,undercuts cranston argument and supports our analysis.the court held a carrier claim was not ripe because the carrier sued in federal court when it still had further recourse before the local zoning board.id.at accord nextel commc ns of,city of margate,cir.indeed the sprint spectrum court observed that the carrier would not need to exhaust all state judicial remedies before bringing suit in federal court.id.at.
cranston reading would frustrate the tca overall statutory scheme and purpose.the act stresses the need for speedily deploying telecommunications and seeks to get prompt resolution of disputes under the act.congress enacted the tca to promote competition and reduce regulation in order to secure lower prices and higher quality services for american telecommunications consumers and encourage the rapid deployment of new telecommunications technologies.stat.at emphasis added.under c b v,parties may sue within thirty days of a final action,and courts must hear and decide such action s on an expedited basis.to hold omnipoint nevertheless needed to sue in state court would undermine the tca goals by imposing a new regulatory obstacle to providing consumers with wireless service.
to the extent c b v,read in light of its language,context,and purpose,could be thought to be ambiguous,the legislative history confirms that a zoning board decision is a final action and omnipoint did not need to seek judicial review under state law of that board decision.the house conference report defined a final action as a final administrative action at the state or local government level so that a party can commence action rather than waiting for the exhaustion of any independent state court remedy otherwise required.telecommunications act of,at,as reprinted in.
b.the district court did not err by granting judgment to omnipoint after trial

existence of a significant gap in coverage 
through the analysis courts determine whether a coverage problem exists at all.second generation,at.in this circuit we consider whether a significant gap in coverage exists within the individual carrier network.metheny becker,cir second generation,at.we have rejected the third circuit rule that considers not the individual carrier network but whether any carrier provides service to an area.nextel unity,cir.in our view,the third circuit rule prevents customers in an area from having a choice of reliable carriers and thus undermines the tca goal to improve wireless service for customers through industry competition.second generation,at.the ninth circuit has adopted our approach.metropcs,at.
when relevant,courts assessing whether a coverage gap is significant should consider,inter alia,the physical size of the gap,the area in which there is a gap,the number of users the gap affects,and whether all of the carrier users in that area are similarly affected by the gaps.see,second generation,at see also metropcs,at degrees commc ns,at cellular.zoning bd.of adjustment of the borough of,cir willoth,at.also relevant could be data about percentages of unsuccessful calls or inadequate service during calls in the gap area.here,omnipoint had shown its need for coverage around phenix avenue is significant.it established phenix avenue was a heavily traveled and important route that connects cranston to its neighbors.
cranston argues that the district court measured the quality of coverage around phenix avenue with an because the court accepted omnipoint dbm standard for reliable service,which omnipoint had set to satisfy customers.cranston asks us to rule that a trial judge errs in considering the provider defined level of acceptable service on the question of the existence of a significant gap.we reject such rules.see metropcs,at.in this case,the district court finding that there was a significant gap in coverage was quite reasonable,and not clear error,on the evidence.
the court did not err by accepting the testimony of omnipoint expert,elijah luutu,about a coverage gap around phenix avenue in cranston,which we described earlier.at trial and on
