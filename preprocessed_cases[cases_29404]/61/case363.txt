in this civil rights case,defendant jennifer pastor pastor,a police officer in the city of miami,appeals from the district court denial of her motion for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.plaintiff albert durruthy durruthy,a freelance cameraman,claims,inter alia,that pastor violated his rights under the fourth amendment when she arrested him for being in the busy intersection of flagler street and avenue in miami as the police were trying to keep the streets clear on a chaotic day after the federal government removed young elian gonzalez from his family in miami in order to return him to his father,who lived in cuba.after thorough review of this record,including a series of videotaped recordings of the incident at issue,we conclude that pastor is entitled to qualified immunity on durruthy wrongful arrest and excessive force claims.accordingly,we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
we review de novo a district court disposition of a summary judgment motion based on qualified immunity,applying the same legal standards as the district court.see lee ferraro,cir.a motion for summary judgment should be granted when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.we resolve all issues of material fact in favor of the plaintiff,and then determine the legal question of whether the defendant is entitled to qualified immunity under that version of the facts.see ferraro,at.
the relevant facts are straightforward.on april,united states government officials removed a young boy,elian gonzalez,from his uncle house to facilitate the boy return to his father in cuba.the reaction in some parts of miami was immediate and violent.protestors took to the streets and,as the plaintiff said,t hat was the day of the riots in miami.durruthy dep.at.some people threw trash bins into the streets and set them on fire.others threw bottles,rocks,and broken glass.at the major intersection of avenue and flagler street one of the intersection roads has six lanes,the other four,the scene was chaotic during some of the morning.police were trying to clear the intersection of people and cars.protesters were arrested at that location.many cameramen were on hand,including durruthy.
by durruthy account,he knew that miami police officers were trying to clear the street.he observed that throughout the day he was shooting officers arresting protesters,clearing the street,and i was shoulder to shoulder with these officers.and officers would grab me and say please,once you get your shot,please go back from the street,from tear gas,from launching tear gas,from arresting protesters.durruthy dep.at.
by the intersection of flagler street and avenue was shut off to vehicular traffic,and police officers had cleared the demonstrators from the street.at that time,the police arrested a cameraman,bruce bernstein bernstein,and escorted him through the middle of the cleared street.durruthy,a freelance cameraman who was on assignment to film the protests,ran into the street to film bernstein arrest up close.
the scene that followed was captured on a series of videotapes filmed by different people including durruthy and from different locations.while durruthy was filming bernstein arrest in the street,an officer instructed durruthy to get out of the street.durruthy backpedaled toward the sidewalk,while continuing to film bernstein arrest.as durruthy approached the sidewalk,officer pastor grabbed him from behind.pastor and another officer then pulled durruthy onto the ground,while struggling to pin his arms behind him and handcuff him.during the struggle,the other officer also kneed durruthy in the back.durruthy stated,sir,my arm please sir i am going peacefully,sir.pastor held durruthy down with her hands,while the other officer tied durruthy arms behind his back with flex cuffs.officer pastor testified that whenever anyone is being arrested,she assumes that the person is armed with a weapon.she also said that she had never seen the plaintiff before the day of his arrest.
in a sworn declaration,durruthy said that during the morning of april other police officers let him enter the street,film his shot,and return to the sidewalk on several occasions.he further stated that he had followed this procedure countless times during the previous four months without incident and with the permission of police.in his deposition,durruthy testified that throughout that morning he had filmed officers arresting protestors and clearing the streets,and the officers had requested that he move out of the street once he got his shot.durruthy did not detail any of the specific circumstances surrounding these earlier incidents,nor did he identify any officer by name.notably,however,durruthy does not contend that pastor allowed him to enter the streets at any time that day or in the past.
durruthy was charged with resisting,obstructing,or opposing an officer in violation of.stat.but the charges ultimately were dropped.subsequently,durruthy filed a complaint against the city of miami and pastor,alleging claims under for unlawful arrest and excessive force,in violation of the fourth amendment,as well as various state law claims.pastor moved for summary judgment on the ground that she was entitled to qualified immunity.pastor argued that not only did she have probable cause to arrest durruthy for violating,but she also had probable cause to arrest him for violating.stat.stat.and of the miami city code 
the district court denied pastor motion for summary judgment.first,the court found that there was no probable cause,or even arguable probable cause,to arrest durruthy.see durruthy city of miami,d.the court rejected pastor proffered bases for probable cause,determining that.stat.stat,and of the miami city code were not applicable because durruthy complied with the officer orders to get out of the street,even if he backpedaled and continued to film when ordered off the street,and that.stat.was inapplicable because it is directed at preventing pedestrians from walking among vehicular traffic.the court also found that although there was no specific florida supreme court,eleventh circuit,or united states supreme court caselaw on point,pastor conduct was obviously illegal,based on the complete lack of any reasonable basis for the arrest.id.at.
the district court also held that pastor used excessive force against durruthy.the court reasoned that because durruthy was obviously a member of the media,was not protesting,and complied with the officer requests and instructions,any use of force was unnecessary in light of the circumstances,the force applied was illegally disproportionate.id.at.the district court also determined that it was clearly established that pastor conduct constituted excessive force.it acknowledged that there was no controlling and factually similar caselaw,but found that her conduct fell within the category of cases in which the unlawfulness of the conduct is readily apparent even without identifying caselaw.id.at quoting smith mattox,cir.this appeal ensued.
as we observed in lee ferraro 
qualified immunity offers complete protection for government officials sued in their individual capacities as long as their conduct violates no clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.thomas roberts,cir quoting harlow fitzgerald,d additional quotations omitted.the purpose of this immunity is to allow government officials to carry out their discretionary duties without the fear of personal liability or harassing litigation,see anderson creighton,d,protecting from suit all but the plainly incompetent or one who is knowingly violating the federal law.willingham loughnan,cir.because qualified immunity is a defense not only from liability,but also from suit,it is important for a court to ascertain the validity of a qualified immunity defense as early in the lawsuit as possible.gjr,county of escambia,cir citation omitted.
at.whether a defendant is entitled to qualified immunity is a question of law,in other words,whether the law at the time of the incident was clearly established so that a reasonable person should have known that he was violating it.see courson mcmillian,cir.
to receive qualified immunity,the public official must show that he was acting within the scope of his discretionary authority at the time the allegedly wrongful acts occurred.see ferraro,at.on this record,it is undisputed that officer pastor was acting within her discretionary authority.once it is established that the defendant was acting within her discretionary authority,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that qualified immunity is not appropriate.id.in evaluating claims of qualified immunity,we apply the saucier test as a threshold question,a court must ask,t aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,do the facts alleged show the officer conduct violated a constitutional right and if a constitutional right would have been violated under the plaintiff version of the facts,the court must then determine whether the right was clearly established.id.quoting saucier katz,d.this inquiry,in turn,must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the case,not as a broad general proposition.id.quoting saucier,at.at.in saucier,the supreme court noted that i f no constitutional right would have been violated were the allegations established,there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning qualified immunity.at.at.however,if a constitutional right would have been violated under the plaintiff version of the facts,the court must then determine whether the right was clearly established.see id.
durruthy argues that pastor violated his clearly established constitutional rights under the fourth amendment by arresting him without probable cause and by subjecting him to excessive force.we conduct the saucier analysis separately for each of pastor claims.see ferraro,at.
first,durruthy says that his arrest was unlawful.plainly,an arrest without probable cause violates the right to be free from an unreasonable search under the fourth amendment.see redd city of enterprise,cir a n arrest made without probable cause violates the fourth amendment.under federal law,probable cause to arrest exists when an arrest is objectively reasonable based on the totality of the circumstances.mccormick city of fort lauderdale,cir quoting ferraro,at.this standard is met when the facts and circumstances within the officer knowledge,of which he or she has reasonably trustworthy information,would cause a prudent person to believe,under the circumstances shown,that the suspect has committed,is committing,or is about to commit an offense.id.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.although probable cause requires more than suspicion,it does not require convincing proof,and need not reach the same standard of conclusiveness and probability as the facts necessary to support a conviction.ferraro,at internal citations omitted 
moreover,probable cause determinations are generally ex parte determinations,see,united states,d the same rules that,in an adversary hearing on the merits,may increase the likelihood of accurate determinations of guilt or innocence do not necessarily advance the mission of a grand jury,whose task is to conduct an ex parte investigation to determine whether or not there is probable cause to prosecute a particular defendant,which are made on the basis of the evidence extant.see united states gonzalez,cir t he court must decide whether the objective facts available to the officers at the time of arrest were sufficient.thus,in pickens hollowell,for example,we held that two deputies who otherwise had probable cause to arrest the plaintiff pursuant to facially valid arrest warrants did not have a duty to investigate and decide the potential viability of a defense before arresting the plaintiff,cir.
we add that officers who make an arrest without probable cause are still entitled to qualified immunity if there was arguable probable cause for the arrest.jones cannon,cir citing lindsey storey,cir.arguable probable cause exists when an officer reasonably could have believed that probable cause existed,in light of the information the officer possessed.montoute carr,cir see also jones,at.as we framed the concept in lee ferraro 
arguable probable cause exists where reasonable officers in the same circumstances and possessing the same knowledge as the defendant could have believed that probable cause existed to arrest.id.quoting redd,at internal citations omitted.in determining whether arguable probable cause exists,w e apply an objective standard,asking whether the officer actions are objectively reasonable regardless of the officer underlying intent or motivation.vaughan cox,cir quoting montoute,at.arguable probable cause does not require an arresting officer to prove every element of a crime or to obtain a confession before making an arrest,which would negate the concept of probable cause and transform arresting officers into prosecutors.scarbrough myles,cir.
after thorough review of the entire record,we are satisfied that pastor had probable cause to arrest durruthy for violating.stat.and that,in any event,she had arguable probable cause to effect the plaintiff arrest.again,provides,in pertinent part,that w here sidewalks are provided,no pedestrian shall,unless required by other circumstances,walk along and upon the portion of a roadway paved for vehicular traffic.stat.notably,no command or direction by the police to leave the streets is required to establish a violation of this statute under florida law,a law enforcement officer may arrest a person without a warrant if a violation of chapter has been committed in the presence of the officer.stat.it is undisputed that durruthy was walking in the middle of a street paved for vehicular traffic the busy intersection of flagler street and avenue,where sidewalks were provided,and he was not required to do so by other circumstances.moreover,plainly he was in the middle of the busy street at a chaotic time when the police were attempting to clear the streets,and by his own account,specifically knew that the officers were trying to clear that very intersection.
the district court nevertheless held that no probable cause existed under,reasoning 
the statute is directed at preventing pedestrians from walking among vehicular traffic.in this case,however,there was no vehicular traffic in the roadway.further,durruthy was not a pedestrian in the normal sense of the word but an obvious member of the media acting within the scope of his journalistic duties.under these circumstances,an arrest pursuant to could not be reasonable.
durruthy,d at.we disagree.first,the statute does not require that there be vehicular traffic in the roadway at the time of the offense.see.stat.see also.stat.defining roadway as t hat portion of a highway improved,designed,or ordinarily used for vehicular travel,exclusive of the berm or shoulder emphasis added.nor was it a surprise to anyone at that intersection on the morning of april,that the police had cleared protesters from the street.second,the definition of pedestrian as a ny person afoot.stat,contains no exception for anyone,including members of the media.indeed,at oral argument,plaintiff conceded that durruthy was entitled to no special deference or exception simply because he was a cameraman.
simply put,our case law makes clear that probable cause exists whenever an officer reasonably believes that an offense is being committed.it is therefore difficult to understand the claim that no probable cause,let alone arguable probable cause,existed to arrest durruthy when the undisputed facts show him to have been in unmistakable violation of.stat.the wording of that provision says nothing about giving exemptions to people who violate the command of the statute when its intended purpose is otherwise satisfied.a driver who runs a red light when no other cars or pedestrians are around is not exempt from a traffic law requiring him to stop,even though the obvious purpose of the be moot at the time.section unambiguously says that w here sidewalks are provided,no pedestrian shall,unless required by other circumstances,walk along and upon the portion of a roadway paved for vehicular traffic.no one has denied that durruthy did just that.nor is there any suggestion in the record that circumstances somehow required or compelled him to walk in the intersection.
the heart of durruthy argument is that there was no probable cause for his arrest because he had permission to be in the street.the first problem with this contention is that there is no evidence durruthy had express permission to be in the street at the time and location of the arrest.his evidence of permission is vague,general,and stated at the highest order of abstraction.the most that can be said is that other unnamed officers allowed him to be in unspecified streets,at unspecified locations,and under unexplained circumstances,earlier that morning,and that in the preceding four months he had gotten the implied and express permission of still other unnamed officers to shoot pictures in the street at unspecified locations and under unexplained circumstances.
in the second place,there is no evidence that pastor knew other officers previously had allowed durruthy to be in the street under unspecified circumstances,and,significantly,probable cause is determined based on the facts and circumstances within the officer knowledge.mccormick,at see also dahl holley,cir holding that the probable cause standard is met if,at the moment the arrest was made,the facts and circumstances within the officers knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the suspect had committed or was committing an offense.emphasis added quoting hunter bryant,d see also wilson kittoe,cir same thacker city of columbus,cir same johnson campbell,cir same jocks tavernier,cir same united states fiasconaro,cir same united states wesley,same united states henderson,cir same mcfarland childers,cir same spiegel cortese,cir same sanders sears,roebuck,cir same martin thomas,cir same.
finally,even if we could somehow impute such knowledge to pastor,we can discern no grounds for saying that she could not enforce.stat.simply because other officers in unspecified circumstances had not enforced it.the aforementioned driver who runs a red light does not get a free pass just because he ran another red light earlier in the day and was not stopped for that violation.notably,mere selective enforcement of a law is not unconstitutional,and durruthy has not even alleged selective prosecution based on improper grounds.see united states lichenstein,cir though selective prosecution,if based on improper motives,can violate constitutional guarantees of equal protection,selective enforcement in and of itself is not a constitutional violation.therefore,to support a defense of selective prosecution,one must establish that others similarly situated have not generally been prosecuted and that the government discriminatory selection of him is invidious,or in bad faith that is based on constitutionally impermissible considerations,such as race or religion.citing oyler boles,d,and united states johnson,cir 
durruthy also points to an internal city of miami police department order saying that n o warrantless arrest of media personnel for acts arising out of the pursuit of the news gathering function will be made without the express authority of the senior commanding officer or the staff duty officer,exhibit g.we are unable to understand how pastor failure to comply with this internal police department guideline vitiates probable cause.by its own terms,the guideline does alter the elements of,provide an affirmative defense,create any enforceable rights in a defendant,or otherwise undermine probable cause.united states beard,cir holding that the department of justice dual prosecution policy is an internal policy of which confers no enforceable rights on a criminal defendant.nor does it address precisely how an officer should react to the circumstances of directly seeing a violation of on a busy street at a chaotic time.
we add that for qualified immunity purposes we are concerned only with the constitutional requirements of probable cause.see craig singletary,cir holding that,for purposes of determining whether probable cause exists,we are only concerned with constitutional requirements not with any local policies or with any strategic decisions of law enforcement officers.the fact that pastor may have violated an internal guideline may subject her to internal sanction,but it does not undermine objective plaintiff was walking in the middle of a busy intersection at a chaotic time with specific knowledge that the police were trying to clear that street,and he was not required to be in the otherwise establish probable cause,let alone arguable probable cause.simply put,the internal guideline does not convert an illegal act suddenly into a legal one.
moreover,even though we believe pastor had probable cause to arrest durruthy for violating.stat,she would also be entitled to qualified immunity if there was even arguable probable cause for the arrest.jones,at emphasis added.here,pastor was faced with making a close call on a difficult day,under chaotic circumstances.she had no knowledge that durruthy previously had been allowed,by unknown officers and under unspecified conditions,to shoot pictures in the street.a reasonable officer could have believed,in light of the information pastor possessed,that she had probable cause.see montoute,at holding that arguable probable cause exists when an officer reasonably could have believed that probable cause existed,in light of the information the officer possessed.
we add that even if durruthy had actually alleged the violation of a constitutional right,such a violation was not clearly established.a party may show that the law was clearly established,first by pointing to a materially similar case that has already decided that what the police officer was doing was unlawful.lee ferraro,at citation omitted.a party may also demonstrate the existence of clearly established law when the words of the pertinent federal statute or federal constitutional provision are specific enough to establish clearly the law applicable to particular conduct and circumstances and to overcome qualified immunity,even in the total absence of case law.this kind of case is one kind of obvious clarity case.vinyard wilson,cir footnote omitted emphasis in original.thus,the words of a federal statute or federal constitutional provision may be so clear and the conduct so bad that case law is not needed to establish that the conduct can not be lawful.id.emphasis added.
no caselaw gave pastor fair warning that she would be charged with the knowledge that other officers previously allowed durruthy to film in the street,or that she somehow lacked probable cause to arrest durruthy for violating because of that permission.see williams consol.city of jacksonville,cir noting that in determining whether the unlawfulness of an official actions was clearly established,the salient question is whether the state of the law at the time of the unconstitutional act gave the official fair warning that her alleged treatment of the plaintiff was unconstitutional quoting hope pelzer,d.nor was pastor on notice that an internal departmental guideline requiring her to obtain a superior officer approval before making a misdemeanor arrest rendered an arrest otherwise based on probable cause unconstitutional or somehow vitiated that probable cause.no case to which we have been cited,or that we can find,even remotely suggests that the possible violation of an internal law enforcement guideline strips an officer of qualified immunity for an arrest founded on sufficient cause.in this context,we are reminded of the supreme court admonition in county of sacramento lewis 
like prison officials facing a riot,the police on an occasion calling for fast action have obligations that tend to tug against each other.their duty is to restore and maintain lawful order,while not exacerbating disorder more than necessary to do their jobs.they are supposed to act decisively and to show restraint at the same moment,and their decisions have to be made in haste,under pressure,and frequently without the luxury of a second chance.
d citation omitted.moreover,nothing found in the language of or in the command of the fourth amendment states with obvious clarity that pastor conduct in arresting durruthy was unlawful.see vinyard wilson,at 
durruthy also claims that pastor used excessive force when she arrested him.the fourth amendment freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures encompasses the plain right to be free from the use of excessive force in the course of an arrest.ferraro,at citation omitted.the question is whether the officer conduct is objectively reasonable in light of the facts confronting the officer.vinyard wilson,at.we begin by observing that w hen an officer lawfully arrests an individual for the commission of a crime,no matter how minor the offense,the officer is entitled under controlling supreme court precedent to effectuate a full custodial arrest.ferraro,at.indeed,under florida law,like under federal law,a full custodial arrest is allowed even when the offense is only a misdemeanor.see.stat.a law enforcement officer may arrest a person without a warrant when t he person has committed a felony or misdemeanor in the presence of an officer.in this inquiry,we consider such factors as the severity of the crime at issue,whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others,and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.ferraro,at quoting graham connor,d.
the district court determined that the force applied by pastor was illegally disproportionate because no force was acceptable under these circumstances.see durruthy,d at.we disagree.this circuit has made clear that some use of force by a police officer when making a custodial arrest is necessary and altogether lawful,regardless of the severity of the alleged offense.see ferraro,at fourth amendment jurisprudence has long recognized that the right to make an arrest or investigatory stop necessarily carries with it the right to use some degree of physical coercion or threat thereof to effect it.quoting graham,at.at.quite simply,the police were allowed to use some force in effecting the plaintiff arrest.furthermore,the application of de minimis force,without more,will not support a claim for excessive force in violation of the fourth amendment.see nolin isbell,cir.here,even if the force applied by pastor in effecting the durruthy down to the ground and placing him in unnecessary,plainly it was not unlawful.the amount of force used was de minimus.in fact,the quantum of force used here was far less than our court has sustained in other contexts.see id.at finding force to be de minimus where an officer grabbed the plaintiff from behind by the shoulder and wrist,threw him against a van three or four feet away,kneed him in the back and pushed his head into the side of the van,searched his groin area in an uncomfortable manner,and handcuffed him see also jones city of dothan,cir finding the force used to be minor where officers slammed the plaintiff against a wall,kicked his legs apart,required him to put his arms above his head,and pulled his wallet from his pants pocket.
notably,durruthy had not been restrained at the time the force was applied,distinguishing the instant case from two cases on which the district court relied.see ferraro,at,finding excessive force where the plaintiff was already handcuffed when an officer slammed her head on the car priester city of riviera beach,cir concluding that the force was excessive where a police officer released an attack dog on the plaintiff while the plaintiff was lying on the ground and the police officer gun was pointed at the plaintiff head.the pivotal question in this case is really whether the arrest was lawfully founded on probable cause or at least arguable probable cause.we are satisfied on this point.moreover,on the facts presented here,we also find that the physical restraint and handcuffing of the plaintiff was likewise lawful the force used to effect the plaintiff arrest was de minimus,not excessive under the fourth amendment.because we find no constitutional violation,we need not address whether the constitutional right at issue was clearly established.
accordingly,we reverse the district court denial of the defense of qualified immunity and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
reversed and remanded.
the defense of qualified immunity attempts to strike a balance between the need for a remedy to protect the rights of citizens from government excess and the need for government officials to be able to carry out their discretionary functions without fear of constant litigation.gjr investments,county of escambia,cir.in this case,we address the violation of a clearly established constitutional right by a police officer who had more than enough awareness of the surrounding circumstances to know that her arrest of plaintiff albert durruthy,and the force used in so doing,was not only unnecessary,but unlawful.whether under a standard of probable cause or arguable probable cause to arrest,the facts of this case,made all the more apparent and troubling by videotape evidence of the arrest,preclude any notion that officer pastor,or any reasonable police officer,could have believed that probable cause to arrest existed.qualified immunity is inappropriate here,especially at the summary judgment stage.accordingly,with respect,i dissent.
first,we must consider the threshold issue of whether durruthy allegations,if taken as true,establish a violation of his constitutional right against unlawful arrest under the fourth amendment of the federal constitution.see hope pelzer,d.the evidence shows that there simply was no reason for durruthy arrest.the videotape squarely refutes pastor initial stated basis for the arrest of durruthy,which was allegedly his obstruction of an officer arrest of bruce bernstein,an nbc cameraman,and his failure to obey another officer order to leave the street.see.stat.there were no acts of civil obedience taking place and no protestors or moving vehicles in the street.moreover,the police were not clearing the area in which durruthy was filming.pastor herself was standing in a line of officers approximately sixty feet away from durruthy.she left the line,without the permission of any superior officer,and rushed over to durruthy though she plainly saw that he was following another officer direct order to get off the street.she admitted that she was aware that durruthy was a member of the press and saw that he was carrying a large television camera,but nonetheless helped pin him to the ground and forcibly secure him by wrenching his right arm behind his back and pressing his head to the sidewalk.though durruthy repeatedly pled with pastor and the other officers that he would go peacefully and that his bad arm would not bend backward,pastor and the other officers did not relent.
in addition,george sound man who recorded audio of the the scene,attempted to inform the attending police officers,including pastor,that he was durruthy partner,and convinced the officers to give him durruthy camera,which they had taken from durruthy before forcing him to the ground.yet,pastor continued to pin durruthy to the sidewalk and proceed with the arrest without regard to the obvious pain and injury she was inflicting even though durruthy was neither resisting the officers nor presenting any danger.pastor knew all of this.thereafter,durruthy was held in a police van without medical care for six hours before being released.a prudent officer with pastor knowledge of the situation,under the circumstances,could not have believed that durruthy had committed,was committing,or was about to commit an offense which justified arrest.
moreover,when durruthy and his criminal defense attorney met with the state attorney several weeks after the arrest,durruthy counsel showed the state attorney the videotape of the arrest.the state attorney immediately decided to drop all charges against durruthy,and asked him to sign a release of liability in favor of the miami police department and its officers.durruthy refused to sign the release.
in a thoughtful opinion,the district court concluded that a reasonable jury could find that pastor arrested durruthy without probable cause.see durruthy city of miami,d.the court further found that there was sufficient evidence to show that pastor did not even have arguable probable cause,that is,there existed sufficient proof that no reasonable police officer in the position of pastor could have believed that there was probable cause to arrest plaintiff.id.at.
the majority decision adopts pastor argument made to the district court that even if there was no probable cause or arguable probable cause to arrest durruthy for obstructing or resisting the officers,there was probable cause or at least arguable probable cause to arrest him under.stat.the district court found this argument unconvincing because is directed at preventing pedestrians from walking among vehicular traffic and there was no vehicular traffic in the roadway.durruthy,d at.the majority points out that the statute does not require that there be vehicular traffic in the roadway at the time of the offense and that it contains no exception for anyone,including members of the media.indeed,durruthy acknowledges that he was not entitled to a special exception because he was a cameraman.the fact that he was a cameraman,however,and that he was performing his duties as a cameraman at the time of the arrest goes to the core of the qualified immunity analysis.
and that is where the district court is correct and the majority of this court wrong with respect to pastor arguable probable cause to arrest under.again,the district court pointed out that t he statute is directed at preventing pedestrians from walking among vehicular traffic.d at.notwithstanding what the statute does and does not require,an arrest pursuant to could not be reasonable given that at the time of the arrest,pastor knew that there was no vehicular traffic in the roadway and that durruthy was an obvious member of the media acting within the scope of his journalistic duties.id.in my view,the district court correctly analyzed the applicability of in terms of whether pastor,at the time of the arrest and given her knowledge of the circumstances,had arguable probable cause to arrest based on.the inquiry is not whether durruthy actually violated the statute or whether the elements of the statute were met,but whether it was objectively reasonable for pastor to arrest durruthy given the obvious circumstances.pastor invocation of fails to amount even to an excuse for her actions.durruthy was charged only with obstruction of an officer under.stat,and that charge was dropped immediately by the state attorney upon viewing the videotape of the arrest.pastor never articulated as the purported basis for the arrest at the time of the arrest and raised it as a justification for the arrest only after the commencement of this litigation.though i acknowledge that an arrest is not rendered invalid by the fact that the basis for the arrest,though legitimate,was merely pretextual,see whren united states,d,we should be troubled by an argument suggesting that a legitimate basis for an arrest identified only after the arrest would provide sufficient grounds therefor.rogers powell,cir emphasis added.moreover,it is patently obvious to any observer of the videotape evidence that the sole reason for pastor conduct was that she and the other officers wanted durruthy to stop filming the arrest of the nbc cameraman.no one has argued that the mere act of durruthy filming is a crime,unlike the scenarios in whren,united states holloman,cir,and other cases cited by the majority where the officers purported bases for arrest were obvious pretexts for suspicion of drug possession,murder,and other crimes.
the majority states that t he heart of durruthy argument is that there was no probable cause for his arrest because he had permission to be in the street and proceeds to discredit durruthy testimony as vague,general,and stated at the highest order of abstraction.given that the case is at the summary judgment stage,we must resolve all issues of material fact in favor of durruthy before determining the legal question of whether the defendant is entitled to qualified immunity under durruthy version of the facts.see lee ferraro,cir.durruthy testimony on whether he had permission to be in the street still leaves a genuine issue of material fact as to whether pastor was aware,with notice that durruthy and the media overall was authorized to be in the street,that she was violating a clearly established federal right when she arrested him.see penn city of miami,wl.
as to the issue of whether durruthy constitutional right against illegal arrest was clearly established,the majority relies on this circuit rigid gloss of how exactly such a right is clearly established.hope,at.durruthy has argued that pastor violation of a miami police department internal policy shows pastor knowledge of the unlawfulness of her actions.the policy reads 
no warrantless arrest of media personnel for acts arising out of the pursuit of the news gathering function will be made without the express authority of the senior commanding officer or the staff duty officer.
city of miami office bulletin dated january.
chief of police raul martinez explained that the department media policy granted a higher degree of courtesy to members of the media than to average citizens and that if a member of the media complies with a police officer request to move,such compliance should be the end of the incident.
the majority claims that it can not find any precedent that even remotely suggests that the possible violation of an internal law enforcement guideline defeats an official qualified immunity.hope,however,a decision by the united states supreme court that directly addresses this circuit strict view of qualified immunity,stands in part on guidelines and regulations issued by law enforcement.hope,an inmate assigned to limestone correctional facility in alabama,was twice handcuffed to a hitching post for several hours as punishment for disruptive behavior.this court found that though cuffing an inmate to a hitching post for a period of time extending past that required to address an immediate danger or threat is a violation of the eighth amendment,hope pelzer,cir,the defendant prison guards were still entitled to qualified immunity because there was no clear,test established at the time of the violation that would survive our circuit qualified immunity analysis.id.at.this court went on to explain that it is important to analyze the facts in prior cases,and determine if they are materially similar to the facts in the case in front of us.id.a nalogous facts,the court concluded,are not enough.id.instead,the facts must be materially similar to hope situation.id.
the supreme court reversed and rejected this court analysis and asserted that this rigid gloss on the qualified immunity standard is not consistent with our cases.hope,at.the court continued 
officials can still be on notice that their conduct violates established law even in novel factual circumstances although earlier cases involving fundamentally similar facts can provide especially strong support for a conclusion that the law is clearly established,they are not necessary to such a finding.the same is true of cases with materially similar facts t he salient question that the court of appeals ought to have asked is whether the state of the law in gave respondents fair warning that their alleged treatment of hope was unconstitutional.
the court,as part of its analysis,considered a regulation issued by the alabama department of corrections adoc and a report and advisory letter issued by the department of justice to the adoc before the incidents of hope mistreatment.the adoc regulation authorized the use of the hitching post when an inmate refused to work or was otherwise disruptive to the prison work squad.it provided that an activity log should be completed for each such inmate,detailing his responses to offers of wa
