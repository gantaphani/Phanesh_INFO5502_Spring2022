larry flynt and,the company that publishes hustler magazine collectively flynt or appellants sued donald rumsfeld,secretary of defense,and the united states department of defense dod seeking,inter alia,injunctive relief against interference with its exercise of a claimed first amendment right of the news media to have access to troops in combat operations,and claiming that dod delay in granting hustler s reporter access to troops in afghanistan infringed that right.they further argued that dod directive controlling media access to military forces facially violates this same constitutional right.the district court dismissed flynt constitutional claims for lack of ripeness and standing,and refused to exercise its discretion under the declaratory judgment act to declare the pertinent dod directive facially unconstitutional.this appeal followed.because we find that no such constitutional right exists,we will affirm the district court decision on other grounds.
background 
hustler attempts to gain access 
shortly after the september,terrorist attacks,the united states military began combat operations in afghanistan in support of the global war on terrorism.on october,flynt wrote a letter to the honorable victoria clarke,assistant secretary of defense for public affairs,requesting that hustler correspondents be permitted to accompany ground troops on combat missions and that said correspondents be allowed free access to the theater of united states military operations in afghanistan and other countries where hostilities may be occurring as part of operation enduring freedom.two weeks later,on november,flynt wrote clarke again requesting the same access and complaining about her failure to respond to his october letter.three days later,on november,clarke sent flynt a fax stating that access to ground operations was not immediately possible because the only troops on the ground in afghanistan are small numbers of servicemen involved in special operations activity.clarke explained that t he highly dangerous and unique nature of their work makes it very difficult to embed media with ground troops,but also stated that there had been extensive media access to other aspects of military operations.specifically,s cores of reporters and photographers have covered the air strikes,witnessed the humanitarian drops and interviewed dozens of soldiers.clarke then provided flynt with contact information for the fifth fleet public affairs officer so that hustler could have similar access.
not satisfied with the access provided by dod,and that other media outlets had received,flynt did not contact the fifth fleet public affairs officer rather,he filed this lawsuit the day after he received clarke fax.shortly after filing suit,flynt sent another letter to clarke on january,stating that i did not contact the fifth fleet public affairs officer because i did not request any such access or similar access.rather,i specifically requested reporter access to actual battlefield combat activities.the letter also characterized clarke description of special operations activities as vague.two weeks later,flynt sent another letter to clarke requesting an immediate response to his january letter.clarke responded by letter on february,reiterated dod position,and again described the access that was currently available.furthermore,she stated that all your reporter needs to do is work with dod people on the ground.she also provided flynt with an extensive list of contact persons and explained that dod decisions regarding media access were controlled by department of defense directive.
on february,flynt lawyer sent an email tolieutenant commander bonnie hebert,one of the contacts clarke had provided,requesting permission to have hustler magazine correspondents accompany and report on the activities of american soldiers on the ground in afghanistan who are engaged in combat actions.hebert responded three days later,asking w here exactly in afghanistan would you like to go and requesting the identity of the reporter.this began a series of communications that ultimately resulted in david buchbinder,a hustler reporter,arriving at bagram air force base by may.once in afghanistan,buchbinder placed himself on a list of reporters awaiting access to ground units.since his arrival in afghanistan,buchbinder has filed several stories,at least one of which shows he has accompanied troops on a search for al qaeda operatives.
b.the directive 
as stated above,dod decisions regarding media access to combat troops are guided by department of defense directive.this directive,issued on september,assigns the responsibility of e nsur ing a free flow of news and information to the news media to the assistant secretary of defense for public affairs.directive.the directive contains three enclosures.at issue in this case is enclosure,entitled statement of dod principles for news media.this enclosure begins with the command that o pen and independent reporting shall be the principal means of coverage of military operations.it then outlines the manner in which such coverage should occur.it allows for media pools,limited numbers of press persons who represent a larger number of news media organizations and share material,but states that pools are not to be the standard means of covering military operations.rather,pools are only to be used when space is limited or areas to be visited are extremely remote.it also directs that field commanders should be instructed to permit journalists to ride on military vehicles and aircraft when possible.in sum,the directive represents an attempt to facilitate broad media coverage,and contains few restrictions,including limited restrictions on media communications for security purposes and expulsion for members of the media who violate the ground rules.id.at.it also includes the caveat that s pecial operations restrictions may limit access in some cases.
proceedings below 
flynt and,filed their initial complaint against the dod and secretary rumsfeld on november,requesting preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.in addition,flynt challenged directive on the grounds that enforcement of the policies violated his historical and constitutional rights of access to the battlefield enforcement of the policies amounted to a prior restraint that deprived him of his first amendment rights dod denial of his request was not narrowly tailored to further a substantial government interest and dod denial was arbitrary and capricious and made without reference to specific and objective standards.
after a hearing on flynt motion for a preliminary injunction,the district court denied the motion,stating that it was persuaded that in an appropriate case there could be a substantial likelihood of demonstrating that under the first amendment the press is guaranteed a right to gather and report news about military operations,subject to reasonable regulations.flynt rumsfeld,d.that being said,the district court determined that flynt likelihood of success on the merits was far from clear,id.at,and that because of the quickly evolving factual situation any judicial decisions would have to await the development of a fuller record,id.at.
on january,nine days after the district court denied his motion for a preliminary injunction,flynt filed an amended complaint.the amended claim presented ten claims,including claim a request for a declaration that the first amendment guarantees flynt a right of access to the battlefield,subject to reasonable regulations for safety and security claims a claim that dod directive fails to recognize and protect flynt first amendment right of access to the battlefield and dod denial of his request violated these same rights claim an assertion that the directive does not contain constitutionally required definite and objective standards for determining press access claim a claim that the directive fails to place reasonable time limits on dod process claim a contention that the directive does not provide for prompt administrative appeal claims a claim that the directive imposes an unlawful prior restraint on the media constitutional right to battlefield access and claim a request for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.by motion filed february,dod moved to dismiss the amended complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b and b or,in the alternative,for summary judgment under federal rule of civil procedure c.
in considering dod motion,the district court grouped appellants claims as follows claims,and portions of claims that alleged dod improperly applied enclosure to flynt request,were considered as claims and claims were considered as facial challenges to enclosure.flynt rumsfeld,d.the district court also considered flynt request for injunctive relief.
with regard to the claims,the district court held they were unripe because the record did not reflect dod ever made a final decision with respect to flynt request.id.at.furthermore,flynt would suffer no concrete hardship by delaying review.id.at.also citing the absence of a final decision,the district court held flynt had not suffered a concrete and,thus,had no standing to press the claims.id.
turning to the facial challenges,the district court held that flynt had both constitutional and prudential standing.id.at.the court stated that because the dod had already crystallized its policies in enclosure,the posture of these particular claims ma de it inappropriate to dismiss on prudential ripeness grounds.id.at.the district court also held that dismissal on political question grounds was inappropriate because flynt claims did not implicate the president activities as commander in chief or the authority of the secretary of defense to direct military actions,nor did they require a court to apply principles beyond normal judicial competence.id.at.the district court did,however,refuse to exercise its discretion under the declaratory judgment act to consider flynt facial claims.id.citing the considerable discretion the declaratory judgment act gives to district courts,the court relied on the absence of a concrete controversy and the uncertainty surrounding flynt constitutional claims in withholding declaratory relief.id.at.the court further refused to grant injunctive relief.id.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
this court reviews de novo the district court dismissal of a complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.empagran.in our review,we assume the truth of the allegations made and construe them favorably to the pleader.scheuer rhodes,d.we review the district court decision to withhold declaratory relief for an abuse of discretion.wilton seven falls,d.
appellants claims 
as a threshold matter,it is important to clarify the right appellants seek to protect.in candor,it is not at all clear from appellants complaint below or briefs in this court precisely what right they believe was violated or contend the courts should vindicate.after some pressing,at oral argument it became clear that they claimed a right,protected under the first amendment,in their own words,to go in to battle with the military.this right is different from merely a right to cover war.the government has no least so far as flynt has made known to prohibits the media from generally covering war.although it would be dangerous,a media outlet could presumably purchase a vehicle,equip it with the necessary technical equipment,take it to a region in conflict,and cover events there.such action would not violate enclosure or any other identified dod rule.
with that distinction made,appellants claim comes more sharply into focus.they claim that the constitution guarantees to the hustler right to travel with military units into combat,with all of the accommodations and protections that what is currently known as embedding.indeed,at oral argument appellants counsel stated that the military is obligated to accommodate the press because the press is what informs the electorate as to what our government is doing in war.
ripeness and standing 
we first consider appellees contention that appellants lack standing to assert their as applied claims and that those claims were not ripe.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that appellants do have standing and that the claims are ripe.
standing requires that plaintiffs allege an injury in fact that is concrete and particularized and actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan defenders of wildlife,d citations and internal punctuation omitted.in applying that test,we assume the validity of appellants allegation of injury,although having crossed that threshold,we may ultimately determine it to be invalid.with that assumption,we hold that appellants do have standing to assert their claims.they asked for immediate access to accompany troops in combat,which they contend is their constitutional right,and that access was not granted.therefore,appellants ha ve suffered an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl,d.they have standing to challenge the directive as it was applied in this case.
in order to test the ripeness and justiciability of the claims,we again assume that they are otherwise valid.ripeness analysis tests whether a question has sufficiently matured to be amenable to adjudication.the supreme court has explained that when considering whether an issue is ripe for judicial review,a court must evaluate both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of refusing a decision.texas united states,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.further,a claim is unripe if it depends on contingent future events.id.at.
appellants claim is that credentialed press persons have an immediate right,upon request,to accompany troops in combat.so understood,the claims are ripe.flynt requested that hustler reporters gain access to combat operations,and that access was not immediately granted.instead,access of another sort was of covering the air strikes,witness ing the humanitarian drops and interview ing soldiers.flynt claim does not depend on contingent future events.he asked for immediate access,which he contends is his constitutional right,and that access was not granted.on these facts,the question is presented in a concrete factual setting and is fit for judicial review.
facial challenge 
with all of appellants claims properly before us,we now turn to their validity.because it is clear to us that appellants have asserted no cognizable first amendment claim,both the and facial challenges fail.
the facial challenge is premised on the assertion that there is a first amendment right for legitimate press representatives to travel with the military,and to be accommodated and otherwise facilitated by the military in their reporting efforts during combat,subject only to reasonable security and safety restrictions.there is nothing we have found in the constitution,american history,or our case law to support this claim.
to support the position that there is such a constitutional right,appellants first point to cases that discuss the general purposes underlying the first amendment.see new york times united states,d t he press was protected so that it could bare the secrets of government and inform the people.black,concurring mills alabama,d the first amendment supports the free discussion of governmental affairs.these cases,however,say nothing about media access to the combat units engaged in battle.
appellants also cite cases that allow facial challenges to statutes or regulations that vest public officials with unfettered discretion to grant or deny licenses to engage in expressive activity,such as city of lakewood plain dealer publishing,d,and shuttlesworth city of birmingham,d.this is not,however,a license decision.this appeal challenges regulations controlling access to government information and activity,not governmental limitation of expression.the supreme court has noted the difference.see,los angeles police united reporting publ g,d distinguishing government limits on access to information in its possession from a government restriction on disseminating information one already possesses.
likewise,this court has held that freedom of speech and of the press do not create any per se right of access to
