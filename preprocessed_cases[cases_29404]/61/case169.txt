nationwide administration nationwide brought defamation and related claims against belo,the dallas morning news,and writer scott burns collectively referred to as belo based on an allegedly defamatory article that appeared in the dallas morning news.the district court granted belo rule b motion to dismiss on statute of limitations grounds and nationwide appealed to this court.for the reasons stated below,we affirm.
on july,the dallas morning news published an article criticizing a particular mortgage program offered by nationwide.the article first appeared in a financial column written by scott burns in the newspaper print edition and was subsequently made available on its website.the dallas morning news website is readily accessible on the internet by entering the proper internet address or by using a standard internet search engine.
based on the article,nationwide filed suit in ohio state court on july,against belo,alleging defamation,tortious interference with prospective business relations,and business disparagement.however,nationwide did not serve belo until june.
upon being served,belo removed to the united states district court for the southern district of ohio where it brought a timely motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to rule b and for failure to state a claim pursuant to rule b.before the court ruled on belo motion,nationwide moved to transfer the case to the northern district of texas,where it could exercise personal jurisdiction over belo.by order dated march,the ohio district court granted nationwide motion and transferred the case to the northern district of texas pursuant to a.that section permits a court to transfer a case to any district or division in which it could have been brought regardless whether it has personal jurisdiction over the defendants.a goldlawr,heiman,d.
after the suit was docketed in the northern district of texas,belo brought a rule b motion to dismiss on may,arguing that nationwide suit violated the statute of limitations.the district court granted the motion and dismissed the case.nationwide timely appealed.
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court dismissal for failure to state a claim under rule b.frank delta airlines,cir.dismissal under rule b is appropriate when the plaintiff has failed to allege enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face and fails to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.bell atl.twombly,d.we proceed on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true even if doubtful in fact.id.at.however,w e review the district court administrative handling of a case,including its enforcement of the local rules and its own scheduling orders for abuse of discretion.macklin city of new orleans,cir.
procedural issues 
nationwide argues that belo rule b motion to dismiss,filed on may,in the northern district of texas,was procedurally barred because it was untimely,and belo failed to consolidate its defenses in one motion as required by rule g.
nationwide first argues that belo motion was barred because it was untimely under rules setting deadlines for filing responsive rule b motions or pleadings by defendants.the northern district of texas received this case from the southern district of ohio on april,and belo filed its rule b motion on may.nationwide contends that,assuming the transfer to the northern district of texas constituted a and of their complaint,belo motion was untimely under rule a a.see.a a requiring a defendant to serve an answer within days after being served with the summons and complaint.construing this rule as requiring belo to file either an answer or a rule b motion within days of the transfer,nationwide contends that belo may motion was untimely.nationwide cites no authority for the proposition that transfer of a case under a constitutes a of the case in the transferee court.we find such a contention untenable.nothing in the statutory language of a suggests that transfer should be treated as a.further,when cases are transferred from one district to another,all docket entries are transferred and all pending motions remain pending.
nationwide other arguments relating to the timeliness of belo rule b motion also lack merit.nationwide contends that belo rule b motion was untimely under rule a a,which provides if the court denies a rule b motion or postpones its disposition until the trial on the merits,the responsive pleading shall be served within days after notice of the court action.fed.civ.a a.application of rule a a is triggered when the court denies a motion or postpones disposition of a motion until trial.see id.neither the ohio or the texas district court denied or postponed disposition of any rule b motion,so that section is inapposite.
nationwide also asserts that rule c renders belo motion untimely.rule c provides that when a defendant removes an action to federal court before answering a complaint,the defendant has twenty days from receipt of the initial pleading or service,or five days after filing a notice of removal,whichever is longer,to file a responsive pleading or motion.fed.civ.c.contrary to nationwide argument,rule c merely set the deadline for belo to make its first responsive pleading or motion after removal.see id.belo satisfied rule c by timely filing a responsive motion in the ohio district court.
having concluded that belo rule b motion was not untimely under any of the rules cited by nationwide that set deadlines for responsive pleadings and motions,we turn to nationwide argument that belo failed to consolidate its defenses as required by rule g.rule g provides in relevant part if a party makes a motion under this rule but omits therefrom any defense or objection then available the party shall not thereafter make a motion based on the defense or objection so omitted,except a motion as provided in subdivision h.fed.civ.g.nationwide argues that belo failed to consolidate its personal jurisdiction and statute of limitations defenses in the same rule b motion.however,rule g did not require consolidation here because rule h explicitly excepts from the consolidation requirement motions based on the defense of failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.see id.at h in sum,we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by considering belo rule b motion.
substantive issues 
statute of limitations 
belo rule b motion sought dismissal of nationwide claims on statute of limitations grounds.see jones alcoa,cir noting that a statute of limitations defense may be properly asserted in a rule b motion.the parties do not dispute that the texas statute of limitations applies to this suit transferred from the southern district of ohio to the northern district of texas pursuant to a,and we agree.f ollowing a section a transfer,regardless of which party requested the transfer or the purpose behind the transfer,the transferee court must apply the choice of law rules of the state in which it sits.ellis great sw,cir.applying the texas choice of law rules,we conclude that texas has the most significant relationship to this dispute and thus,texas substantive law applies.see id.at noting that texas has adopted the most significant relationship test to determine which state substantive law applies.further,when texas substantive law applies,there is no question that texas courts would apply their own state statute of limitations.id.at.
texas has adopted a statute of limitations for libel claims.see.civ.prac.a.the limitations period begins to run when publication of the libelous statement is complete,which is the last day of the mass distribution of copies of the printed matter.holloway butler,dist,writ ref.on that date,the publisher of the statement has made the libelous matter available to his intended audience and the tort is complete.stephan baylor med.ctr.at garland,no pet.because the period begins to run on the date the publication is complete,this rule is commonly referred to as the single publication rule.see see also williamson new times,worth,no pet.
an important purpose of the single publication rule is to prevent plaintiffs from bringing stale and repetitive defamation claims against publishers.see holloway,at.as a result,retail sales of individual copies after the publication date and sales of back issues do not trigger a new limitations period.id.at.however,separate printings of the original content are considered subsequent publications.stephan,at reasoning that in the case of separate printings it is apparent that the publisher intends to reach different audiences and this intention justifies a new cause of action.
it is uncontested that the dallas morning news published the allegedly defamatory article in its july,print edition,and that nationwide filed its complaint on july,the allowed period.however,the mere timely filing of a suit will not interrupt or toll the running of a statute of limitation to interrupt the statute,the use of diligence in procuring the issuance and service of citation is required.ellis,at internal quotation marks omitted applying texas law.nationwide failed to serve belo until june,more than months after filing suit.the district court,citing this lengthy and unexplained delay,found that nationwide failed to exercise due diligence in serving belo and dismissed the suit on statute of limitations grounds.see id.at surveying texas cases and concluding that unexplained delay of as little as six months demonstrates as a matter of law that the plaintiff lacked diligence in obtaining the issuance and service of process.
on appeal,nationwide does not appear to challenge the proposition that,if its claim rested solely on publication of the article in the print edition,its claim is barred.nationwide instead argues that the article availability on the dallas morning news website mandates a different result.this is so,according to nationwide,because each time a viewer accesses the article from the website a republication occurs for statute of limitations purposes.this concept,widely argued but virtually always rejected,is referred to as the continuous publication rule.
ii.continuous publication rule and internet publication 
as mentioned,texas applies the single publication rule to libel cases involving mass media publications.holloway,at.however,texas courts have not yet considered whether the single publication rule should apply to internet publications.accordingly,this court is required to follow the rule we believe the texas supreme court would adopt.am.indem.lloyds travelers prop.cas.ins,cir.i n making our erie guess,we consider,among other sources,treatises,decisions from other jurisdictions and the majority rule.id.internal quotation marks omitted.we may also consider texas public policy interests.
in this case,decisions from other jurisdictions prove the most instructive in considering decisions from other jurisdictions,we have found only one that applied the continuous publication rule.see swafford memphis individual practice ass n,wl,at.june.nationwide believes the texas supreme court would be inclined to follow swafford lead and hold that each time a reader accesses the article on the dallas morning news website a new publication occurs.however,our reading of swafford and subsequent cases fails to persuade us that texas would adopt its holding here.
swafford involved a online database containing information about individual doctors.id.at.the database allegedly provided defamatory information about an individual doctor to health care facilities who requested his information.id.the tennessee court of appeals,reasoning that the database limited access to authorized users and only released information in response to an affirmative request by a hospital,refused to apply the single publication rule.id.at.the court noted that no aggregate publication occurs when users of the database request information,and thus,the justification for the single publication rule,a vast multiplicity of lawsuits resulting from a mass publication,is simply not present.id.at.
swafford is factually distinguishable from the case at bar.the information at issue in swafford was not publicly available and could hardly be considered an aggregate communication comparable to typical internet publication.oja army corps of eng rs,cir internal quotation marks omitted discussing swafford.in contrast,the article at issue here was undisputably posted on the website and made widely available to the public via the internet.this distinction is material because,as swafford itself noted,a primary purpose of the single publication rule is to prevent the multiplicity of suits that may follow widespread dissemination.see swafford,wl,at.
in addition to this factual distinction,we are influenced by the fact that apparently no court has followed swafford.however,a number of cases have refused to follow swafford and have applied the single publication rule to internet publications.of these,perhaps the most influential is firth state.
in firth,the plaintiff sued the publisher of an investigative report that was published on the internet.id.at.the plaintiff argued that because the report was constantly available on the internet,each day resulted in a new publication of the report.id.at.the new york court of appeals,after considering the competing policy arguments,held that a multiple publication rule would implicate an even greater potential for endless retriggering of the statute of limitations,multiplicity of suits and harassment of defendants.id.at.further,the court recognized that if it applied the continuous publication rule i nevitably,there would be a serious inhibitory effect on the open,pervasive dissemination of information and ideas over the internet,which is,of course,its greatest beneficial promise.id.thus,the court held the single publication rule applies to internet publications.id.
every court to consider the issue after firth has followed suit in holding that the single publication rule applies to information widely available on the internet.see,oja,at van buskirk new york times,cir mitan davis,d,churchill state,mccandliss cox,traditional cat ass n,gilbreath,th,d,given that every case to consider the issue has applied the single publication rule to publicly available internet articles,it is clearly the majority approach.see churchill,at agreeing with the almost unanimous view of other courts that the single publication rule applies to internet publications see also kumar,chi.revv.at the idea that publication on the web and traditional print publishing are similar enough to merit application of the single publication rule is not controversial.furthermore,we find the rationale behind the widespread acceptance of the single publication rule in the internet context persuasive.
for example,some courts have reasoned that the functional similarities between print and internet publication support application of the single publication rule to both types of media.oja,at see also firth,at communications accessible over a public web site resemble those contained in traditional mass media,only on a far grander scale.as one court noted,a statement electronically located on a server which is called up when a web page is accessed,is no different from a statement on a paper page in a book lying on a shelf which is accessed by the reader when the book is opened.mitan,d at.while we recognize that important differences exist between print media and the internet,we agree that the similarities between the two media support application of a consistent rule.see oja,at.
nationwide attempts to distinguish internet publication,where editors can easily alter or remove content,from print media where publishers relinquish all right of control,title,and interest in the printed matter upon publication.new times,at.in oja,the ninth circuit rejected a similar argument 
it is true that an internet publisher may have greater control over the availability of content posted on its server than a print publisher has over its printed stock however,that fact alone does not corrupt the analogy between internet and print publication,given that the single publication rule generally applies to books in a publisher stock that could have been withdrawn following their initial availability for sale but were not.
