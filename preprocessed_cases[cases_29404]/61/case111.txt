t he heart or essence of the transaction was not a sale or assignment of rights in the works under,but rather a sale or assignment of the agreements for those works under which thomson was substituted for and took place under the agreements.
hearing brief,dated september,at emphasis in original.contended that

thus,letters written well before claimants asserted their claim made it clear that its share as publisher was being sold,and that as part of the sale the publishing agreement was being assigned,not rights to claimants work claimants signed the consent to assignment clause at the foot of each letter,in which they gave their consent to the assignment of the publishing agreement for the work to thomson,effective as of the date of thomson acquisition of the business.sale of the business to thomson,and claimants consent to the assignment of their publishing agreement as part of the sale,fall squarely within of the agreement.
