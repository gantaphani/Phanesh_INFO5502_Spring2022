appellant harry yohe is a retired member of the army green berets.in may of,yohe resided in townsend,massachusetts and was stationed at fort devens.on the evening of may,police responded to a report of a domestic disturbance involving yohe.the police interviewed yohe spouse at the neighbor residence and she told them that,yohe was threatening suicide and had amassed an arsenal of weapons.yohe wife informed police that her husband had been acting irrationally and had armed himself with two rifles,a kevlar helmet and rounds of ammunition.she also reported that yohe,who was on antidepressants,had been drinking since the previous day and was home alone with his seventeen son.
townsend police and massachusetts state police evidently took yohe report very seriously,because they dispatched a small army to yohe house.thirty police vehicles,including a swat team and a hostage negotiator converged on the yohe home,only to find that yohe had left the residence.police later found yohe at fort devens,where he was arrested at approximately on may.
after his arrest at fort devens,yohe was transported to nashoba deaconess hospital for a medical evaluation.he was then transferred to elizabeth hospital in brighton for further treatment and psychiatric evaluation.although the record is less than clear on this point,it appears that both hospitals discharged yohe shortly after admitting him,finding no evidence of intoxication or suicidal ideation.
on may and,two local newspapers printed stories about the arrest.peter nugent of the worcester telegram gazette and kate walsh,a reporter for the townsend times published articles about the arrest,without identifying yohe by name.the two articles were substantially similar and we reproduce the townsend times article in full here.
domestic situation turns ugly 
local residents were alarmed sunday night with the sight of up to state police vehicles traveling through the streets of townsend.police chief william may had called in the extra forces when a woman reported a drunk and suicidal husband in possession of deadly fire power and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.
the domestic dispute between husband and wife began at about on mother day,stated may.police were called at approximately when the woman reported that she and her children had left the house with a drunk and suicidal husband still inside.the unidentified woman alerted police of the presence of two and rounds of ammunition in the house,with her husband identified as a former soldier connected with special forces units.
he had been drinking all weekend,stated may.she also told us that her older son was either in the house or on his way there we determined that he was there.
with the unidentified man in custody by midnight,police confirmed that he had been drinking.may stated it was his belief that the man was suicidal.no charges have been brought against him.
the operation was secured at monday morning.
the nugent and walsh articles were published one and two days after yohe arrest,hospitalization and discharge.each of the articles was based entirely on interviews with chief may.nugent and walsh had each interviewed may in the past,and finding him to be a credible source,did not conduct an independent investigation before publishing the articles.consequently,neither article contained any information about yohe eventual discharge from the hospital,or about the results of any examinations he underwent.it is undisputed that the articles accurately recounted chief may statements to nugent and walsh.
as for may himself,his statements were based on the police incident report,which memorialized the telephone report and request for assistance by yohe spouse.there is no also no dispute about the accuracy of chief may statements regarding yohe spouse domestic dispute report.
yohe sued nugent and the worcester telegram gazette,and walsh of nashoba publications,the newspaper defendants for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.yohe also sued chief may for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.additionally,he brought an action against may and the town for a variety of alleged constitutional violations connected with yohe arrest and may statements to the media.the district court granted summary judgment to the newspaper defendants on the ground that the reports were either truthful or protected by the fair report privilege.the court also granted summary judgment for chief may,finding that his statements were not defamatory because they simply conveyed information he received in his official capacity and which served as the basis for the arrest.further,his statements could not give rise to a suit for intentional infliction for emotional distress because the statements were not extreme and outrageous.yohe now appeals the district court summary dismissal of his defamation and infliction of emotional distress claims.
discussion 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment for chief may and the newspaper defendants de novo.we affirm the district court judgment only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and if the appellees are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.rochester ford sales,ford motor,cir.
defamation is the publication,either orally or in writing,of a statement concerning the plaintiff which is false and causes damage to the plaintiff.mcavoy shufrin.to establish a claim of defamation,a plaintiff must satisfy the following elements.first,the defamatory statement must hold the plaintiff up to contempt,hatred,scorn,or ridicule or tend to impair his standing in the community,at least to his discredit in the minds of a considerable and respectable class in the community.tartaglia townsend,quotation omitted.second,the statement must have been to at least one other individual other than the one defamed.brauer globe newspaper company.third,where the speech is a matter of public concern,a defamation plaintiff must prove not only that the statements were defamatory,but also that they were false dulgarian stone,see also philadelphia newspapers,hepps,d holding that where plaintiff is a private figure and newspaper articles are a matter of public concern,there is a constitutional requirement that the plaintiff bear the burden of showing falsity,as well as fault,before recovering damages.finally,the plaintiff must show that he suffered special damages and must set forth these damages specifically.lynch lyons.
with that background in mind,we now analyze the statements of chief may and the newspaper defendants to determine whether any of these statements can support a claim of defamation or intentional infliction of emotional distress.
chief may statements 
yohe alleges that chief may statements defamed him and intentionally inflicted emotional distress.specifically,yohe challenged the following statements that may made to the press that yohe was a retired member of the army special forces of green berets and has been trained as a sniper that yohe had threatened to kill himself and was reported to be armed with several large caliber weapons and it was may belief that yohe was suicidal.
as the district court judge noted,
reading the newspaper articles in their entirety,it is clear that may was simply reporting information he received in his official capacity and which served as the basis for the arrest.he makes clear that the information was derived from witness statements,and qualifies his recitation of facts with phrases like according to witnesses,it was my belief,and it was reported.while plaintiff challenges the veracity of the underlying information may gathered from witnesses,he does not refute that those facts were reported to may,or that they were the premise of his conduct.
yohe may,no,wl at,march.
may statements referring to yohe military background,to the fact that he was heavily armed and that he was in a disturbed mental state on may,amount to nothing more than unrefuted statements of fact.although yohe now challenges these statements,the fact is that most of them are either true or have never been shown to be false.yohe carries the burden of showing that each allegedly defamatory statement is materiall
