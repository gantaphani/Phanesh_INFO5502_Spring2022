george milam hall submitted to a local newspaper,the coffey county republican the republican,an advertisement opposing the election bid of judge phillip fromme.he paid to have the ad run on two occasions.the paper ran the ad the first time but not the second,instead running an ad supporting judge fromme,which was paid for and signed by a number of attorneys,including coffey county attorney douglas witteman.hall filed suit in the united states district court for the district of kansas against the republican,judge fromme,the signatory attorneys,and a few others.his complaint included claims under federal laws and and the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organization rico statute,as well as a number of claims.the heart of the allegations in the complaint paragraphs is that after hall placed his advertisement,the defendants unlawfully convinced the paper publisher to pull the second running of his advertisement in favor of their own,which contained defamatory remarks about him.this action,he contends,violated his right of free speech under the first amendment,as applied to the states under the fourteenth amendment,as well as his fourteenth amendment right to equal protection of the law.
the district court dismissed hall federal claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,see.b,and denied his motion to amend his complaint.it declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his claims.hall now appeals.we have jurisdiction under and affirm.his claims fail because he did not allege state action,and his rico claims fail because he did not allege a threat of continuing racketeering activity.
background 
because we are reviewing a dismissal under rule b,we assume the truth of the properly alleged facts in hall complaint.cory allstate,wl,at cir.in the fall of,hall campaigned against judge fromme retention in the election to be held that november.his displeasure with judge fromme appears to stem from the manner in which judge fromme presided over litigation involving hall mother.as part of this campaign,hall placed an advertisement in the republican.he paid the paper to run the ad on october and november,but the paper published the ad only on october.on november,the republican,instead of carrying hall ad,ran an advertisement placed by a group of attorneys who belonged to the coffey county bar association the responsive ad.the responsive ad was critical of hall and called into question his motives in opposing judge fromme retention.it was paid for and signed by defendants stephen smith,james campbell,douglas witteman,thomas robrahn,linda mcmurray,brenda kelley,brad jones,and bryan hastert the bar association defendants,each of whom,except witteman,signed the responsive ad as attorney at law,vol.doc.at.witteman signed using his title as coffey county attorney.id.
hall requested witteman,in his capacity as coffey county attorney,to prosecute the bar association defendants and others for their actions in placing the advertisement.he also appeared before the coffey county commissioners to discuss their potential liability for witteman actions.neither witteman nor the commissioners took any action in response.
on november,hall filed his,complaint in federal district court.included as defendants in the complaint were the bar association defendants,judge fromme,and the republican and some of its personnel,as well as various other entities and individuals including local governments and their officials whose connection to the alleged conspiracy is not entirely clear from the complaint.in addition to the federal and rico claims,hall complaint asserts causes of action for invasion of privacy,defamation,negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress,tortious interference with contract,and fraud.hall theory of the case,as he describes it in his opening brief on appeal,is that the defendants violated his civil rights by intimidating and coercing a local newspaper from running a political advertisement submitted by hall,and for which he paid.aplt.br.at.
the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint under rule b,arguing primarily that hall had failed to state a federal cause of action.the district court agreed.in orders dated august and october,it concluded that the complaint failed to allege the requisite state action to support a claim,and for various reasons failed to state claims under and rico.it dismissed those claims with prejudice and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claims,dismissing them without prejudice.hall now challenges the court dismissal of his federal claims.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo the dismissal of a complaint under rule b.see christy sports,llc deer valley resort,cir.in doing so,we ask whether there is plausibility in the complaint.the complaint does not need detailed factual allegations,but the factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.id.citations,brackets,and internal quotation marks omitted.a claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.ashcroft iqbal,d.
iqbal stressed that it is not enough for the plaintiff to plead facts merely consistent with the defendant liability.id.internal quotation marks omitted.also,t hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action,supported by mere conclusory statements,do not suffice.id.iqbal suggested a approach.first,the court identif ies the conclusory allegations in the complaint that are not entitled to the assumption of truth.id.at.then it consider s the factual allegations in the complaint to determine if they plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief.id.
hall pro se status entitles him to a liberal construction of his pleadings.see van deelen johnson,cir.nonetheless,this court has repeatedly insisted that pro se parties follow the same rules of procedure that govern other litigants.garrett selby connor maddux janer,cir brackets and internal quotation marks omitted.
to state a claim under a plaintiff must allege the violation of a right secured by the constitution and laws of the united states,and must show that the alleged deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law.west atkins,d.private persons may be said to act under color of state law if they are jointly engaged with state officials in the challenged action.dennis sparks,d.but private conduct that is not fairly attributable to the state is simply not actionable under,however discriminatory or wrongful the conduct is.jojola chavez,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.hall claim is premised on the alleged denial of his rights to free speech and equal protection under the fourteenth amendment.a violation of the fourteenth amendment requires action by the state.in the context of claims based on violations of the fourteenth amendment,as is the situation here,the requirement in is equivalent to the fourteenth amendment requirement.see am.mfrs.mut.ins.sullivan,d.
although several defendants are local governments or persons holding public office,the sole defendant on whose official position the complaint specifically relies is witteman.hall appears to concede that his claim depends entirely on witteman involvement in the defendants actions.his opening brief in this court states,the essential theory behind hall claims can be found in paragraphs and of his complaint.aplt.br.at.the only official power mentioned in these paragraphs is that of witteman.paragraph alleges 
that on or about november,the cba coffey county bar association,fba franklin county bar association,solander,campbell,fromme,ryburn and specifically defendant witteman,and all defendant s decided to use the power of witteman kansas state office as coffey county attorney to subscribe the advertisement the reponsive ad under color of state law.this separate predicate act,use of the power and influence of the state,defendant knew,and each of them,would hopefully persuade voters,sitting on the fence,with their votes err on the side of caution,and vote for judge fromme when
