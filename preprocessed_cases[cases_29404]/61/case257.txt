dish network offers two products the hopper,which hops over commercials,and a companion box known as a joey.fox broadcasting company claims these products are contractually out of bounds and constitute copyright infringement.the district court denied the broadcaster request for a preliminary injunction.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm.
plaintiffs fox broadcasting company,twentieth century fox film,and fox television holdings,collectively,fox own the copyrights to television shows that air on the fox television network.its primetime lineup includes shows such as glee,bones,the simpsons,and family guy.fox contracts with cable and satellite television service providers to retransmit fox broadcast signal for the customers of these providers,known as multichannel video programming distributors.some such distributors also offer fox programming via video on demand.fox separately licenses its shows to companies such as hulu,apple,netflix,and amazon,which sell fox programs online or stream them over the internet.
one distributor that fox contracts with is dish network,the pay television service provider in the united states.dish retransmits fox broadcast signal under a contract with dish former parent company and current technology vendor,echostar technologies.among other things,the contract provides that dish shall not distribute fox programs on an interactive,or similar basis,though dish may connect its subscribers video replay equipment.dish also can not record,copy,duplicate authorize the recording,copying,duplication other than by consumers for private home use or retransmission of any part of fox signal.
fox and dish have amended this contract several times,most recently in a letter agreement.under that agreement,dish could provide fox video on demand to its subscribers,but dish had to disable fast forward functionality during all advertisements the contract stated such disabling is a necessary condition to distribution of the fox broadcast content via video on demand.the agreement also forbids fox and dish from attempting to frustrate or circumvent the contractual rights.
in march,dish released to its customers the hopper,a box with digital video recorder dvr and video on demand capabilities.the hopper provides service to up to four televisions in a home using companion boxes known as joeys wired to each television.dish customers can also watch hopper content on their computers and mobile devices using a product called the sling adapter.
at the same time it released the hopper,dish introduced a feature called primetime anytime that works only on the hopper.primetime anytime allows a subscriber to set a single timer to record any and all primetime programming on the four major broadcast networks including fox every night of the week.to enable primetime anytime,a hopper user presses the button on the remote control to reach the primetime anytime setup screen.the user selects enable,and a new menu appears where the viewer can disable recordings of certain networks on certain days of the week and change the length of time that the shows are saved between two and eight days.by default,primetime anytime records primetime shows on all four networks each night of the week and saves all recordings for eight days 
dish determines the start and end time of the primetime anytime recordings each night and sometimes alters these times to record programming outside the traditional primetime window of to eastern and pacific time monday through saturday and to on sunday primetime starts and ends one hour earlier in the mountain and central time zones.for instance,dish altered the times to accommodate olympic programming on nbc in summer.if at least half of a program falls within the primetime window,dish includes the entire show in the primetime anytime recording.
a user may start watching recorded programs immediately after primetime anytime starts recording.the user must enable primetime anytime at least minutes before the primetime recording begins and can cancel a primetime anytime recording up to minutes before the recording begins after that,a user can no longer cancel that day primetime anytime recording.
all primetime anytime recordings are stored locally on a customer hopper for the preselected number of days typically eight,at which time they are automatically deleted.before that time,a customer can not actually delete or save a primetime anytime recording.rather,if the customer selects save or save series from the primetime anytime menu,an icon is created in the customer my recordings folder,but the icon is simply linked to the primetime anytime recording until the time of automatic deletion,at which time a duplicate copy is created.similarly,if a customer deletes a show recorded through primetime anytime,the icon for that show disappears from the user graphical user interface,but the recording remains on the customer hard drive until it is automatically deleted.
dish customers can also use the hopper to access movies via video on demand,but dish does not offer video on demand from any of the four broadcast networks,including fox.video on demand recordings are stored on the user hard drive in a file directory separate from the primetime anytime and dvr recordings.
in may,dish started offering a new feature,autohop,that allows users to automatically skip commercials.autohop is only available on shows recorded using primetime anytime,typically on the morning after the live broadcast.it is not available for all primetime programs.when a user plays back a primetime anytime recording,if autohop is available,a screen appears that allows the user to select the option to automatically skip over commercial breaks.by default,autohop is not selected.
if a customer enables autohop,the viewer sees only the first and last few seconds of each commercial break.a red kangaroo icon appears in the corner of the screen to demonstrate that autohop is skipping commercials.unlike the second skip feature available on many dvrs,once a user has enabled autohop,the user does not press anything to skip through commercials.autohop does not delete commercials from the recording.customers can see the commercials if they manually rewind or into a commercial break.
to create the autohop functionality,dish technicians in cheyenne,wyoming manually view fox primetime programing each night and technologically mark the beginning and end of each commercial.the program content is not altered in any way.the electronically marked files are then uplinked in wyoming and eventually transmitted to subscribers in an announcement file that dish makes available to subscribers after the show has aired.simultaneously with the uplink,three beta hoppers record the fox primetime block for transmissions in kentucky,pennsylvania,and florida to test the marking announcement.these copies remain at the uplink facility and are used to make sure the commercials have been accurately marked and that no portion of the program has been cut off.
fox sued dish for copyright infringement and breach of contract and sought a preliminary injunction.the district court denied the motion.fox broad.dish network,llc,d.it held that fox did not demonstrate a likelihood of success on most of its copyright infringement and contract claims.the exceptions were fox claims regarding the quality assurance copies.in making these copies,the court held,dish likely breached its contract with fox and directly infringed fox reproduction rights.id.at.nonetheless,the court held that fox was not entitled to an injunction because it failed to establish that it would likely suffer irreparable harm as a result of those copies.id.at.
to obtain a preliminary injunction,fox must demonstrate that it is likely to succeed on the merits,it is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief,the balance of equities tips in its favor,and an injunction is in the public interest.winter natural res.def.council,
we review the denial of a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion.perfect,cir.factual findings are reviewed for clear error,and legal conclusions are reviewed de novo.id.we do not reverse simply because the appellate court would have arrived at a different result if it had applied the law to the facts of the case.sports form,united press int l,cir see also united states hinkson,cir en banc.
applying this deferential standard of review,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that fox did not demonstrate a likelihood of success on its copyright infringement and breach of contract claims regarding dish implementation of primetime anytime and autohop.furthermore,the district court did not err in holding that fox did not demonstrate a likelihood of irreparable harm from dish creation of the quality assurance copies used to perfect the functioning of autohop.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that fox was unlikely to succeed on its claim of direct copyright infringement regarding primetime anytime.to establish a claim of copyright infringement by reproduction,the plaintiff must show ownership of the copyright and copying by the defendant.kelly arriba soft,cir see also,a.
in this case,the district court determined that fox had demonstrated ownership of the copyrights of some of the shows.the court then focused on who made the copies of fox programs using primetime anytime dish or its customers.the district court noted that the second circuit had considered a similar question in cartoon network lp csc holdings,cablevision,cir.the second circuit concluded that cablevision dvr system did not directly infringe the plaintiffs copyrights.unlike a typical dvr system,in which a customer remote sends signals to the box in her home,users of cablevision dvr system sent signals to cablevision central facility,where a copy of the program the viewer selected was created and stored on cablevision central servers.id.at.the question was who made this copy the viewer or cablevision id.at.the second circuit held that much like a vcr user makes the copy,so did the cablevision customer.id.at.
in this case,the district court found that dish exercises a degree of discretion over the copying process beyond that which was present in cablevision.fox,d at.it pointed to the facts that dish decides how long copies are available for viewing,dish maintains the authority to modify the start and end times of the primetime block,and a user can not stop a copy from being made once the recording has started.id.at.yet the court held that at this stage of the proceedings,it was not satisfied that primetime anytime had crossed over the line that leads to direct liability.id.at.the court held that the user,not dish,must take the initial step of enabling primetime anytime.id.the user,then,and not dish,is the most significant and important cause of the copy.id.quoting prosser keeton on torts.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that fox had not established a likelihood of success on this claim.infringement of the reproduction right requires copying by the defendant,kelly,at emphasis added,which comprises a requirement that the defendant cause the copying.see cablevision,at explaining that direct infringement claim turned on who made the copies.fox argues that because dish participates in the operation of primetime anytime on a daily basis,dish made the copies,either alone or concurrently with its users.however,operating a system used to make copies at the user command does not mean that the system operator,rather than the user,caused copies to be made.here,dish program creates the copy only in response to the user command.therefore,the district court did not err in concluding that the user,not dish,makes the copy.
that dish decides how long copies are available for viewing,modifies the start and end times of the primetime block,and prevents a user from stopping a recording might be relevant to a secondary or perhaps even a direct infringement claim.cablevision,at finding that factors evidencing cablevision control over copying process seemed more relevant to the question of contributory liability but reserving the question whether one contribution to the creation of an infringing copy may be so great that it warrants holding that party directly liable for the infringement,even though another party has actually made the copy.but these facts do not establish that dish made the copies.therefore,the district court did not err in holding that fox did not establish a likelihood of success on its direct infringement claim.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that fox was unlikely to succeed on its claim of secondary copyright infringement for the primetime anytime and autohop programs.secondary liability for copyright infringement does not exist in the absence of direct infringement by a third party.a m records,napster,cir.therefore,to establish secondary liability,fox must establish that dish users are infringing.there is no dispute that fox has established a prima facie case of direct infringement by dish customers because fox owns the copyrights to its shows and the users make copies.thus,the burden shifts to dish to demonstrate that it is likely to succeed on its affirmative defense that its customers copying was a fair use.perfect,at.dish has met this burden.
as the district court recognized,the supreme court analysis in sony of am.universal city studios,provides strong guidance in assessing whether dish customers copying of fox programs is a fair use.in sony,the supreme court held that sony was not liable for secondary infringement for manufacturing betamax vcrs because customers used the machines primarily for,the practice of recording a program to view it once at a later time,and thereafter erasing it.id.at.the court held that even the unauthorized home of respondents programs is legitimate fair use.id.at.
fox and its amici argue that dish customers use primetime anytime and autohop for purposes other than namely,and librarybuilding.these uses were briefly discussed in sony,in which the court recognized that some betamax customers used the device to avoid viewing advertisements and accumulate libraries of tapes.in sony,about percent of betamax users through commercials.id.at.additionally,a substantial number of interviewees had accumulated libraries of tapes.id.at.one user owned about tapes and bought his betamax intending to build a library of cassettes,but this proved too expensive.id.at.because the betamax was primarily used for timeshifting,the court in sony never expressly decided whether and were fair uses.metro goldwyn mayer studios grokster,explaining that a lthough sony advertisements urged consumers to buy the vcr to record favorite shows or build a library of recorded programs,neither of these uses was necessarily infringing citations omitted.
yet,as the district court held,does not implicate fox copyright interest because fox owns the copyrights to the television programs,not to the ads aired in the commercial breaks.if recording an entire copyrighted program is a fair use,the fact that viewers do not watch the ads not copyrighted by fox can not transform the recording into a copyright violation.indeed,a recording made with primetime anytime still includes commercials autohop simply skips those recorded commercials unless a viewer manually rewinds or into a commercial break.thus,any analysis of the market harm should exclude consideration of autohop because does not implicate fox copyright interests.
analyzing primetime anytime under the fair use factors,dish has demonstrated a likelihood of success on its customers fair use defense.as for the first factor,the purpose and character of the use,including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes,dish customers home viewing is noncommercial under sony,which held that timeshifting for private home use was a noncommercial,nonprofit activity,at.here,the district court found that primetime anytime is used for,and that the hopper is available only to private consumers.fox,d at.
sony also governs the analysis of the second and third factors,the nature of the copyrighted work and the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole.sony hel
