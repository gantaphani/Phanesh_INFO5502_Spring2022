the freedom of information act requires federal agencies to make records and documents publicly available upon request,subject to several statutory exemptions.one of those exemptions,exemption c,covers law enforcement records the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.b c.comptel,a trade association,submitted a foia request for documents had provided to the federal communications commission enforcement bureau during an investigation of that company.the bureau found that exemption c applied to individuals identified in submissions but not to the company itself,concluding that corporations do not have personal privacy interests as required by the exemption.the fcc agreed with the bureau,but the court of appeals for the third circuit did not.it held that exemption c extends to the personal privacy of corporations,reasoning that personal is the adjective form of the term person,which congress has defined,as applicable here,to include corporations.
held corporations do not have personal privacy for the purposes of exemption c.
a argues that the word personal in exemption c incorporates the statutory definition of person,which includes corporations.but adjectives do not always reflect the meaning of corresponding nouns.person is a defined term in the statute personal is not.when a statute does not define a term,the court typically give s the phrase its ordinary meaning.johnson united states.personal ordinarily refers to individuals.people do not generally use terms such as personal characteristics or personal correspondence to describe the characteristics or correspondence of corporations.in fact,personal is often used to mean precisely the opposite of we speak of personal expenses and business expenses,personal life and work life,personal opinion and a company view.dictionary definitions also suggest that personal does not ordinarily relate to artificial persons like corporations.
contends that its reading of personal is supported by the common legal usage of the word person.yet while person,in a legal setting,often refers to artificial entities,effort to ascribe a corresponding legal meaning to personal again elides the difference between person and personal.provides scant support for the proposition that personal denotes corporations,even in a legal context.
regardless of whether personal can carry a legal meaning apart from its ordinary one,statutory language should be construed in light of the terms surrounding it.leocal ashcroft.exemption c refers not just to the word personal,but to the term personal privacy.personal in that phrase conveys more than just of a person it suggests a type of privacy evocative of human concerns not the sort usually associated with an entity like.does not cite any other instance in which a court has expressly referred to a corporation personal privacy.nor does it identify any other statute that does so.while argues that this court has recognized privacy interests of corporations in the fourth amendment and double jeopardy contexts,this case does not call for the court to pass on the scope of a corporation privacy interests as a matter of constitutional or common law.contends that the fcc has not demonstrated that the phrase personal privacy necessarily excludes corporations privacy.but construing statutory language is not merely an exercise in ascertaining the outer limits of a word definitional possibilities,dolan postal service,and has provided no sound reason in the statutory text or context to disregard the ordinary meaning of the phrase.
b the meaning of personal privacy in exemption c is further clarified by two foia exemptions.exemption,which congress enacted eight years before exemption c,covers personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.b.this court has regularly referred to exemption as involving an individual right of privacy,department of state ray,and congress used in exemption c the same phrase personal privacy used in exemption.in contrast,foia exemption,which protects trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential,b,clearly applies to corporations.congress did not use any language similar to that in exemption in exemption c.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit 
chief justice roberts delivered the opinion of the court.
the freedom of information act requires federal agencies to make records and documents publicly available upon request,unless they fall within one of several statutory exemptions.one of those exemptions covers law enforcement records,the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.b c.the question presented is whether corporations have personal privacy for the purposes of this exemption.
the freedom of information act request at issue in this case relates to an investigation of respondent,conducted by the federal communications commission.participated in an program the or program that was created to enhance access for schools and libraries to advanced telecommunications and information services.in august,voluntarily reported to the fcc that it might have overcharged the government for services it provided as part of the program.
the fcc enforcement bureau launched an investigation.as part of that investigation,provided the bureau various documents,including responses to interrogatories,invoices,emails with pricing and billing information,names and job descriptions of employees involved,and assessment of whether those employees had violated the company code of conduct.the fcc and resolved the matter in december through a consent decree in which without conceding liability agreed to pay the government and to institute a plan to ensure compliance with the program.see fcc rcd.
several months later,comptel a trade association representing some of competitors submitted a foia request seeking a ll pleadings and correspondence in the bureau file on the investigation,at.opposed comptel request,and the bureau issued a in response.
the bureau concluded that some of the information had provided including cost and pricing data,information,and identifying information about staff,contractors,and customer representatives should be protected from disclosure under foia exemption,which relates to trade secrets and commercial or financial information,b.app.to pet.for cert.the bureau also decided to withhold other information under foia exemption c.exemption c exempts records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.b c.the bureau concluded that individuals identified in submissions have privacy rights that warrant protection under exemption c,at.the bureau did not,however,apply that exemption to the corporation itself,reasoning that businesses do not possess personal privacy interests as required by the exemption,at.
on review the fcc agreed with the bureau.the commission found position that it is a private corporate citizen with personal privacy rights that should be protected from disclosure that would barrass it within the meaning of exemption c at odds with established fcc and judicial precedent.fcc rcd.it therefore concluded that exemption c has no applicability to corporations such as.at.
sought review in the court of appeals for the third circuit,and that court rejected the fcc reasoning.noting that congress had defined the word person to include corporations as well as individuals,the court held that exemption c extends to the personal privacy of corporations,since the root from which the statutory word personal is derived is the defined term person.at.as the court explained,i t would be very odd indeed for an adjectival form of a defined term not to refer bac
