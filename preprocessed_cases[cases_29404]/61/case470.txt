appellant marty ingels sought to participate in a radio talk show.upon learning appellant age,the screener told appellant he was too old for the audience to which the show was aimed.appellant objected that his age should not preclude him from participating in the forum.he was then allowed on the air,where he elected to address his displeasure over his perception that he was a victim of age discrimination,rather than the subject then under discussion on the show.he sued the producers and the talk show host for age discrimination under the unruh civil rights act,civil code section et hereafter sometimes the act,and for unfair business competition under business professions code section.the trial court granted a special motion to strike pursuant to code of civil procedure section and dismissed the action 
we first conclude that the action falls within application of section and is not exempt from such treatment under section.we then conclude,given the unique circumstances presented,appellant has failed to demonstrate a probability he will prevail on his unruh civil rights act claim.because his claim for unfair competition is based on a violation of the act,we also conclude he has failed to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on that claim.we affirm.
statement of 
respondent westwood one broadcasting services,produces a radio show hosted by respondent tom leykis.the show utilizes the format of a host addressing various topics who responds to listener and correspondence,and who also takes calls from listeners.the show is described as an extremely popular radio talk show that is broadcast in los angeles each weekday from to,as well as by satellite feed to affiliate stations.it is broadcast to affiliated stations in more than states and has an estimated weekly national audience of more than adult listeners.we are told i n the los angeles metro survey area,the tom leykis show had a share of the men aged radio audience,making it the for all radio stations in the los angeles market during its time period.

appellant describes himself as a television personality and a concerned citizen.he also hosted his own radio talk show in los angeles for two years the world as seen by marty ingels.appellant regularly calls into radio talk shows using the name paul russo.every show he calls has screeners,and on many occasions he has not been allowed on the air.
on june,appellant was listening to the tom leykis show.the topic involved relationships between men and women,a topic which appellant believed was significant.the host was discussing a young man strategy for,in appellant words,luring dates,girls,and being popular,and stuff like that.the host was giving advice to the young man.appellant decided to call into the show and confront the host to,in appellant words,challenge him on his beliefs and win a moral argument when he finally got through,he spoke with a screener and told the screener that his name was paul russo and that his age was,although appellant was actually years of age at the time.the screener made a few jokes about appellant age and told appellant he did belong on the show.appellant was on and off hold for approximately to minutes,during which time he decided to address the issue of age when he got on the air.
appellant was then put on the air with tom leykis and the following exchange occurred,after which appellant was cut off

appellant suit names as defendants westwood one broadcasting services,and tom leykis.the first cause of action alleges a violation of the act with the following pertinent charging allegations.during the june,telephone call,leykis intentionally deprived ingels of the advantages,privileges,and accommodations of the tom leykis show by refusing to allow ingels to participate in the show based upon ingels age over years old.during the june,telephone call,leykis put ingels on the air and proceeded to berate and humiliate ingels and refused to allow ingels to air his opinions or participate in the show because of ingels age.as a direct and proximate cause of defendants conduct,ingels suffered a loss of dignity,hurt feelings,and emotional upset and distress in an amount to be determined at the time of trial.ingels also seeks treble that amount as allowed by law.ingels has further presumed damages in the amount of as defined in civil code.
the second cause of action,brought by appellant individually and on behalf of the general public,alleges unfair competition,with the following pertinent charging allegations.commencing at least as early as june,defendants have committed acts of unfair competition,as defined by business and professions code section,by engaging in the following unfair and unlawful business practices using the public airwaves to encourage members of the public to telephone into the radio talk show and then discriminating against certain members of the public based upon age engaging in an unlawful act and practices in violation of the unruh civil rights act found at civil code et.by depriving members of the public of the advantages,privileges,and accommodations of a business establishment by refusing to allow the general public to participate in the radio talk show based upon the caller age or other prohibited basis.
in connection with the first cause of action,appellant prayed for recovery of compensatory damages,statutory damages,punitive damages,attorney fees,and for a permanent injunction pursuant to business professions code section.appellant sought only injunctive relief and attorney fees in connection with the second cause of action.
respondents filed a special motion to strike pursuant to section,supported by various declarations.they argued that appellant would be unable to prevail in his claims ingels can not meet his burden to prove that respondents committed any actual violation of the unruh civil rights act.ingels is manifestly not a person denied the rights provided in section,because ingels admits that he was in fact put on the air with leykis,complaint,and because age is not and should not be a protected class in this context.without any unruh act claim,ingels unfair competition claim can not stand.ingels claims fail as a matter of law under the first amendment,the supremacy clause,and preemption doctrine because the unruh act does not trump the first amendment and broadcast freedom.
appellant opposed the motion,first contending that his claims fell outside the scope of section.he argued that because the action was for age discrimination it did not address any first amendment rights of respondents.his fallback argument was that he had demonstrated a valid age discrimination claim under the act and he would be able to prevail on his claims.he did not challenge the evidentiary foundation supporting respondents motion.
the trial court found the action fell within the scope of section and that appellant had failed to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on his claims.on the issue of the merits of appellant claims the court minute order provides 
plaintiff argues that there is no legitimate viewpoint neutral reason for barring the views of a person older than from the show.but plaintiff must provide evidence to support his allegations that discrimination occurred and there was no viewpoint neutral reason behind excluding him.it is enough if the plaintiff establishes a substantial or reasonable probability of success plaintiff provides little if any evidence in his sole exhibit a that he was actually initially barred from the show,that this was based on his age as alleged in or that the radio show has any policy which excludes older people opp.at and.this lack of evidence does not overcome the first amendment protections against prior restraints upon broadcasters as discussed above.as defendant argues,to the contrary,plaintiff admits that during his call,he spoke for several minutes with the call screener he was put on the air with the show host he engaged the host in a discussion of whether the host should be entitled to screen out a caller based on his stated age,hoping the host would respond,which he did plaintiff has not made a prima facie showing that he was treated any differently than any other caller,such that he was denied equal accommodations under the unruh act.therefore,this act can not be applied to impose upon broadcasters a viewpoint unwanted in their message to targeted audiences.
a defendant can not be liable under for committing unlawful business practices without having violated another law.here no violation of the unruh act is capable of proof given the facts placed before this court.scripps clinic superior court th,d.if the unruh act claim is dismissed,then there is no unlawful act upon which to base the derivative unfair competition claim.
an order granting the special motion to strike and dismissing the action was entered and a timely notice of appeal was filed.
discussion 
special motions to strike,generally 
in,the legislature enacted code of civil procedure section in response to its perception that there has been a disturbing increase in lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances,subd.a wilcox superior court th,d,overruled in part on other grounds by equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d,fn.equilon.
section provides a procedural remedy to a party who perceives that an action qualifies as a strategic lawsuit against public participation slapp.that party may bring what is termed a special motion to strike against a claim arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,subd.b.the term person includes a corporation.lafayette morehouse,chronicle publishing th,d,superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in damon ocean hills journalism club th,d.

on appeal,w e apply the de novo standard of review to both prongs of the statute.citation.mann quality old time service,th,d.
does the action fall within section 
in reviewing whether a defendant has met its initial burden of proving that an action falls within section,we consider the pleadings and any supporting and opposing affidavits stating facts upon which the liability is based.citations.t he statutory phrase cause of action arising from means simply that the defendant act underlying the plaintiff cause of action must itself have been an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech citation.t he critical point is whether the plaintiff cause of action itself was based on an act in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech.citation.the moving defendant has no obligation to demonstrate that the plaintiff subjective intent was to chill the exercise of constitutional speech or partition rights,or that the action had the effect of chilling such rights.citation.the principal thrust or gravaman of the claim determines whether section applies.citation.mann quality old time service,supra,th at,d.
subdivision e of section includes four categories describing what qualifies for treatment under the section.items and appear to be the ones at issue here.as used in this section,act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue includes any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.ibid.
a case treated under section and presenting facts similar to those at issue here is seelig infinity broadcasting th,d seelig.the plaintiff in seelig was a participant in a previously taped television program titled who wants to marry a millionaire,which was to air during the evening of february.in early february,a representative from a morning radio talk show styled sarah and vinnie contacted the plaintiff,a resident in the locale of the talk show,and asked if she would appear on the talk show to discuss the upcoming television program.she declined saying that she did not want to bring attention to herself or to subject herself to public humiliation.id.at,d.
on the morning of february,the principals of the talk show discussed the upcoming who wants to marry a millionaire and told the listeners that they had contacted a local resident,without naming her,and had requested that she be on the show.the hosts then exchanged various comments ridiculing her refusal to appear on the show and making arguably disparaging remarks about her.despite the fact plaintiff had not been identified by name,listeners were able to identify her and she received phone calls from friends and business associates who commiserated with her about the broadcast.she sued infinity broadcasting and three of its employees alleging claims for slander,invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress,along with others.the defendants successfully moved to strike the complaint pursuant to section.the matter was appealed and the first issue addressed was plaintiff argument that the activity did not qualify for treatment under section.this argument was rejected 
plaintiff argues that the offending comments by defendants were not directed at her participation in the television contest,but instead were directed at her refusal to participate in the radio program.the distinction is unpersuasive.to satisfy the first threshold requirement,the offending comments must have been made in connection with an issue of public interest,subd.e.furthermore,this requirement,like all of section,is to be construed broadly so as to encourage participation by all segments of our society in vigorous public debate related to issues of public interest.citations.
the topic under discussion on the radio program was plaintiff appearance on the television show,and why she wants to marry some random guy.indeed,it is evident that defendants talked about plaintiff only because she had participated in the show.disparaging her refusal to appear on the radio program was indistinguishable from criticizing her participation in the televised contest.it was,in effect,the radio variant of the empty chair scenario,which is occasionally played out live or on television a participant in an issue of public controversy declines to appear at a forum to discuss the matter and the host sets a place at the table,an empty chair,to emphasize that the absence underlines the flaw in the party position.thus,criticism of the refusal to defend her participation in the contest satisfies the requirement of being in connection with an issue of public interest,subd.e.
seelig,supra,th at,d,italics added,fn.omitted.
we see no distinction between seelig and the facts of this case for purposes of section.here,appellant casts the issue as the purported refusal of respondents to allow him to participate in the show because of his age.in seelig,as here,the alleged tortious conduct occurred in connection with a live radio talk show addressing subjects of interest to the public at large.of equal import is the fact that both situations the subject addressed was participation in the talk show.the court in seelig concluded that criticism of plaintiff refusal to participate in the talk show was a matter of public interest.here,respondents did allow appellant on the air and appellant addressed the reluctance of respondents to allow him to participate in the discussion at issue because of his age.
appellant attempts to distinguish seelig and other similar cases as involving claims of defamation and invasion of,he argues,which are appropriate for treatment under section.he contends there is no nexus between his claim for age discrimination and a chilling of respondents first amendment rights.we disagree with this proposition.the nature of the cause of action alleged is not dispositive.slapp suits can conceivably be pleaded in terms of breach of contract or other valid actions.citation.when considering a section motion,a court must consider the actual objective of the suit and grant the motion if the true goal is to interfere with and burden the defendant exercise of his free speech and petition rights.citations.foothills townhome christiansen th,d,italics added,overruled in part on other grounds by equilon,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
we look to the context out of which appellant claims arose his attempt to express himself in an open forum carried over the airwaves of public radio.in this context,appellant and respondents each are imbued with first amendment rights which may be burdened by resolution of issues to be addressed in this action.the legislature has declared that section shall be construed broadly,subd.a.we have no trouble concluding that respondents activity in providing an open forum by means of a radio talk show fits within the scope of section,subdivision e.
does section preclude application of section 
appellant argues that his action does not qualify for treatment under section by reason of section,subdivision b.section was enacted in and became effective january,after the trial court ruled on the motion in this case.
respondents counter with three arguments why section should not apply appellant action does not meet all three criteria listed under subdivision b appellant claims,arising from a radio talk show,fall within the exemptions listed under section,subdivision d and section was not applicable when the matter was argued before the trial court,therefore,the matter must be remanded to the trial court for the parties to better develop the record.
the legislature enacted section,effective january,to address a disturbing abuse in litigants use of the statute,subd.a.the new statute applies to lawsuits brought before its effective date because it constituted a procedural change regulating the conduct of ongoing litigation and thus triggered no retroactivity concerns.citation.mann quality old time service,supra,th at,d.
because there are no disputed facts presented,only an application of law,and because respondents have responded on the merits to the section argument,we will address the issue.yeap leake th,d.
as pertinent,section,subdivision b provides 
section does not apply to any action brought solely in the public interest or on behalf of the general public if all of the following conditions exist 
the plaintiff does not seek any relief greater than or different from the relief sought for the general public or a class of which the plaintiff is a member.a claim for attorney fees,costs,or penalties does not constitute greater or different relief for purposes of this subdivision.
the action,if successful,would enforce an important right affecting the public interest,and would confer a significant benefit,whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary,on the general public or a large class of persons.
private enforcement is necessary and places a disproportionate financial burden on the plaintiff in relation to the plaintiff stake in the matter.
there are yet no reported cases construing the scope of section,subdivision b.the limited number of reported cases to date involve commercial speech,which is addressed under subdivision c of section.on its face,subdivision b appears to exempt class actions and private attorney general suits from treatment under section.a review of the legislative history confirms that was the intent of the legislature.
sb would make the slapp motion inapplicable to public interest and class action lawsuits brought solely in the public interest or on behalf of the general public when three specified conditions are met.in general,the qualifying language would clearly encompass claims brought under the unfair competition law business and professions code section et,the unfair practices act business and professions code section et,the consumer legal remedies act civil code section et,as well as any other public interest or class actions lawsuits where the three specified conditions are met.
com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended may,see also assem.com.on judiciary,on bill reg.sess.as amended june.
the first condition listed is that t he plaintiff does not seek any relief greater than or different from the relief sought for the general public or a class of which the plaintiff is a member,subd.b.the reason for this condition is explained in the senate report there are certain statutes that protect public health or consumers that allow for enforcement by private attorneys general,without an injured plaintiff.conceptually,these are virtually identical to when the or attorney general enforces those same statutes.citations.since the statute already exempts actions filed by public prosecutors,it should provide a parallel protection when people are acting only in the public interest as private attorneys general,and are not seeking any special relief for themselves.the public interest criteria also make clear that suits motivated by personal gain are not exempted from the motion.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended may,italics added.
appellant first cause of action is for age discrimination under the act.in connection with this claim,appellant alleges as a direct and proximate cause of respondents conduct,appellant suffered a loss of dignity,hurt feelings,and emotional upset and distress in an amount to be determined at the time of trial.appellant also seeks treble that amount as allowed by law.because appellant alleges and seeks recovery of damages personal to himself,his claim fails to meet the first requirement set out in section,subdivision b.
appellant second cause of action is for unlawful business practices pursuant to business professions code section and is brought on behalf of appellant individually and on behalf of the general public appellant seeks injunctive relief,attorney fees and a ny further relief that the court may deem just and equitable.on its face,this claim fell within the exemption of section,subdivision b,because appellant was not seeking any special relief for himself.but in response to a letter we sent requesting that the parties address applicability of proposition to the instant case,appellant responded that it did not apply because he was seeking damages personal to himself that being clarified,the second cause of action also does not qualify for treatment under section,subdivision b.
but even if appellant were seeking relief no different or greater than relief sought for the general public,pursuant to subdivision d of section,the claims are excepted from the section exemption.
the action is against the producer of a talk show,westwood one broadcasting,and the host of the show,tom leykis.subdivision d excepts from application of subdivision b a ny action against any person or entity based upon the creation,dissemination,exhibition,advertisement,or other similar promotion of any dramatic,literary,musical,political,or artistic work,including,but not limited to,a motion picture or television program,or an article published in a newspaper or magazine of general circulation,subd.d,italics added.
the senate analysis includes the following explanation for the exceptions listed in section,subdivision d proposed subdivision d of newly added section would exempt the news media and other media defendants such as the motion picture industry from the bill when the underlying act relates to news gathering and reporting to the public with respect to the news media or to activities involving the creation or dissemination of any works of a motion picture or television studio.for claims arising from these activities,the current slapp motion would remain available to these defendants.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended may.
the fact that radio stations are not specifically listed is of no moment because the language of the subdivision specifically states it is not inclusive.the tom leykis show is designed and produced to elicit viewpoints from members of the public on issues of public interest which are contemporaneously aired to the public at large.we see no distinction in this and the gathering and dissemination of news by other media organizations which are identified in the exception.
we conclude that section does not preclude application of section to this action.we therefore turn to the issue of whether appellant has provided evidence demonstrating a probability that he will prevail on the claims,subd.b.
the probability of prevailing on the claims 
as pertinent,civil code section states b all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal,and no matter what their sex,race,color,religion,ancestry,national origin,disability,or medical condition are entitled to the full and equal accommodations,advantages,facilities,privileges,or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever.italics added.
because the unfair competition claim utilizes the act as its triggering statute,if no violation of the act has been demonstrated,the entire action must be stricken.scripps clinic superior court th,d.
we first note,as the trial court found,that appellant was not excluded from participating on the program.it was appellant who elected to change the topic he originally called in to discuss and take on the host for threatening to exclude him from the air because of his age.but appellant still purports to be making a claim on behalf of the general public.thus,we need to discuss the ultimate issues presented by this case.
does the act address age discrimination 
respondents argue that the act does not apply to a claim for age discrimination because age is not included within the types of discrimination delineated in the act.it is true that age is not listed in the statute,but cases have construed the act to include age discrimination.
in flowers john burnham d,the plaintiffs brought an action for age discrimination in housing after their landlord evicted them.a demurrer was sustained by the trial court without leave to amend.without analysis,the court of appeal concluded the act applied although liability for damages under section has been invoked primarily for racial discrimination its language and its history compel the conclusion the legislature intended to prohibit all arbitrary discrimination by business establishments citation.id.at,italics added.but the demurrer was upheld when the court concluded that the landlord rationale for excluding minor male children over five years of age was reasonable,not arbitrary.id.at.
in sunrise country club proud d,the issue was whether the act precluded the homeowners association of sunrise country club from limiting the sale and use of certain areas of the condominium development,identified as adult regions,to families with children years of age and older.the homeowners association argued the act did not apply to age restrictions.again without analysis,the court of appeal concluded that the act applied but it affirmed the trial court issuance of a restraining order,finding that the age restriction was reasonable under the circumstances the trial court determined and we agree that the division of sunrise county club into adult and family regions where over the living units and swimming pools are designed for family use does not constitute an unreasonable or arbitrary age discrimination.id.at.
in marina point,wolfson cal d,the supreme court addressed a claim of discrimination under the act brought by a family with a minor child against an apartment complex for refusing to rent to the family.the trial court concluded the specific categories of discrimination listed in the act were exclusive and because age was not listed the action could not proceed.citing and quoting from its prior opinion,in re cox cal d,the supreme court disagreed with this limited interpretation of the act after reviewing the common law origin,the legislative history and the past judicial interpretations of the act and its statutory predecessors,our court unanimously concluded in cox that the identification of particular bases of,race,religion,ancestry,and national origin is illustrative rather than restrictive.citation.although the legislation has been invoked primarily by persons alleging discrimination on racial grounds,its language and its history compel the conclusion that the legislature intended to prohibit all arbitrary discrimination by business establishments.marina point,at.i
