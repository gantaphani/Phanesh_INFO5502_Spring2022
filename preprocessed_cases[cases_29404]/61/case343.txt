aundra anderson appeals several district court rulings in this action brought pursuant to and oklahoma state tort law.she had sued kimberly lohman,a reporter from local television station koco,and the company that owns and operates koco television,hereinafter the media defendants,along with officer don blake of the norman police department.anderson appeals the district court order partially granting the media defendants motion to dismiss by dismissing her federal right to privacy and state intrusion upon seclusion claims,and the district court order granting the media defendants motion for summary judgment on her publication of private facts claim.she contends the district court erred in concluding that the media defendants were not state actors,and in concluding that her allegations and proffered evidence failed to support her state law tort claims against them.additionally,she challenges the district court denial of leave to amend her complaint to add claims against the media defendants for promissory estoppel and tortious or malicious interference with a contract.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to and affirm.
anderson alleges that she was raped by her estranged husband while she was unconscious.anderson did not know of the rape until june,when she found a videotape of the incident.anderson gave the videotape to officer blake and agreed to press charges after blake promised that the videotape would be kept confidential and would be used only for law enforcement purposes.anderson alleges that blake told her that the only people who would see the tape would be himself,his partner,a judge,and a jury.
before any charges had been filed in anderson case,blake gave an interview to lohman about anderson allegations.by this time,anderson husband had already been arrested on other sexual assault charges involving other alleged victims.blake showed lohman the videotape,and lohman asked if she could record it to obtain a head shot of the alleged perpetrator.aplt.app.at.blake contends that he agreed to allow lohman to record and display the videotape contents on the air,so long as the broadcast was limited to a view of the perpetrator face and was tasteful.id.at.lohman promised blake she would only use a view of the perpetrator face in her report.
anderson alleges that,before the news segment aired,blake contacted her by telephone and said that he wanted her to speak with lohman.anderson replied that she did not want to talk to the press,but blake put lohman on the telephone anyway.anderson refused to answer most of lohman questions.during their conversation,lohman told anderson that she had viewed the videotape.anderson alleges that she never authorized lohman to view or use the videotape in any way.during the newscast of july,koco aired lohman story about anderson allegations,including excerpts from the videotape.
several days after the broadcast,charges were filed against anderson husband for crimes committed against anderson.after the july koco broadcast,anderson refused to cooperate with the district attorney office,and the charges involving anderson were eventually dropped.anderson then filed this action against blake and the media defendants.anderson alleged that all of the defendants had violated her federal constitutional right to privacy in the videotape.she also asserted that the media defendants had invaded her privacy rights under oklahoma tort law 
the district court denied blake motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity,which we affirmed.see anderson blake,cir as for the claims against the media defendants,the district court granted their motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b as to anderson right to privacy and intrusion upon seclusion claims,but denied their motion to dismiss as to anderson publication of private facts claim.subsequently,the district court granted the media defendants summary judgment on anderson publication of private facts claim.the district court also denied anderson request to amend her complaint to add claims against the media defendants for promissory estoppel and tortious or malicious interference with a contract.after the district court certified its summary judgment order as a final judgment under rule b anderson filed the instant appeal.anderson contends that the district court erred by dismissing her right to privacy and intrusion upon seclusion claims against the media defendants,by granting the media defendants motion for summary judgment on her publication of private facts claim asserted against the media defendants,and by denying her motion to amend her complaint against them.
a.the media defendants motion to dismiss 
we first review the district court order partially granting the media defendants motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b as to anderson right to privacy and intrusion upon seclusion claims.we review the district court order de novo and apply the same standard as the district court.moore guthrie,cir.rule b provides for dismissal of a plaintiff claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted we accept as true all factual allegations and view them in the light most favorable to anderson,the nonmoving party.moore,at.we may uphold the grant of a motion to dismiss if,viewing the factual allegations in the complaint as true and in the light most favorable to the party,the complaint does not contain enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.macarthur san juan county,wl,at.lexis,at cir quoting bell atlantic twombly,d.as we have explained this new standard for reviewing a motion to dismiss,the mere metaphysical possibility that some plaintiff could prove some set of facts in support of the pleaded claims is insufficient the complaint must give the court reason to believe that this plaintiff has a reasonable likelihood of mustering factual support for these claims.ridge at red hawk,schneider,cir.
anderson federal right to privacy claim 
anderson challenges the district court dismissal of her right to privacy claim for failing to allege state action.to survive as a claim arising under the federal constitution and,anderson right to privacy claim must allege that the media defendants were state actors.scott hern,cir.the supreme court has explained that the state action doctrine requires that the constitutional deprivation be caused by the exercise of some right or privilege created by the state or by a rule of conduct imposed by the state or by a person for whom the state is responsible and that the party charged with the deprivation must be a person who may fairly be said to be a state actor.johnson rodrigues,cir quoting lugar edmondson oil,d.the supreme court has outlined four tests to determine whether private actors,such as the media defendants,should be considered state actors the public function test,the nexus test,the symbiotic relationship test and the joint action test.id.at.
anderson relies on the joint action test and contends she has satisfied the state action requirement by showing the media defendants acted jointly with blake,a state actor.private participants acting jointly with state actors can satisfy the state action requirement if the private party is a willful participant in joint action with the state or its agents.id.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.we examine whether state officials and private parties have acted in concert in effecting a particular deprivation of constitutional rights.id.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.anderson argues that the facts alleged in her complaint evince such concerted action by claiming that the media defendants and blake agreed to misuse blake authority to obtain access to and ultimately air the confidential videotape.
anderson allegations are inadequate to support her claim that the media defendants acted jointly with blake to violate anderson right to privacy by airing a confidential videotape.anderson does not allege that the media defendants knew about the confidentiality agreement between anderson and blake protecting the videotape contents from disclosure.while anderson asks us to infer such knowledge,she provides no basis for such an inference.further,anderson complaint fails to allege facts demonstrating a shared purpose by blake and the media defendants to violate anderson constitutional rights.at most,the complaint alleges that the parties had their own,separate goals blake wanted to appear on camera,and the media defendants wanted exclusive access to the investigation.see.at.indeed,the complaint specifically disavows a shared law enforcement purpose.id.at.
anderson also argues that the media defendants became state actors because they agreed with blake to receive the leaked portions of the videotape and to air them on the nightly news.without more,a reporter does not become a state actor,however,simply because she has received and published information from a governmental official,as the media defendants did here.phelps wichita,cir.although anderson points to the fact that blake gave the media defendants exclusive access to the information,this fact only explains how widely blake disseminated the does not demonstrate concerted action between blake and the media defendants.in addition,a prior with police officers in which koco employees participated concerned a different case and did not involve any joint action that could potentially violate anderson constitutional rights.finally,anderson alleges that koco,not blake or any other state actor,retained editorial control over the use of the,she asserts that the media defendants aired more of the videotape than blake had wanted.
blake telephone call to anderson,on lohman behalf,to encourage her to speak with lohman displays a closer working relationship between blake and the media defendants than anderson other allegations.while this fact may show that blake and the media defendants acted jointly to secure anderson cooperation for an interview,it does not show joint action to violate anderson constitutional rights by airing sexually explicit portions of a videotape.in fact,anderson complaint alleges that blake had already permitted the viewing and taping of the videotape by the media defendants prior to the telephone interview because lohman told anderson that she had seen the entire video tape.at.
anderson also cites to berger hanlon,cir,vacated and remanded by,d,judgment reinstated by cir,as authority in support of her joint action argument.in that case,the cable news network cnn filmed federal agents as they executed a search warrant of a montana ranch.id.at.when the rancher sued the cnn team for violating his constitutional rights,the ninth circuit concluded that the members of the cnn team participating in the search were state actors.id.at.anderson argues that berger is support for reaching a similar result in her case because one fact that led the ninth circuit to its conclusion was that the federal entities shared confidential information with the media.id.at.
while the sharing of confidential information makes berger and the instant case superficially similar,berger facts suggested a much greater degree of cooperation between government officials and reporters than is present in anderson case.the federal agents in berger planned and executed the search in a manner designed to enhance its entertainment,rather than its law enforcement value,by engaging in,for example,conversations with the rancher for the purpose of providing interesting soundbites,and to portray themselves as tough,yet caring investigators,rather than to further their investigation.id.by these actions,the federal agents became joint participants in shaping the content of cnn coverage,transforming the cnn team into state actors.the most that anderson alleges,however,is that blake allowed the media defendants to film the videotape contents so that the media defendants,not blake,could produce a head shot for the evening news.rather than support anderson argument that the media defendants became state actors for purposes of because blake and the media defendants acted in concert,berger highlights what is missing in this case facts alleging joint action between blake and the media defendants in airing the videotape.we therefore agree with the district court conclusion that anderson factual allegations regarding blake involvement in the ultimate publication of portions of the videotape by the media defendants were insufficient to treat the media defendants as state actors.
anderson intrusion upon seclusion claim 
turning briefly to the district court dismissal of anderson intrusion upon seclusion claim,anderson provides no support in her opening brief for her contention that the district court erred in dismissing this claim.see aplt.opening br.at.she cites cases which set forth the elements of an intrusion claim,but fails to tie those cases to the facts of her case.the only other reference to her intrusion claim is in her statement of the issues for review,where she states 
the district court erred in dismissing a state claim for intrusion into seclusion because release of the entire rape video to the koco defendants was an intentional intrusion into a private matter highly offensive to a reasonable person the violations of federal privacy and the state intrusion into seclusion were completed when blake released the video to the koco defendants.
id.at.these arguments are not only untethered to any legal citation,but also are too conclusory to permit judicial review.see am.airlines christensen,cir it is insufficient merely to state in one brief that one is appealing an adverse ruling below without advancing reasoned argument as to the grounds for the appeal.citing fed.a.we therefore decline to address any claimed issue involving the district court dismissal of anderson intrusion upon seclusion claim.
b.the media defendants motion for summary judgment 
we next turn to the district court grant of summary judgment for the media defendants on anderson publication of private facts claim.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo under the same standard that the district court applied.camuglia city of albuquerque,cir.ordinarily,the district court must view the record in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment and should grant summary judgment only when there is no genuine dispute over a material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
anderson argues that the district court incorrectly granted the media defendants summary judgment on her publication of private facts claim.anderson alleges in her publication of private facts claim that the media defendants tortiously published private facts about her when they aired the videotape.we agree with the district court that anderson failed to create a genuine issue of material fact as to this claim because the material published was substantially related to a matter of legitimate public concern.
oklahoma has adopted the restatement of torts definition of publication of private facts 
one who gives publicity to a matter concerning the private life of another is subject to liability to the other for invasion of his privacy,if the matter publicized is of a kind that 
a would be highly offensive to a reasonable person,and 
b is not of legitimate concern to the public.
restatement second of torts mccormack.publ.the requirement that the published private facts not be of legitimate public concern is both an element of the common law tort and a constitutional limitation imposed by the first amendment.see gilbert med.econ,cir restatement second of torts cmt.d see also alvarado,cir however,we observe that state law now defines torts involving publication to take into account first amendment restrictions announced by the supreme court.this limitation on the tort protects the right of the press to disseminate newsworthy information to the public.gilbert,at.a matter can be of legitimate public concern even though it concerns private individuals,like anderson,who have not sought publicity or consented to it,but through their own conduct or otherwise have become a legitimate subject of public interest.id.quoting restatement second of torts cmt.f.but there are limits as well to what matters are of legitimate public concern.in gilber
