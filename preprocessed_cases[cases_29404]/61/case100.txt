grace entered into an arrangement with sygma in early whereby sygma would act as his agent in the licensing of his photographs and grace would receive of the net sales.id.at.grace was assured that he would receive a monthly statement along with a check for his share of the income and that sygma would promote grace and seek photographic assignments for him.id.at.there was no written agreement and no specific arrangement for the manner in which the photographs would be stored or returned to grace.sygma main office was in paris,france,but it also maintained a new york city office.id.grace photographic images were licensed out of both offices.id.
many of the photographic images shot by grace on assignment for time,newsweek,and other magazines and newspapers eventually were released to sygma,which licensed and distributed them on behalf of grace.over the years,sygma returned various photographs to grace as requested.included among the photographic images held by sygma were images not selected for use with stories for which they were commissioned.id.at.as licensor,sygma provided a standard consignment form to its customers when licensing photographs.id.at.the form provided for a liquidated sum of for a lost image or transparency,but those fees often were negotiated or waived when a loss actually occurred.id.at.
sygma had no adequate means of tracking the inventory of images entrusted to it by any of the photographers it represented.apparently,sygma never had a system to keep track of its new york inventory and,starting in,only a limited means of tracking its paris inventory.id.when corbis corporation purchased sygma in,it acquired the licensing rights for some forty million images,including those owned by grace.id.no complete inventory existed of the images retained in sygma archives.id.the sygma images were stored with other images,whose licensing rights also were acquired by corbis corporation,and filled three large rooms of file cabinets.id.in a letter dated may,grace notified sygma by then known as that he was terminating sygma as his representative.id.at.the letter included the following 
i expect all of my images that are now in files to be returned to me no later than june.this includes all images from may to the present that have been archived in both new york and paris as originals or dup licates.
sygma made sporadic returns of grace images beginning in the fall of.id.the returns continued up to the time of trial.id.the fact that the photographs were disorganized and kept in a haphazard fashion made it impossible for sygma to account for all of the thousands of photographs spanning a period of thirty years.id.sygma found some of the images by referring to a list of stories relating to photographs for which royalties were paid and matching the photographs to the stories.id.despite all efforts,sygma simply was unable to account for and return a great number of the photographs grace had entrusted to it as his agent and representative.during the trial,grace claimed that of his images were missing.id.at.the district court found that as of december,sygma had returned original images to grace,id.at,and the parties do not dispute this figure.
the district court determined that grace entrustment of his photographs to sygma for licensing purposes as his agent was a mutual benefit bailment,that the bailment ended when grace terminated the relationship in may,and that sygma is presumed to have been negligent in failing to return the missing images.id.at.accordingly,the district court concluded as follows defendants have not provided a sufficient explanation for the loss,and,indeed,the record shows that sygma system of keeping track of images was completely inadequate.hence,defendants are liable.id.sygma,having filed no cross appeal,does not disagree with these determinations nor with the damages fixed by the district court.
in evaluating grace loss,the district court observed that grace burden to prove his damages with reasonable certainty was impacted by sygma wrongdoing.id.citing raishevich foster,d.the court recognized that the uniqueness and earning potential of the photographic images are essential components in the evaluation of damages.see id.identifying the number of images as the threshold question,the district court noted the difficulty in resolving this issue occasioned by the essentially and stated as follows 
i conclude,however,that the number of missing images is substantially below,the number claimed by grace,and that,more likely than not,the number is about.i reach these conclusions because some of grace estimates are high for example,there was some inadvertent some images were undoubtedly returned to grace over the course of the thirty years and some of the images were not given to sygma in the first place in any event,in light of my rulings below on damages,a precise number is not necessary.
id.at internal citations omitted.on appeal,grace asserts that,even assuming as accurate the district court discounts for double counting,returned images,and images not given to sygma in the first place,the number of images missing would be.sygma advances an even higher.sygma claims,however,that this figure could be reduced to reflect the several categories of images for which,while there are no exact numbers,one can reasonably be sure grace numbers did not account.br.at.grace also contests the district court assertion that a precise number is not necessary,arguing that the c ourt failure to accurately calculate the number of lost images directly resulted in a corresponding reduction in damages.appellant br.at.
as to the uniqueness element essential to the valuation process,the district court concluded that,although grace had a unique eye and was one of the top photojournalists of his time,the vast majority of his images were not unique.id.at.the district court reasoned that most of the lost images were photographs of news events covered by other photographers,that many were or unusable,and that only a small percentage of any collection of photographs is placed into the licensing stream.id.the court noted that zuma,grace present agent,had selected only to of his available images for licensing.id.
reviewing grace earning potential as a prelude to its ultimate assessment of damages,the district court found that grace earned an average of per year from all of his images licensed by sygma during the period,and per year for the period,with the income from celebrity photos omitted.id.as a measure of future income,however,the district court characterized these averages as high because they included revenue from images that have been returned and that remained available for licensing,as well as low because,in later years especially,income more likely was reduced because the lost images were not available for licensing.id.in evaluating grace earning potential,the district court indicated that it took into consideration grace outstanding reputation and experience the fact that he had spent little time in the past fifteen years in photojournalism the declining income stream as the stories behind the images passed into history the possibility that interest in past events could be triggered by current events and the significant competition between grace images and those of many other successful photojournalists.id.at.
according to the district court,the sales of various collections of images in their entirety also entered into its final determination of sales of the bettmann collection for million per image the turnley collection for million per image and the entire sygma collection to corbis for million per image.id.at.the district court noted that these figures were relevant,but the collections are different,and,unlike here,the transactions involved willing buyers and willing sellers.grace did not want to sell his images.id.
the district court considered and rejected the industry liquidated damages standard of per lost transparency delivered on consignment,observing that some courts had used this standard in cases involving unique,superior,and irreplaceable images.the court found that the standard of would lead to an absurd result in this case,since not all the lost images were unique and irreplaceable and the recovery for the images ultimately found missing by the district court would be million.the district court stated that w hat a client was willing to stipulate to as compensation in the event of the loss of an image when receiving a few selects on consignment to review under the pressure of a deadline is not relevant to a situation involving images.id.
proceeding to review grace other theories of valuation,the district court rejected the testimony of grace expert,who ranked the images into three categories of values of,and each.the court observed that the expert never looked at the licensing revenue that grace photographs actually earned,which clearly is a relevant consideration,id.at,and characterized his testimony as evasive,and nonsensical.id.the district court found unreasonable grace theory that of the images assuming images missing were super selects with a value of each were selects valued at each and the remaining had a value of each.also rejected as unreasonable was the proposal that of the images claimed to be missing be valued at each.as to both these last theories,the court noted that the interest earned on the resulting sums would be more than ten times what grace was earning a year,on average,from the licensing of all his images.id.
setting forth the rationale for the award it ultimately made,the district court 
conclude d that defendants proposal of looking at grace licensing income is reasonable,but only as a starting point.at a minimum,grace should be compensated for what he would have earned if the missing images had been available for licensing in the past and if they were available for licensing in the future.but he should be awarded something more,for the loss of the licensing income is only part of his damages.the images have a value beyond just the licensing no longer has these images to view or hold or enjoy or otherwise do with as he wishes.
t aking into account the foregoing rationales,the district court awarded grace total damages in the sum of in accordance with the following 
first,he is awarded a year for years,or to account for lost licensing income from july,when his images should have been returned,to date.
second,he is awarded an additional for the loss of the images,based on a value of per image for images i conclude ten percent are selects and an image for the remaining images.
id.although the district court awarded costs,it explained that interest was included in the total damages award and that n o additional award is allowed for claims for holding fees or improper deductions or any other expenses or damages.id.
discussion 
on this appeal from a judgment entered after a bench trial,we are constrained to review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.see mobil shipping transp.wonsild liquid carriers,cir.we also are constrained to accord de novo review in examining whether the correct legal standard was applied by the district court.see lopresti terwilliger,cir.since sygma does not contest its liability as bailee for the negligent loss of photographic images belonging to grace,we are confronted here only with grace challenge to the methodology employed by the district court in arriving at its award of damages and his consequent objection to the adequacy of the award.in assessing damages,we are guided by the general rule that t he measure of a bailee liability to the bailor for wrongful loss of the goods is their reasonable value at the time of such loss.bailments.
we have stated the new york rule applicable here governing the valuation of lost photographic images as follows 
t he value of lost slides depends primarily on their uniqueness and the plaintiff earning potential.lowit consolidated edison,accord blackman michael friedman publ g group,the proper standard is a consideration of uniqueness of the transparencies and plaintiff earning potential.see also gasperini,cir new york courts consider the uniqueness of the transparencies and the earning level of the photographer nierenberg wursteria,uniqueness of subject matter of the slides and the earning level of the photographer alen macweeney,esquire,same.
gasperini ctr.for humanities,cir.
in gasperini,we upheld the district court determination that the jury ability to distinguish slides that were of superior quality,unique,and irreplaceable from those that were readily replaceable and available from other sources enabled it to assign reasonable values to the lost images accordingly.id.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.the case before us is different from gasperini and somewhat unusual in that an enormous number of images is missing,the parties are unable to agree on the number of images lost,and the incompleteness of the records available makes it impossible to identify all the images in the unique category.the difficulty in computing damages under these circumstances is apparent.however,in cases such as this,in which the defendant wrongdoing prevented the plaintiff from demonstrating the exact measure of the damages suffered,the factfinder may make a just and reasonable estimate of the damages caused.raishevich foster,cir quoting bigelow rko radio pictures.therefore,although grace had the burden of proof as to loss,he
