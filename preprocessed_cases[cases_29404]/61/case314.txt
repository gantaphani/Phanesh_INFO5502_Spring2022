chase jarvis is a professional photographer who created several thousand photographic slides over a period for,a maker of outdoor sporting goods.unfortunately,this relationship eventually soured.jarvis sued,alleging that it infringed his copyrights in his photographic images,lost many of the slides that he delivered and repeatedly failed to credit him when it used his images.the district court agreed that was liable under each of these theories and awarded damages to jarvis.however,the district court found that of jarvis in four collage advertisements that combined jarvis images with other images and not infringed because the ads were covered by the collective works privilege of c jarvis now appeals the district court damages awards and its ruling as to the collage ads privileged status.
we hold that the district court properly calculated damages.it employed reasonable estimates of the market value of the infringed images as well as the business lost by jarvis because of the lost images and failures to credit him.we do not agree with the district court,however,that the images in the collage ads were privileged under c.the collage ads were derivative rather than collective works because they transformed jarvis original images into new promotional posters the collective works privilege therefore did not apply to the ads,and their online display after term of use had expired infringed jarvis copyrights in the underlying images.accordingly,we reverse the district court ruling as to c and remand for determinations of willfulness,actual and statutory damages and attorney fees with respect to the collage ads.
background 
factual history 
jarvis is a professional photographer who specializes in outdoor sports images.is a corporation that sells outdoor sporting goods such as skis,snowboards,skates and bikes.jarvis and entered into five separate agreements from to,pursuant to which jarvis took photographs for and sent it the resulting slides in exchange for compensation.each delivery of slides was accompanied by a delivery memorandum that,among other things,stated that l oss or damage of any image will result in a fee per image,as set forth by industry standards.
three of the five agreements between jarvis and were oral.of greater relevance here,two agreements were written by jarvis and entered into,respectively,on october,agreement and december,agreement.both of these agreements authorized to publish images provided by jarvis in brochures,print advertisements,trade show display booths,posters,and electronically for the web so as to market its business.all uses of jarvis images had to include an attribution credit.photo use rights in the agreement images were to extend through the ski year or one year from the images delivery date,while its rights in the agreement images were to last for the ski season,ending in may.there was an integration clause in both agreements stating,this agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties as to the subject matter hereto.jarvis delivered slides to and received under the agreement,and delivered slides and received under the agreement.
in total,jarvis provided slides to,the vast majority of them pursuant to the and agreements.lost of these slides and hence was unable to return them to jarvis.also failed to provide a photo credit to jarvis in images that it used,and miscredited one of his images to another photographer.finally,of jarvis images were used by after the underlying licenses had expired or by third parties to whom had improperly provided the images.of the images were incorporated into four collage advertisements that were initially published as magazine inserts during the time period the agreement authorized to use the images.the ads combined edited versions of jarvis images with other images,marketing graphics and promotional slogans.after the contractual term limit for using jarvis images had expired,scanned the collage ads and displayed them on its website.
procedural history 
jarvis filed his action against in june.the district court granted partial summary judgment against on jarvis copyright infringement,breach of contract and conversion claims in september.the court later bifurcated jarvis claims,ordering the lanham act and damages issues to proceed to trial but staying the vicarious copyright infringement,breach of contract and conversion claims.upon conclusion of a bench trial in march,the court entered comprehensive findings of fact and conclusions of law.although the court ruled in jarvis favor in many respects and awarded him damages,jarvis takes issue with the court ruling as to the collective works privilege as well as its determination of damages.
the district court award of damages for the unreturned slides totaled each for the unidentified slides and for one slide identified as having been created for bike.damages for the failures to credit and one miscredit totaled,based on a rate of per failure for online use,per failure for print ads and per failure for media use.and damages for infringements of jarvis copyrights totaled,based largely on a fair market value of each for images used online 
the district court damages awards were premised on several legal and factual determinations,two of which are particularly relevant here.first,the court found that the and agreements were fully integrated contracts,and that jarvis delivery memos specifying a liquidated damages amount for lost or damaged slides were simply proposed contract modifications that never accepted.second,the court ruled that collage contained images that would otherwise have infringed jarvis collective works and thus were privileged under c.according to the court,the time limits for usage specified in the agreements did not obviate the rights conferred by c,and the transfer of the ads from print to electronic form did not transform them into unprotected new works.importantly,by finding the ads privileged under c,the court negated the effect of jarvis registration of his copyrights in some of the images in the collage ads before alleged infringement.otherwise,jarvis could have elected statutory damages and potentially received attorney fees for those infringements.
judgment was entered in may,and jarvis timely appealed.
ii.standard of review 
the district court findings of fact are reviewed for clear error whereas its conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.see zivkovic cal.edison,cir.actual damages awards are reviewed for clear error.see frank music,cir.whether a contract is integrated is a factual determination that we review for substantial error.see sierra diesel injection,burroughs,cir.
iii.discussion 
a.the collage advertisements 
jarvis contends that the agreement,which applied to all the images in the collage ads,did not permit the images use by in any capacity after may.he also argues that the district court erred in ruling that collage ads were collective works protected by c and hence not infringements of jarvis copyrights.we agree with jarvis on both counts,because the agreement explicitly limited the term of use of jarvis images and because the collage ads were derivative works not protected by c.we do not reach jarvis other arguments for why the collective works privilege did not apply to the collage ads,namely that the ads were publicly displayed when they were posted on website,that the ads were new works rather than revisions of the original magazine inserts and that c had been circumvented by the agreement.accordingly,we reverse the district court ruling that the collage ads were privileged collective works and remand for determinations of willfulness,statutory and actual damages and attorney fees.
the agreement term limit on use 
the agreement authorized to publish jarvis images in media including brochures,print advertisements posters,and electronically for the web so as to market its business.therefore acted within its rights when it first created the collage ads and published them in the form of magazine inserts.also would not have breached the agreement had it scanned the ads and placed them online during the time period authorized by the contract.these uses were or would have been examples of the publi cation in posters and electronically for the web contemplated by the agreement.
however,the agreement also contained language that explicitly limited the time period during which could use jarvis images.the usage section of the contract specified that rights were for,ending may.analogously,the term section stated that photo usage rights apply for the ski season,ending in may.this language plainly barred any use by of jarvis images after may.the usage term appeared twice in the contract,indicating its significance to the parties and rebutting any claim of inadequate notice.moreover,the first statement of the term limit came directly after photo use rights were described,while the second statement was located in a section labeled term and referred specifically to photo usage rights.given the agreement phrasing and structure,we conclude that the parties agreed that would not use jarvis images in any capacity after may.melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright b hereinafter nimmer on copyright i f consent to use the underlying material is limited in time,then the owner of the derivative work may not exploit the underlying material beyond the time limit.notably fails to argue to the contrary,thus apparently conceding that its scanning and online display of the collage ads after may were not authorized by the agreement.
derivative versus collective works 
rather than claim that its use of the collage ads was permitted by the agreement itself,relies on the collective works privilege of c.in relevant part,c provides that,i n the absence of an express transfer of the copyright or of any rights under it,the owner of copyright in the collective work is presumed to have acquired only the privilege of reproducing and distributing the contribution as part of that particular collective work,any revision of that collective work,and any later collective work in the same series.the district court the collage ads were collective works and that even though the agreement usage term had expired,scanning and online display of the ads were permissible uses under c.we disagree,because the ads were not collective works and thus not eligible for protection under c 
by its own terms,c protects only collective works.t he owner of copyright in the collective work is presumed to have acquired certain rights.id.emphasis added see also,at,as reprinted in,hereinafter house report referencing within section on c the definition of collective work in and stating that c deals with the troublesome problem of ownership of copyright in contributions to collective works.collective and derivative works are both defined in 
a collective work is a work,such as a periodical issue,anthology,or encyclopedia,in which a number of contributions,constituting separate and independent works in themselves,are assembled into a collective whole.
a derivative work is a work based upon one or more preexisting works,such as a translation,musical arrangement art reproduction,abridgement,condensation,or any other form in which a work may be recast,transformed,or adapted.a work consisting of editorial revisions,annotations,elaborations,or other modifications which,as a whole,represent an original work of authorship,is a derivative work.
id.emphasis added see also id.defining a compilation,of which collective works are a subcategory,as a work formed by the collection and assembling of preexisting materials that are selected,coordinated,or arranged in such a way that the resulting work as a whole constitutes an original work of authorship house report at t here is a basic distinction between a joint work by multiple authors,where the separate elements merge into a unified whole,and a collective work,where they remain unintegrated and disparate.emphasis added nimmer on copyright t he originality called for in a collective work consists of the collection and assembling of works,while derivative work originality lies in the manner in which a work is transformed.
under these statutory definitions,somewhat clarified by the legislative history,the collage ads were derivative rather than collective works.in accordance with his usual practice,jarvis delivered all of his images to in the form of identical square slides.the collage ads did not merely compile these slides as an album might,or as jarvis own website does.see chase jarvis portfolio.to the contrary,the ads shrank,expanded,distorted,overlaid and otherwise edited the original images,while also combining them with photos taken by other photographers,additional graphics,the logo and marketing slogans.in the ad,for example,jarvis six photos are of all different shapes and sizes,one of them has a drawing of a falling skier superimposed,there are at least six photos not taken by jarvis in the arrangement and logo and the slogan are you listening are prominently displayed.similarly,in the ad,seven of jarvis photos are arranged in trapezoidal wooden frames of different sizes along with more than a dozen other photos,and the words factory team forty years in the making appear in the upper section of the ad.the two remaining collage ads,and,are strikingly similar,respectively,to the and ads the ad is largely a vertically aligned version of the ad while the ad is largely a version of the ad.see appendix 
the changes to which subjected jarvis images are examples of the recast ing,transform ing,or adapt ing and editorial revisions,annotations,elaborations,or other modifications that define derivative works.see.jarvis delivered the images to in one form,and they were subsequently used in the collage ads in a quite different though still recognizable form.the ads did not simply compile or collect jarvis images,but rather altered them in various ways and fused them with other images and artistic elements into new works that were based,derivative original images.these circumstances are somewhat similar to mirage editions,albuquerque,cir,in which the appellant purchased art prints,encased them in a black plastic border,glued them onto ceramic tiles and then sold the resulting products.we held that b y borrowing and mounting the preexisting,copyrighted individual art images appellant has prepared a derivative work and infringed the subject copyrights.id.at.even more analogous is greenberg geographic soc y,cir,in which the national geographical society animated sequence of magazine cover images repositioned greenberg photograph from a horizontal representation of the diver into a vertical presentation of that diver.id.at.according to the court,m anifestly,this arrangement of preexisting copyrighted photographs constitutes with reference to the greenberg photograph,a derivative work.id.
fails to offer any case law in support of its position that the collage ads were collective works.it does argue that the collage ads in no way transformed or altered jarvis preexisting photographs.however,even a cursory look at the transformed or altered jarvis photographs in a variety of the weakness of this claim.counsel for also emphasized during oral argument that the collage ads that appeared on website were identical to the original magazine inserts.but this fact is irrelevant to our inquiry into the ads nature.a derivative work remains derivative when it is scanned and placed online,just as a collective work would remain collective if it were transferred from one medium to another.
we thus hold that the four collage ads were all derivative rather than collective works.accordingly,when scanned and placed the ads online after the usage period specified in the agreement had terminated,the collective works privilege did not rescue them from infringement 
our holding as to the inapplicability of c means that infringed jarvis copyrights in the images of his that were contained in the four collage ads.this increases the total number of images that infringed from to.we remand to the district court to determine what damages are appropriate for the additional instances of copyright infringement.we also note that,unlike the other infringed images,some of the images in the collage ads appear to have been registered by jarvis before their infringement by commenced.jarvis may be entitled to statutory damages and attorney fees under,c for these images,and he may attempt to show that infringement was willful under c.
on remand,the district court should determine which of the images in the collage ads jarvis registered and when he did so.the court should consider jarvis argument,which we do not address here,that he registered all of the images rather than the the court originally designated.the court should then determine which of the images were registered before their infringement commenced,and address the issues of attorney fees and statutory damages for those images assuming jarvis elects that option and actual damages for the remainder of the images.finally,the court should determine whether willfully infringed any of the images whose infringement began after their registration.
jarvis argues that all of the district court damages calculations were flawed.we disagree and uphold the damages that the court awarded to jarvis because of copyright infringements,losses of images and failures to credit jarvis.all three of these awards were based on reasonable estimates of loss and thus were not clearly erroneous.
copyright infringement 
the district court awarded jarvis in actual damages for the images whose copyrights infringed.this figure was based largely on a fair market value estimate of each for images used online,half the average market value of the images used in print.jarvis complains that in coming up with its damages award,the court erroneously relied on rather than rates and annual rather than monthly prices for use 
actual damages for copyright infringement are governed by b,which states that t he copyright owner is entitled to recover the actual damages suffered by him or her as a result of the infringement,but does not elaborate on how the damages are to be calculated.we have held that in situations where the infringer could have bargained with the copyright owner to purchase the right to use the work,actual damages are what a willing buyer would have been reasonably required to pay to a willing seller for plaintiffs work.frank music,at quoting sid marty krofft television,mcdonald,cir.excessively speculative claims of damages are to be rejected,id.at,and the market value approach is an objective,not a subjective,analysis,mackie rieser,cir see also on davis v.the gap,cir the question is not what the owner would have charged,but rather what is the fair market value.
jarvis actual damages argument fails because the district court properly based its calculations on objective considerations of market value.the court findings show that it examined at least six estimates of the fair market value of jarvis infringed images the testimony of jarvis expert witness richard weisgrau that,assuming monthly rates,jarvis images were worth to each the testimony of a senior executive that he would pay for an image to be used online and for a glossy image for a print advertisement or magazine cover jarvis compensation of for the images he delivered to under the agreement jarvis compensation of for the images he delivered to under the agreement jarvis compensation of for seven images he delivered to in and jarvis settlement offer of for all images infringed by.although these estimates informed the district court calculations,it ultimately cited jarvis own damages figures for images used in print and then halved the average of these figures to determine the damages per online use.the court based its halving on its finding that the fair market value of an online use is less than the average fair market value of a print use.this methodology produced a damages figure of per online use,a figure below weisgrau estimate but well within the range of the other five estimates.
we believe that the district court calculations were entirely consistent with b and the case law.the court inquiry was objective,avoiding references to what jarvis thought he should have earned or wished he had charged.the court also examined the financial perspectives of both the willing buyer in the form of evidence about what typically pays for images and what it specifically paid jarvis in its prior dealings with him and the willing seller in the form of jarvis earlier deals with and his revenue from image databanks at the hypothetical time of sale furthermore,the court gave logical reasons why it discounted weisgrau testimony according to the court,he relied almost exclusively on the getty website for his figures and unrealistically used a monthly licensing fee as the basis for his valuations.finally,the figure the court adopted was near the center of the range supported by the evidence.duckett godinez,cir where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.quoting anderson bessemer city,d.
jarvis argues,in essence,that it was clear error for the district court not to adopt weisgrau assumptions of fees paid monthly.but,as the court found,monthly prices are not particularly relevant since the annual price is only about twice as high any reasonable business person and particularly a company that updates its web content only once a year would pay to license the image s on a yearly basis rather than a monthly basis.jarvis policy argument about deterring infringers by charging them the higher price is also unsupported by the statutory text or by the case law emphasis on fair market value at the time of the infringement.making the plaintiff whole is plainly different from punishing the infringer by charging the highest possible rate for the infringement.see stehrenberger reynolds tobacco holdings,d,criticizing effort to inflate actual damages and stating that the effort represents concepts of punishment for infringement,deterrence of similar behavior in the future,and recompense for the costs and effort of litigation that form no part of actual damages under the statute.
the versus issue is more difficult,but we need not resolve it here for two reasons.first,the district court did not clearly embrace pricing in its decision.the district court did opine that such pricing is more appropriate for assessing online uses of images,but the court actual methodology was to consider the various estimates of the images worth,to accept jarvis figures for the fair market value of the print uses and then to halve these figures in order to calculate damages for the online uses.the court did not cite any evidence about prices,let alone use such evidence in its own calculations.second,the court figure for online uses was consistent with both and pricing.weisgrau testified that licenses for jarvis images cost to on the open market,and the nine licenses that jarvis actually sold for online use had prices ranging from to.
we therefore hold that the district court actual damages award for copyright infringement was not clearly erroneous.however,we take no position on whether or pricing is the appropriate method for determining actual damages in this and other similar cases,and we do not approve any implied endorsement of pricing by the district court.
unreturned images 
jarvis also challenges the district court damages award for the images that failed to return to him.this award was based on a loss estimate for each of the unidentified slides and a loss estimate for one slide that was the subject of correspondence between jarvis and a bike employee.jarvis argues that the and agreements were only partially integrated,not,as the district court found,fully integrated.as a result,jarvis contends that the provision in his delivery memos stating that must reimburse him for each lost slide is contractually binding on.
whether a contract is integrated is a factual question reviewable for substantial error.see sierra diesel injection,at.the trial court must hear all relevant,extrinsic evidence,oral or written,and determine whether the parties intended the contract to be the final and complete expression of the parties agreement.emrich connell.if a contract is fully integrated,it may be modified only by a writing signed by both parties.
here the district court specifically found that the and agreements were fully integrat
