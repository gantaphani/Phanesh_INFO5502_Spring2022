introduction 
prison legal news pln appeals the partial grant of summary judgment to the executive office for united states attorneys eousa exempting from mandatory disclosure under the freedom of information act foia video depicting the aftermath of a brutal prison murder and autopsy photographs of the victim.exercising jurisdiction under,this court dismisses as moot the portion of the appeal pertaining to records that have now been released by eousa,and affirms the district court order as to the remaining portions of the withheld records because the disclosure of the images in this case could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy of the victim family.b c.
ii.background 
in october,william sablan and rudy sablan,two prisoners at the united states penitentiary in florence,colorado,murdered their cellmate,joey jesus estrella.bureau of prisons bop personnel filmed the aftermath of estrella death.the first portion of the video depicts the interior of the shared cell and the sablans conduct inside the cell,including the mutilation of estrella body.the audio of the first portion contains both the sablans voices and prison officials voices.the second portion of the video depicts bop personnel extracting the sablans from the cell and does not contain any images of estrella body.bop personnel also took still autopsy photographs of estrella body.
the sablans were tried separately on first degree murder charges and the united states sought the death penalty in both cases.at each trial,the video,with audio,and autopsy photographs of estrella body were introduced as evidence and shown in open court to the jury and to the public audience.the exhibits were not sealed.both of the sablans were convicted and in each case a sentence of life in prison was imposed.at the completion of trial,the photographs and video were returned to the united states attorneys office pursuant to a standard order regarding the custody of exhibits.
pln is an organization that publishes a legal journal concerning prisoners rights issues.pln filed a request under foia for the videotape and autopsy photographs introduced as evidence at rudy sablan trial.eousa denied the foia request in full and the department of justice denied pln subsequent administrative appeal.thereafter,pln filed a complaint in district court alleging eousa withholding of the requested records under foia was improper.
the parties filed for summary judgment.eousa argued the autopsy photographs and video taken after estrella death were properly withheld under foia exemptions and c based on the privacy interests of estrella family.the district court granted in part and denied in part each party motion,ordering the release of the second portion of the video plus the audio of bop officials voices in the first portion of the video 
both parties filed notices of appeal,but eousa subsequently voluntarily dismissed its appeal.in conjunction with the dismissal,eousa released the second portion of the video,including the accompanying audio,and the audio track only of the first portion with four of the sablans statements deleted at oral argument,the parties agreed eousa had released more than the district court order required the materials eousa continues to withhold are now limited to the first portion of the video,four redactions of the audio accompanying the first portion of the video,and the autopsy photographs.pln appeal as to all other materials,which have now been released,is moot.see anderson dep t of health and human,cir noting that once requested records are released,foia claims as to those records are moot.
iii.discussion 
standard of review 
when the underlying facts of a foia case are undisputed and a district court has granted summary judgment in favor of a government agency,we review the district court legal conclusion that the requested records are exempt from disclosure de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.herrick garvey,cir.as part of this review,this court has conducted an in camera inspection of the requested records.
foia overview 
congress enacted foia to open agency action to the light of public scrutiny.dep t of air force rose,quotation omitted.to promote government accountability,disclosure,not secrecy,is the dominant objective of the act.id.recognizing,however,certain instances in which disclosure would harm legitimate interests,congress exempted from foia disclosure mandate nine categories of records.trentadue integrity,cir b.the government bears the burden of demonstrating the requested records fall within one of foia enumerated exemptions,which we construe narrowly in favor of disclosure.trentadue,at.
relevant here,exemption c allows an agency to withhold records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes,but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.b c.we therefore first determine whether there is a personal privacy interest at stake,and,if so,balance the privacy interests against the public interest in disclosure.see dep t of justice reporters comm.for freedom of the press.
autopsy photographs and video 
we consider the autopsy photographs and the images from the first portion of the video together.we agree with the district court that the same considerations apply to both sets of images,and the parties have briefed the issues as such.
the parties agree that the relevant privacy interests are the interests of estrella family the supreme court recently considered a privacy claim under foia concerning photographs of the body of vincent foster,deputy counsel to president clinton,at the scene of his death.favish,at.tracing the types of personal privacy interests protected under foia,the court held that exemption c recognizes family members right to personal privacy with respect to their close relative images.id.at.
eousa has identified members of estrella family whose interests are at stake.moreover,based on this court in camera review of the autopsy photographs and the first portion of the video at issue in this appeal,the records unquestionably reflect images.the photographs depict views of the injuries to estrella body and the first portion of the video prominently features estrella body on the floor of the prison cell.if anything,the privacy interest in these images is higher than the privacy interest in the photographs at issue in favish.the photographs in favish depicted the victim of an apparent suicide,see id.at,but the images did not involve grotesque and degrading depiction of corpse mutilation as do the images at issue here.additionally,the images in favish were all still photographs,whereas the video at issue here depicts corpse mutilation as it occurs.the privacy interest of the victim family in images of this nature is high.
pln argues,however,that in the circumstances of this case,estrella family has no privacy interest.pln first asserts that because estrella was a prisoner and the images were taken in a prison cell,estrella himself had no expectation of privacy and his family likewise can have none.second,pln contends that the use of the photographs and video at the sablans trial,combined with the family failure to object to the introduction of the evidence in open court,effectively constituted a waiver of the privacy interests at stake.finally,pln urges this court to require an evidentiary showing that estrella family objects to the release of these images or otherwise will be harmed.
any diminishment of estrella expectation of privacy as a result of his status as a prisoner does not bear on his family privacy interest in not having gruesome images of his body publicly disseminated.as the supreme court stated in favish,family members have a right to personal privacy to secure their own refuge from a culture for their own peace of mind and tranquility,not for the sake of the deceased.id.at.accordingly,contrary to pln contention that any privacy interest of estrella family is derivative of estrella own privacy interest,family members privacy interests under foia are independent interests.estrella status as a prisoner only has the potential to affect his own,and not his family,privacy interests.
estrella family did not waive their privacy interests in the video and photographs as a result of the government use of these materials at the sablans trials.the government can not waive individuals privacy interests under foia.see sherman dep t of army,cir holding the government prior disclosure of requested information could not waive individual privacy interests under exemption and collecting cases involving exemption c.as such,neither the government conduct in introducing the records nor its failure to have them admitted under seal is relevant to a waiver analysis.
the family failure to object at the time of trial is also not sufficient to waive their own privacy interests under foia.an individual can waive his privacy interests under foia when he affirmatively places information of a private nature into the public realm.for example,when ross perot made public statements concerning his offer to assist government agencies with certain law enforcement matters,he waived any privacy interest he had in his name appearing on records concerning those matters.nation magazine customs.in contrast,estrella family members did not take any affirmative actions to place the images in the public domain.
that the video and photographs were,at the time of the trials,displayed publicly,may impact the family expectation of privacy in those materials but does not negate it.in reporters committee,the supreme court held that even though criminal conviction information was publicly available in individual court records,individuals still maintained a privacy interest in compilations of such information that would otherwise be difficult to assemble.at.as the court explained,the fact that an event is not wholly private does not mean that an individual has no interest in limiting disclosure or dissemination of the information.id.at quotations omitted.reporters committee thus requires an examination whether,as a practical matter,the extent of prior public disclosure has eliminated any expectation in privacy.
here,the images are no longer available to the public they were displayed only twice once at each sablan trial only those physically present in the courtroom were able to view the images and the images were never reproduced for public consumption beyond those trials.although descriptive information about what the images contain may now be widely available,there is a distinct privacy interest in the images themselves.see times nasa,en banc recognizing the possibility of family privacy interest in an audiotape of space shuttle challenger astronauts voices just prior to their death even when transcript had already been publicly released,remanded to.concluding the audiotape was exempt from disclosure on that basis.a member of the public would have to go to even greater lengths to see the images at issue in this case than to access the individual criminal records considered difficult to compile in reporters committee.because of the limited nature of the prior public disclosure,we conclude estrella family retains a strong privacy interest in the images.
pln suggestions that the government was required to offer evidence of the family objection and that the district court improperly made findings regarding the particular harm the family would suffer are incorrect.exemption c covers records,the release of which could reasonably be expected to be an unwarranted invasion of privacy interests.b c.by its plain language,the test is an objective one and does not depend on the affected individuals statements of objection or their personal views of the harm they might suffer.likewise,the district court observation that release of the records could impede the family ability to mourn estrella death in private and achieve emotional closure is a proper statement of the general type of harm the supreme court recognized as implicating a legitimate privacy concern in favish.see at.
the determination of a privacy interest in the requested images does not end the exemption c inquiry.the privacy interest at stake must be weighed against the public interest in disclosure.only if disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy can the records properly be withheld under exemption c.see reporters,at.the supreme court has defined the relevant public interest narrowly,and we therefore consider only the public interest in obtaining information likely to contribute to its understanding of an agency performance of its duties.id.at.
here,pln argues the first portion of the video and the autopsy photographs will aid the public understanding of agency activities in two ways.first,it contends the records will shed light on the bop performance of its duty to protect prisoners from violence perpetrated by other prisoners,including its obligations to provide adequate conditions of confinement and to prevent prisoners from falling under the influence of alcohol and other prohibited substances.second,it argues that if the records are released,the public will better understand the prosecutor decision to seek the death penalty against the sablans,a decision significantly increasing the cost of prosecution.
while the bop protection of prisoners and the government discretionary use of taxpayer money may be matters of public interest,there is nothing to suggest the records would add anything new to the public understanding.see forest guardians fema,cir concluding release of requested records would not add to the public knowledge about the agency performance because the information was already available.the video does not begin until estrella has already been murdered and therefore does not depict any bop conduct prior to estrella death.the second portion of the video depicting bop personnel interacting with the sablans to extract them from the cell has now been released in full.all statements made by bop personnel in the first portion of the video have also been released in an audio file.at oral argument,the parties indicated that the length of time between the beginning of the video and the time bop personnel extracted the sablans from the cell is publicly known.thus,all aspects of the video documenting bop response to the situation have been fully disclosed.
pln argument that the video may shed light on the conditions of confinement also rings hollow,as the size of the cell and conditions therein are public knowledge because they were discussed in detail at trial and reported in the press.the sablans state of intoxication,about which pln also argues there is a public interest,has likewise been discussed in the media.to the extent their behavior in the video can add anything to the understanding of the sablans state of intoxication,that behavior can be observed in the second portion of the video,now released.
the same problem plagues pln argument that the public would benefit in understanding the prosecutor decision to seek the death penalty in the sablans trials.all of the information pln claims would shed light on the issue,including the heinous nature of the mutilation of estrella corpse,is already publicly known.the images at issue were viewed by members of the media at the sablan trials,and the media widely reported on the contents of the video and photographs.
pln argues that news media reporting on the video and photographs is not the same as the ability of the media to provide the video and photographic images to the public.nonetheless,to the extent any additional information can be gained by release of the actual images for replication and public dissemination,the public interest in that incremental addition of information over what is already known is outweighed by the estrella family strong privacy interests in this case.thus,any additional disclosure would be an unwarranted invasion of the family personal privacy.
redacted audio 
eousa also withheld from pln certain segments of the audio track accompanying the first portion of the video.those segments amount to four statements made by the sablans.pln argues no portion of the audio track is exempt and
