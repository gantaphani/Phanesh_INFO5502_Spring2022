public television a fixture of american life for decades has showcased masterpiece theater,pbs newshour,children programs such as sesame street and curious george,and many more audience favorites.the hallmark of public broadcasting has been a longstanding restriction on paid advertising to minimize commercialization.in a classic case of follow the money,congress recognized that advertising would change the character of public broadcast programming and undermine the intended distinction between commercial and noncommercial broadcasting.
public broadcast radio and television stations are regulated by federal statute.under,public stations are prohibited from transmitting paid advertisements for entities,issues of public importance or interest,and political candidates.these restrictions were adopted to minimize commercialization of public broadcast stations,also known as noncommercial educational nce stations because they are used primarily to serve the educational needs of the community for the advancement of educational programs and to furnish a nonprofit and noncommercial television broadcast service.
minority television project minority tv,a public television broadcaster,challenges the advertising restrictions as facially unconstitutional under the first amendment.applying intermediate scrutiny,as counseled by the supreme court in fcc league of women voters,we uphold the advertising ban as constitutional.we also affirm the district court dismissal of minority tv challenges to and its challenge to the related regulation,e.
background 
noncommercial educational stations 
for of a century,the federal communications commission fcc has set aside broadcasting channels for noncommercial educational stations.see,reserving channels for nce fm radio stations sixth report order,reserving channels for nce television stations see also a b authorizing the fcc to classify radio stations and p rescribe the nature of the service to be rendered by each class of licensed stations.the fcc explained that it was reserving a portion of the broadcast spectrum for nce television stations because of the important contributions which noncommercial educational television stations can make in educating the people both in school at all levels and also the adult public,and the high quality type of programming available on nce stations programming of an entirely different character from that available on most commercial stations.third notice of further proposed rulemaking.
from the start,the fcc recognized that allowing nce stations to operate in substantially the same manner as commercial applicants would not further its goal of ensuring high quality educational programming.at.initially,nce stations were prohibited from airing any promotional content even if it was unpaid and were only permitted to identify program underwriters by name.see.commission policy concerning the noncommercial nature of educational broadcast stations.
in response to concerns that this restriction was broader than necessary to achieve its purpose,the fcc embarked on an extensive notice and comment proceeding between and.see.at commission policy concerning the noncommercial nature of educational broadcast stations.the fcc undertook this effort with an eye toward striking a reasonable balance between the financial needs of such stations and their obligation to provide an essentially noncommercial broadcast service.at.in crafting new rules,the fcc noted that its interest in creating a noncommercial service has been to remove the programming decisions of public broadcasters from the normal kinds of commercial market pressures under which broadcasters in the unreserved spectrum usually operate.id.at.cognizant of first amendment concerns,the fcc stated that it was adopting the minimum regulatory structure that preserves a reasonable distinction between commercial and noncommercial broadcasting.id.at.at the end of lengthy deliberation,the fcc in set out a new,liberalized broadcast advertising framework.id.later that year,after two days of hearings congress essentially codified the fcc new framework in and 
section the heart of this case prohibits paid advertising,except for advertising for goods and services offered by organizations.an advertisement is defined as material transmitted in exchange for remuneration that is intended 
to promote any service,facility,or product offered by any person who is engaged in such offering for profit 
to express the views of any person with respect to any matter of public importance or interest or 
to support or oppose any candidate for political office.
a.section allows the airing of promotional content for which consideration is not received.section,which is not at issue here,permits the use of identifying information in donor acknowledgments for example,logograms and location information.this scheme has been the law for more than years.
ii.minority tv proceedings 
minority tv is the licensee of a noncommercial educational television station in san francisco subject to the advertising restrictions in and e.after another broadcaster complained to the fcc about minority tv underwriting announcements,the fcc commenced a proceeding against minority tv.the fcc enforcement bureau found that minority tv had broadcast announcements that violated and e more than times,and issued a notice of apparent liability for forfeiture in the amount of.fcc rcd.minority tv announcements were in exchange for consideration and on behalf of corporations such as chevrolet,ford,and korean airlines.id.the fcc found that the advertisements included improper promotional language.id.the fcc rejected nearly all of minority tv challenges and issued a forfeiture order for.fcc rcd.the fcc denied minority tv application for review and petition for reconsideration.fcc rcd.fcc rcd.
minority tv then filed in this court a petition for review of the fcc orders.after filing the petition,minority tv paid the forfeiture to the fcc in full.we transferred the case to district court 
the district court dismissed minority tv challenges to the notice and the forfeiture order,its challenges to,and its facial and challenges to e for lack of jurisdiction because the courts of appeals have exclusive jurisdiction to review fcc regulations and orders.a.the court explained that a,the allowing district courts to review forfeiture orders,applied only to unpaid forfeiture actions.a.

minority tv appealed.the panel upheld the ban on goods and services advertising.two members of the divided panel issued separate opinions striking down the statute ban on issue and political advertising.minority television project,fcc,cir.in dissent,judge paez determined that a and were neither patently overinclusive nor underinclusive,and that there were no less restrictive means to that were readily available.id.at paez,dissenting citation omitted.unlike the panel majority,judge paez found substantial record evidence to support narrow tailoring.id.at.in an unpublished memorandum disposition,the panel unanimously held that the district court correctly dismissed minority tv challenges to and its challenges to e,and that was not unconstitutionally vague a majority of nonrecused active judges voted in favor of rehearing en banc.cir.
facial intermediate scrutiny challenge to.framework for.intermediate scrutiny test for broadcast regulation 
the supreme court laid down the standard for evaluating the constitutionality of intermediate scrutiny in league of women voters.at.that case involved a first amendment challenge to a statutory provision forbidding all nce stations that received grants from the corporation for public broadcasting from engag ing in editorializing.id.at citing.the court declined to apply strict scrutiny even though the statute was and plainly operate d to restrict the expression of editorial opinion on matters of public importance a form of speech entitled to the most exacting degree of first amendment protection.id.at.it explained that,because broadcast regulation involves unique considerations,our cases have not followed precisely the same approach that we have applied to other media and have never gone so far as to demand that such regulations serve compelling governmental interests.id.at.
the court struck down the ban on editorialization because it was not sufficiently tailored to the harms it s ought to prevent to justify its substantial interference with broadcasters speech.id.at.in particular,the ban was manifest ly imprecis e both patent ly overinclusive and underinclusive.id.at.the government substantial interest in ensuring that viewers did not think broadcasters editorials reflected the views of the government could be fully satisfied by less restrictive means that were readily available.id.at.
like the statute at issue in league of women voters,is a broadcast regulation,and we may uphold the statute restrictions on advertising only if we are satisfied that they are narrowly tailored to further a substantial governmental interest.id.at.in addition,because subsections a and a burden public issue and political speech,we must be particularly wary in assessing the statute to determine whether it reflects an impermissible attempt to allow a government to control the search for political truth.id.at quoting consolidated edison public service comm of,alteration in original.
minority tv urges us to adopt a strict scrutiny standard.we do not credit minority tv argument that citizens united federal election comm n,overruled decades of precedent sub silentio especially given that the court there expressly overruled two other cases with no mention of league of women voters or an intent to change the level of scrutiny for broadcasting.citizens united was not about broadcast regulation it was about the validity of a statute banning political speech by corporations.had citizens united changed the standard for broadcast regulation,presumably the supreme court would have recognized as much two years later in fcc fox television stations,rather than declining to address the broadcasters claim that precedent providing for less rigorous scrutiny of broadcast regulation should be overruled because the rationale of that case has been overtaken by technological change.the supreme court has not gone there and neither should we,absent a complete record on the subject and a change of direction by the supreme court.this case is not a suitable one for such fundamental reconsideration of longstanding precedent 
scope of the record 
we are presented with an ample record to support,consisting both of evidence that was before congress in and evidence before the district court that covered the period after enactment.following the supreme court lead,we look to the evidence before congress and then the further evidence presented to the district court.turner broadcasting fcc,turner ii.as a matter of course,in multiple first amendment cases,the court has looked beyond the record before congress at the time of enactment.see,league of women voters,at,looking to testimony before congress as well as reports and other evidence following the statute enactment,and united states playboy ent,faulting the government for failing to produce additional probative evidence to supplement the near barren legislative record in applying strict scrutiny.
congress enacted and after a fcc notice and comment proceeding,days of hearings,and a thoughtful committee report.indeed,the record before congress provides a sufficient basis to uphold the statute even without the supplemental evidence offered in the district court.this case does not present a close call requiring us to elaborate on what evidentiary burden congress bears in enacting a law that implicates first amendment rights.nixon shrink missouri gov t pac,see also sable comm.of,fcc,scalia,concurring neither due process nor the first amendment requires legislation to be supported by committee reports,floor debates,or even consideration,but only by a vote.
it is clear,however,that congress is not obligated,when enacting its statutes,to make a record of the type that an administrative agency or court does to accommodate judicial review.turner broadcasting fcc,turner i.we reject minority tv suggestions to the contrary.the dissent insistence on evidence in the technical sense is misplaced.we are not abdicating to a congressional whim or succumbing to some notion that judges like public radio and television,dissent at,simply because we give credence to congressional findings.pure and simple,the dissent does like what congress found after considering extensive fcc administrative proceedings,holding its own hearings,and preparing a committee report.congress is a political body that operates through hearings,findings,and legislation it is not a court of law bound by federal rules of evidence.ignoring fundamental principles of separation of powers,the dissent would rewrite the legislation,ignore the congressional evidence,and substitute pop culture and its own policy judgment for that of congress.
in enacting and,congress made a prediction about the effects of underwriting announcements,logograms,and advertising on public broadcast programming.we must accord deference to congress findings as to the harm to be avoided and to the remedial measures adopted for that end,lest we infringe on traditional legislative authority to make predictive judgments when enacting nationwide regulatory policy.turner ii,at.congressional concern and prognostication was well informed,but the information before congress was necessarily limited because advertising had never been allowed on nce stations.the first amendment does not require congress to wait for a feared harm to take place before it can act.such a high bar would make little practical sense it would tie congress in knots and strip it of its ability to adopt forward thinking public policy.sound policymaking often requires legislators to forecast future events and to anticipate the likely impact of these events based on deductions and inferences for which complete empirical support may be unavailable.turner i,at.
apart from the evidence that was before congress in,the government presented significant additional evidence,including a report by the government accountability office gao on public television the report of the temporary commission on alternative financing for public telecommunications,which oversaw an experiment with limited advertising on public television information about political advertising an expert report from a stanford university professor emeritus with over years of experience in studying the economics of broadcasting and public television and a declaration from a vice president of a foundation that operates numerous noncommercial educational radio and television stations.
we conclude that substantial evidence before congress supported the conclusion that the advertising prohibited by posed a threat to the noncommercial,educational nature of nce programming and that the additional evidence bears out congress predictive judgment in enacting.minority tv scant evidentiary showing reinforces this conclusion.see nixon,at noting that more extensive evidence might be required if the parties challenging the statute had made any showing of their own to cast doubt on the evidence supporting it.similarly,the dissent offers only speculation not substance for its view that permitting unfettered advertising would lead to distortion and perverse incentives.poking holes in the congressional evidence is hardly a substitute for the scrutiny required of this court.
intermediate scrutiny analysis of section 
we now turn to a more detailed analysis of whether is narrowly tailored to further a substantial governmental interest.league of women voters,at.section was enacted in against the backdrop of declining federal support for public broadcasting.congress was acutely aware that public broadcasting needed new sources of revenue to survive,but it was also worried about undermining the essential nature of public broadcast programming.the fcc had just promulgated new,liberalized regulations that were designed to further the important governmental interest in preserving the essentially noncommercial nature of public broadcasting within a minimal regulatory framework by insulating public broadcasters from commercial marketplace pressures and decisions,statement by fcc commissioner washburn clarifying the impact of the public broadcasting amendments act on the recently issued regulations emphasis in original.the fcc believed the liberalized advertising restrictions satisf ied constitutional objections.id.congress agreed,and so do we.
substantial governmental interest 
federal regulation of the broadcast spectrum,a scarce public resource,is entitled to more deferential first amendment review than regulation of other types of media.see reno aclu,highlighting the special justifications for regulation of the broadcast media that are not applicable to other speakers,including the history of extensive government regulation of the broadcast medium,the scarcity of available frequencies at its inception,and its invasive nature citations omitted turner i,at noting that the justification for the court distinct approach to broadcast regulation rests on the unique physical limitations of the broadcast medium.this deferential review is not strict scrutiny light,but instead requires us to benchmark the statute against the requirements of league of women voters,including the government substantial interest.section advertising restrictions speak directly to the government substantial interest in maintaining the unique,free programming niche filled by public television and radio.that minority tv does not contest the government substantial interest in ensuring the diversity and quality of public broadcast programming is no surprise.nonetheless,it is useful to detail the nature and scope of the government interest both as a prelude to and a basis for informing our narrow tailoring analysis.
the first amendment rights of minority tv and potential advertisers do not exist in a vacuum.the supreme court has recognized the public right to receive suitable access through broadcast media to social,political,esthetic,moral,and other ideas and experiences.red lion broad.fcc.balancing the various first amendment interests involved in the broadcast media and determining what best serves the public right to be informed is a task of great delicacy and difficulty,and we must afford great weight to the decisions of congress and the experience of the fcc.columbia broad.democratic.
in pursuit of its goal,the government set aside specific channels for noncommercial use,provided funding through the corporation for public broadcasting and other means,and created special requirements and restrictions for nce stations.see,a b.however,the dissent fails to appreciate that section b is a central prong of these structural constraints and that they operate as a package to effectuate congressional intent.the dissent selective excision of a foundational principle of public television undermines the integrated legislative package and ignores the fcc experience with public television.section does not stand alone it is an important piece of a comprehensive scheme to promote programming that is differentiated from the typical commercial fare.
numerous statutes and reports recognize the unique nature of nce programming.for example,when the fcc first set aside television channels for noncommercial use,it pointed to the important contributions which noncommercial educational television stations can make and the high quality type of programming available on nce stations programming of an entirely different character from that available on most commercial stations.third notice of further proposed rulemaking.in the public broadcasting act of,which,among other things,established the corporation for public broadcasting,congress found that i t furthers the general welfare to encourage public telecommunications services which will be responsive to the interests of people both in particular localities and throughout the united states,which will constitute an expression of diversity and excellence,and which will constitute a source of alternative telecommunications services for all the citizens of the nation.a.and in passing the children television act of,the senate explained that public television is the primary source of educational children programming in the united states,at.
the unrebutted evidence before us documents that programming on public broadcast stations is markedly different from that on commercial stations.that was true in when congress enacted,and it is true now.as the district court noted,congress did not write on a blank slate when it enacted section rather,after a of experience with public broadcasting,the record before congress showed that public television and radio stations carry very different programming than do commercial stations.d at.for example,there was testimony before congress that public radio allows or minutes to explore an issue,rather than being confined to the and second snatches common to commercial stations,provides the only network for the blind,gives you jazz live,and provides four hours of daily news of a different nature than that provided by commercial stations.hgs.at walda roseman,senior vice president,national public radio npr.
stanford university professor emeritus roger noll,a government expert who has spent over forty years studying the economics of broadcasting and public television,presented evidence that stations offer statistically significantly more public affairs,children and family programming,and statistically significantly less violent programming,than both affiliates of commercial networks and all other commercial stations.according to the government accountability office,public broadcasters devote percent of all program hours to educational children programming compared to the hours per week the average commercial broadcaster gives to such programming.many nce stations also broadcast instructional programming for adults,including ged preparation,community college telecourses,and professional growth programming for teachers and administrators.in addition,some public broadcast stations are the only source of local programming that is not related to news or sports.
the primary harm sought to prevent was the loss of the distinctive content of public broadcast programming.congress heard from dozens of witnesses who testified,among other things,that c ommercialization will make public television indistinguishable from the new commercial or pay culture cable services,hgs.at larry sapadin,executive director,association of independent video filmmakers,and that programming is just not possible with the commercial constraints of providing a commercial service,hgs.at walda roseman,npr.all consumer and public interest group representatives who testified were concerned about what they viewed as a trend towards the commercialism of public broadcasting,at.
one of the major themes in the evidence before congress was that advertising distorts programming decisions because advertisers have something to sell be it a product,message,or candidate and they want to sell it to the largest audience possible.representative robert matsui,a former member of the communications subcommittee,explained that the principal thrust of commercial broadcasting is controlled by its need to reach mass audiences in order to sell products.while this mass approach is definitely a valid purpose,commercial broadcasting is unable thereby to respond to the myriad of individual needs of any community it simply does not possess the programming flexibility to tailor shows to serve the numerous characteristics of each community.hgs.similarly,an article submitted to the house by the national association of educational broadcasters explained that public broadcasters do aim to amuse the lowest common denominator of the audience because we not seeking the highest ratings possible.because we do carry ads.because the law wo let us.hgs.see also hgs.john dewitt,american found.for the blind testifying that commercialization of public broadcasting run s the danger that broadcasters will focus on the lowest common denominator of programming rather than on serving diverse audiences like minorities,women,and the print handicapped.one member of the house of representatives summed up this concern will the search for dollars compromise public broadcasting creative genius will there be strings attached to the money that is given to public broadcasting so that the most courageous and needed programs are not funded for fear of controversy or simply fear itself cong.rec.june.
the commercialization congress feared was not restricted to typical commercial business advertising.rather,congress was worried about the commercialization of public broadcasting itself the selling of airtime.see,hgs.senator wirth describing how the selling of time would transform public broadcasting by leading stations to make programming decisions based on their calculations of the advertising value of shows see also hgs.the executive director of the association of independent video filmmakers,emphasizing that s elling makes its own demands.
congress heard testimony about the need to protect public broadcasting from all special interests whose advertising dollars could affect programming decisions.see hgs.jack golodner,director,department for professional employees,afl cio i f public broadcasting is to perform its role,then sufficient public funding must be made available so that to the furthest extent humanly possible,it is insulated from political,corporate,and,for that matter,labor influence.the record shows that congress was concerned with insulat ing public broadcasting from special interest influences political,commercial,or any other kind.cong.rec.see also,at listing as a criterion for alternative financing mechanisms the insulation of program control and content from the influence of special interests be they commercial,political or religious.
evidence before the district court reinforces the congressional view that if advertising were allowed,programming would follow the money,changing the nature of public broadcast programming.the research cited by noll is consistent with much of the testimony before congress,and it bears out congress predictive judgment that advertising would change the face of public broadcasting.noll explained that commercial broadcasting suffers from a market failure in that a competitive,television system leads to an emphasis on mass entertainment programming with insufficient attention to programs that serve a small audience,even if that audience has an intense desire to watch programs that differ from standard mass entertainment programs.according to noll,in order to attract advertising dollars,nce stations would have to change their programming to be more like that on commercial stations programming that advertisers prefer because it attracts large audiences.
the diversity and quality of programming on public broadcast stations stems both from the restrictions on advertising and from the incentives created by the existing funding structure.funding for nce stations comes from federal,state,and local subsidies donations from viewers and program underwriters including corporations,foundations,and other entities.noll explained that,b ecause the viability of public television stations depends on attracting donations,stations are motivated to offer programs that encourage voluntary contributions from the communities that they serve.
lance ozier,the vice president for planning and policy of the wgbh educational foundation,detailed that funding from federal and state government sources as well as foundations and other underwriters would be jeopardized if nce stations were permitted to air paid advertisements.ozier stated that the loss of funding would not be restricted to those stations who chose to air advertisements every public station would face the consequences generally of a perceived deviation from the public education mission.
in,the gao reported that many of the public television licensees with whom it spoke opposed greater underwriting flexibility.the large majority that opposed greater underwriting flexibility said that it would not generate increased underwriting revenues,since corporations and advertisers desire programming with high ratings and a targeted demographic,would upset viewers and contribute to a decline in membership support,could threaten a licensee ability to receive financial support from a state government,and would be inconsistent with the mission of public television and could alter programming decisions.
the upshot of the evidence starting with the fcc study,buttressed during congressional hearings,and reinforced by additional evidence before the district court is that the government has a substantial interest in imposing advertising restrictions in order to preserve the essence of public broadcast programming.
narrow tailoring 
with this substantial interest in mind,the next question in our intermediate scrutiny analysis is whether the law is narrowly tailored to further that substantial government interest.league of women voters,at.unlike strict scrutiny,intermediate scrutiny does not require that the means chosen by congress be the least restrictive.see turner i,at united brotherhood of carpenters joiners of am.local nlrb,cir.as the supreme court succinctly noted in a commercial speech case,narrow tailoring requires a fit between the legislature ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends.bd.of tr.of the state of new york fox,citation omitted.
understanding the contrast between this case and the ban on editorialization in league of women voters is a useful starting point in the narrow tailoring analysis.see at.that ban was patently overinclusive because it include d within its grip a potentially infinite variety of speech that was not related to the government interests in protecting nce stations from being coerced into becoming vehicles for government propagandizing or the objects of governmental influence.id.at.the restriction was also patently underinclusive.id.at.because the stations remained fully able to broadcast controversial views so long as such views were not labeled as their own,the ban did not effectively reduce the risk of government retaliation and interference.id.at.there was also evidence that some supporters of the bill were less concerned with the risk of government control of nce stations than they were with protecting themselves from critical speech.id.at quoting the provision chief sponsor,who explained that some representatives have very strong feelings because they have been editorialized against.finally,the government interest in ensuring that audiences would not presume that broadcasters editorials reflected official government views could have been easily satisfied by a less restrictive regulation requiring nce stations to broadcast a disclaimer when they editorialized.id.at.in short,there was very little fit between the ban and its stated purposes.
in contrast,restrictions are narrowly tailored to the harms congress sought to prevent.having documented the link between advertising and programming,congress reaffirmed the ban on advertising on nce stations,but in a more targeted manner.in place of the prior absolute ban on promotional content,which swept within its reach a wide range of speech that did not pose a significant risk to public programming,congress enacted targeted restrictions that leave untouched speech that does not undermine the goals of the statute.the restrictions leave broadcasters free to air enhanced underwriting,which both the fcc and congress determined did not pose the same risk to programming as advertisements.broadcasters may air any promotional content for which consideration was not received.finally,the statute permits advertisements.as to this latter category,the government offered evidence that advertisements,which are few in number and perceived by the public as consistent with the mission of public broadcasting,do not pose the same threat as other forms of advertising.
section prohibitions are specifically targeted at the real threat the influence of paid advertising dollars.congress identified significant special interests that pump money into advertising,setting out three subsets of advertisers typical businesses,political candidates,and advocacy groups.the term advertisement is defined by reference to these three subsets,which taken together have a single effect to prevent the commercialization of public broadcasting by prohibiting nearly all advertising.although the dissent proffers unsupported distinctions between political or issue advertisements and commercial advertisements they are not germane to the overall threat that congress targeted commercialization through advertising.
unlike the ban on editorialization,which was underinclusive to the point of ineffectiveness,effectively insulate s public broadcasting from special interest,commercial,or any other kind.cong.rec.more than thirty years since was enacted,the continuing differences between public broadcasting and commercial broadcasting are a testament to the statute success in promoting congress purpose.the government provided expert evidence that the present system of financing public television is effective that it improves diversity of programming while avoiding problems associated with advertisements.minority tv unsupported assertion that attempt to prevent the buying of influence can not possibly be effective because groups,entities,and individuals can still attempt to buy influence by making donations is not persuasive.not only is there no evidence that donations affect programming there is a huge difference between a donation and targeted advertising.
the dissent acknowledges the evidence before congress and the district court,but offers its own theories of how to protect public broadcasting.contrasting the actual evidence and the dissent proposals illustrates the difference between the strict scrutiny standard that the dissent hoped we would apply and the intermediate scrutiny standard that we are bound to apply.we do not demand mathematical precision from congress rather,we demand a fit between the ends and the chosen means.fox,at.the evidence in this case easily demonstrates a fit between section b and the substantial interest in protecting the essence of public broadcasting.therefore,section b survives intermediate scrutiny on this prong of the analysis under league of women voters.
overinclusiveness challenge to issue and political advertising restrictions 
minority tv essentially lets pass restriction on goods and service advertising and focuses its attack on the political and issue advertising restrictions.this attack rests on a distinction without a difference.congress was trying to prevent the commercialization of public broadcasting itself,not simply advertisements by commercial businesses.
minority tv mistakenly attempts to equate congressional focus on commercialization with businesses but this reading is at odds with congressional intent.congress determined that the insulation of program control and content from the influence of special interests be they commercial,political or religious was necessary.see,at.the government evidence regarding the enormous sums spent on political advertising confirms congress prediction that,like advertising by entities,political advertising dollars have the power to distort programming decisions.in alone,political advertisers spent billion.as the campaign season gets longer and longer,commercial television viewers are bombarded with political and issue advertising.prohibiting only goods and services advertising and allowing issue and political advertising would have shifted incentives and left a gaping hole in protections.
we recognize the special place political speech has in our first amendment jurisprudence.morse frederick,political speech,of course,is at the core of what the first amendment is designed to protect.citation omitted.but there is no evidence that congress was targeting political speech,critical speech or particular viewpoints as opposed to the programming influence exerted by advertising dollars.league of women voters,at noting that some supporters of the ban on editorialization appear to have been more concerned with preventing the possibility that these stations would criticize government officials than with the risk of undue government influence.
each form of prohibited advertising poses a similar threat.whether selling financial services,a state senator,or a voter initiative,advertisers seek the largest possible audience.see hgs.the purpose of advertising is simply to sell a product or an image.selling makes its own demands.larry sapadin,executive director,association of independent video filmmakers.advertisers also seek programming that is consistent or at least not contrary to their messages and values,or the values of their customers or constituencies.see yoo,christopher,architectural censorship and the fcc,regulation,vol,issue,at anecdotal evidence suggests that some advertisers have discouraged networks from offering programming that addresses controversial issues or that casts their products in an unflattering light.in addition,reliance on advertising support leaves programmers vulnerable to the political biases of advertisers and special interest groups.finally,selling programs would essentially convert public broadcasting into commercial broadcasting.see,hgs.if we get public broadcasting into the selling of time,how do we avoid then getting public broadcasting into a very large commitment of their own to figure out what demographics they are touching or what the measurement is going to be able to be of that particular population,and how much x program sells for and how much y program sells for.it strains logic to suggest that advertisers would compete intensely to run ads for a state senator or a voter initiative on guns or taxes during sesame street or mister rogers.children are hardly the appropriate target audience.
minority tv argues that more was needed before congress could prohibit issue and political advertising.we disagree.substantial evidence before congress supported its determination that the selling of airtime to political and issue advertisers,as with advertisers,would distort programming decisions.as the court observed in turner ii in rejecting the dissent insistence that congress was required to have more information before it could enact the cable legislation,that level of factfinding would be an improper burden for courts to impose on the legislative branch.at.that amount of detail is as unreasonable in the legislative context as it is constitutionally unwarranted.id.congress prophylactic action,based on common sense,congressional understanding of how political advertising works,and record evidence,did not need to await an empirical study to support its predictions.see turner i,at sound policymaking often requires legislatures to forecast future events and to anticipate the likely impact of these events based on deductions and inferences for which complete empirical support may be unavailable.
congress determination that all three kinds of advertising posed a significant threat to public programming is supported by substantial evidence,and minority tv does not point to any evidence indicating that issue and political advertising are less likely to result in commercialization than corporate goods and services advertising.its argument as to overinclusiveness does pan out.
underinclusiveness challenge to permitting advertising by non profit entities 
minority tv makes much of the fact that does not prohibit advertising by entities.it frames this as an argument that favors commercial speech advertising by over speech political and issue advertisements.minority tv claims that the statute clearly inverts the hierarchy of constitutional protections of speech.there is,however,a documented reason for exempting this tiny slice of advertising from the overall restrictions advertising is a drop in the bucket money wise and this limited advertising has no programmatic impact.
although the cases that minority tv relies on for this argument concern newspaper racks and portable signs,the argument itself appears to come straight from the law of billboards.it is true that,with respect to billboards,an ordinance is invalid if it imposes greater restrictions on noncommercial than on commercial billboards.adver.orange,cir.but public broadcasting stations are not billboards,and broadcast regulations are not subject to the formulation for billboards,newspaper racks,or signs.each method of communicating ideas is a law unto itself and that law must reflect the differing natures,values,abuses and dangers of each method.metromedia,city of san diego,quoting kovacs cooper,jackson,concurring.
even if this longstanding distinction were cast aside,minority tv reliance on cases such as ballen redmond,cir,and cincinnati discovery network,is misplaced.in ballen,for example,the sign ordinance was ostensibly intended to promote safety and community aesthetics.instead,the ordinance discriminated on the basis of content and the permitted signs created the same harms as the prohibited ones.this was a classic mismatch between the restriction and its stated purpose.unlike the statute here,the ordinance in ballen was not a reasonable fit between the restriction and the goal.at.discovery network also underscored the same absence of reasonable fit because the ordinance was directed to such a paltry aspect of the purported problems posed by newspaper racks.at.
to the extent that minority tv is making an underinclusiveness argument that is underinclusive because it does not prohibit goods and services advertising by that attack also fails.see sorrell ims health,explaining that r ules that burden protected expression may not be sustained when the options provided by the state are too narrow to advance legitimate government interests see also mainstream mktg,ftc,cir the underinclusiveness of a commercial speech regulation is relevant only if it renders the regulatory framework so irrational that it fails materially to advance the aims that it was purportedly designed to further.the statute in league of women voters was patent ly underinclusive and provide d only ineffective or remote support for the government purpose,whereas has been effective in meeting the government asserted interest.at quoting cent.hudson gas pub.serv.comm of.allowing nonprofit advertising has not thwarted goals.
in promulgating its newly liberalized regulations,the fcc noted that m any commenting parties were concerned with the proscription on promoting the sale of products or services as applied to announcements made on behalf of entities or the station itself.at.the fcc addressed this concern by limiting the ban to announcements for which consideration was received.id.at.congress went one step further in narrowly tailoring the legislation,by allowing advertising for goods and services without regard to whether consideration was received.
congress prediction that advertising would not pose the same risk to public broadcasting as the restricted types of advertising is borne out by the record.lance ozier from the wgbh educational foundation explained that advertising by entities do es not present the same danger to public television as prohibited forms of advertising because viewers generally have seen messages from entities as being consistent with the public education mission of public television,so advertisements by entities do not threaten traditional funding sources like viewer donations and government grants,and there is a much smaller set of advertisers than there is of advertisers.advertising sales are so small that they did not even register on the breakdown of public television revenue sources presented by the government.indeed,there is only a single actual announcement in the record before us,and it is not one that minority tv sought to broadcast.advertising does not pose the same threat as commercial,political,or issue advertisements in large part because the number of corporate advertisers dwarfs the number of potential advertisers.in the end,exempting advertising underscores,rather than undermines,congress narrow tailoring.
no sufficient less restrictive means 
the goals of can not be fully satisfied by less restrictive means that are readily available.at.section already is a less restrictive means of ensuring diverse,high quality programming on public broadcast stations than either the previous promotional prohibition or any attempt to directly regulate program content rather than advertising the latter approach would not only be less effective,it would open a different can of first amendment worms.
minority tv insists that time,place,and manner restrictions could achieve the same goals.without any support as to correlation with congressional goals,minority tv blithely suggests limiting the number of underwriting announcements or permitting advertising that does interrupt programming and is limited in length.but that argument runs counter to the evidence.lance ozier concluded that nce stations would be forced to change their programming substantially even if advertisements did not interrupt programming or if they were limited in length.ozier explained that,should public broadcasting be perceived as being commercial,nce stations would have a harder time soliciting donations from viewers and might lose funding from federal and state government sources,foundations,and other underwriters.the stations could also experience increased costs by losing the beneficial treatment they currently receive in negotiating labor contracts and broadcast rights.
minority tv also ignores the history of the advertising demonstration program,an experiment authorized by the public broadcasting act of that allowed advertisements on some public broadcast stations subject to the very restrictions minority tv proffers that the advertisements not interrupt programming and be limited in length.the temporary commission on alternative financing for public telecommunications the commission,which was charged with overseeing the experiment,concluded that the benefit that some public broadcasting stations might gain additional revenues from the authorization of limited advertising does not balance the potential risks identified in this report.among the potential risks identified were those noted by ozier.for example,representatives of the five major unions involved with program production told the commission that they may seek commercial rates and rights agreements from public broadcast stations that air limited advertisements,and representatives similarly indicated that they might seek higher payments from those stations based on the results of the experiment,the commission recommended that congress leave prohibitions in place.it is rare to have the benefit of a comparison when judging less restrictive means.we can not ignore experience with alternatives that demonstrates that is narrowly tailored to accomplishing congress goals 
finally,although congress may not have considered a pure time,place and manner restriction,as minority tv claims it should have,it did evaluate less restrictive alternatives.the house considered an alternative to that would have allowed institutional advertisements that did not interrupt regular programming and did not exceed thirty seconds in duration.hgs.proposed text of.while some of those who testified before congress supported allowing institutional advertisements,many opposed it.see,hgs.david ives,president of wgbh tv in boston stating that allowing logograms liberalizes our rules without compromising our principles,but that permitting even limited institutional advertisements would blur the distinction between us and commercial stations hgs.association of independent video and filmmakers,even tasteful,institutional advertising will give rise to programming that will conform to the purposes of corporate.
ii.facial vagueness challenge to 
section prohibition of paid messages intended to promote any service,facility,or product of a entity is not unconstitutionally vague.a statute need not have mathematical certainty to survive a vagueness challenge instead,it may be marked by flexibility and reasonable breadth,rather than meticulous specificity.grayned city of rockford,citation omitted.nonetheless,the meaning of the term promoting a product or service is fully within common understanding and is clear in the vast majority of circumstances.cal.teachers ass state bd.of,cir.to the extent it is not,the fcc to remove uncertainty provides declaratory rulings to broadcasters who fear they might run afoul of.this guidance serves to sufficiently narrow potentially vague or arbitrary interpretations of the statute.vill.of hoffman estates flipside,hoffman estates.
iii.as applied challenge to and challenges to.e 
the district court correctly dismissed minority tv challenges to and its challenges to e.section was applied to minority tv only through fcc orders and regulations,including e.jurisdiction over challenges to fcc orders lies exclusively in the court of appeals as such,federal district courts lack jurisdiction over appeals of fcc orders.the court of appeals has exclusive jurisdiction to enjoin,set aside,suspend in whole or in part or determine the validity of all final orders of the federal communications commission.see also united states dunifer,cir explaining that district courts lack jurisdiction over any challenge to fcc regulations.
although the supreme court has previously reviewed a first amendment challenge to an fcc regulation that was initially filed in federal district court,see greater new orleans broadcasting ass united states,the court in that case did not address and was not asked to address whether jurisdiction in the district court was proper.courts are not bound by a prior exercise of jurisdiction in a case where it was not questioned and it was passed sub silentio.united states trucker truck lines.
i concur in the majority opinion only insofar as it upholds b prohibition against paid advertisements by entities.
i dissent from the majority acceptance of b prohibition of advertisements on issues of public importance or interest and for political candidates.as explained by the chief judge in his dissent,and by judge bea in his opinion for the three judge panel,minority television project,cir,these restrictions implicate the first amendment core concerns and are not justified on this record even under the intermediate standard set forth in fcc league of women voters.i would hold that these restrictions are unconstitutional.
the united states stands alone in our commitment to freedom of speech.no other nation not even countries like canada,england,australia,new zealand and israel has protections of free speech and free press like those enshrined in the first amendment.these are dead words on paper written two centuries ago they live.in many ways,the first amendment is america.we would be a very different nation but for the constant buffeting of our public and private institutions by a maelstrom of words and ideas,uninhibited,robust,and.times sullivan.
but the first amendment is it depends on the vigilance of judges in scrutinizing the multitude of prohibitions,restrictions,burdens and filters that government federal,state and local constantly seeks to impose on speech and the press.the essence of first amendment vigilance is skepticism,not deference.governments always have reasons for the things they do and,for the most part,we accept those reasons as valid,even if they not entirely persuasive.but prohibitions on speech are different.whether we engage in strict scrutiny,which applies to most forms of speech,or intermediate scrutiny,which my colleagues believe applies here,we do uphold restrictions on speech if the government reasons do not,at the very least,make sense.
the majority embraces every justification advanced by the government without the least hesitation or skepticism,and without giving proper weight to the true harms caused by the speech restrictions in question.the opinion is certainly a fine example of rational basis review,but if intermediate scrutiny is to have any bite,we ca just trot out all of the reasons the government advances in support of the regulation and salute.
the supreme court showed us how intermediate scrutiny should be done in fcc league of women voters.there,the court found restrictions on speech wanting because the government justifications were speculative and any problems could be remedied by less drastic means.id.at.the majority here downplays league of women voters as an obvious case of governmental overreach,but it was so obvious to the four justices who wrote three separate dissents taking the majority to task for failing to accord the speech restrictions sufficient deference.the majority cites the league of women voters opinion,but its approach resembles far more the dissents.
that said,it hard to pinpoint exactly where the majority goes astray.i will note what i consider to be errors,but doubt i can persuade those not already on board.how could i with a standard as mushy and toothless as intermediate scrutiny,it hard to be clearly wrong.a standard that calls on us to distinguish among shades of gray provides scant protection to speech the very indeterminacy of the standard enables nay,encourages judges to apply their own values.speech that judges like gets protected,and speech that judges do like gets the back of the hand.and judges like public radio and television,while pretty much nobody likes commercials.it hardly a fair fight,which is why i believe it time to reconsider the applicability of intermediate scrutiny to broadcast restrictions.
the court plucked broadcast stations out of the mainstream of first amendment jurisprudence in,when the world of communications looked vastly different.the only way to reach mass audiences in those days was through the broadcast spectrum.and no medium of communication approached the power of radio and television to reach into people homes with sounds and images.given the scarcity of the broadcast spectrum and the absence of viable alternative means of communication,the court may have justifiably believed that it was confronted with a market failure a bottleneck in the pathways of communication.it may have served the first amendment to correct that market failure by keeping those pathways accessible to a multitude of views,red lion broad.fcc,safe for minors,fcc pacifica found,and otherwise regulated.
i certainly not the first one to note that that rationale whatever its merits at the time no longer carries any force.see,fcc fox television stations,thomas,concurring.it a fine point whether judges of the inferior courts are bound by supreme court decisions that the court itself has yet bothered to overrule,but whose rationale has been decimated by intervening developments.i was once of the view that only the supreme court may perform such operations,and the rest of us must keep applying law we know to be wrong until the court tells us otherwise.in fact,i once wrote a jeremiad warning my colleagues of the perils of treating a supreme court case as overruled,when the court itself had told us so.in that case,we not only defied a six supreme court precedent,but also dozens of cases in every other regional circuit.see united states gaudin,cir en banc kozinski,dissenting.and,as i predicted,the court granted cert.and unanimously affirmed us.united states gaudin.so i guess the lesson is,we must not get ahead of the supreme we right.
the statute here draws a curious line between permissible and impermissible speech advertisements for commercial goods and services are prohibited,and so are those for political candidates and issues.but logograms and advertisements for goods sold by entities are permitted.id.to determine whether speech falls on the permitted or prohibited side of the line,the regulator here the fcc must evaluate what the speech says it must evaluate speech based only on its content.moreover,as the majority recognizes,some of the prohibited speech namely political and issue advertising implicates the first amendment core concern with ensuring an informed electorate.we must therefore be doubly skeptical first,because the restriction is and,second,because we have traditionally treated some of the prohibited speech with the greatest solicitude.
the majority declares itself satisfied with the evidence supporting these prohibitions and distinctions,but the record is much sparser and far more ambiguous than the majority acknowledges.there is,for starters,almost nothing in the congressional record compiled at the time the legislation was adopted that speaks to the supposed dangers posed by political and issue advertising.many witnesses testified about their fear that c ommercialization would make public television indistinguishable from the new commercial or pay culture cable services.citing hearings before the subcomm.on,consumer protection,and finance of the comm.on energy and commerce on and,cong.larry sapadin,executive director,association of independent video filmmakers,hereinafter hgs.see also hgs.at walda roseman,npr.but commercialization,as that term is commonly understood,deals with commerce it says nothing at all about advertising for political candidates or on issues of public interest.
the majority also points to a few comments suggesting that congress feared the influence of political interests.jack golodner,of the afl cio,for example,advocated that public broadcasting be insulated from political,corporate,and,for that matter,labor influence.see id.at.congressman gonzales similarly emphasized the need to insulate public broadcasting from special interest influences political,commercial,or any other kind.cong.rec.but such general concerns about insulating public television from a variety of influences say nothing about advertising.no one explained,much less provided evidence,how allowing stations to accept paid advertising from politicians would make them subject to influence by those politicians.no one said a word about influence by organizations that sponsor issue ads.stray comments,unsupported by facts,may be enough to support legislation under the rational basis test,but intermediate scrutiny surely calls for more.
there are other lacunae in the legislative record.no one explains why political and issue ads are dangerous,if advertising for entities including product ads is.if legislators feared influence,why did they worry about stations falling under the sway of entities the list of entities is vast.many are poorly funded and such as some museums and theater groups,but others are quite wealthy and influential,including advocacy groups,churches,foundations,think tanks and fraternal organizations.the legislation forbids organizations from advertising about matters of public concern or candidates for public office.but nothing prevents them from advertising themselves and the services they offer,and thereby presumably influencing the programming of public broadcast stations.if there are reasons why influence by the westboro baptist church,heritage foundation,planned parenthood,national rifle association,middle east research institute,family research council,media matters for america and aarp poses less of a threat than influence by entities commenting on issues of public importance or candidates for public office,they are nowhere to be found in the legislative record.
even if we look at the evidence developed after the legislation was passed some of it decades later there is much to support the ban on political and issue ads.the majority cites a magazine article stating that in,billion was spent on political advertising.so what where the evidence that public broadcasters would suffer adverse consequences if they were allowed to run such ads we ca assume that political campaign ads will have the same adverse effects attributed to commercial ads more on this later.political ads are inherently more transitory and episodic centering on a particular campaign season,ballot issue or candidate so it far from clear that they would present the same capture problem attributed to ads for commercial products,whose producers are in the market for the long haul.nobody bothers to explain the connection,and yet the majority sees no problem.this is hardly rational basis review,much less intermediate scrutiny.
and the new evidence says nothing at all about issue ads.neither of the expert affidavits such as they are even mentions them.there is no magazine article suggesting there are billions of dollars in issue ads gearing up to invade the public airwaves.no one suggests that sponsors of issue ads are waiting voraciously in the wings,yearning to pressure public broadcast stations into changing their programming.not a word.nor is there a hint of a suggestion that issue ads are out of keeping with the character of public television.and,of course there ca be,because issue ads are about ideas.where the beef 
issue ads can be quite important from a first amendment perspective.aside from generating revenue,which public televison and radio stations can use to produce more and better programming,issue ads can help educate the public about some of the most significant questions of the day whether to take military action against foreign nations whether private individuals should have the right to carry concealed weapons whether minors are entitled to undergo certain medical procedures without their parents consent whether we should have capital punishment,and for what crimes whether undocumented aliens should be given a path to citizenship how the tax burden should be allocated whether couples should be allowed to marry whether the government should be reading our or listening to our phone calls the list is endless.how exactly would public broadcasting as we know it be harmed by allowing a limited number of paid issue ads that do interrupt programming my colleagues give the issue ban a pass,based entirely on the momentum supposedly created by the ban on commercial advertising.this is intermediate scrutiny it zero scrutiny.
which brings us to the one debatable issue the ban on advertisements for commercial products and services,which was at the center of congressional concern when the act was passed.there was,indeed,much about the dangers of commercialization,most of which the majority references in its opinion.but there nothing that one might call evidence.the legislation was designed to deal with the problem of drastically diminished federal funding for public broadcast stations,and the need for those stations to raise money from other sources.congress considered several possibilities,among them various flavors of commercial advertising,including logograms,institutional advertisements promoting companies rather than specific products and commercial advertising.it fair to say that none of the witnesses thought commercial advertising was a good idea,and most thought it would significantly harm public broadcasting.
their concerns can be divided into roughly categories that adding commercial advertising would force changes in program format and cause public broadcasting to lose its distinctive character that broadcasters ability to raise money commercially would cause subscribers and other sources of funding to withdraw support that the need to raise revenue through commercial advertising would necessitate changes in programming content,so as to attract larger audiences,leaving no airtime to serve audiences with less popular tastes and that there would be an increase in various costs,ranging from increased labor costs to the payment of additional royalties for copyrighted materials to loss of various statutory benefits.in the aggregate,the witnesses fretted,allowing commercial advertising would dramatically change the character of public broadcasting,defeating its mission of serving audiences not served by commercial stations.
these are certainly weighty concerns,but what remarkable about the testimony presented to congress is that they are nothing but concerns.the legislative record contains no documentation or evidence there are no studies,no surveys,no academic analyses nothing even as meaty as the rather anemic expert reports introduced by the government in our case.sure,a lot of people worried that commercial advertising would wreck public broadcasting,but people worry about a lot of things that never come to pass.see,peter gwynne,the cooling world,newsweek,april,at.where the proof,or even the rigorous analysis,showing that the matters worried about were likely to occur it certainly not in the legislative record.
i know it difficult to prove with certainty what the future will bring.see,turner broad.fcc turner i.nevertheless,if we conducting some level of heightened scrutiny,not merely rational basis review,we should insist on something more than a bunch of talking heads bloviating about their angst.we should expect,for example,a study of how public broadcast stations actually operate,how they differ in their governance and structure from commercial stations and whether those differences have any bearing on how they are likely to respond if they were allowed to raise money through commercial advertising.or,witnesses might have presented historical examples shedding light on the likelihood of future behavior,or the experience of broadcast stations in other countries.but there nothing like that we left to take on faith that the witnesses fears are justified.such faith is consistent with the heightened scrutiny courts are supposed to give legislation that abridges the freedom of speech.
in fact,there was a great deal that congress could have considered before resorting to such strict speech restrictions things we may not ignore in judging the legislation under heightened scrutiny.we must consider whether the speculation about the dangers of commercial advertising makes sense in light of all the known circumstances,just as the court did in league of women voters,at.the concerns expressed by the various witnesses about the dangers of commercial advertising boiled down to the fear that it would change public broadcasting into a more commercial enterprise,which would disserve the segment of the public not being adequately served by commercial broadcasting.
does this make sense commercial broadcasters operate the way they do precisely because they commercial entities,whose purpose is to make profits for their shareholders.managers of commercial broadcast stations and networks thus generally measure their success based on the broad popularity of their shows and the revenue they generate as a result of commercials and subscriptions.we call this capitalism,and we perfectly content to have the laws of supply and demand control the behavior of commercial entities.
but we do observe entities operating by the same rules museums,charities,churches,universities,hospitals,theater companies,musical ensembles and a large variety of other organizations operate on a basis,even as similar institutions,hospitals,museums,universities,theaters operate with them on a commercial basis.the lure of profit does cause charitable institutions to abandon their missions and reinvent themselves as commercial entities the red cross does go into the business of selling blood or charging for rescue missions because there a quick buck in it the met does swap programs with the grand ole opry because it thinks it can make more money playing country music and food banks do start charging prices that match those of the supermarket across the street.
we understand perfectly well why this is so.charitable and civic organizations have charters and other organizational constraints that tie them to their mission they have a variety of governmental regulations and incentives that keep them from straying into the commercial arena they have managers and staff who are dedicated to the organization core purpose and they have boards of directors who supervise them to ensure they stick to it.just as important is what they do have shareholders who demand a return on their investments.charitable and civic organizations intrinsically operate by different rules than commercial entities,and it would never occur to us to pass laws prohibiting the los angeles county museum of art from selling automobiles and dishwashers,even though the sale of such items might well be profitable and allow the museum to acquire more and better art.
it thus seems wholly irrational to make undocumented claims about the likely behavior of public broadcast stations,were they allowed to air advertisements,without first considering the ways in which they differ from commercial entities.and the differences are huge.to begin with,public broadcasters must,by law,operate as entities.they must be owned by a public agency or nonprofit private foundation,corporation,or association,or by a municipality.any station that is owned or operated by a state,political subdivision of a state or a public agency must have a community advisory board.k a.in fact,universities operate most public radio stations,while community organizations and state government agencies operate most public television stations.see corporation for public broadcasting,who operates the stations.
federal funding for public broadcasting stations is also conditioned on their maintaining programming that is consistent with the goals of the statute.federal funds are distributed by the corporation for public broadcasting,which may make grants for production of public television or radio programs by independent producers and production entities and public telecommunications entities,producers of national children educational programming,and producers of programs addressing the needs and interests of minorities,and for acquisition of such programs by public telecommunications entities.k b i.
finally,licenses for public broadcast stations are handed out on a,basis.in deciding whether to grant an application for a license,the fcc favors local applicants who have been local continuously for no fewer than two years applicants with no attributable interests in any other broadcast station public or private entities with authority over a minimum of accredited elementary secondary schools within a single state accredited public or private institutions of higher learning with a minimum of five full time campuses within a single state and organizations that will regularly provide programming for and in coordination with statewide educational entit ies for use in schools curricula.further,to receive a license,the potential station owner must show that the proposed station will be used primarily to serve the educational needs of the community for the advancement of educational programs and to furnish a nonprofit and noncommercial television broadcast service.
none of those who presented evidence better characterized as chicken littleisms about the calamitous effects of allowing commercial and political and issue advertising on public broadcasting took the slightest account of these structural constraints.they all predicted that the lure of advertising dollars would turn public broadcasters into commercial broadcasters.but is it rational to believe that public broadcast stations operated by municipalities,universities and foundations would risk losing federal funding and perhaps their fcc licenses by abandoning their traditional viewership in order to compete with commercial stations for advertising dollars this strikes me as about as likely as the smithsonian turning itself into busch gardens because it decides that roller coaster rides are more popular than mastodon skeletons.
still and all,had congress been presented with evidence that public broadcast stations could be diverted from their mission by the lure of lucre,despite the multitude of structural obstacles had anyone even mentioned this as a consideration i might feel constrained to defer to the congressional judgment.but no one paid any attention to the obvious differences between and commercial entities,and how they respond to market incentives even though there is a branch of economics that deals with precisely this subject.see,burton weisbrod,the nonprofit economy susan roseackerman,altruism,nonprofits,and economic theory,econ.lit.joseph newhouse,toward a theory of nonprofit institutions an economic model of a hospital,am.econ.
what more,we know for a fact that some of the witnesses who testified before congress in were wrong.three of the witnesses,each of whom was worried sick about the potentially catastrophic effects of commercialization on public broadcast stations,also made dire predictions about the pernicious use of logograms.oy vey congress nevertheless adopted that provision,and logograms have been in use in public broadcasting for over a quarter of a century.and,know what the cassandras were wrong public broadcasting as we know and love it has survived just fine perhaps a tad better,as underwriting,including logograms,generates revenue for public broadcasting.see npr,public radio finances,h ttp.
congress knew that predictions about how commercial advertising would affect public broadcast stations were speculative.it therefore sought to develop empirical evidence by authorizing an experiment that would allow public broadcasters to air commercial advertising and expanded underwriting credits.a temporary commission was established to study the project and report back to congress.the majority alludes to this study in its opinion,claiming that it supports its position,but i read the study very differently.
while written in cautious and somewhat tentative terms,the report contained a number of findings and conclusions that severely undermine the doomsday predictions made by witnesses before congress and accepted as gospel truth by the majority today.specifically,the commission found as follows 
limited advertising and expanded underwriting credits both generated revenues in excess of reported expenses.such revenues equaled about percent of the stations total net income.
in several cases,advertising revenues permitted stations to acquire specific programs that they otherwise could not have afforded to purchase the demonstration program did suggest that at least where advertising or expanded underwriting revenue is only one source among many no movement toward programming changes resulted.
w hile most subscribers and regular viewers reported initially that they would watch less public television if advertisements were present,the second wave of the survey showed no differences in the amount of time these groups reported watching.
although a first wave response suggested that to percent of public television subscribers might reduce their contributions,the second wave of the opinion poll showed no significant differences in the overall amount of giving reported.additionally,the poll showed an increase in the number of subscribers who reported that they would continue to contribute to public television.
analysis of subscription revenues at participating stations showed a n increase in total number of subscribers and contributors at all stations compared with the previous year n o significant differences in total number of subscribers or total contributions compared to the control group stations that did not carry advertising a significant decline in average contribution per subscriber at advertising stations compared to the control group which suggests that carriage of limited advertising may have affected giving by large contributors.the decline,however,also could reflect an influx of new subscribers contributing smaller amounts to the stations involved.
it is true,as the majority notes,that the temporary commission recommended maintaining the advertising ban,despite these positive findings.instead of raising revenue through advertising,the commission recommended enhanced federal funding for public broadcasting at least the majority did.for this,they were taken to task by the minority report,authored by the national telecommunications and information administration,an executive agency within the department of commerce.the minority decried the fact that t he majority report does not fully and fairly reflect the overwhelmingly positive results of the advertising demonstration experiment itself the majority,in short,seems to have rejected the congressional directive that we come up with some new lyrics and appears content instead simply to sing what by now is a very familiar song.it a song that echoes loud and clear in today majority opinion,three decades later.pointing out that the public money is the easiest of all money to spend because it does seem to belong to anyone,the minority chastised the majority for continuation of the cargo cult approach all have seen before.ditto.
here is how the minority report summarized the results of the demonstration program the evidence produced by the advertising demonstration program is almost completely positive and affirmative.in no instance did the findings indicate any significant adverse consequences with respect to these matters.the demonstration program confirmed the view that people watch and support public television because they like and enjoy the programming,not just because it is commercial free.the commission polling data,for example,revealed that no significant audiences were in fact alienated,and that stations were able to generate significant revenues.although the minority conceded that there were risks to allowing public broadcasters to air paid advertisements,because of the significance of the potential gains,it concluded that the sounder course for the temporary commission would have been to place maximum reliance on informed licensee discretion,and minimum weight on the utility of constraints.
the significance of the demonstration program ca be overstated it is the only evidence in the record about the consequences of allowing public broadcast stations to run commercial advertisements.and the experience is overwhelmingly positive.the demonstration program points to yet another gap in the majority reasoning the failure to appreciate or accord any weight to the serious adverse free speech consequences of the advertising ban.the record suggests three 
first,as the demonstration program illustrates,stations that receive paid advertising revenue can acquire or produce programs that they could not otherwise afford.thus,the loss of advertising revenue ca be dismissed as simply a loss of money it is,in fact,a loss of speech.we know for a fact from the demonstration program that there are stations wishing to run content that is consistent with their educational and civic mission but ca afford to do so.advertising revenue would allow public broadcast stations to acquire content that will serve their audiences.additional revenue would also enable stations to produce local content,which is one of the identified goals of public broadcasting,rather than relying on content produced nationally or abroad.
second,an infusion of additional revenue would help public broadcast stations gain independence from the federal government.the record before congress,and the record in our case,makes it clear beyond dispute that public broadcast stations are desperately dependent on federal subsidies.can broadcasters that are so dependent on one source of revenue be truly free to speak in ways that are critical of that source would public broadcasters feel free to run a program exposing corruption by,say,the chairman of the relevant appropriations committee my guess is that any station wishing to produce such a program would be dissuaded from doing so.washington is a small town with a long memory,and no one wants to get into a grudge match with the goose that lays golden eggs.the only true independence,the only truly free speech,comes from having a multitude of funding sources,so that none is so crucial that it ca be dispensed with.deriving a portion of revenue from commercial advertising,along with other sources,can help secure that independence.
third,advertisements are speech.viewers often see commercials as no more than annoying interruptions,but the supreme court has recognized that advertisements often carry important,sometimes vital,information.see,bates state bar of arizona,lawyer advertising virginia state bd.of pharmacy.virginia citizens consumer council,prescription drug prices rubin coors brewing,beer labels.advertisements can be for annoying,useless or decadent products,but they can also encourage people to get breast exams,join the pea
