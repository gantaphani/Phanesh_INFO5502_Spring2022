as part of its continuing effort to promote low power fm lpfm radio service,the federal communications commission in amended its lpfm rules,including announcing standards for waivers of certain protections against interference with fm stations.creation of a low power radio service,third report and order and second further notice of proposed rulemaking,rcd,order.in so doing,the commission purported not to harm the interests of fm stations or other commission licensees.id.at.the national association of broadcasters nab petitions for review of three changes,each of which it contends either reduced the protections afforded to fm stations against signal interference from lpfm stations or gave lpfm stations primary status over fm stations in particular circumstances.in adopting these changes,the nab contends,the commission violated the radio broadcasting preservation act of,stat,the preservation act,and the administrative procedure act,et apa.we hold that the preservation act did not bar the commission from reducing or eliminating interference protections other than channel minimum distance separation requirements,and that the nab challenges under the apa are either unripe or unpersuasive.accordingly,we deny the petition in part and dismiss it in part.
in january,the commission adopted rules authorizing lpfm radio service in order to provide opportunities for new voices to be heard.see creation of low power radio service,report and order,rcd,order.the lpfm stations were to be operated on a noncommercial educational basis,with a maximum of or watts of power,compared to stations that operate with minimum power of to watts.to prevent interference between lpfm stations and stations near each other on the fm dial,minimum distance requirements were established for and first and channel lpfm stations but not for channels.id.at see also the commission found that channel lpfm stations would not cause significant new interference to the service of existing fm stations,and that any small amount of interference that may occur in individual cases would be outweighed by the benefits of new low power fm stations.order at.the commission imposed minimum distance requirements for channels because it concluded that the risk of interference from lpfm signals may be somewhat higher than the risk from channels.id.the commission also required any lpfm station causing actual interference to a subsequently authorized new or modified station to modify its facilities and to cease operations if modifications could not prevent interference.id.at see also.on reconsideration it established complaint and license modification procedures designed to expedite the resolution of problems associated with any unexpected,significant adjacent channel interference problems caused by an lpfm station.creation of low power radio service,memorandum opinion and order on reconsideration,rcd,see also.
on december,congress enacted the preservation act,which did three things of relevance to this appeal.section a a directed the commission to amend the lpfm rules to prescribe minimum distance separations for channels as well as for and first and channels emphasis added.section a a barred the commission from eliminat ing or reduc ing the minimum distance separations for channels required by paragraph a emphasis added.and,b and b required the commission to engage an independent testing entity to study whether harmful interference would result if lpfm stations were not subject to channel minimum distance separation requirements,and to file a report with congress.the commission amended the lpfm rules accordingly in,creation of a low power radio service,second report and order,rcd,and forwarded the independent study to congress in,with a recommendation that congress modify the statute to eliminate the channel distance separation requirements for lpfm stations,federal communications commission,report to the congress on the low power interference testing program.to date,congress has not acted on that recommendation.
in december,the commission amended the lpfm rules,pointing to considerably changed circumstances arising from both the january lifting of the freeze on the filing of fm community of license modification proposals,and the implementation of streamlined licensing procedures that resulted in a flurry of filing activity order at.the amendments were designed to minimize the loss of lpfm stations and increase the number of lpfm stations on the air without causing interference to existing service.the commission explained that over the seven years since it had established the lpfm service,the service had flourished for the most part,but had also encountered unique obstacles.id.at.only approximately one third of lpfm applications had been granted and although stations were operating at the time of the order,station licenses and construction permits had been cancelled due to noncompliance with technical or procedural requirements.id.
the nab challenges three provisions of the amended rules,the first two involving channel protections,the third involving displacement protection for lpfm stations 
the modification of the requirement in,where an lpfm station is causing interference to a subsequently authorized new or modified fm station,to apply only to and channels,not channels.id.at.
the interim standards for waiving minimum distance requirements where a subsequently authorized new or modified fm station would be to the lpfm station and thus cause the lpfm station to be displaced where an alternate,and channel was unavailable to the lpfm station.id.at.
a rebuttable presumption favoring lpfm stations deemed to be appropriate by the commission because the public interest would be better served by a waiver of the commission rule making lpfm stations secondary to subsequently authorized full power fm stations and the dismissal of an encroaching community of license reallotment application when the threatened lpfm station can demonstrate it has regularly provided at least eight hours per day of locally originated programming.id.at.
the commission invited comment on whether to codify the second and third changes.id.at.
the nab challenges the commission statutory interpretation and also raises objections under the apa.upon reviewing an agency interpretation of a statute it administers,the court applies the familiar analysis of chevron,natural resources defense council,d.under step one,where a statute has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,id.at,the court and the agency must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress,id.at.under step two,when the statute is silent or ambiguous regarding the specific question,the court asks whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.regarding the apa challenges,the court will reverse only if the agency action is arbitrary or capricious or manifestly contrary to the statute.see fcc fox television stations,d motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.we conclude that the nab has read into the preservation act words congress did not enact and that its efforts to avoid the plain text are unavailing,and further that its apa challenges are unpersuasive or unripe.
section a a of the preservation act requires the commission to prescribe minimum distance separation for channels as well as for and first and channels.by contrast,a a bars the commission from eliminat ing or reduc ing the minimum distance separations for channels required by paragraph a but makes no reference to other channels.the to a a is tied explicitly to the minimum distance separations for channels.by their clear text,a and a are not opposite sides of the same coin,requiring minimum distance separations for all four categories and then banning elimination or reduction of those.in a a,congress acknowledged the four categories of minimum distance separations employed by the commission.in a a,congress restricted the commission authority to eliminate or reduce those separations in only one category,channels.under the general presumption that an omission is intentional where congress has referred to something in one subsection but not in another,russello united states,d see also barnhart sigmon coal,d,the fact that a a mentions all four categories but a a mentions only channels further indicates that a a restricts the commission authority only with respect to that category.the nab reliance on the discussion of superfluity in statutory interpretation in entergy riverkeeper,d,and corley united states,d,is misplaced.reading the preservation act in accord with its plain text does not render a a superfluous because that provision requires the commission to establish channel minimum distance separation requirements and acknowledges that the commission has already imposed minimum distance requirements for the other channels.on the other hand,reading a a to prohibit the commission from limiting interference protections would render a a superfluous.the statute should be read in a manner that gives effect to all of its provisions.see hibbs winn,d.
the context in which congress acted supports reading the preservation act in a manner consistent with its plain text.the nab suggests it would make no sense to conclude that congress meant to prohibit the commission only from eliminating protections,while leaving the commission free to reduce interference protections from channels closer on the dial that would cause even greater interference.petr br.at.however,as the commission points out,the issue pressing congress at the time was the absence of channel minimum distance separation requirements.see respt br.at.confirming that a a focused on the channel,congress directed the commission in subsection b to engage an independent testing entity to study channel interference.having prescribed a course of action for the commission with regard to the channel,congress silence in a a as to other channels indicates no other restrictions were placed on the commission authority in regulating lpfm stations.
the nab evidence that congress had a broader purpose is,at best,of minimal persuasive force because courts have no authority to enforce a principl e gleaned solely from legislative history that has no statutory reference point.shannon united states,d quoting int l of workers,local union,nlrb,emphasis deleted and alterations made in shannon.the nab points to statements in the house commerce committee report,see,at,and several statements by members on the house floor that the legislation was intended to require the commission to impose protections at least as strict as were in existence on january.but the statutory text is narrower.for example,the report states that lpfm stations which are authorized under this section,but cause interference to new or modified facilities of a station,would be required to modify their facilities or cease operations.id.no such requirement appears in the preservation act,which does not address signal interference protections other than minimum distance separation.likewise,the limitation referred to in congressman tauzin statement that the bill maintains congressional authority over any future changes made to the interference protections that exist in the fm dial today,cong.rec,appears nowhere in the statute.
furthermore,not only do the statements in the committee report on which the nab relies lack a statutory reference point,shannon,at,aspects of the legislative history support reading the statute as restricting the commission authority only with respect to channels.for instance,the headings of the proposed legislation printed in the report read a channel protections required,and b further evaluation of need for channel protections,at,and the report discussion of the need for legislation emphasizes the commission failure to provide for channel protections,id.at.not only did the house committee retreat from a bill that would have prevented the commission from authorizing lpfm at all,see,cong,floor statements indicate that the bill passed by the house was a true compromise and allows for the commission to proceed with plans to implement a fm radio service to address the community needs of many localities,cong.rec.at statement of tauzin see id.at statement of pallone the compromise allows the commission to move forward with the fm as long as it protects existing interference protections id.at statement of oxley.these statements are consistent with the conclusion reflected in the plain text that congress did not intend to restrain the commission authority to respond to new circumstances potentially threatening lpfm stations other than with respect to channel minimum separation requirements.
in a further attempt to avoid the plain text,the nab maintains it produces absurd results.see engine mfrs.ass epa.in the nab view,congress understood that the commission would have to peel back the outmermost layer of protections before reaching the inner layers,and the act protection of the outer layer thus protected the whole.petr br.at.seemingly intuitive,this assertion is unsupported by the statutory text.even assuming the logic behind relaxing requirements for channels before those for first or channels,the nab has not shown that the former must precede the latter.although entirely eliminating the requirements for channels while retaining the requirements for channels might fail the arbitrary and capricious test,that is not what the commission has done.rather,the commission has simply announced limited circumstances in which it will waive the requirements.having addressed only the minimum distance requirements for channels,congress did not implicitly restrict the commission authority with regard to the separate but related issue of channel requirements.
in sum,congress spoke directly to channel minimum distance separation protections but was silent regarding the commission authority to reduce or eliminate protections for other channels.moreover,the modification of the requirement and the announcement of a presumption favoring waiver of secondary status do not concern minimum requirements,and thus are not covered by the text of the statute at all.the limited nature of congress direction is unsurprising because the commission had already imposed protections on the other channels.other than acknowledging those existing protections,congress left undisturbed the commission authority to adopt regulations,including ones to modify the channel distance protection in section of its rules,to set standards for waiving channel minimum distance requirements in section,or to set standards for determining whether an lpfm station should be accorded primary status over an encroaching station.because congress did not address the subjects that are the focus of the nab challenges,the commission interpretation of the preservation act as limiting its authority only with respect to channel minimum distance requirements reflects the plain text and the context in which congress acted,and is neither demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters,mova pharm.shalala,quoting united states ron pair,d,nor contrary to common sense,id.
the nab challenges on apa grounds range from broad assertions of arbitrariness to more technical objections.while of varying force,none demonstrate,at least at this point,that the nab petition should be granted.although the commission maintains the nab contentions regarding the interim waiver policies are not ripe,see abbott labs.gardner,d natural res.def.council epa,at t fcc,whether the commission violated the apa notice and comment requirement in announcing waiver standards and the requirement that it provide an adequate explanation for its actions are questions of law where factual development would not aid review.see better gov t ass dep t of state.accordingly,these challenges are ripe,see sabre,dep t of,epa,although some of the nab other challenges are unripe.the challenges that are ripe lack merit.
as regards the commission weakening of channel interference protections under sections and,the nab asserts that a single unsupported sentence is the totality of the commission reasoning and fails to satisfy the apa requirement that the commission provide a reasoned explanation for the change.petr br.at.in that sentence,the commission stated based on signal strength ratio calculat
