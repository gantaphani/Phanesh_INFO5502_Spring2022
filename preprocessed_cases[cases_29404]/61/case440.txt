anti slapp motions 
section,subdivision b authorizes a special motion to strike causes of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states constitution or the california constitution in connection with a public issue the subdivision also provides that the motion shall be granted unless plaintiff establishes that there is a probability that plaintiff will prevail on the claim.
although hupp contends that his breach of contract cause of action does not refer to any free speech issue,the statute plainly applies to any cause of action that meets the statutory requirements.jarrow formulas,lamarche cal th.
the statute states the legislative purpose as follows the legislature finds and declares that there has been a disturbing increase in lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for redress of grievances.the legislature finds and declares that it is in the public interest to encourage continued participation in matters of public significance,and that this participation should not be chilled through abuse of the judicial process.to this end,this section shall be construed broadly,subd.a.
accordingly,the motion is directed against slapp suits.litigation which has come to be known as slapp is defined by the sociologists who coined the term as civil lawsuits that are aimed at preventing citizens from exercising their political rights or punishing those who have done so.citation.the paradigm slapp is a suit filed by a large developer against environmental activists or a neighborhood association intended to chill the defendants continued political or legal opposition to the developers plans.citations.slapp,however,are by no means limited to environmental issues citation,nor are the defendants necessarily local organizations with limited resources.citation.the favored causes of action in slapp suits are defamation,various business torts such as interference with prospective economic advantage,nuisance and intentional infliction of emotional distress.citation.plaintiffs in these actions typically ask for damages which would be ruinous to the defendants.citations.slapp suits are brought to obtain an economic advantage over the defendant,not to vindicate a legally cognizable right of the plaintiff.citation.thus,while slapp suits masquerade as ordinary lawsuits the conceptual features which reveal them as slapp are that they are generally meritless suits brought by large private interests to deter common citizens from exercising their political or legal rights or to punish them for doing so.citation.wilcox superior court th,overruled on other grounds in equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,fn.equilon.
while hupp complaint does not generally fit the above description of a typical slapp suit,it is subject to an motion if it fits within the statutory definition,which includes having the purpose of punishing the register for exercising its free speech rights.hupp appeal on this point provides only two sentences of argument and does not address the issues presented by the trial court decision.
the anti slapp motion in this case 
in reviewing an appeal from the decision granting the motion,we determine de novo whether the defendants made the threshold showing that the complaint arises from protected activity and if so,whether plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on its claim.equilon,supra,cal th at.
under section,subdivision b,the trial court in making these determinations considers the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.ibid.
applying these principles to this case,we conclude that defendants have established that the gravamen of the complaint was based on protected activity,and that plaintiff has not sufficiently demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the merits.
the register motion first argues that the register actions arise from its acts in furtherance of its free speech rights.it relies on the definitions of an act in furtherance of a person right of free speech in section,subdivision e.that section provides four categories of such acts.the register cites the final two any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest,or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e.
the register then cites tamkin cbs broadcasting,th.in that case,the court held that a n act is in furtherance of the right of free speech if the act helps to advance that right or assists in the exercise of that right.citation.id.at.the register contends that its maintenance of a website that publishes articles of public interest,such as the pension article in this case,and that allows user comments on such articles,facilitates free speech and the exchange of ideas and opinions on the internet.
