background 
martin and her two sons were arrested on august,after police,who suspected a drug ring was operating out of her house,searched her home and found marijuana,scales,plastic bags,and drug paraphernalia.martin and her sons were charged with various offenses related to the possession of narcotics and drug paraphernalia.
local newspapers reported martin arrest.on august,the connecticut post,stamford advocate,and greenwich time,all owned by defendant appellee hearst corporation,published articles online,stating that martin had been arrested and charged with numerous drug violations after police received information that a pair of brothers were sic selling marijuana in town.on august,defendant appellee news interactive llc published an internet article that reported that martin was arrested on after police say they confiscated grams of marijuana,scales and traces of cocaine from her house.martin concedes that these reports were accurate at the time they were published.the articles remain available online.
more than a year after the defendants published the reports of martin arrest,the state of connecticut decided not to pursue its case against her,and a nolle prosequi was entered in january.because the criminal case against her was nolled,martin arrest records were erased pursuant to the erasure statute 
after the case against her was nolled,martin asked each of the defendants to remove the accounts of her arrest from their respective websites.in her view,once erasure occurred in january,it became false and defamatory to report of her arrest because,by operation of the erasure statute,she is deemed to have never been arrested within the meaning of the general statutes with respect to the proceedings so erased.e.
when the defendants refused to remove the stories from their websites,martin filed suit in the united states district court for the district of connecticut,asserting causes of action for libel,placing another in a false light before the public,negligent infliction of emotional distress,and invasion of privacy by appropriation.the district court shea,awarded summary judgment to the defendants on all claims.it reasoned that the deemer provision of connecticut erasure laws does not alter the historical fact that martin was arrested and that all of martin claims necessarily fail because there is no genuine dispute that the reports of her arrest in the articles at issue remain as true now as on the date they were first published.martin hearst,mps,wl,at.
on appeal to this court,martin reiterates her argument that,even though she was arrested,once erasure occurred in january,it became false and defamatory to publish statements regarding that arrest.
the consequences of a criminal arrest are and,even where an individual is subsequently found not guilty or the charges against him are dismissed.employers or landlords might,for example,discriminate against prospective employees or tenants who have arrest records without distinguishing those merely arrested from those arrested and subsequently convicted.to protect individuals who are arrested but not convicted from the adverse effects of an arrest record,state west,the erasure statute wipes the slate clean by p rohibiting the subsequent use of records of a prior arrest and court proceedings,state morowitz,and requiring the state to erase official records of an arrest if the individual is subsequently found not guilty or pardoned or if the charges against him are nolled or dismissed.
the erasure statute further provides that a ny person who shall have been the subject of such an erasure shall be deemed to have never been arrested within the meaning of the general statutes with respect to the proceedings so erased and may so swear under oath.e.the statute thus insulat es the defendant from the consequences of the prior prosecution by ensuring that the defendant is no longer considered to have been arrested for the alleged crimes to which the records pertained and allowing him to swear so under oath.state apt,alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.
the historical truth of martin arrest 
although martin concedes that she was,in fact,arrested on august,she argues that it became false to publish statements regarding the arrest after the charges against her were nolled.she reasons that the erasure statute rendered it factually false to continue to state that she was arrested and that the defendants reports have become defamatory.
martin misunderstands the effect of the erasure statute.subsection e deems a person to have never been arrested.e emphasis added.that is to say,as a matter of legal fiction,the defendant is no longer considered to have been arrested.thus,the erasure statute bars the government from relying on a defendant erased police,court,or prosecution records in a later trial,morowitz,at,prohibits courts from relying on the defendant historical status as an arrestee to enhance his sentence for a later offense,apt.at,and entitles a defendant to swear under oath that he has never been arrested.e.if the state decides to reverse course and charge a defendant whose records have been erased,it may not simply reactivate the nolled charges,but must instead charge the defendant in a new information as if he had not previously been arrested and charged.state anonymous,n per curiam.
w e are bound to interpret connecticut law according to connecticut own interpretive rules.morenz wilson coker,cir.under those rules,t he meaning of a statute shall,in the first instance,be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes.it therefore matters that the statute appears in the criminal procedure title of the connecticut general statutes title,not the title dealing with civil actions title.the legislature evidently did not intend to provide a basis for defamation suits.
accordingly,the statute only requires that certain official records be erased the few enumerated exceptions to the erasure requirements and the statute text confirm that the legislature contemplated erasure only in the context of the judicial and law enforcement systems as the district court reasoned,n othing in suggests any intent to impose requirements on persons who work outside courts or law enforcement agencies,and nothing suggests any intent to mandate the erasure of records held by such persons.martin,wl,at.
in short,the erasure statute requires the state to erase certain official records of an arrest and grants the defendant the legal status of one who has not been arrested.but the erasure statute effects end there.the statute creates legal fictions,but it does not and can not undo historical fa
