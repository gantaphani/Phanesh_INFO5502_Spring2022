the city of league city,texas,challenges being permanently enjoined from enforcing,as unconstitutional,its ordinance the ordinance,regulating street vendors and solicitors.the city contends the two plaintiff newspapers,the houston chronicle and the galveston county daily news,lack standing the injunction should be vacated for mootness because,of the injunction,the city repealed the constitutionally impermissible provisions and the provision,which regulates only street vendors conduct at intersections,is a constitutional restriction.the newspapers respond they have standing vacatur due to mootness is improper because such mootness resulted from the city voluntary actions is unconstitutional,as held by the district court and it erred in not awarding them attorney fees.
both newspapers have standing.further,the injunction will not be vacated.because the remaining provision,has never been applied to the newspapers,however,and,because its plain language is and,we reverse the district court holding it unconstitutional,both facially and as applied.pursuant to the newspapers,we reverse the district court refusal to award attorney fees to them,because they remain prevailing parties on their claim,pursuant to.vacated in part reversed in part remanded.
the instant dispute a related texas action,in which the houston chronicle sued city officials for prosecuting its street vendors for violating texas transportation code a prohibiting street solicitations,except by charitable organizations.that action ended in march with a consent judgment permanently enjoining the city from prosecuting houston chronicle vendors under this state law.houston chronicle pub.sistrunk,judicial district court,galveston county,texas march.
the ordinance is similar to the above texas law.as noted,most of it was voluntarily repealed after entry of the injunction in this action,leaving only,quoted below.the ordinance required,inter alia,any solicitor,peddler,canvasser,or itinerant vendor,prior to engaging in any business and related activities,to register with the city submit to a criminal background check pay a fee and post a bond.league city,ordinances art.ii,and.the ordinance exempted m inors conducting fundraising activities who represent a youth organization,including,but not limited to boy scouts,girl scouts,little league groups,and school groups.id.at c.
in january,approximately nine months after the consent judgment,the city amended the ordinance to add.that section is primarily at issue in this appeal and states,in part 
a no person who is within a public roadway may solicit or sell or distribute any material to the occupant of any motor vehicle stopped on a public roadway in obedience to a traffic control signal light.it is specifically provided,however,that a person,other than a person twelve years of age or younger,may solicit or sell or distribute material to the occupant of a motor vehicle on a public roadway so long as he or she remains on the surrounding sidewalks and unpaved shoulders,and not in or on the roadway itself,including the medians and islands.
id.at emphasis added.
a year after the consent judgment,and several months after was added,the city,using a related ordinance provision,issued citations to two houston chronicle vendors selling newspapers at the intersection of state highway fm and interstate,for soliciting without a permit.id.at making it unlawful for any peddler,solicitor,canvasser or itinerant vendor to conduct business on any public roadway,public roadway median,public sidewalk or other public property within the city without written authorization from the city.as a result,the houston chronicle and the daily news filed this action in august,pursuant to,claiming the ordinance violated the first and fourteenth amendments.
that october,the district court permanently enjoined enforcement of the ordinance,holding it unconstitutional,both facially and as applied to prohibit newspaper sales on public streets.regarding the recently enacted and,the court found the city allows charitable organizations,firefighters to solicit donations for their causes at the intersection in issue while prosecuting the newspapers vendors for engaging in constitutionally protected activity because the newspapers activities are commercial,rather than charitable.houston chronicle pub.city of league city,no.mem.hereinafter usdc opn.the district court did not find,however,that the city ever prosecuted,or threatened to prosecute,the newspapers under.but implicit in its findings is the suggestion that the city will do so.id.at.in any event,the district court held section can not be justified as a valid time,place and manner restriction because the city de facto discriminates in enforcing it based on the content of the message being conveyed.id.at.the city filed its notice of appeal that november.the following january,however,it voluntarily repealed the provisions of the ordinance pertaining to registration,bond posting,and solicitation it did not repeal.
first at issue is whether the newspapers have standing.because they do,next at issue is whether the injunction should be vacated due to mootness.it is not vacated because the mootness is due to the city voluntarily repealing portions of the ordinance.the remaining issues are whether the district court erred in holding unconstitutional due to the city repealing the other ordinance provisions,only the constitutionality vel non of remains and in denying attorney fees to the newspapers.
the city maintains both newspapers lack standing to challenge the repealed provisions of the ordinance,claiming the controversy as to those provisions is moot.mootness as it relates to vacatur is addressed in part.concerning the remaining provision,the city conceded at oral argument here that the houston chronicle has standing to challenge that section.of course,we,not the parties,determine such jurisdictional questions.the city continues,however,to contend the daily news lacks standing to challenge because it failed to present evidence it engages in sales prohibited by that provision.
standing issues are reviewed de novo,rivera,cir.no authority need be cited for our standard of review for findings of fact.the district court held both newspapers have standing because each demonstrated practices of sales in the city.usdc opn.at.
to establish standing,a plaintiff must show it has suffered,or imminently will suffer,a concrete and particularized the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant conduct and a favorable judgment is likely to redress the injury,lujan defenders of wildlife,d.as the parties agree,both newspapers satisfy the causation and redressability requirements.therefore,at issue is whether the newspapers can demonstrate injury for the repealed provisions and for.
toward this end,the newspapers rely on a april letter from the city attorney,which indicated the city would prosecute them under.the letter acknowledged possible constitutional problems with subjecting the newspapers to the ordinance permitting requirements,pursuant to,but stated 
it is our position that in all other respects the ordinance represents a reasonable exercise of the city police power as the city police chief made clear in his comments at a meeting that april,houston chronicle salespeople are,in certain instances,setting up shop in the center of a painted,unimproved median on a busy road intersecting interstate south.enforcement of the ordinance will minimize the possibility of serious bodily injury or death for these individuals.in the face of these known circumstances,i can not imagine that either the houston chronicle or daily news would wish to be recognized for having advocated a repeal of these safety measures at the risk of their employees safety and.
concerning the houston chronicle,the city issued two citations to its vendors at the intersection,pursuant to the ordinance permitting requirements in and related sections.although the correspondence intimates the city would not further prosecute both newspapers under,it clearly indicated it will do so under.the houston chronicle has demonstrated sufficient injury to establish standing for the repealed provisions and,as discussed below,for.
regarding the daily news,and contrary to the city contentions,it has demonstrated it engages in sales in the city that would subject its vendors to prosecution under the ordinance in general and in particular.in addition to the evidence the district court found sufficient which finding the city does not show was clearly erroneous,this court granted the daily news february motion to supplement the record on appeal,adding evidence that,following entry of the injunction,the daily news began selling newspapers at the intersection.that motion was filed after the city november notice of appeal and its january repeal of most of the ordinance.allowing the supplementation was appropriate in the light of this conduct by the city.of course,after the notice was filed,the evidence could not be filed in district court without our remanding for that purpose.
chilling a plaintiff speech is a constitutional harm adequate to satisfy the requirement.meese keene,d holding exhibitor showed chill sufficient to meet objective injury requirement by demonstrating reputational injuries that would result from labeling films political propaganda under the foreign agents registration act but see laird tatum,d holding unspecified a llegations of a subjective chill are not an adequate substitute for a claim of specific present objective harm or a threat of specific future harm.
although,unlike the houston chronicle,the daily news has not been issued a citation under the ordinance,it has shown a chilling of its first amendment activities under the repealed ordinance provisions.both newspapers have shown such effect for,and both have shown imminent future prosecution if the city is not enjoined.therefore,each newspaper has demonstrated specific injury beyond mere subjective chill.meese,at.lujan,at.thus,like the houston chronicle,the daily news has satisfied the requirement.
this result is consistent with broader supreme court and fifth circuit precedent.see,steffel thompson,d it is not necessary that a party first expose himself to actual arrest or prosecution to be entitled to challenge a statute that he claims deters the exercise of his constitutional rights int l soc y for krishna consciousness of atlanta eaves,cir a justiciable controversy exists when the plaintiff is seriously interested in disobeying,and the defendant seriously intent on enforcing,the challenged measure.
the city asserts its repealing parts of the ordinance renders the newspapers earlier challenge to those parts moot and,as a result,the injunction should be vacated.the newspapers concede their challenge to the repealed provisions is obviously moot but,they claim the city should not be permitted to evade the injunction by selectively repealing provisions.we reject the city contention.
it goes without saying that disputes concerning repealed legislation are generally moot.see,commc ns of the,city of austin,cir citing united states munsingwear.nevertheless,v acatur of the lower court judgment is warranted only where mootness has occurred through happenstance,rather than through voluntary action of the losing party.murphy fort worth indep.sch,cir per curiam citing arizonans for official english arizona,d emphasis added see also staley harris county,texas,wl,at cir en banc.as the supreme court held in bancorp mortgage bonner mall partnership,d if mootness results from the losing party voluntary actions,that party has forfeited his legal remedy by the ordinary process of appeal,thereby surrendering his claim to the equitable remedy of vacatur.to allow a party to employ the secondary remedy of vacatur as a refined form of collateral attack on the judgment apart from any considerations of fairness to the the orderly operation of the federal judicial system.id.at.see also,commc ns of the,at vacatur does not lie when the party seeking relief from the district court judgment caused the mootness by voluntary action quoting bancorp,at.sierra club glickman,cir refusing to vacate where the issue was rendered moot by the losing party voluntary compliance with the judgment.
in response to this authority,the city points to two cases each is readily distinguishable.in arizonans for official english,the supreme court vacated a judgment as moot because the state employee,who was challenging the arizona constitutional amendment requiring state employees to speak only english,quit her employment while her appeal was pending.at.because the employee was not the loser in the judgment,the bancorp rule was not involved.
similarly,in communications of the southwest,our court vacated a judgment due to mootness when the ordinance at issue was superseded by a texas state law.that law was passed while the appeal was pending and prohibited the ordinance.at.contrary to the city contentions,this case also does not concern the bancorp rule because,again,the mootness was not caused by the losing party actions rather,the texas legislature created it by enacting the new law.id.
our decision here finds further support in our court recent en banc decision in staley,in which we refused to vacate an injunction against a religious display outside a texas courthouse after the voluntarily removed it.at,wl,at.as emphasized in staley,vacatur is an extraordinary and equitable remedy,to be determined on a basis,governed by facts and not inflexible rules.id.at,wl,at citing,at.the burden is on the party seeking relief from the status quo that party must demonstrate equitable entitlement to the extraordinary writ of vacatur,at.
in holding the in staley had not made such a showing,our en banc court distinguished several cases granting vacatur even though the controversy was mooted by the losing party voluntary action.see,russman bd.of,cir granting vacatur and differentiating between voluntary conduct purposefully taken to moot a controversy,and voluntary conduct entirely unrelated to the lawsuit,such as the graduating from school khodara,beckman,cir granting vacatur when no evidence suggested the legislation responded to the unfavorable judgment black police ass dist.of columbia,vacating judgment as moot when challenged limits were removed before the district court enjoined them.as noted in staley,equitable factors distinguish these cases from the instant case,including whether plaintiffs obtained full relief in district court before the defendants mooted the case and the extent to which to the litigation were impacted by the district court judgment,wl,at.
consistent with staley,and unlike russman,khodara environmental,and national black police association,the equitable factors in the instant case weigh against vacating the district court injunction.contrary to russman,the action did not result from typical progression of events,such as a student graduating from school.distinct from khodara environmental,the city has not shown its repealing the ordinance provisions was not in response to the district court judgment.and unlike national black police association,the newspapers obtained full relief in district court before league city repealed most of the ordinance.moreover,the ordinance has been applied exclusively against the newspapers,rather than to this litigation.therefore,we refuse to vacate the injunction.
as discussed,the only provision not voluntarily repealed,was held unconstitutional by the district court.the city contends is a constitutionally permissible,time,place,and manner restriction,narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling governmental interest.see konigsberg state bar of,d general regulatory ordinances not intended to control the content of speech but incidentally limiting its unfettered exercise,have not been regarded as the type of law the first or fourteenth amendments forbade.
despite its ultimately holding unconstitutional,the district court found has no discriminatory intent.usdc opn.at.consistent with the letter from the city attorney,the city relies on this finding to maintain its purpose is one of public safety to prohibit the dangerous activity of solicitors entering busy traffic intersections.toward this end,the city demonstrated at trial that newspaper in nearby cities had been seriously in
