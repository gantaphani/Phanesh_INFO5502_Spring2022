in connection with the congressionally mandated switch from analog to digital broadcast television transmission on february,the federal communications commission promulgated regulations requiring cable systems with subscribers either to transmit,for three years after the date of transition,both analog and digital signals of broadcast channels,or to switch to an system.carriage of digital television broadcast signals,third report and order,viewability order.various cable programmers challenge the regulations on statutory and constitutional grounds.because petitioners have not met their heavy burden as parties to show that they have article iii standing,we must dismiss the petition.
under the communications act,cable operators with twelve or more channels are required to devote up to one third of their usable activated channels to the signals of local commercial broadcast television stations.b b.the act further provides that 
signals carried in fulfillment of the requirements of this section shall be provided to every subscriber of a cable system.such signals shall be viewable via cable on all television receivers of a subscriber which are connected to a cable system by a cable operator or for which a cable operator provides a connection.if a cable operator authorizes subscribers to install additional receiver connections,but does not provide the subscriber with such connections,or with the equipment and materials for such connections,the operator shall offer to sell or lease a converter box to such subscribers at regulated rates.
id.b emphasis added.with regard to noncommercial broadcast stations,the act mandates that each cable operator of a cable system shall carry the signals of qualified noncommercial educational television stations,id.a,and that such signals shall be available to every subscriber as part of the lowest priced service tier that includes the retransmission of local commercial television broadcast signals,id.h.the commercial and noncommercial transmissions that cable systems are required to transmit are broadcast signals.the constitutionality of the act was upheld in turner broadcasting system,fcc,d turner ii,and is not at issue here.
under the digital television transition and public safety act of full power television stations,a category that includes certain local commercial and noncommercial stations,are required to switch their broadcast transmissions from analog to digital format by february.the requirement that broadcast television stations switch to signals does not,however,extend to cable systems.these are generally free to choose their own mix of analog and digital technology.however,pursuant to b a,g,which prohibit material degradation of the signals of stations,the commission has required cable operators to transmit in hd any signals delivered to them in hd by stations.carriage of digital television broadcast signals,first report and order.as millions of cable customers lack the equipment required to view digital cable transmissions,these analog cable consumers would be unable to view local broadcast stations transmitted in digital format only.
on may,responding to the prospect that some local broadcast stations might not be available to analog cable subscribers,the commission issued a notice of proposed rulemaking nprm seek ing comment on the obligations of cable operators.carriage of digital television broadcast signals,nprm.after receiving comments,the commission,on november,issued the viewability order in which the commission adopted rules establishing a viewability mandate,requiring that to the extent that cable subscribers do not have the capability of viewing digital signals,cable systems must carry the signals of commercial and stations in analog format to those subscribers,after downconverting the signals from their original digital format.viewability order,at.under separate regulations promulgated in regarding material degradation,b a,g,where a broadcaster delivers its signal to a cable operator in hd digital format as opposed to sd,the cable operator is required to transmit the station in hd thus,the combined effect of the material degradation regulations and the viewability order is that cable systems with analog and digital subscribers hybrid systems are effectively required to allocate two channels to each hd broadcaster.alternatively,cable systems are permitted to become,with all subscribers able to view digital signals under this option,only digital signals need be broadcast.the commission specified that any downconversion costs will be borne by the cable operator,at,and further provided that the viewability mandate would apply for an initial period following the february digital transition date.
the commission,as relevant,found that any incremental increase of bandwidth devoted to stations would be negligible,at internal quotations omitted,and that any concerns of individual cable channels about being crowded out of cable systems were outweighed by congressional concern for broadcast channels.it further noted that insofar as its requirements spurred a move to cable systems,total channel capacity might actually be increased.in concluding that the viewability provisions survived intermediate first amendment scrutiny,the commission noted that the option for cable systems was significantly less burdensome than the analog mandate upheld by the supreme court in turner i because digital signals occupy much less bandwidth on a cable system than do analog signals.id.at.finally,the commission underscored that its viewability provisions were in line with the approach already voluntarily planned by many cable operators.id.at.
the cable operators themselves have not challenged the viewability order.instead,petitioners are cable programmers who fear that access to cable operators systems will become more difficult because of the viewability mandate.they contend that the requirements of the viewability order are contrary to the plain meaning of the communications act,are arbitrary and capricious,and violate their first amendment rights.while the court would consider the familiar standard set out in chevron,nrdc,d,in reviewing an agency interpretation of a statute that it is required to implement,and review de novo a challenge to the constitutionality of the regulations,jifry faa,the commission has raised a threshold challenge to petitioners standing under article iii of the constitution.
article iii standing is reviewed under the standard established by lujan defenders of wildlife,d,and contains three elements.in order to establish standing,a party must have suffered an,by showing an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.id.at.internal quotations and citations omitted.in addition,the injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant,and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.id.internal quotations and alterations omitted.finally,it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.id.at.internal quotations omitted.w hen the petitioner is not itself the object of the government action or inaction petitioner challenges,standing is not precluded,but it is ordinarily substantially more difficult to establish.id.at.internal quotations omitted.in this latter situation it becomes the burden of the petitioner to adduce facts showing that choices by parties directly affected by a regulation have been or will be made in such manner as to produce causation and permit redressability of injury.id.
petitioners theory of standing is that by requiring increases in the percentage of bandwidth devoted by hybrid cable systems to channels,the viewability order ensures that hybrid cable systems will have less bandwidth to devote to other uses,including cable programming.this increases the competitive pressure faced by cable programmers as they attempt to sell their wares to cable systems,which have less bandwidth to fill and can thus afford to drive harder bargains with potential suppliers.in addition to im
