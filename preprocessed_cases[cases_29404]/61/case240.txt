due to a conflict of interest,the county attorney for hcao,amy klobuchar hennepin county attorney klobuchar,referred koblick complaint to michael fahey,the county attorney for neighboring carver county carver county attorney fahey.following an investigation conducted by the carver county attorney office,on january,a carver county grand jury indicted knight on four counts of violating minnesota statute,subdivision by using knowingly false and misleading claims in his paid political advertising material 
on january,the party filed the present civil action on behalf of knight and its other members,in the united states district court for the district of minnesota,against hennepin county attorney klobuchar and carver county attorney fahey the defendants,in their official capacities only.in count i,the party alleged that by prosecuting knight the defendants are violating the party freedom of association rights to determine membership requirements and define what a republican is and are chilling and members of the party from discussions regarding membership and what a republican is for the and elections.in count ii,the party alleged that by prosecuting knight the defendants,in violation of the first amendment,are chilling its and party members free speech rights to declare who is or is not a republican.in count iii,the party brought a first amendment facial overbreadth challenge to,subdivision.finally,in count iv,added via an amended complaint,the party alleged that certain statements made by counsel for carver county attorney fahey after this case was filed have resulted in continued intimidation by the defendants that has further chilled party members free speech and left them in fear of prosecution.the challenged statements were to the effect that,in prosecuting knight,the defendants only did what the law required them to do.as relief,the party first amended complaint seeks a permanent injunction against the prosecution of knight and its other members under,subdivision for establishing party membership requirements a declaration that,subdivision is facially and as applied to the facts of this case unconstitutional and reimbursement for all litigation costs,expenses,and expert witness fees as allowed by law.notably,the party expressly alleged in its first amended complaint that it did not and has not taken a position on whether john knight was the only republican candidate in the race for hennepin county commissioner,district number.

on september,during the pendency of this appeal,the state court dismissed with prejudice the four criminal charges against knight for violating,subdivision.the dismissal with prejudice came as the result of knight fulfillment of an agreement to read a scripted apology into the court record and to make a total donation of to nonpolitical charities.
the gravamen of the party three first amendment challenges is that knight,subdivision prosecution for use of the telephone script claiming to be the lone republican candidate in the race for hennepin county commissioner,district,is chilling it and its members from defining and expressing membership policies as well as making membership determinations.the district court dismissed these three claims on the alternative grounds of lack of standing,see fed.civ.proc.b,and younger abstention.see younger,at.the party challenges the district court action as erroneous.
