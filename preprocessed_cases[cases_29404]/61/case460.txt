penal code section,subdivision b provides that grand jury transcripts shall be open to the public after an indictment issues unless the court finds a reasonable likelihood that their release will prejudice the defendant right to a fair trial,subd.b.the first amendment of the united states constitution guarantees the press and the public a right of access to certain judicial proceedings and precludes their closure unless the court finds that access will create a substantial probability of prejudice and finds there are no less restrictive measures that would ameliorate the harm.superior court,d ii nbc subsidiary,superior court cal th,d,nbc subsidiary.
the reasonable likelihood standard of section places a lesser burden on a defendant seeking to prevent dissemination of grand jury transcripts than would the substantial probability standard that applies to public access cases under the first amendment.superior court th,d,fn.iii.as we explain below,we conclude the first amendment right of access does not extend to postindictment grand jury transcripts at a section hearing,and that a defendant seeking to seal such transcripts pending the completion of trial need only establish prejudice under the lesser reasonable likelihood standard of section.
background 
officer richard may of the east palo alto police department was shot and killed on january.defendant was arrested as a suspect a few days later.local news media covered the case extensively,and articles about the crime,the victim and defendant appeared both in print and on the internet.
on august,defendant was indicted by a grand jury and charged with first degree murder with special circumstances,namely,that a peace officer was killed in the line of duty,subd.a,subds.a,b c.the indictment also charged defendant with felon in possession of a firearm,subd.a and alleged that he had personally discharged a firearm causing great bodily injury or death,subd.d,that he had committed the murder while on parole,subd.b,that he was ineligible for probation by virtue of a prior felony conviction,subd.e and that he had previously served a prison term for a felony offense,subd.b.
after the indictment issued,the trial court ordered that the grand jury transcripts would be provided to the district attorney and the defendant,but would otherwise remain under seal pending further order.defendant filed a motion to seal the transcripts until the completion of his trial pursuant to section,subdivision b.san jose mercury news,mercury news opposed the motion,and defendant filed a reply challenging the paper standing to participate.mercury news filed a separate motion to unseal the grand jury transcripts.the district attorney took no position as to whether the transcripts should be released.
a hearing was held at which defendant presented the testimony of two expert witnesses in support of his request that the transcripts remain sealed.lewis leader,a former newspaper reporter and editor,was offered as an expert on journalistic practices regarding stories about crimes and the courts.edward bronson,a social scientist with a degree in law,discussed the effects of pretrial publicity on the fairness of a trial,as well as the efficacy of voir dire in preventing prejudice.both opined that the amount of media coverage on the case had been extensive,that the victim had been portrayed positively throughout,that the defendant had been portrayed very negatively,and that release of the grand jury transcripts would reignite public interest in the case and increase media coverage.
the trial court granted mercury news motion to unseal after redacting irrelevant and unduly prejudicial material.it concluded that the public and press have a qualified first amendment right of access to grand jury transcripts after an indictment has issued,therefore,federal constitutional law required release of the transcripts unless doing so would create a substantial probability of prejudice,which defendant had not demonstrated.the court rejected defendant argument that he need only show a reasonable likelihood of prejudice as provided under section,subdivision b t he statutory language in section b is unconstitutional to the extent that it ignores the constitutional dimension of this problem.
defendant filed a petition for writ of mandate prohibition in this court seeking an order that the grand jury transcripts remain sealed.mercury news filed informal opposition.we summarily denied the petition.the supreme court granted review and transferred the matter back to this court with directions to issue an order to show cause why the relief sought by defendant should not be granted.we set a date for filing a return,continued the trial court stay of its order unsealing the grand jury transcripts,and calendared the matter for oral argument.
ii.discussion 
defendant contends the order unsealing the grand jury transcripts must be vacated because the trial court imposed a higher burden of proof upon him than required under california law when it considered whether the pretrial release of the transcripts would create a substantial probability of prejudice.he argues that under section,subdivision b,he needed only to prove a reasonable likelihood of prejudice for the transcripts to remain sealed pending the completion of his trial.defendant also argues that mercury news lacked standing to participate in the hearing below.we conclude that mercury news had standing to participate in the hearing,but agree with defendant that the court should have applied the reasonable likelihood standard of section,subdivision b.
defendant contends the district attorney was the only party other than himself entitled to participate in the hearing to determine whether the transcripts should remain sealed.we disagree.at the time of the hearing,the grand jury transcripts had been ordered sealed pending further order by the court.mercury news was entitled to seek inspection of the transcripts and properly did so by filing a motion to unseal.cal.rules of court,rule h a party or member of the public may move,apply,or petition to unseal a record.craemer superior court d,fn.reporter had standing to seek writ of mandate to inspect sealed grand jury transcripts.
defendant acknowledges that a member of the press is entitled to challenge an order sealing grand jury transcripts,but suggests the court should have first ruled on his motion to seal,and then separately addressed mercury news motion to unseal the transcripts in the event his motion was granted.bifurcating the hearing in this manner would have elevated form over substance when the court ultimate task was to determine whether release of the transcripts would prejudice defendant fair trial rights.the trial court did not err when it considered the motions to seal and unseal in a single hearing.
b.the public right to grand jury transcripts under section 
california has provided for a secret grand jury since the inception of its criminal justice system.people superior court mouchaourab th,d.but unlike many other jurisdictions,this state permits the release of grand jury transcripts to the public once an indictment has been returned.see judicial council of,to governor and leg.sealing of criminal transcripts before trial,california is one of the few states that has rejected the traditional secrecy of grand jury transcripts.contrast fed.rules,rule e,
the california constitution,as adopted in,left to the legislature the adoption of specific rules for the operation of the grand jury.it provided offenses heretofore required to be prosecuted by indictment shall be prosecuted by information,after examination and commitment by a magistrate,or by indictment,with or without such examination and commitment,as may be prescribed by law.cal,art.i,former.as we explained in fitts superior court cal d,the constitutional convention of by failing to make further provisions as to the grand jury left to the l egislature all questions affecting the grand jury not expressly covered by the constitution.daily journal superior court cal th,fn,d.
as early as,former section required that a reporter transcribe grand jury proceedings for delivery to the county clerk and further provided,the county clerk shall not exhibit said transcript to any person other than the district attorney nor divulge any of the contents thereof until after the defendant is in custody.stats,ch.implicit in this statute was the county clerk authority to release the transcripts to the public after the defendant was taken into custody,though it is not clear from case law or legislative history whether this was done as a matter of routine.
section was replaced by sections and in.section continued the practice of allowing release of the grand jury transcripts after the defendant was indicted and taken into custody if an indictment has been found or an accusation presented against a defendant,the stenographic reporter shall certify and file with the county clerk an original transcription of his shorthand notes the county clerk shall deliver the original of the transcript so filed with him to the district attorney immediately upon his receipt thereof and shall deliver a copy of such transcript upon each such defendant or his attorney the county clerk shall not exhibit the transcript to any person other than the district attorney nor divulge any of its contents until after the defendant is in custody.stats,ch.
in craemer superior court,supra,d,this court considered the circumstances under which grand jury transcripts could be withheld from the public once an indictment issued.we granted a petition for writ of mandate filed by a newspaper reporter who sought to inspect grand jury transcripts that had been sealed by the trial judge in an effort to minimize pretrial publicity.id.at.we explained,in the case before us there is no statutory provision restricting the inspection of the grand jury transcripts after the indictment and apprehension of the defendants.therefore,the actions of the grand jury and the record of its proceedings should not be unnecessarily,and without reason,withheld from public scrutiny after the indictment and apprehension of the defendants unless a countervailing public policy requires such a restriction.id.at.
we noted in craemer that a trial court may limit disclosure of grand jury transcripts in cases where doing so is necessary to limit pretrial publicity that could impair a defendant right to a fair trial.see craemer superior court,supra,d at.the effect of the trial court order in that case,however,was to permanently deny the right of public inspection of the grand jury records in question.we think that such an order is unreasonable since the only justifiable purpose of the order is to prevent public knowledge of inadmissible matter prior to the completion of the defendant trial.to extend the order beyond this justifiable purpose in the present case does violence to the general policy of this state that public records and documents be kept open for public inspection in order to prevent secrecy in public affairs the trial judge indicated purpose in the present case can be accomplished by affording an indicted defendant a reasonable opportunity to examine the grand jury transcript for objectionable matter,and,if such is found,to move the court that such matter be held from public scrutiny until after trial of the case.id.at.
recognizing the need for a procedure to determine whether and on what terms grand jury transcripts should be withheld from the public pending a defendant trial,the legislature responded to craemer by amending section in to include subdivision b the grand jury transcript shall not be open to the public until days after its delivery to the defendant or his attorney.thereafter the transcript shall be open to the public unless the court orders otherwise on its own motion or on motion of a party pending a determination as to whether all or part of the transcript should be sealed.if the court determines that there is a reasonable likelihood that making all or any part of the transcript public may prejudice a defendant right to a fair and impartial trial,that part of the transcript shall be sealed until the defendant trial has been completed.stats,ch,see judicial council of,to governor and,supra,italics added.with the exception of a minor,nonsubstantive change to the first sentence,the language of subdivision b,and its reference to a reasonable likelihood of prejudice,has remained unchanged since its enactment 
constitutional right of access to judicial proceedings 
after the enactment of section,subdivision b,the united states supreme court decided a series of cases recognizing that the first amendment,in conjunction with the fourteenth,gives the press and the public a presumed right of access to criminal trials and certain other judicial proceedings.ii,supra,at.superior court of cal,d i globe newspaper superior court,d richmond newspapers,virginia,d.this right is implicit in the enumerated first amendment rights of speech,press and assembly,which share a common core purpose of assuring freedom of communication on matters relating to the functioning of government.richmond newspapers,virginia,supra,at.
the constitutional right of access to judicial proceedings is not absolute.the publicity generated by such access can sometimes jeopardize a criminal defendant right to a fair trial by exposing jurors or prospective jurors to prejudicial and inadmissible information about the case.see people jackson th,d.the first amendment does not trump the duty of a trial judge to control adverse publicity to protect the right of an accused to a fair trial.in re willon th,d.a court faced with an access claim that has the potential to infect the fairness of legal proceedings must perform the difficult task of balancing these respective constitutional interests f ree speech and fair trials are two of the most cherished policies of our civilization,and it is a trying task to choose between them.people jackson,supra,th at,d,citing bridges california.
when the press and public have a first amendment right of access to a particular type of judicial proceeding,it can not be closed unless specific,on the record findings are made demonstrating that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.ii,supra,at.in cases where the higher value being asserted is the right of a criminal defendant to a fair trial,the defense must demonstrate that first,there is a substantial probability that the defendant right to a fair trial will be prejudiced by publicity that closure would prevent and,second,reasonable alternatives to closure can not adequately protect the defendant fair trial rights.id.at.italics added.this substantial probability standard is constitutionally compelled and can not be satisfied by applying a lesser burden of proof to a party seeking closure.see id.at.
in ii,the united states supreme court established a test for determining whether a first amendment right of access attaches to a particular judicial proceeding.the first consideration is whether the place and process have historically been open to the press and general public.ii,supra,at.the second is whether public access plays a significant positive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.ibid.the court has utilized this analysis to extend the right of access to several phases of a criminal case the trial itself globe newspaper superior court,supra,at,including those phases of the trial that involve sensitive matters such as the testimony of a minor victim id.at,fn,voir dire i,supra,at,motions to suppress evidence waller georgia,fn,d recognizing right under sixth amendment public trial provision,but applying same standard as first amendment right of access cases and preliminary hearings ii,supra,at.the california supreme court has extended the right of public access to civil trials as well.nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d.
