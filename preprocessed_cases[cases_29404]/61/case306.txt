the washington department of corrections doc appeals from the grant of summary judgment and permanent injunctive relief on prison legal news and rollin wright collectively pln claim that the doc prohibition against the receipt by inmates of bulk mail and catalogs violates the first and fourteenth amendments.the thirteen individual defendants prison officials appeal from the denial of their motion for summary judgment based on their defense of qualified immunity from damages as a result of restricting inmates from receiving legal materials.
pln has filed a from the order granting summary judgment to the thirteen individuals based on their defense of qualified immunity regarding pln claim that the defendants violated its constitutional rights.
we affirm the district court decision.under the test laid out in turner safley,d,the doc ban on bulk mail and catalogs is not rationally related to a legitimate penological interest and is therefore unconstitutional.although the ban violates pln first amendment rights,the prison officials are entitled to qualified immunity because their actions did not violate clearly established law.we also hold that the district court did not err by declining to grant qualified immunity to the officials for their policies regarding legal materials.if the evidence produced at trial demonstrates that the doc applied its policy in a discriminatory fashion based on the content of the legal materials as pln contends,the prison officials are not entitled to qualified immunity because they violated clearly established law.the district court correctly concluded that this disputed factual question must be resolved at trial.
prison legal news is a washington nonprofit corporation that publishes and distributes publications regarding legal issues of interest to inmates,such as prisoners rights.it publishes a monthly subscription magazine,which has subscribers across the united states,including who are inmates in washington state correctional facilities.its editor,paul wright,is an inmate in a washington state correctional facility.
the prison officials are policymaking employees in the doc.the doc operates fifteen washington correctional institutions that house inmates.the doc employs approximately one mailroom staff person per persons served at each institution,including inmates and staff.
this is the fourth case since brought by pln against the doc.the previous cases are miniken walter,macfarlane walter,and humanists of washington lehman.
the doc policy directive,entitled mail for offenders,sets forth rules and procedures regarding mail delivery to inmates.the district court summarized the portions relevant to this appeal 
first,the directive prohibits inmates from receiving bulk mail unless that bulk mail is a subscription publication.in contrast to first and second class mail rejected due to prohibited content,n o rejection notice is required for bulk mail that is not a subscription publication.additionally,inmates are not permitted to receive catalogs by mail,whether sent first class,second class,or at a bulk mail rate.if mail other than that constituting bulk mail is rejected for delivery,inmates receive notice of the rejection and may appeal the decision.
prison legal news lehman,d,alterations in original citations omitted pln ii.the court further explained,the department defines bulk mail as m ail which is clearly marked or bulk rate.this type of mail is also referred to as bulk business mail or advertising mail and includes,but is not limited to,catalogs and circulars.id.at alterations in original citations and quotations omitted.the department defines catalog as a publication which is predominantly or substantially focused on offering items for sale.id.at alterations in original citations omitted.the court also explained the doc policy regarding legal material

mail which consists of judicial opinions published and unpublished,reports and recommendations,orders,complaints or answers,settlement agreements,class action notices,legal briefs and memoranda,and motions,and

pln sued the doc under,arguing that these regulations violated its first and fourteenth amendment rights.the district court held that the doc policies regarding non subscription bulk mail and catalogs violated pln first amendment rights,id.at,but that the officials were entitled to qualified immunity for their decisions.id.at.the district court further concluded that summary judgment was not appropriate for the claim regarding legal material,because resolution of these issues requires highly inquiries that are not amenable to summary determination.id.at.furthermore,the district court limited its finding of qualified immunity to the issues resolved on summary judgment,and expressed no opinion regarding whether the officials will be entitled to qualified immunity if pln should ultimately prevail on its claim regarding legal materials.id.at.
the district court had jurisdiction under.we have jurisdiction to review the district court decision to grant summary judgment for pln and its decision to grant qualified immunity to defendants regarding pln claims under.we have jurisdiction to review the grant of permanent injunctive relief to pln relating to catalogs and bulk mail and notice under a.
we have jurisdiction under over an interlocutory appeal regarding the issue of qualified immunity.wilkins city of oakland,cir citing jeffers gomez,cir per curiam schwenk hartford,cir.in such circumstances,however,appellate review is generally limited to issues of law,and does not extend to claims in which the determination of qualified immunity depends on disputed issues of material fact.wilkins,at quoting jeffers,at internal citation omitted.where disputed facts exist,we will determine if the denial of qualified immunity was proper by assuming that the version of events offered by the nonmoving party is correct.id.
the parties dispute whether we have jurisdiction over the officials assertion that the district court improperly denied qualified immunity from the claim relating to legal materials.pln argues that the officials waived their qualified immunity defense as to the legal material claim because they only asserted qualified immunity with regard to the bulk mail and catalog claims.we disagree.in their motion for summary judgment,the officials ask for qualified immunity,and do not specifically limit their request to the bulk mail and catalog claims.the heading on that portion of their argument is defendants should be entitled to qualified immunity from damages.the section of their motion addressing qualified immunity reads in its entirety 
in the event that this court determines plaintiffs constitutional rights were violated,defendants should be entitled to qualified immunity from damages.saucier katz,d.based on relevant case law in this and other circuits,as well as unpublished washington opinions,defendants reasonably believed that their policy,and actions in adopting and enforcing the catalog and bulk mail restrictions were lawful.see sorrels mckee.cir citing cook,at unpublished district court decisions may be considered for purposes of determining qualified immunity.
while the second sentence supports only their arguments based on the bulk mail and catalog claims,the first sentence of the argument does not limit the request in any way.we are persuaded that the officials did not waive their argument that they are entitled to qualified immunity from the claim concerning legal materials.
pln also argues that because the officials dispute the factual merits of the legal materials claim,rather than the legal basis,that claim is outside the scope of this court interlocutory jurisdiction.we disagree.as noted above,cases in this circuit establish that when disputed facts exist,we have jurisdiction to decide the claim,but must assume that the version of events offered by the nonmoving party is correct.wilkins,at.therefore,we have jurisdiction to hear the appeal of the district court denial of qualified immunity.
we review de novo a district court decision to grant or deny summary judgment.botosan paul mcnally realty,cir.we apply the same standard used by the trial court under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.meade cedarapids,cir.we must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.lopez smith,cir en banc.we also review a grant or denial of qualified immunity de novo.bahrampour lampert,cir.
we first consider whether the district court correctly found that pln was entitled to summary judgment on its claims that the ban on bulk mail and catalogs was unconstitutional.in prison legal news cook,cir pln i,we held that publishers and prisoners have a constitutionally protected right to receive subscription bulk mail and that a ban on bulk mail was unconstitutional as applied to such mail.id.at.in morrison,we held that a similar ban on subscription bulk mail was likewise unconstitutional.morrison hall,cir.in this case,we are squarely presented with the question of whether a ban on bulk mail and catalogs is also unconstitutional.
publishers have a first amendment right to communicate with prisoners by mail,and inmates have a first amendment right to receive this mail.pln i,at citing thornburgh abbott,d.but this right is subject to substantial limitations and restrictions in order to allow prison officials to achieve legitimate correctional goals and maintain institutional security.walker sumner,cir citations omitted.in order for the doc ban on bulk mail to be upheld,it must be reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.turner safley,at.
in turner,the supreme court laid out a test to determine whether a prison regulation is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests 
whether the regulation is rationally related to a legitimate and neutral governmental objective,whether there are alternative avenues that remain open to the inmates to exercise the right,the impact that accommodating the asserted right will have on other guards and prisoners,and on the allocation of prison resources and whether the existence of easy and obvious alternatives indicates that the regulation is an exaggerated response by prison officials.
pln ii,d at citing pln i,at and turner,at.the first factor of these factors constitutes sine qua non.walker,at.therefore,if a regulation is not rationally related to a legitimate and neutral governmental objective,a court need not reach the remaining three factors.id.as in the previous cases challenging restrictions on bulk mail,the district court in this case found that because the ban on bulk mail was not rationally related to a neutral government objective,it did not reach the remaining factors of the test.pln ii,d at holding that the court need not consider the other factors because the doc had failed to demonstrate the regulation was rationally related to a neutral government objective see also pln i,at same morrison,at same.
the doc offered four penological goals which it claims justifies the ban on bulk mail and catalogs reducing the volume of mail to be searched in order to increase the likelihood of mailroom staff preventing contraband from entering the facility reducing the amount of mail coming into the jail generally in order to reduce the amount of work required to sort the mail and deliver it to inmates reducing the amount of clutter in each inmate cell to reduce the risk of fires and reducing the amount of clutter in each inmate cell to make searching the cell and enforcing limitations on personal property more efficient and effective.
the doc offered the same arguments in the previous cases challenging bans on subscription mail,see pln i,at,and subscription mail,see morrison,at.we rejected each contention in those cases.
regarding the doc justification that the ban would reduce the volume of mail that may contain contraband,we believe that it is far more likely that contraband would be contained in first class mail than in bulk mail.the district court properly found that there is no rational relation between this regulation and the penological objective of reducing the amount of mail that may contain contraband.
the doc also argues that the regulation is justified because it reduces the volume of mail generally.our previous cases analyzing the efficient use of staff time argument also apply here.while the doc mailroom staff may have to spend more time analyzing the content of bulk rate mail and catalogs,such a ban on bulk rate mail and catalogs is not rationally related to the goal of reducing contraband.as we explained in morrison,p rohibiting inmates from receiving mail based on the postage rate at which the mail was sent is an arbitrary means of achieving the goal of volume control.morrison,at.
the doc also asserts that the restrictions help reduce the risk of fire.while a greater volume of mail will enter inmates cells as a result of our decision to void this regulation,it is irrational to prohibit prisoners from receiving bulk rate mail and catalogs on the theory that it reduces fire hazards because the doc already regulates the quantity of possessions that prisoners may have in their cells.see morrison,at holding that a lthough the number of subscription publications that enter the osp may be greater than the number of subscription publications,because the osp already regulates the quantity of possessions that prisoners may have in their cell,it is similarly irrational to prohibit prisoners from receiving subscription mail on the theory that it reduces fire hazards.
finally,we reject the doc proposition that this regulation is justified because it increases the efficiency of cell searches,for the same reason that we reject the fire hazard argument.see morrison,at in light of the regulation limiting the total amount of property in a cell permitting inmates to receive,subscription publications could not possibly increase the total volume of cell materials.pln i,at determining that a ban on subscription publications is not rationally related to the department interest in rendering efficient cell searches.
it should be noted that pln was not sending mail to washington correctional facilities to be distributed to all inmates,regardless of whether they had expressed interest in receiving it.this case is therefore distinguishable from jones north carolina prisoners labor union,d,in which the supreme court upheld a ban on junk mail sent indiscriminately to all inmates.in jones,the inmates were permitted to receive mail that was sent to them individually.id.at.in this case,every piece of mail sent by pln is sent as a result of a request by the recipient,but the inmates were not allowed to receive it.
the only way to distinguish this case from morrison and pln i is that the inmates in this case did not pay for the mail that was sent to them.but it is the fact that a request was made by the recipient,and not the fact that the recipient is paying to receive the publication,that is important.as a washington district court explained in one of the previous cases brought by pln against the doc,t he sender interest in communicating the ideas in the publication corresponds to the recipient interest in reading what the sender has to say we can perceive no principled basis for distinguishing publications specifically ordered by a prison inmate from letters written to that inmate for purposes of first amendment protection miniken walter,quoting brooks seiter,cir.although the miniken case involved a subscription publication,it indicates that it is the request on the part of the receiver and compliance on the part of the sender,and not the payment of money,that is relevant to the first amendment analysis.
this case is not a scenario in which a publisher has attempted to flood a facility with publications sent to all inmates,regardless of whether they requested the publ
