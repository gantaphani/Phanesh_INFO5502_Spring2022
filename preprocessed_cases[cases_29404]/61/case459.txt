the trial court determined that state law preempted the efforts by the city of arcata city to enforce its ordinances requiring permits before viacom outdoor,viacom could rebuild a number of billboards.because it had no authority to insist on compliance with its ordinances,the city was also found to have violated viacom federal civil rights.damages and attorney fees were awarded to viacom under federal civil rights statutes.
the primary issue presented on this appeal by the city is whether california outdoor advertising act bus,et the state act preempts municipal ordinances that require a permit for rebuilding outdoor billboards destroyed by natural forces.we conclude this local power is not displaced by the state act.we further conclude that because the municipal ordinances are valid and enforceable,their threatened enforcement has not yet been shown to have caused actionable damage.in light of these conclusions,we reverse.
background 
the salient facts are easily recounted.viacom owned four billboards located within the city and adjacent to state highway.for each of the billboards viacom had a current outdoor advertising permit issued by the california department of transportation caltrans.the billboards were made of wood.three were put up in,the fourth in.the billboards were destroyed by windstorms in of.viacom began rebuilding the billboards.a city official posted stop work orders on the billboards,thus directing viacom to cease rebuilding until it applied for permits as required by the city building code and its sign code although viacom stopped rebuilding,in subsequent correspondence with the city it insisted it was not obliged to obtain permits prior to rebuilding its billboards.
viacom did not apply for permits,but it did commence this action against the city and the members of the city council.viacom alleged three causes of action in its complaint.the first was a petition for a writ of mandate on the ground that the state act and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto constituted the sole applicable law,meaning the city had no regulatory authority to require permits for reconstructing billboards.specifically,the state act withdrew municipal power over customary maintenance of any billboard for which caltrans had issued a permit citing,tit.the second cause of action sought declaratory relief to the effect that the legislature enacted the outdoor advertising act with the express intention to preempt the entire field of regulation of billboards in california,allowing cities only the power to regulate the locations and placements of new billboard structures.all other acts of municipalities are defined as ultra vires acts for which compensation must be paid to caltrans billboard permit holders.the city of arcata has no power to require the application for,or issuance of,city building permits 
viacom third and final cause of action invoked the federal civil rights act of.viacom alleged the city actions unfairly singles out viacom to bear the burden of government action in violation of the equal protection clause as set forth in article i,section a of the california constitution and the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution,and also infringed viacom procedural and substantive due process rights and denie d just compensation for governmental taking of private property,all in violation of article i,section a of the california constitution and the fifth and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution.viacom prayed for monetary damages and an injunction preventing the city from attempting to enforce any municipal permit conditions or requirements.
the case was tried in two stages.in the first,the court granted viacom petition for a writ of mandate upon concluding that california code of regulations,section,preempts the field.it sets forth the criteria by which billboards may be.if those criteria are met,no further action by a local public entity is necessary.the california department of transportation is the sole governing agency under such circumstances.the city of arcata is enjoined from interfering with the of the billboards.
there followed a bench trial on the issue of damages.the court concluded that the city unlawful interference with viacom right under the outdoor advertising act to reconstruct billboards blown down in a storm constituted a violation of viacom civil right to enter into and maintain contracts.here,because viacom could not reconstruct the billboards without the threat of action by the city of arcata,viacom could not perform its contracts with its vendees by supplying the advertising required by those contracts.the city of arcata,then,intentionally interfered with viacom contractual relations,a property right guaranteed by the state and federal constitutions.the court fixed viacom damages for lost rent in the sum of.the court further found that viacom was entitled to attorney fees under.the court thereafter entered judgment awarding viacom damages of almost,attorney fees of,and an injunction prohibiting the city from interfering with viacom of the wind blown billboards.the city then perfected this timely appeal.
discussion 
since the city sign code has provided that a sign shall not hereafter be erected,constructed,altered or maintained except as provided by this code and after a permit has been issued and making it unlawful for a person,firm or corporation to erect,construct,enlarge,alter,repair,move,improve,remove,convert or demolish,equip,use,or maintain a sign or sign structure in this jurisdiction contrary to or in violation of the provisions of this code.arcata sign code.it was the attempted exercise of this ordinance that the trial court found was preempted by the state act.
the general principles governing preemption analysis are these.under article xi,section of the california constitution,a county or city may make and enforce within its limits all local,police,sanitary,and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.
if otherwise valid local legislation conflicts with state law,it is preempted by such law and is void.citations.a conflict exists if the local legislation duplicates,contradicts,or enters an area fully occupied by general law,either expressly or by legislative implication.citations.
local legislation is duplicative of general law when it is coextensive therewith.citation.similarly,local legislation is contradictory to general law when it is inimical thereto.citation.
finally,local legislation enters an area that is fully occupied by general law when the legislature has expressly manifested its intent to fully occupy the area citation,or when it has impliedly done so in light of one of the following indicia of intent the subject matter has been so fully and completely covered by general law as to clearly indicate that is has become exclusively a matter of state concern the subject matter has been partially covered by general law couched in such terms as to indicate clearly that a paramount state concern will not tolerate further or additional local action or the subject matter has been partially covered by general law,and the subject is of such a nature that the adverse effect of a local ordinance on the transient citizens of the state outweighs the possible benefit to the locality.citations.city of los angeles cal th,d,fn.omitted accord,great western shows,county of los angeles cal th,d,people ex rel.deukmejian county of mendocino cal d.
billboards have long been recognized as a proper subject for local regulation under the police power.louis poster louis.thomas cusack city of chicago.united advertising borough of raritan,and authorities cited mcquillen,the law of municipal corporations ed vol.et,power of municipality as to billboards and outdoor advertising.california counties and municipalities have not been hesitant to exercise their regulatory powers on this subject,tahoe regional planning agency king d.mountain view chamber of commerce city of mountain view d.burk municipal court d.national advertising county of monterey d.people norton.the regulatory powers of cities and counties do not rest solely on our state constitution the legislature has codified local authority to regulate billboards,subd.a,subd.b.
local power has never been viewed as a contest with the state authority to regulate outdoor advertising.in fact,the history of the state act demonstrates that the totality of regulatory power has been shared for a considerable period.when first enacted in,the uncodified provisions of the state act applied to outdoor advertising structures by means of a permit system administered by the director of the department of public works.stats,ch.the scope of the measure was subject to an important limitation the provisions of this act shall apply only to the placing or maintenance of advertising structures signs located in any of the territory of the state of california,other than the territory within incorporated cities and towns and incorporated cities and counties,italics added.
the legislature reiterated this point when the state act was codified in,directing that its provisions apply only to the placing of advertising displays within view of the public highways located in any of the territory of the state of california,other than the territory within incorporated cities and towns.stats,ch,adding former.the regulatory domain claimed for the state exclusive jurisdiction was modest the regulation of the placing of advertising displays by this chapter in so far as such regulation may affect the placing of advertising displays within view of the public highways of this state in unincorporated areas,shall be exclusive of all other regulations for the placing of advertising displays within view of the public highways of this state in unincorporated areas whether fixed by a law of this state or by a political subdivision thereof,adding former,italics added.at the same time,former section was enacted to read it is the intention of the legislature to occupy the whole field of regulation by the provisions of this chapter except that nothing in this chapter prohibits enforcement of any or all of its provisions by persons designated so to act by appropriate ordinances duly adopted by any county of this state nor does anything prohibit the passage by any county of reasonable land use or zoning regulations affecting the placing of advertising displays ibid.the obvious point is that the legislature intentionally extended the exclusive reach of the state act only to counties,and only to the unincorporated parts of counties adjacent to what were then state highways.these provisions,read together,did not purport to extend any exclusive state power to state highways located within cities.
section is one of a number of provisions in the current version of the state act aimed at demarcating the boundaries of responsibility between the state,counties,and cities.section specifies that the state act shall not be construed to permit a person to place or maintain in existence on or adjacent to any street,road or highway any outdoor advertising prohibited by law or by any ordinance of any city,county or city and county.section declares the legislature intent to establish minimum standards with respect to advertising displays adjacent to highways,and section states the governing body of any city,county,or city and county may enact ordinances,including,but not limited to,land use or zoning ordinances,imposing restrictions on advertising displays adjacent to any street,road,or highway equal to or greater than those imposed by this chapter if section is complied with.no city,county,or city and county may allow an advertising display to be placed or maintained in violation of this chapter.section provides the governing body of any city or city and county may enact ordinances requiring licenses or permits,or both,in addition to those imposed by this chapter,for the placing of advertising displays in view of any highway within its boundaries.moreover,section provides that a city or a county with land use jurisdiction may adopt an ordinance that establishes standards for the spacing and sizes of advertising displays that are more restrictive than those imposed by the state.they may also enter agreements with the owners for the relocation of advertising displays.finally,in terms of whether a display has been lawfully erected,meaning that it can not be removed without payment of just compensation,the state act defines lawfully erected displays as those erected in compliance with state laws and local ordinances in effect at the time of their erection or which were subsequently brought into full compliance with state laws and local ordinances,italics added.
the state act operates by regulating the business of outdoor advertising,defined as placing an advertising display or changing the message of an advertising display for another person business,subd.a.persons or firms engaging in the business of outdoor advertising must have a license issued on an annual basis by caltrans.a licensee must have a issued by each advertising display.the permit is good for five years,and can be renewed for additional terms.a licensee seeking a permit to place an advertising display in a new location must offer written evidence that the city or the county with land use jurisdiction over the property upon which the location is situated ha s consented to the placing,subd.a.in addition,the legislature expressly noted the issuance of a permit pursuant to this chapter does not allow any person to erect an advertising display in violation of any ordinance of any city,county,or city and county,and this includes county zoning laws,subd.b.finally,nothing in the state act prevents cities or counties from exercising the ultimate immediate removal of existing they are willing to pay compensation to the billboard owner.
viewed against this backdrop,it is obvious that a general theory of state preemption is untenable.section can not be read in isolation.such an approach is contrary to the rule of construction requiring consideration of all parts of a statutory scheme to allow harmonious operation and effectiveness for every provision,renee superior court cal th,d,alford superior court cal th,d,devita county of napa cal th,d.allowing the opening words of section to obliterate county and city regulatory powers could be accomplished only by ignoring the language of sections,et,thus turning them into dead letters.this too is not an option open to us,hagberg california federal bank cal th,d,lungren deukmejian cal d.moreover,it is not the interpretation given to section by the courts and the attorney general.desert outdoor advertising,county of san bernardino d.county of santa barbara purcell,d.
neither section,nor any other provision of the state act,uses the type of language accepted as expressly preempting all local power over a given topic there is no scope for finding implied preemption because the state act makes considerable allowance for past and future county and city ordinances on the subject of advertising displays.as shown by the plain language of sections,and,the legislature clearly contemplated that local regulation would augment the state act,and might in some instances go beyond it.an expressed intent to allow local regulation,or an express recognition of local regulation,is convincing evidence that the state legislative scheme was not intended to occupy the field.it solano county bd.of supervisors cal th,fn,d.it is therefore not possible to conclude that the subject of billboards has been so fully and completely covered by state law that it has become exclusively a matter of state concern or has been partially covered by state law couched in such terms as to indicate clearly that a paramount state concern will not tolerate further or additional local action,supra,cal th,d,quoting in re hubbard cal d.
regulation of title of the california code of regulations regulation,cited by the trial court,falls short of demonstrating the state intention to exclude local regulatory action.it has a far more modest scope.but the operation of regulation can not be appreciated without appreciating the concept of customary maintenance,a term defined in the immediately preceding regulation,tit,regulation.as will be shown,these regulations effect no diminution of the city traditional power to require permits.
customary maintenance is a term used in two provisions of the state act,but most fully explained in regulation as any activity performed on an advertising display for the purpose of actively maintaining the display in its existing approved physical configuration and size dimensions at the specific location approved on the permit issued by caltrans.customary maintenance includes the following activities changing of the advertising message.adding an extension to an outside dimension of a display as incident to the copy for a temporary period up to three years.the sale,lease,or transfer of the display or its permit.adding a light box,subd.a.customary maintenance does not encompass raising the height of the display from ground level.relocating all or portion of a display.adding a facing which is defined in,tit,subd.l as the portion of the display that contains advertising copy.increasing any dimension of a facing except as permitted by section a.turning the direction of a facing.adding illumination or a changeable message with the exception of a light box,subd.b.the import of regulation is routine upkeep or modest improvements,not an extraordinary event like rebuilding a billboard after it has been destroyed.
regulation only deals with the procedures to maintain a caltrans permit,thereby allowing continued customary maintenance,after an advertising display becomes nonconforming because it has been destroyed.it provides 
a a display is destroyed and not eligible for customary maintenance when for days after notice from the department,caltrans,it remains damaged and is not used for the purpose of outdoor advertising in the configuration size,facings,location,structure approved by the department.
b when the department becomes aware of or identifies a damaged display,the department mails a written notice by certified mail to the permittee beginning the period for the permittee to refurbish,replace,rebuild,or in kind or smaller the damaged display refurbishing,replacing,rebuilding or shall be to the approved characteristics as recorded in the department records for the display.this notice is not necessary if the permittee has completed repair back to the approved characteristics prior to notice being issued by the department.
c the permittee has until the end of the time period identified in the department notice to repair,replace,or rebuild,or in kind the damaged display and place advertising copy.upon receiving written notice from the permittee showing good cause prior to the or last day of the time period,the department may extend the established time period not to exceed a total of six months.in such case,the department shall issue a written response identifying by what date the work must be completed.
d when the display is not restored and advertising is not placed before the last day of established time period,the display customary maintenance is ended and the display is deemed destroyed.when the display is deemed destroyed,the permit is revoked,subject to appeal and the remains of the display are subject to removal after the permit is revoked,a permit may not be issued for the location unless the display conforms to all laws and regulations in effect at the time of application 
properly understood,regulation addresses only certain circumstances that will not result in loss of a caltrans permit.during the period,the billboard owner can repair the damaged display,that is,perform customary maintenance.if the damage is sufficiently extensive,the owner can the billboard.
viacom argues that caltrans regulations,specifically regulation,subject the outdoor advertising industry to municipal regulation of building standards only at the time of placement of billboards.once the billboard is up,the sole regulatory role belongs to the state,in the form of caltrans localities are involved only for the initial placement of a new outdoor advertising display.once the billboard is up,the owner is permitted to undertake customary maintenance,including rebuilding,without interference from local authorities.viacom can not point to any statutory language,or any regulation,which hints at such a limitation on local regulatory authority.instead,the plain language of the state act is to the contrary.placement is defined by the state act as not only erecting,but also maintaining signs.maintaining necessarily takes place after the initial construction of the billboard,and such activity is excluded from the definition of placement only if it constitutes customary maintenance.as we have concluded,goes beyond customary maintenance.therefore,amounts to a placement of the billboard.people ex rel.pub.wks.ryan outdoor advertising,d.placement of an advertising display is an area where local power is expressly recognized by the state act.
moreover,the language of regulation speaks exclusively to the power of caltrans.it does not address whether any other jurisdiction permit might be needed before a billboard is.nothing in it suggests a restriction of the traditional power of cities and counties to require construction permits.nothing in regulation suggests that local power,once exercised,would thereafter be exhausted.nothing in it suggests why the legislature would allow cities and counties to require a building permit for the initial construction of a billboard,but would deny them that power if the billboard is destroyed and the owner wants to.arguably,the fact that viacom billboard structures failed is exactly the kind of event that the legislature could have concluded justified affording local government the opportunity to address the issue through the permit process.and no regulation could outmuscle the plain language of the numerous provisions in the state act recognizing that aspect of local power,agnew state bd.of equalization cal th,d,california teachers commission on teacher credentialing th,d administrative regulations may not contravene the terms of the statutes under which they have been adopted.
viacom does not explain how its construction of regulation is consistent with the language of the numerous provisions of the state act allowing local regulation.sections and are particularly pertinent in this respect.section withholds permission for a person to place or maintain any outdoor advertising prohibited by any ordinance of any city,county,or city and county.italics added.and section expressly allows local governments to require a permit for placement of a sign,which we have concluded encompasses the sign.here is express statutory authority for the role viacom claims the city can not exercise.this is not all.the state act is equally explicit in not restricting to the state the power to act against billboards which,although already in existence,were not lawfully erected.all advertising displays which are placed or which exist in violation of this chapter are public nuisances and may be removed by any public employee italics added.
viacom claims our supreme court decision in traverso people ex rel.of transportation cal th,d,traverso,supports its position.the issue in traverso was the facial constitutionality of section,which authorizes caltrans to revoke a permit and remove a billboard that is not in compliance with the state act.in the course of recounting the facts,the court stated adco traverso company renewed its permit each year up to and including december,as required by section.in early,the billboard fell down due to circumstances that are apparently still undetermined.if the billboard was destroyed,as the result of criminal or tortious acts,as caltrans assumes,then repair of the structure must be completed within days after receipt of written notice from caltrans.citation.if,on the other hand,the billboard blew down in a windstorm as adco maintains,there appears to be no express time limit for completion of repairs.id.at,d.from this passage viacom discerns that the supreme court has determined that billboards blown down by windstorms may be repaired under caltrans regulations,and presumably only those regulations,making conflicting municipal assertion of local authority over billboards improper and vio
