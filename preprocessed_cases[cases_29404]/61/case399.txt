this case involves a dispute over the procedures the federal communications commission fcc or commission uses to determine local television market designations pursuant to the cable television mandatory carriage rules.in particular,costa de oro television,costa petitions for review of two fcc orders that sustain earlier market modification rulings but,at the same time,change the market definition mechanism.costa also seeks review of the fcc decision promoting the use of certain data the signal strength prediction methodology maps in market modification proceedings.because we conclude that the commission articulated a rational explanation for its decisions,epa,we deny costa petition.
background 
statutory and regulatory background 
concerned that local television broadcast stations were no longer able to compete with the growing cable industry the congress passed the cable television consumer protection and competition act of cable act,et.the cable act includes provisions that require e ach cable operator to carry the signals of a specific number of local commercial television stations.a a local commercial television station is defined as any full power television broadcast station that,with respect to a particular cable system,is within the same television market as the cable system.h a.a local commercial television station that exercises its statutory right is entitled to cable carriage in its local market but it does not receive compensation therefor from the cable operator.the cable act also gives a broadcaster the option of cable carriage under a retransmission consent provision that permits the broadcaster and the cable operator to negotiate cable carriage arrangements and the broadcast station to receive compensation in return.id.b.every three years,the broadcaster is required to make an election between the and the retransmission consent options.see id.b b.the first cycle began in june.f.a broadcast station market is determined by the commission by regulation or order using,where available,commercial publications which delineate television markets based on viewing patterns.h c i.in,the year the cable act was enacted,the commission rules,now codified at e,defined a station market by reference to the area of dominant influence adi data produced by arbitron,an audience research organization.id.e.the adi describes a particular geographic television market based on measured viewing patterns.see report and order and further notice of proposed rulemaking,definition of markets for purposes of the cable television broadcast signal carriage rules,fcc rcd,wl,first order.in general,every american county is assigned to a discrete market according to those stations with a preponderance of total viewing hours in the county.id.
in december,shortly after the first election cycle ended,arbitron discontinued its television ratings business and ceased publishing updated adi data.in response and after notice and comment rulemaking,the fcc determined to continue to use the adi market list for the election and to substitute nielsen media research television ratings service beginning with the election.see first order,fcc rcd at.nielsen uses a market designation called the designated market area dma.both the adi and the dma use audience survey information from cable and noncable households to determine the assignment of counties to local television markets based on local stations respective viewer shares.id.at.nonetheless,because of differences in methodology as well as sampling and statistical variation,the switch to the market resulted in the reassignment of some counties.id.differences between the adi market list and the dma market list manifested a change in markets with approximately markets gaining counties and markets losing counties.id.at.
while a broadcast station market is generally based on the adi now dma data,section h directs the commission to consider an individual request for a change in market designation.the fcc may with respect to a particular television broadcast station,include additional communities within its television market or exclude communities from such station television market to better effectuate the purposes of this section.h c i.in considering such requests,the commission shall afford particular attention to the value of localism by taking into account the following factors,among others 
i whether the station,or other stations located in the same area,have been historically carried on the cable system or systems within such community 
ii whether the television station provides coverage or other local service to such community 
iii whether any other television station that is eligible to be carried by a cable system in such community in fulfillment of the requirements of this section provides new coverage of issues of concern to such community or provides carriage or coverage of sporting and other events of interest to the community 
iv evidence of viewing patterns in cable and noncable households within the areas served by the cable system or systems in such community.
id.h c ii i iv.typically,a request is made either by a broadcast station wanting to be included as part of a cable system in a market outside its dma designation or by a cable operator attempting to exclude a broadcast station from the cable operator market.the cable act legislative history recites as a rationale of the h market modification procedure that 
where the presumption in favor of adi now dma carriage would result in cable subscribers losing access to local stations because they are outside the adi in which a local cable system operates,the fcc may make an adjustment to include or exclude particular communities from a television station market consistent with congress objective to ensure that television stations be carried in the areas which they serve and which form their economic market.
at.during the period arbitron adi market areas were in use,the commission ruled on numerous market modification requests filed pursuant to section h.see,in re complaints of costa de oro television,fcc rcd,wl,aff on,fcc rcd,wl,pet.for review denied,costa de oro television,fcc.the interplay between the fcc earlier market modification decisions under the adi regime and its move to a market definition is the focus of costa appeal.
history of costa license 
costa is the licensee of television station located in ventura,california.ventura is in ventura county.although arbitron included ventura county in the adi market for greater los angeles,it assigned kjla to the santa luis obispo adi market.nielson,however,has always placed kjla in the los angeles dma.the change in market designation results in a corresponding change in kjla must carry right because a broadcast station generally has a right to carriage within its market only.while the commission ordered carriage of kjla throughout the los angeles market once the station was assigned to that dma,it continued to exclude certain communities that were the subject of earlier h market modification rulings.see costa de oro television,fcc rcd,wl costa de oro television,fcc rcd,wl.
as part of the change,the commission considered,and sought comment on,the continuing validity of its earlier h market modification rulings made using adi data.costa requested the commission to reconsider de novo any prior section h ruling based on adi data if,as in kjla case,the change resulted in the reassignment of a station to a new market.in the second report and order on definition of markets for purposes of the cable television broadcast signal carriage rates,fcc rcd,wl,second order,the commission rejected costa request.it also decided to continue using adi data to process any market modification request filed before the effective date of the change to dma,that is,before january.in its second order,however,the fcc noted that,i n cases in which the conversion to dmas will have a direct consequence,we will take the future dma assignment into account.second order.with respect to prior market modification rulings,then,where the commission has previously decided to delete a community from a station adi market,that deletion will remain in effect
