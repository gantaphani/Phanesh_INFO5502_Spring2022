a free press is a foundation of citizen participation in government because the press informs people about issues of public concern and provides a place for debate about public issues.a lawsuit filed primarily to chill the valid exercise of free speech is called a slapp suit and,if without merit,such an action may be dismissed early under code of civil procedure section in what is commonly known as an motion 
in this case,investigative newsource inewsource,an independent,nonprofit journalism organization,entered into contracts with kpbs,san diego public radio and television station,to gather and produce news stories with and for kpbs,in exchange for the right to use kpbs offices,media equipment,and related news facilities.kpbs is a department of san diego state university sdsu,and inewsource and kpbs have jointly created hundreds of news stories.
in february inewsource began publishing articles critical of attorney cory briggs.for example,one was entitled cory briggs land deals raise ethical legal questions and another was called san diego attorney environmental lawsuits could be tainted by conflict of interest.
after inewsource published about a dozen more critical stories about briggs,san diegans for open government sdog an entity inewsource reported is controlled by briggs sued inewsource,along with its founder,loretta hearn,and also sdsu,california state university csu,and san diego state university research foundation sdsurf.
the gist of sdog complaint is the contracts between kpbs and inewsource violate statutory prohibitions on involving public funds because hearn was allegedly influencing both sides of the transaction for sdsu as a faculty member,and for inewsource as its executive director.sdog also alleges inewsource and hearn misappropriated the names kpbs and sdsu.
asserting sdog lawsuit is based on the exercise of their constitutionally protected speech rights and lacked merit,defendants brought motions.the court granted the motions.
sdog appeals,contending the statute does not apply because its lawsuit is a public interest lawsuit,exempt from the law under section,subdivision b and the exception to that exemption for media defendants under section,subdivision d is inapplicable because its lawsuit has nothing to do with stopping news reporting but is instead directed to stopping by a public employee.
alternatively,sdog asserts that if the statute applies,the order should be reversed because its lawsuit is not directed at protected activity and even if it is,sdog established a probability of prevailing.
we affirm.reporting news is protected speech.hunter cbs broadcasting,th,hunter.news stories addressing issues of public interest do not arise out of thin air.they often require newsgathering using offices,internet access,studios,and production services.providing office space and related newsgathering facilities in exchange for investigative news stories furthers protected speech.sdog lawsuit is therefore squarely within the statute,which protects not only speech,but also conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e,italics added.
we reject sdog assertion that the statute does not apply because its lawsuit targets unlawful,not protected speech.sdog argument improperly conflates distinct issues of conduct and motive.in determining whether the statute applies,the appropriate focus is on the alleged conduct here,the contracts,and not the defendant alleged wrongful motive for engaging in that conduct here,alleged.hunter,supra,th at.

last,sdog claims fail on the merits because sdog offered no admissible evidence to support its claims.sdog attempt to fill the evidentiary void by relying on allegations in its verified complaint is insufficient as a matter of law.brodeur atlas entertainment,th,brodeur.
factual and procedural background 
a.the news media parties 
hearn has been a professional journalist since.in she founded inewsource,which creates investigative news stories on public issues.
kpbs is a media entity operating as a public service of sdsu.kpbs,with broadcast facilities on the sdsu campus,delivers news and entertainment programming through television,radio,and digital media.
sdsurf is a nonprofit corporation and a separate legal entity from sdsu.for over years,sdsurf has provided kpbs with financial accounting,tax reporting,and administrative support.
in kpbs began publishing inewsource news stories.reporters for these two organizations also began working together on stories of public interest.
b.the agreement for collaboration between inewsource and kpbs 
in the fall of,kpbs remodeled its newsroom and began a nightly news television show.hearn asked kpbs station manager,deanna mackey,about moving inewsource into the remodeled kpbs newsroom because inewsource was looking for a reliable audience for its investigative news.hearn proposal interested kpbs,which was looking for more investigative news content.
in kpbs and inewsource entered into a contract under which kpbs agreed to provide inewsource newsroom space to allow inewsource reporters to work closely with kpbs editors,reporters,and producers on collaborative work the agreement in exchange,inewsource agreed to give kpbs all of its news content for distribution on radio,television,and the internet.kpbs characterizes this relationship with inewsource as a partnership that contemplates joint story telling.
under the agreement,kpbs agreed to provide inewsource with offices,furniture,studios and production areas,telephone and internet connections,and news gathering equipment.kpbs also agreed to invite inewsource employees to daily news meetings.
in exchange,inewsource agreed to provide kpbs with substantial data driven stories during the term and one watchdog feature per month,plus a w eekly data brief on a topic of interest to kpbs audience.inewsource also agreed to provide reporters to kpbs and to provide kpbs access to its databases.
kpbs did not competitively bid the agreement.mackey,kpbs station manager who participated in drafting the agreement,stated such a contract would never be subject to open bidding because content is qualitative and p artnerships between news organizations require trust mackey stated kpbs only partners with news organizations whose accuracy and content have proven to be trustworthy,such as inewsource.vince petronzio,associate general manager for business and financial affairs at kpbs,similarly stated that kpbs does not solicit open bids for contracts.he explained,in fact,because content is unique and qualitative,it would never be subject to open bidding.kpbs receives significant value from its partnership with inewsource because inewsource stories enhance the coverage that kpbs can provide to its audience.he added,the partnership between kpbs and inewsource is definitely a partnership.
in a declaration,hearn asserted she negotiated the agreement only on behalf of inewsource.mackey and suzanne marmion,director of news and editorial strategy for kpbs,negotiated the agreement for kpbs.neither mackey nor marmion has any financial interest in inewsource.in,although hearn occasionally volunteered as a guest lecturer for sdsu school of journalism,she was not employed by sdsu and held no executive or managerial role at sdsu.
hearn declaration states she has never been a kpbs board member or kpbs employee and has never been in a position to influence the kpbs process or outcome in any way.she has never been a tenured or sdsu professor,nor a department head,advisory board member,committee member,director,officer,or department chairperson.hearn has never been employed by sdsurf.
c.the extension and lease 
in inewsource and kpbs extended the agreement the extension they also entered into a new lease lease under which kpbs leased office space,conference rooms,studios,and production areas to inewsource for its reporters to use for the benefit of securing investigative news content for kpbs.rent under the lease was only one dollar however,kpbs station manager stated kpbs received significant value from this agreement because inewsource stories enhance the coverage that kpbs can provide to its audience.
hearn states she negotiated the extension and lease only on behalf of inewsource.mackey and marmion negotiated on behalf of kpbs.in hearn was an adjunct professor of journalism at sdsu,teaching a class.sdsu paid hearn for her teaching time at its standard rate,and she received no other benefits from sdsu.hearn declaration states she did not occupy any position of control or authority with sdsu,sdsurf,or kpbs.
nature of kpbs and inewsource collaboration 
inewsource and kpbs have jointly created and distributed more than stories.in most,inewsource reports the news,with input from kpbs editors and using kpbs videographers.in other cases,kpbs reporters do the reporting and inewsource reporters edit.occasionally,kpbs and inewsource collaborate to jointly report stories.in all these situations,inewsource reporters work closely with kpbs editors and producers on content for kpbs.
inewsource articles about briggs 
in february inewsource began publishing uncomplimentary stories about briggs.for example,one was entitled,san diego attorney environmental lawsuits could be tainted by conflict of interest.there,inewsource reported that briggs wife,sarichia cacciatore,was listed as a project manager on a contract her employer had with a government entity at the same time briggs was suing that entity over environmental matters.briggs responded by stating on his website,my wife has a job,and i have a job.we do talk about or share client confidences,and we take measures to avoid creating any conflicts.there is anything illegal,unethical,or even unusual about this either.
the next day,in an article entitled,document links briggs wife to his law business,inewsource reported that cacciatore was listed as vice president of briggs law firm at the same time she worked on projects for government agencies briggs was suing.
on february,inewsource reprinted a letter briggs posted on his website,defending his conduct and stating,my clients are wealthy corporations.there are people who have to fight and need a lawyer to represent them but often ca pay right away.i still fight for them.
on march,inewsource published three more articles about briggs.these were entitled behind the briggs investigation,helix briggs wife did not disclose vp role in his law firm,and contested transcript of san diego attorney cory briggs wife released.
in these articles,inewsource reported that cacciatore was employed by an environmental company that has done work for the city of san diego the city and that briggs sued the city regarding one of these projects.inewsource reported,records released monday confirm cory briggs wife was vice president of the briggs law corp oration for the past twenty years,which means she was an officer of the law firm he used to sue the city at the same time she worked for a company on contract with the city.briggs responded,stating cacciatore was vice president of his law corporation for reasons having nothing to do with running the firm and everything to do with things like estate planning 
on march,inewsource reported that briggs had sued the city about at least one project cacciatore worked on directly.
on march,cacciatore and briggs wrote to kpbs to give you notice of our demand,and to make that demand,for correction and retraction of false,inaccurate,misleading reporting that may have been disseminated by kpbs inewsource and kpbs responded,stating it was unaware of any false fact in its story.
on april,inewsource reported that the environmental firm employing cacciatore had agreed to pay the city to resolve the potential conflict of interest claim.earlier,briggs wrote,there is anything illegal,unethical or even unusual about cacciatore employment and relationship to briggs.
one day later,inewsource published another article about briggs,reporting cacciatore played a key role in an environmental review of a project near the mexican border.the article states briggs filed a lawsuit alleging inadequacies in that project analysis of biological impacts,and cacciatore vice president of briggs law firm was the project biologist.inewsource also reported that briggs had sued at least government agencies that had contracted with the environmental firm employing cacciatore.the article states briggs operates through nonprofit corporations,including sdog,which are actually run by briggs associates,including his cousin.the article states,experts in legal ethics have told inewsource the connection between briggs and his wife is a horrible and problematic conflict of interest.the article explains 
briggs lawsuits against the city have cost taxpayers a significant amount of money over the years.but there was an undisclosed conflict of interest behind at least two of them,posing ethical and legal issues that recently resulted in a taxpayer settlement.
on april,inewsource published cacciatore demand for correction and retraction,along with inewsource lawyer response,refuting briggs assertions.the same day,sdog filed the instant action.however,sdog did not serve hearn with the lawsuit until june.
inewsource publishes another article about briggs 
in the meantime,in late may,inewsource published another uncomplimentary article about briggs entitled nonprofits flout state,federal laws.there,inewsource reported,briggs and his law firm have sued on behalf of more than charitable nonprofits,almost all of which he and his family helped create.inewsource also reported that sdog officers have stated under oath that briggs law corp oration oversees and pays for nearly every aspect of the group operation and that sdog does not have a penny to its name 
according to depositions and other court filings,briggs and his law firm hold and maintain all the group sdog corporate records,file and pay for its lawsuits,its annual registration fees and filings with the state and federal governments,control its facebook and twitter accounts and collect all settlements and judgment when the group prevails in court.
sdog does have a penny to its name nor has it recorded any revenue or expenses with the federal or state agencies,according to government records.
responding,sdog corporate secretary explained sdog has no checking or savings account because it wants to operate as simply and cleanly as possible.he also explained that when sdog loses a case,briggs does not get reimbursed for his time or expenses,and he is willing to risk substantial loss to fight the groups he takes on for us.
sdog complaint 
the crux of sdog lawsuit here is its assertion the agreement and lease violate prohibitions on and use of public funds for private benefit,and therefore are void.the first cause of action is entitled,illegality of agreement.sdog alleges that agreement violated government code section because hearn was then employed by sdsu and therefore had a financial interest on both sides of the transaction sdog also alleges the agreement should have been subject to a competitive bid process just like a construction contract or other public works project.
sdog second cause of action alleges the lease referred to in the complaint as the lease was negotiated or executed by hearn in her official capacity as a sdsu employee while she had a conflicting financial interest as inewsource executive director.sdog alleges hearn used her position as a sdsu lecturer to secure approval of the agreement and lease for the benefit of inewsource,in violation of government code section sdog also alleges inewsource infringed kpbs and sdsu trademarks by using them without permission and without paying compensation.
inewsource and hearn filed an motion,accompanied by a request for judicial notice,documentary exhibits,and declarations of hearn,norma clark sdsurf associate executive director of facilities planning and management,mackey,and brad racino,an inewsource reporter.
inewsource and hearn asserted sdog complaint attacked protected activity under the statute namely,the partnership between kpbs and inewsource for gathering and reporting news.they also presented admissible evidence showing sdog claims lacked merit.for example,hearn declaration states 
sdog alleges that the agreement was negotiated executed by one or more csu,sdsu,sdsu r f officials or employees in their official capacities who,at the time of the contract negotiating execution,had a financial interest in the contract in violation of government code section and other laws,including but not limited to hearn.this statement is false.i negotiated the agreement between inewsource and kpbs on behalf of inewsource.i did not negotiate on behalf of kpbs and had no role whatsoever much less authority,power,or influence on the kpbs side of the negotiations.deanna mackey,kpbs station manager,and suzanne marmion,director of news and editorial strategy,negotiated on behalf of kpbs.
hearn similarly refuted sdog allegations she received personal benefits from the lease.asserting briggs controls sdog as his alter ego,hearn and inewsource sought an award of attorney fees jointly against sdog and briggs 
the trustees of the california state university trustees and sdsurf collectively university defendants also filed an motion the university defendants accompanied their motion with documentary exhibits and declarations of bob wolfson sdsurf executive director,petronzio kpbs associate general manager of business and financial affairs,mackey kpbs station manager,and hearn.
the university defendants asserted that sdog complaint was governed by the statute because the action is based on agreements for collaborative news reporting.they also asserted the public interest lawsuit exemption to the statute in section,subdivision b did not apply because under section,subdivision d and ingels westwood one broadcasting services,th ingels,news gathering and reporting are exceptions to the public interest lawsuit exemption.on the merits,the university defendants asserted sdog claims fail because hearn did not make the agreement or lease in her official capacity as an sdsu adjunct professor,and she had no control or authority for sdsu.they also asserted sdog trademark infringement claim failed on several alternative grounds.
sdog filed opposition,primarily asserting its action was exempt from the statute under section,subdivision b.sdog also asserted its claims did not arise from defendants protected activity,but rather defendants unlawful contracts 
on the merits,relying on hub city solid waste services,city of compton th hub city,sdog asserted there was a triable issue whether hearn exerted a level of influence in a capacity that demands the public trust addressing the trademark claim,sdog asserted defendants had not demonstrated sdsu received compensation from,or authorized,inewsource to use the sdsu trademark.sdog supported its opposition with two declarations from its attorney,john mcclendon.those declarations contain no factual assertions other than an attempt to authenticate sdog verified complaint,the csu handbook on contracts and procurement,csu website section on csu auxiliary organizations,a deposition transcript in san diegans for open government city of san diego super.san diego county,restated articles of incorporation for sdog,and a statement attributed to hearn in an internet article about this case.
in reply,defendants asserted sdog failed to offer any admissible evidence to support its claims.at the hearing,inewsource attorney made the same point,stating 
t he evidence is undisputed from all the defendants and all the people involved in these transactions,hearn had no position,power,ability or influence on the kpbs side of the coin.in fact,i think it really borders on the ridiculous that a professor of a class,up against huge corporations that have sophisticated boards of directors,officers and attorneys have any real influence in this decision as a matter of law.the record is clear,there no evidence of any influence or decision because none exists.she negotiates on behalf of inewsource,and the university and kpbs had their team of people that negotiated for kpbs.
after taking the matter under submission,the court granted the motions.the court determined sdog claims were based upon contracts to investigate and report on the news within the meaning of section,subdivision d.the court also determined the action arises from protected activity because the contracts at issue are inextricably related to news gathering and dissemination.stating sdog was required to submit admissible evidence to establish it can prevail,the court ruled,plaintiff did not meet its burden of showing by competent and admissible evidence that it has a probability of prevailing on the merits of its claim.

a threshold consideration in evaluating an motion is whether the plaintiff lawsuit is exempt from the statute.navarro ihop properties,th,save westwood village luskin th.relevant here,section,subdivision b provides the statute does not apply to any action brought solely in the public interest if t he plaintiff does not seek any relief greater than or different from the relief sought for the general public the action,if successful,would enforce an important right affecting the public interest,and would confer a significant benefit,whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary,on the general public and p rivate enforcement is necessary and places a disproportionate financial burden on the plaintiff in relation to the plaintiff stake in the matter.
section,subdivision b thus provides a safe harbor for a plaintiff from having to satisfy the statute.see holbrook city of santa monica th.as an exception to the statute,it is to be narrowly interpreted.club members for an honest election sierra club cal th.
although section,subdivision b provides that certain public interest lawsuits are exempt from the statute,subdivisions d and d of that statute provide exceptions to that exemption for the news media when the underlying act relates to news gathering and reporting to the public major,supra,th at.thus,regardless of whether the plaintiff action is a public interest lawsuit under section,subdivision b,if section,subdivision d also applies,the defendant may bring an motion.
protected activity 
if the court determines the action is not exempt from the statute,it must then address whether the complaint should be stricken under section.resolving that issue involves two steps.first,the defendant must establish that the challenged claim arises from activity protected by section.baral,supra,cal th at.the defendant meets this burden by showing the act underlying the plaintiff cause of action fits one of the categories of protected speech enumerated in section,subdivision e.navellier sletten cal th,navellier.
section,subdivision e sets forth four categories of protected activity.relevant here,section,subdivision e defines protected activity to include any conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.this category extends the protection of the statute beyond actual instances of free speech to all conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the right of free speech in connection with a public issue.collier harris th,collier,italics omitted.

c.the media exception to the public interest exemption applies here 
the parties contentions 
the threshold issue in this case is whether sdog complaint is exempt from the statute as a public interest lawsuit under section,subdivision b.
sdog asserts this exemption applies because sdog does not seek any direct relief greater than or different from the relief sought by the general public,such as individual money damages the action enforces an important public right prohibiting private enforcement is necessary,with sdog bearing a disproportionate burden because it has no possibility of recovering money in this case.indeed,anticipating defendants would bring motions,sdog complaint alleges,no matter how any portion of this pleading allegations or prayer is construed,in no way does sdog intend to assert a claim or seek relief that is inconsistent with the public interest exemption in section,subdivision b 
inewsource contends the public interest exemption in section,subdivision b does not apply,asserting,i t is clear this lawsuit is not brought in the public interest,but rather to silence inewsource negative coverage of briggs.inewsource contends substantial evidence establishes sdog is the alter ego of briggs and his law firm.the university defendants make the same arguments,asserting,t here is strong evidence that this lawsuit was brought to silence inewsource from publishing unflattering stores about attorney cory briggs.
the university defendants also contend that in determining whether sdog complaint is encompassed within section,subdivision b,we should consider evidence on the merits,including declarations stating hearn did not hold a decisionmaking position at sdsu or with kpbs.the university defendants contend that if such evidence defeats the plaintiff mere allegations in its complaint,the court should find that the plaintiff has not met its burden to establish the public interest lawsuit exemption to the statute applies.
the university defendants acknowledge that in tourgeman nelson kennard th,tourgeman,this court rejected a similar argument.there,we held the applicability of the public interest exemption is determined by examining the allegations of the complaint alone.more recently,in san diegans for open government har construction,th,har construction,this court approvingly cited tourgeman for the same rule,stating whether the public interest exemption in section,subdivision b applies is based on the plaintiff allegations and does not require the plaintiff to proffer affirmative evidence.although the university defendants do not mention it,other courts have agreed with tourgeman on this point.cruz city of culver city th,the inland oversight committee county of san bernardino th.nevertheless,the university defendants ask us to overrule or distinguish this holding in tourgeman.
in the reply brief,sdog asserts there is absolutely no merit to defendants lie that its action was brought to retaliate against inewsource for writing stories about briggs.sdog states it would never retaliate against the media for criticisms leveled against itself or its attorneys.sdog denies it is briggs alter ego,stating there is no evidence to support it.sdog also contends tourgeman,supra,th was correctly decided and should be followed.
issues unnecessary for decision 
to resolve this appeal,it is unnecessary for us to consider many of the issues raised by the parties contentions.if the exception,subd.d to the public interest exemption,subd.b applies,we need not determine whether sdog action is a public interest lawsuit under section,subdivision b because,even if it were,defendants may still invoke the law.stutzman armstrong.lexis at.
thus,we turn to section,subdivision d to determine if sdog action is exempt from the statute.as explained post,section,subdivision d applies in this case and,therefore,we need not consider or decide whether sdog is briggs alter ego,sdog brought this lawsuit to retaliate,tourgeman should be distinguished or overruled,and any of the other issues the parties raise about the applicability of the public interest exemption under section,subdivision b 
analysis of the exception in section,subdivision d 
under section,subdivision d,the exemption to the statute in subdivision b of that statute does not apply to the following 
any person enumerated in subdivision b of section of article i of the california constitution or section of the evidence code,or any person engaged in the dissemination of ideas or expression in any book or academic journal,while engaged in the gathering,receiving,or processing of information for communication to the public.
persons enumerated in the cited portion of the california constitution and evidence code are a publisher,editor,reporter,or other person connected with or employed upon a newspaper,magazine,or other periodical publication,or by a press association or wire service,or any person who has been so connected or employed as well as a radio or television news reporter or other person connected with or employed by a radio or television station,or any person who has been so connected or employed.cal,art.i,subd.b.
section,subdivision d was intended to exempt the news media and other media defendants from section,subdivision b when the underlying act relates to news gathering and reporting to the public with respect to the news media or to activities involving the creation or dissemination of any work of a motion picture or television studio.major,supra,th at.in section,subdivision d,the legislature checked the reach of the public interest exemption by preserving the application of the law to actions that implicate important forms of protected speech.major,at.
the trial court determined section,subdivision d applies in this case to subject sdog action to the statute.we agree.the defendants,news media entities and hearn,are persons enumerated in section,subdivision d.sdog does not contend otherwise.rather,sdog asserts section,subdivision d is inapplicable because hearn alleged illegal conduct did not occur while she was engaged in gathering,writing,or reporting the news as provided in the last clause of section,subdivision d.
the issue presented by sdog argument is whether the phrase engaged in the gathering,receiving,or processing of information for communication to the public in section,subdivision d includes noncommunicative conduct,the negotiation and execution of the agreement and lease done in furtherance of the news media exercise of its free speech right to gather,receive,or process information for communication to the public.
our role in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citation.because the statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of that intent,we look first at the words themselves,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.citation.we do not,however,consider the statutory language in isolation,but rather examine the entire substance of the statute in order to determine the scope and purpose of the provision,construing its words in context and harmonizing its various parts.people castillolopez cal th.
engaged in means to begin and carry on an enterprise or activity.collegiate dict.ed.the contracts sdog challenges dictate the process under which inewsource and kpbs jointly were to begin and carry on newsgathering and reporting.for example,the agreement requires inewsource to deliver to kpbs substantial data driven stories and to make its reporters available as reasonably requested by kpbs for broadcast coverage similarly,the lease provides kpbs is leasing space to inewsource for the benefit of securing investigative news content for kpbs.
therefore,sdog action here is encompassed within section,subdivision d because it challenges any person enumerated in subdivision b of section of article i of the california constitution while engaged in the gathering,receiving,or processing of information or communication to the public.
this conclusion is not only compelled by the statute text,but also finds additional support in the statute legislative history.the analysis for the senate bill enacted as section states 
proposed subdivision d of newly added section would exempt the news media and other media defendants such as the motion picture industry from the bill when the underlying act relates to news gathering and reporting to the public with respect to the news media for claims arising from these activities,the current slapp motion would remain available to these defendants.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended may,ingels,supra,th at.italics added.
in the words of the senate bill analysis,the contracts sdog challenges relate to news gathering and reporting.indeed,news gathering and reporting is the fundamental essence of both contracts.for example,under the agreement,kpbs expressly agreed to provide inewsource with news gathering equipment and in exchange,inewsource agreed to provide,among other news reports,one watchdog feature per month and a w eekly data brief on a topic of interest to kpbs s audience.similarly,under the lease,kpbs leased space to inewsource for the benefit of securing investigative news content for kpbs.
nevertheless,sdog asserts section,subdivision d does not apply because it is suing hearn not for actually engaging in newsgathering,but instead for allegedly using her influence as an sdsu employee to negotiate a contract favorable for inewsource before any function began.this argument fails,however,because it incorrectly analyzes the applicability of section,subdivision d by focusing on hearn allegedly improper motive.section,subdivision d is not concerned with motive.there is nothing in the statute that conditions its application on good or bad motive,or any motive at all.rather,the statute is intended to protect news media engaged in newsgathering and reporting,conduct sdog lawsuit challenges by its attack on the contracts.
in the reply brief,sdog asserts that even if section,subdivision d otherwise would apply,we should reject its application because it exempts the press from being subject to laws of general applicability the state laws and prohibitions against the waste of public resources.in a related argument,sdog asserts,to hold that the statute renders a public employee untouchable under laws just because she is also a member of the press violates equal protection of the laws sdog contends defendants interpretation of section,subdivision d gives them immunity to violate conflict of interest laws while subjecting nonmedia public employees to those same laws.
we reject these sdog arguments because they betray a fundamental misunderstanding of the statute.determining the statute applies to a particular claim does not in any way exempt the defendant from being subject to laws of general applicability.the statute requires that in cases where the statute applies,the plaintiff is required to make a prima facie showing the claims alleged have minimal merit.if sdog actually had evidence to support a prima facie against defendants here,rather than just bare allegations in its complaint,the court would have been required to have denied the motions to strike.the statute poses no obstacle to suits that possess minimal merit.navellier,supra,cal th at.contrary to sdog assertions,determining section,subdivision d applies does not grant defendants any immunity whatsoever.navellier,supra,cal th at.it simply means that sdog is required to present admissible evidence to support its allegations,or have its case dismissed.
because section,subdivision d excepts sdog lawsuit from the exemption to the statute provided in subdivision b of the same statute,defendants were entitled to bring their motions.accordingly,we now consider whether the trial court correctly determined the action is one arising from protected activity under section and sdog failed to sustain its burden of establishing a prima facie case through admissible evidence 
protected activity 
in this step of the analysis,we determine whether sdog causes of action arise from the defendant acts in furtherance of the person right of free speech in connection with a public issue,subd.b.section,subdivision e sets forth four categories of protected activity.relevant here,subdivision e of that statute defines protected activity to include not only speech itself,but also any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e.this category is a that extends the statutes beyond actual instances of free speech to all conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the right of free speech in connection with a public issue.collier,supra,th at,italics omitted.an act is in furtherance of the rights of free speech if the act helps to advance that right or assists in the exercise of that right.ibid.
there is a protected free speech right to report the news.lieberman kcop television,th,lieberman.reporting the news and creating a television show both qualify as an exercise of free speech.hunter,supra,th at.reporting the news requires the assistance of newsgathering and other related conduct and activity,which are acts undertaken in furtherance of the news media right to free speech.such conduct is therefore is protected conduct under the statute.lieberman,supra,th at.
moreover,a n act is in furtherance of the right of free speech if the act helps to advance that right or assists in the exercise of that right.hunter,supra,th at,quoting tamkin cbs broadcasting,th,tamkin.accordingly,prepublication or preproduction acts such as investigating,newsgathering,and conducting interviews constitute conduct that furthers the right of free speech and is protected activity.hunter,supra,th at.
for example,in hunter,supra,th,the appellate court found the plaintiff age and gender discrimination claims against a television station were based on protected activity because the station decision to hire younger and less qualified persons as weather anchors were acts in furtherance of the station free speech rights.id.at.the news station casting decision helped advance or assist first amendment expression,and therefore was a form of protected activity.tamkin,supra,th at writer use of plaintiffs names in draft script of television show is protected activity because it helped to advance or assist in creating,casting,and broadcasting a television show lieberman,supra,th at allegedly unlawful newsgathering technique was protected activity because it aided in the reporting of news.
here,the trial court correctly determined sdog lawsuit arises from defendants protected activity.in assessing whether a cause of action arises from protected activity,we disregard the labeling of the claim citation and instead examine the principal thrust or gravamen of the plaintiff cause of action we assess the principal thrust by identifying t he allegedly wrongful and conduct.collier,supra,th at.
the allegations in sdog lawsuit make clear the conduct underlying its claims consists of the contracts between inewsource and kpbs that govern the process in which these defendants jointly engage in newsgathering and reporting news to the public.for example,paragraph of the complaint expressly states sdog challenges two contracts,namely,the agreement and the lease which sdog refers to as the agreement and the lease.in the first cause of action,sdog alleges the agreement is void because,among other reasons,the university defendants did not receive commensurate value under the agreement.in the second cause of action,sdog alleges the subsequent lease is void and otherwise illegal,for similar reasons.the third cause of action,where sdog realleges and incorporates by reference all of the allegations involving the agreement and lease is also based on that same contractual relationship among the defendants.in the fourth cause of action,sdog again centers its allegations against the two contracts,asserting hearn improperly used her position as a lecturer to secure approval of both contracts.thus,sdog lawsuit targets conduct the contracts that advances and assists the defendants in exercising their right to report the news,and therefore is protected activity under section,subdivision e.lieberman,supra,th at.
sdog attempts to avoid the application of the statute by asserting the acts the c omplaint is sic based on are defendants negotiation and execution of agreements violating statutory and constitutional prohibitions against and gifts of public funds.sdog states,the offending action here is the procuring of a contract by unlawful influence,and not any or petitioning activity.sdog asserts,but for defendants contracting in violation of law,this action would have never been brought.sdog repeats the same argument in its reply brief,asserting,the c omplaint is based on the following acts the negotiation and execution of the a greements by defendants in violation of government code s ections and and the california constitution.
sdog argument fails because it ignores california case law,which holds that in determining whether the defendant acts are protected activity,the underlying conduct must be separated from the defendant purported unlawful motive.hunter,supra,th at.for example,in hunter,plaintiff sued two los angeles television stations,alleging they had committed gender discrimination against him in their hiring of a weather anchor position for the news program.id.at.on appeal,the court held the statute applied to plaintiff claims because the conduct alleged in the complaint consisted of the defendant decisions about whom to hire as the weather anchor for its newscasts,an act in furtherance of the right to free speech.hunter,at.the plaintiff in hunter asserted the statute did not apply because the conduct underlying his causes of action was not the defendant selection of its weather anchors,but rather the decision to utilize discriminatory criteria in making those selections.hunter,at.the hunter court rejected that argument because it confuses the conduct underlying hunter claim cbs employment decisions with the purportedly unlawful motive underlying that conduct employment discrimination.id.at.the hunter court noted that the california supreme court in navellier,supra,cal th at page had clarified that when assessing whether claims arise from protected activity,courts must distinguish between the acts underlying a plaintiff causes of action and the claimed illegitimacy of those acts,which is an issue the plaintiff must raise and support in the context of demonstrating a prima facie showing of the merits hunter,supra,th at.
applying hunter,supra,th here,when determining whether sdog action arises from the defendants protected acts,we must separate the alleged unlawful motive from the defendants conduct entering into news gathering and news producing contracts.in hunter,the court held the plaintiff claims were based on the defendant decisions regarding its choice of a weather anchor,which were acts in furtherance of its first amendment rights,and not based on discrimination,which was the alleged motive for the conduct.hunter,supra,th at.likewise here,for purposes of applying the law,sdog claims are based on defendants decisions in entering into contracts to partner news gathering,news reporting,and news production on television and other media and not the alleged unlawful motive for such acts.accordingly,sdog action is based on acts in furtherance of defendants free speech rights,and therefore protected activity under the statute,subd.e.
in a related argument,sdog contends the statute does not apply because inewsource allegedly engaged in illegal activity in the subject contracts.in flatley mauro cal th,flatley,the california supreme court held that speech or petitioning activities that are illegal as a matter of law are not protected by the statute.
sdog argument fails because conduct that would otherwise come within the scope of the statute does not lose its coverage simply because it is alleged to have been unlawful or unethical.flatley,supra,cal th at.the asserted protected speech loses protection only if it is established through a defendant concession or by uncontroverted and conclusive evidence that the conduct is illegal as a matter of law.collier,supra,th at.the mere fact the plaintiff alleges the defendant engaged in unlawful conduct does not cause the conduct to lose its protection under the statute.birkner lam th.here,the defendants have not admitted the alleged conduct was illegal,and sdog presented no evidence to establish that it was illegal as a matter of law.accordingly,the illegal activity exception to the statute does not apply 
probable merits success 
having determined the allegations against defendants arose from protected speech,we next must determine whether sdog demonstrated a probability of prevailing on its claims.karnazes ares th,karnazes.to defeat the motion,sdog was required to submit competent and admissible evidence establishing a prima facie case.tuchscher development enterprises,san diego unified port dist.th.
