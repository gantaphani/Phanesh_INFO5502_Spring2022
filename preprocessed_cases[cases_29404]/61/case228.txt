controversy began to swirl when jeni porche became editor in chief of the innovator,the student newspaper at governors state university.none of the articles concerned the apostrophe missing from the university name.instead the students tackled meatier fare,such as its decision not to renew the teaching contract of geoffrey de laforcade,the paper faculty adviser.
after articles bearing margaret hosty attacked the integrity of roger oden,dean of the college of arts and sciences,the university administration began to take intense interest in the paper.here,and in part ii of this opinion as well,we relate matters in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.both oden and stuart fagan the university president issued statements accusing the innovator of irresponsible and defamatory journalism.when the innovator declined to accept the administration view of its particular,the paper refused to retract factual statements that the administration deemed false,or even to print the administration carter,dean of student affairs and services,called the innovator printer and told it not to print any issues that she had not reviewed and approved in advance.the printer was not willing to take the risk that it would not be paid the paper relies on student activity funds,and the editorial staff was unwilling to submit to prior review.publication ceased in november.the paper has since resumed publication under new management porche,hosty,and steven barba,another of the paper reporters,have continued the debate in court,suing the university,all of its trustees,most of its administrators,and several of its staff members for damages under.
defendants moved for summary judgment,and the district court granted the motion with respect to all except dean carter.wl,dist.lexis,see also d.some defendants prevailed because,in the district judge view,they had not done anything wrong or,indeed,anything at all,and does not create vicarious liability others received qualified immunity.as for carter,however,the judge thought that the evidence could support a conclusion that threatening to withdraw the innovator financial support violated the first amendment to the constitution applied to the university,as a unit of state government in illinois,through the fourteenth.although hazelwood school district kuhlmeier,d,holds that faculty may supervise and determine the content of a student newspaper,the district court thought that decision limited to papers published by high school students as part of course work and inapplicable to student newspapers edited by college students as extracurricular the judge added that these distinctions are so clearly established that no reasonable person in carter position could have thought herself entitled to pull the plug on the innovator.carter took an interlocutory appeal to pursue her claim of qualified immunity.see behrens pelletier,d.a panel of this court affirmed,and we granted carter petition for rehearing en banc.
when entertaining an interlocutory appeal by a public official who seeks the shelter of qualified immunity,the threshold question is taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,do the facts alleged show the public official conduct violated a constitutional right saucier katz,d.see also,brosseau haugen,d newsome mccabe,cir.only if the answer is affirmative does the court inquire whether the official enjoys qualified immunity.i f a violation could be made out on a favorable view of the parties submissions,the next,sequential step is to ask whether the right was clearly established.saucier,at.we address the issues in the order saucier specifies the existence of a constitutional claim in part ii and immunity in part iii.
hazelwood provides our starting point.a high school principal blocked the student newspaper which was financed by public funds as part of a journalism class from publishing articles that the principal thought inappropriate for some of the school younger students and a potential invasion of others privacy.when evaluating the students argument that the principal had violated their right to freedom of speech,the court first asked whether the paper was a public forum.at.after giving a negative answer based on the school established policy of supervising the writing and reviewing the content of each issue,the court observed that the school subvention of the paper costs distinguished the situation from one in which students were speaking independently,as in tinker des moines independent community school district,d.when a school regulates speech for which it also pays,the court held,the appropriate question is whether the actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.at.legitimate concerns,the court stated,include setting high standards for the student speech that is disseminated under its that may be higher than those demanded by some newspaper publishers or theatrical producers in the real the school may refuse to disseminate student speech that does not meet those standards.in addition,a school must be able to take into account the emotional maturity of the intended audience in determining whether to disseminate student speech on potentially sensitive topics,which might range from the existence of santa claus in an elementary school setting to the particulars of teenage sexual activity in a high school setting.id.at.shortly after this passage the court dropped a footnote a number of lower federal courts have similarly recognized that educators decisions with regard to the content of newspapers,dramatic productions,and other expressive activities are entitled to substantial deference.we need not now decide whether the same degree of deference is appropriate with respect to expressive activities at the college and university level.id.at.citations omitted.
picking up on this footnote,plaintiffs argue,and the district court held,that hazelwood is inapplicable to university newspapers and that educators therefore can not ever insist that student newspapers be submitted for review and approval.yet this footnote does not even hint at the possibility of an switch high school papers reviewable,college papers not reviewable.it addresses degrees of deference.whether some review is possible depends on the answer to the question,which does not automatically vary with the speakers age.only when courts need assess the reasonableness of the asserted pedagogical justification in situations does age come into play,and in a way suggested by the passage we have quoted from hazelwood text.to the extent that the justification for editorial control depends on the audience maturity,the difference between high school and university students may be important.not that any line could be bright many high school seniors are older than some college freshmen,and junior colleges are similar to many high schools.to the extent that the justification depends on other only the desire to ensure high standards for the student speech that is disseminated under the school auspices the court particularly mentioned speech that is ungrammatical,poorly written,inadequately researched,biased or prejudiced,vulgar or profane,or unsuitable for immature audiences,at.but also the goal of dissociating the school from any position other than neutrality on matters of political controversy,id.at.is no sharp difference between high school and college papers.
the supreme court itself has established that age does not control the question.see generally symposium do children have the same first amendment rights as adults.including many articles collecting and discussing these decisions.so much is clear not only from decisions such as tinker,which held that public school students have a right of personal expression on school premises,but also from the decisions concerning the use of school funds and premises for religious expression.see,lamb chapel center moriches union free school district,d rosenberger rector and visitors of the university of virginia,d good news club milford central school,d.see also hedges wauconda community unit school district,cir.these decisions hold that no public school,of any,secondary,or discriminate against religious speech in a public forum including classrooms made available to extracurricular activities,or withhold funding that would be available to student groups espousing sectarian views.good news club,which dealt with student clubs in an elementary school,deemed dispositive at.a decision about the first amendment rights of college students.having opened its premises to student clubs,and thus created a public forum,even an elementary school could not supervise or censor the views expressed at a meeting of the good news club.
if private speech in a public forum is to regulation even when that forum is a classroom of an elementary school the holding of good news club then speech at a forum,and underwritten at public expense,may be open to reasonable regulation even at the college later,as rust sullivan,d,shows by holding that the federal government may insist that physicians use grant funds only for the kind of speech required by the granting authority.national endowment for the arts finley,d.we hold,therefore,that hazelwood framework applies to subsidized student newspapers at colleges as well as elementary and secondary schools.see also johnson,cir hazelwood supplies the framework for evaluating collegiate speech and allows regulation when the speech is connected to the curriculum bishop aronov,cir hazelwood supplies the framework for evaluating collegiate speech and allows regulation when readers might infer the school approval.
hazelwood first question therefore remains our principal question as well was the reporter a speaker in a public forum no censorship allowed or did the university either create a forum or publish the paper itself a closed forum where content may be supervised plaintiffs contend,and the district court agreed,that the court found a public forum missing in hazelwood only because the paper was prepared as part of the journalism curriculum.by contrast,the innovator was an extracurricular activity,and thus beyond all control,the district court concluded.yet if the constitution establishes a bright line between curricular activities and all other speech,then decisions such as rust and finley are inexplicable,for they hold that speakers who have completed their education still must abide by the conditions attached to public subsidies of speech and other expressive activities.see also robert post,subsidized speech,yale.
suppose the university had given the innovator to publish a semester worth of newspapers,and porche then had decided that the students would get more benefit from a booklet describing campus life and cultural activities in the surrounding neighborhoods.both paper and booklet are forms of speech,but the fact that the publication was not part of the university curriculum and did not carry academic credit would not have allowed porche to divert the money from one kind of speech to the other.
or suppose that the publication in question were one under the university direct,its alumni magazine.if the university offered course credit to journalism students who prepared a publishable puff piece,the right to control would be evident.the university,after all,is the alumni magazine publisher the contents are its speech units of state and local government are entitled to speak for themselves.see johanns livestock marketing ass n,d university of wisconsin southworth,d keller state bar,d.that institutions can speak only through agents does not allow the agents to assume control and insist that submissions graded appear under the university masthead.livestock marketing ass has dispelled all doubt on that score.
now take away the course credit and assume that the alumni magazine hires students as stringers and pays by the word for any articles accepted and printed.the university would remain the operator of this forum and could pick and choose from among the submissions,printing only those that best expressed the university own viewpoint.thus although,as in hazelwood,being part of the curriculum may be a sufficient condition of a forum,it is not a necessary condition.extracurricular activities may be outside any public forum,as our example demonstrates,without also falling outside all university governance.let us not forget that academic freedom includes the authority of the university to manage an academic community and evaluate teaching and scholarship free from interference by other units of government,including the courts.see university of pennsylvania eeoc,d university of michigan ewing,d southworth,at.souter,concurring.
what,then,was the status of the innovator did the university establish a public forum or did it hedge the funding with controls that left the university itself as the newspaper publisher if the paper operated in a public forum,the university could not vet its contents.see southeastern promotions,conrad,d.but if underwritten student publications at governors state university are a forum,then it becomes important whether dean carter had legitimate pedagogical reasons for her action.we do not think it possible on this record to determine what kind of forum the university established or evaluate dean carter justifications.but the question posed by saucier is not who wins in the end,but whether the evidence makes out a constitutional claim when taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.these facts would permit a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that the innovator operated in a public forum and thus was beyond the control of the university administration.
the innovator did not participate in a traditional public forum.freedom of speech does not imply that someone else must pay.the university does not hand out money to everyone who asks.but by establishing a subsidized student newspaper the university may have created a venue that goes by the name designated public forum or public forum.see united states american library association,d united states kokinda,d perry education association perry local educators association,d.participants in such a forum,declared open to speech ex ante,may not be censored ex post when the sponsor decides that particular speech is unwelcome.the classrooms used for meetings in good news club were designated public forums,and because the school allowed any student group to use the space the court held that it could not forbid religious speech.in the same way,a school may declare the pages of the student newspaper open for expression and thus disable itself from engaging in viewpoint or content discrimination while the terms on which the forum operates remain unaltered.dean carter did not purport to alter the terms on which the innovator operated that authority belonged to the student communications media board.and the rules laid down by the board,though ambiguous,could be thought when considered as favorably to plaintiffs as the record allows to create a designated public forum.
defendants concede that the board is the publisher of the innovator and other subsidized print and broadcast media.the board has seven members,all chosen by the student senate four students,two faculty members,and one civil service or support unit employee of the university.the board determines how many publications it will underwrite subject to the availability of funds,which as in southworth and rosenberger come from student activities fees,and the general character of each.it appoints for the period of one year,the head of each student media staff.the board policy is that each funded publication will determine content and format without censorship or advance approval.if this is all there is to it,then the innovator is in the same position as the student speakers in southworth and rosenberger a designated public forum has been established,and the faculty can not censor speech within it.when viewing matters in the light most favorable to the students,we stop here,because other matters are cloudy.
two things have the potential to cast matters in a different light if a trial were to occur.one is that the board charter provides that it is responsible to the director of student life.perhaps the director of student life who appears to be one of dean carter subordinates has established criteria for subsidized student publications.none is in the record,however,so this possibility does not matter.the other is that each funded publication has a faculty adviser.the parties disagree not only about who the adviser was at the critical time plaintiffs say that de laforcade remained their adviser even after he left the university faculty carter insists that a different person filled that position but also about whether the adviser just offers advice plaintiffs view or exercises some control carter view.because the district court acted on a motion for summary judgment,it assumed as do we that plaintiffs perspective is the correct one.on that understanding,the board established the innovator in a designated public forum,where the editors were empowered to make their own decisions,wise or foolish,without fear that the administration would stop the presses.
qualified immunity nonetheless protects dean carter from personal liability unless it should have been clear to a reasonable public official that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.saucier,at.this inquiry,it is vital to note,must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the case,not as a broad general proposition.id.at.see also,wilson layne,d anderson creighton,d greenberg kmetko,cir en banc.one might well say as a broad general proposition something like public officials may not censor speech in a designated public forum,but whether dean carter was bound to know that the innovator operated in such a forum is a different question altogether.
the district court held that any reasonable college administrator should have known that a the approach of hazelwood does not apply to colleges and b only speech that is part of the curriculum is subject to supervision.we have held that neither of these propositions is hazelwood framework is generally applicable and depends in large measure on the operation of analysis rather than the distinction between curricular and extracurricular activities.
but even if student newspapers at high schools and colleges operate under different constitutional frameworks,as both the district judge and our panel thought,it greatly overstates the certainty of the law to say that any reasonable college administrator had to know that rule.the question had been reserved in hazelwood,and the supreme court does not identify for future decision questions that already have clearly established answers.see wilson layne,d.decisions likewise had not clearly established that college administrators must keep hands off all student newspapers.as we mentioned in part,the tenth and eleventh circuits have used hazelwood as the framework for evaluating the acts of colleges as well as high schools.one circuit has said otherwise.see student government ass university of massachusetts,cir asserting,in sole reliance on hazelwood footnote,that the supreme court itself holds that hazelwood approach does not apply to education.the approach of others is hard to classify.see kincaid gibson,cir en banc stating,in reliance on the parties agreement,that hazelwood has little application to collegiate publications but not explaining what this means,or how a constitutional framework can apply just a little.this circuit had not spoken on the subject until our panel opinion,which dean carter actions.
many aspects of the law with respect to students speech,not only the role of age,are difficult to understand and apply,as we remarked in baxter vigo county school,cir,when holding school administrators entitled to qualified immunity for banning certain that the pupils claimed were protected under tinker.see also,brown li,cir,in which the members of the appellate panel articulated three distinct and incompatible views about whether hazelwood applies to collegiate settings and how the first amendment affects relations between college faculty and students expression.
neither plaintiffs,who have elected to appear pro se,nor the amici curiae who have ably supported their position in this court,contend that dean carter owes damages from her own purse if hazelwood establishes the appropriate legal framework.for reasons that should by now be evident,the implementation of hazelwood means that both legal and factual uncertainties dog the it is the function of qualified immunity to ensure that such uncertainties are resolved by prospective relief rather than by financial exactions from public employees.qualified immunity shields an official from suit when she makes a decision that,even if constitutionally deficient,reasonably misapprehends the law governing the circumstances she confronted.brosseau.at.that description is as apt here as it was in brosseau.
public officials need not predict,at their financial peril,how constitutional uncertainties will be resolved.disputes about both law and fact make it inappropriate to say that any reasonable person in dean carter position in november had to know that the demand for review before the university would pay the innovator printing bills violated the first amendment.she therefore is entitled to qualified immunity from liability in damages.
in concluding that hazelwood extends to a university setting,the majority applies limitations on speech that the supreme court created for use in the narrow circumstances of elementary and secondary education.because these restrictions on free speech rights have no place in the world of college and graduate school,i respectfully dissent.
the majority conclusion flows from an incorrect there is no legal distinction between college and high school students.in reality,however,t he court long has recognized that the status of minors under the law is unique in many respects.bellotti baird,d.age,for which grade level is a very good indicator has always defined legal rights.as the court has noted 
constitutional rights do not mature and come into being magically only when one attains the age of majority.minors,as well as adults,are protected by the constitution and possess constitutional rights.the court indeed,however,long has recognized that the state has somewhat broader authority to regulate the activities of children than of adults.

this principle is clear with respect to free speech rights,where the court has delineated a consistent line between students and those at the university level.as the court noted in board of regents of the university of wisconsin system southworth,d,the right of teaching institutions to limit expressive freedom of students ha s been confined to high schools whose students and their schools relation to them are different and at least arguably distinguishable from their counterparts in college education.internal citations omitted.see also healy james,d t he precedents of this court leave no room for the view that,because of the acknowledged need for order,first amendment protections should apply with less force on college campuses than in the community at large.
there are two reasons why the law treats high school students differently than it treats college students,who are,of course,young adults,widmar vincent,d high school students are less mature and the missions of the respective institutions are different.these differences make it clear that hazelwood does not apply beyond high school contact.
it is that,as a general matter,juveniles are less mature than adults.indeed,during the formative years of childhood and adolescence,minors often lack the experience,perspective,and judgment to recognize and avoid choices that could be detrimental to them.bellotti,at.see also ginsberg new york,d stewart,concurring footnote omitted a t least in some precisely delineated areas,a someone in a captive not possessed of that full capacity for individual choice which is the presupposition of first amendment guarantees.it is this reasoning that dictated the results in hazelwood and bethel school district fraser.in hazelwood,the court emphasized that a different first amendment standard is appropriate in a high school setting because those students are young,emotionally immature,and more likely to be inappropriately influenced b
