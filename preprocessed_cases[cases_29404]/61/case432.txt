factual and procedural history 
on october,press enterprise petitioned the trial court for a judgment establishing press enterprise newspaper as a newspaper of general circulation for corona.press enterprise provided a memorandum of points and authorities in support of its petition.in the memorandum,relying on the section exemption,press enterprise asserted its newspaper is a newspaper of general circulation because it has been published in riverside county the county since,disseminating local or telegraphic news of general character,on a regular basis six days per week,with a bona fide list of subscribers.press enterprise asserted it published legal notices in.
corona was incorporated as a city in.press enterprise reasoned that since it was a newspaper of general circulation for the county,while the area that became corona was an unincorporated part the county,press enterprise newspaper remained a newspaper of general circulation for corona after corona incorporated.in other words,the incorporation of the city did not change press enterprise status as a newspaper of general circulation for the area that became corona.
press enterprise presented a secondary argument as well.in the secondary argument,press enterprise asserted that after corona incorporated,but prior to,its newspaper became a newspaper of general circulation within corona because it was published six days per week,and circulated to a bona fide list of subscribers in corona.
opposition 
sentinel,whose offices are in corona,opposed press enterprise petition.sentinel asserted the petition is silent as to whether the press enterprise has ever been printed in the city of corona.sentinel asserted press enterprise failed to meet the exception in section with respect to the printing requirement.
first hearing 
on november,the trial court held a hearing in the case.the trial court announced its tentative decision court finds that the press enterprise has met all pre requirements to be a newspaper of general circulation prior to the incorporation of the city of corona pursuant to government code section.in addition,it appears that post,the press enterprise has met the requirements of general circulation as well.on that basis,the court would grant the petition.
sentinel asserted press enterprise had incorrectly read the law related to press enterprise first argument concerning being a newspaper of general circulation for the county,and thereby automatically becoming a newspaper of general circulation for the newly incorporated corona.sentinel argued that if the law provided for such automatic status then every older newspaper would be adjudicated in every city incorporated after even if it did have a presence in that community.sentinel asserted the correct reading of the law is that if a newspaper of general circulation is operating in an unincorporated area,and that area then incorporates,the newspaper can remain a newspaper of general circulation for the newly incorporated area however,the newspaper must have operations based in the relevant area.
press enterprise asserted,some kind of general circulation activity prior to the incorporation of a city was all the law required.thus,since press enterprise newspaper circulated in corona prior to corona incorporating in,press enterprise met the section exemption.sentinel argued that press enterprise had misinterpreted the law.the trial court took the matter under submission saying it would reread the relevant law.
supplemental opposition 
sentinel filed a supplemental opposition.sentinel asserted press enterprise was misstating the law regarding a newspaper of general circulation for a county automatically becoming a newspaper of general circulation for cities incorporated in the county.sentinel argued a newspaper must meet all the legal requirements for a newspaper of general circulation,there is not an automatic status conferred.
the day prior to the november hearing,press enterprise had filed a supplemental declaration with a notice from a edition of the newspaper attached.the notice was a notice of sale for real property belonging to an incompetent person.the property was situated in corona.the sale was scheduled to take place in the city of riverside.the notice of sale was published in the press enterprise newspaper on february.in sentinel opposition,it asserted there was nothing indicating the notice,or notices that press enterprise had produced,were the type of notices that were required to be published in a newspaper of general circulation for corona.as a result,sentinel asserted press enterprise had not established it was a newspaper of general circulation in corona prior to.
supplemental support for the petition 
press enterprise filed supplemental support for its petition.press enterprise reiterated that,prior to,its newspaper was published six days per week,it disseminated local or telegraphic news of a general character,and the newspaper circulated to a bona fide list of subscribers within corona.press enterprise argued that,based upon this evidence,its newspaper qualified as a newspaper of general circulation in corona.
press enterprise also reiterated its assertion that its newspaper automatically qualified as a newspaper of general circulation in corona because,prior to corona incorporation,the newspaper was a newspaper of general circulation in the county.
second hearing 
on january,the trial court held another hearing in the matter.at the beginning of the hearing,the trial court provided its tentative ruling t he press enterprise meets the requirements of government code section and the exemption under.so the court would grant the petition.
sentinel argued that press enterprise failed to prove the newspaper qualified as a newspaper of general circulation prior to.in particular,sentinel asserted there was nothing indicating press enterprise published legal notices that were required to be published in corona prior to.
press enterprise clarified that it was relying on the exception in section.despite the trial court tentative opinion,press enterprise conceded it did not meet the section requirements because the newspaper is not printed in corona.press enterprise argued that providing legal notices published before was an alternative means of proving a newspaper was a newspaper of general circulation.press enterprise argued that in addition to the notice evidence,it also showed the newspaper was regularly published,and there were subscribers in corona prior to.therefore,press enterprise asserted,this is a newspaper that was publishing in corona.
after the press enterprise argument,the trial court asked when corona was incorporated.press enterprise counsel responded.the trial court then said,the court will stand by its tentative,grant the petition.
discussion 
overview of the law 
the government code provides that whenever any official advertising,notice,resolution,order,or other matter is required by law to be published in a newspaper,such publication shall be made only in a newspaper of general circulation,and that term is defined in section as a newspaper for the dissemination of news and intelligence of a general character which has a bona fide subscription list of paying subscribers and has been established,printed and published at regular intervals for at least one year preceding publication in the state,county,or city where the publication is to be made.the word established is defined as referring to a newspaper which has been in existence under a specified name for the whole of the period.until a newspaper could qualify as printed and published within the meaning of the predecessor of section even though the physical act of printing was not performed in the place where the paper was to appear citation,but in that year the legislature adopted provisions,still in effect,defining printed and published in such a manner that a newspaper could not be deemed one of general circulation for an area unless percent of the mechanical work of typesetting and impressing type on paper was completed there.in re norwalk call cal d,fn.omitted.
also in,however,the legislature enacted the provision involved in this proceeding,declaring,nothing in this chapter alters the standing of any newspaper which,prior to the passage of chapter of the statutes of,was an established newspaper of general circulation,irrespective of whether it was printed in the place where it was published for a period of one year as required.in re norwalk call,supra,cal d at.therefore,if a newspaper met all the requirements to qualify as an established newspaper of general circulation before and has continued to meet all the standards in force at that time,then it may rely on the exception in section concerning printing location.norwalk call,at.
prior to,the law provided,a newspaper of general circulation is a newspaper published for the dissemination of local or telegraphic news and intelligence of a general character,having a bona fide subscription list of paying subscribers,and which shall have been established,printed and published at regular intervals,in the state,county,city,city and county,or town,where such publication,notice by publication,or official advertising is given or made,for at least one year preceding the date of such publication,notice or advertisement.in re mcdonald cal,mcdonald.
in,the supreme court considered whether a newspaper,the ontario weekly herald was a newspaper of general circulation for ontario,when the offices for the newspaper were in ontario,ontario was the newspaper principal place of circulation,and a city license to conduct the newspaper business was paid to the city of ontario,but the newspaper was physically printed in colton.the supreme court framed the issue as whether the fact that the physical printing of the paper is done in one town,and the publication and circulation in another,prevents it from being a newspaper of general circulation within the meaning of the statute.mcdonald,supra,cal.at.
the supreme court explained that the purpose of the law is to define the term newspaper in a manner that would allow important notices to reach the community affected by the information in the notices.mcdonald,supra,cal d at.the court explained that since the newspaper offices were in ontario and its taxes were paid in ontario,the newspaper was caused to be printed in ontario,published in ontario,and circulated in ontario.the court reasoned that production of the newspaper was done in ontario,save the setting up of the type and making the impressions on the paper.id.at.the court determined that limiting the definition of printed to setting type and impressing words on paper would be too strict of a limit.therefore,t he only reasonable construction that can be given to printed and published is that the paper must be produced in the community where it is aimed to have it recognized as a legal advertising medium.id.at.
thus,the section exception protects newspapers such as the ontario weekly herald.for example,prior to,a newspaper such as the ontario weekly herald could be a newspaper of general circulation in ontario even though it was printed in colton because all the other aspects of the newspaper production occurred in ontario.upon passage of the law requiring printing to take place in the relevant city,the ontario weekly herald could have lost its status as a newspaper of general circulation for ontario,if not for the section exception for newspapers established as newspapers of general circulation prior to.due to that exception,the ontario weekly herald could remain a newspaper of general circulation for ontario.
section also protects newspapers that had a connection to a particular area,printing or producing the newspaper in the city,but have relocated.as an example,the exemption applies wherein a newspaper was printed in anaheim prior to,but then moved its printing operations to the city of orange after.although the newspaper is no longer printed in anaheim,under the section exemption,since it was a newspaper of general circulation in anaheim prior to,it can continue to be a newspaper of general circulation in anaheim,even though it is now printed in the city of orange.in re anaheim daily gazette d.
at oral argument in this court,the press enterprise repeatedly cited to the case of in re byers cal byers.in byers,a newspaper,the peninsula news,had,in,been adjudicated a newspaper of general circulation for the city of san bruno.at that time the newspaper was printed and published in the city of san bruno.the peninsula news later consolidated with the san bruno herald.the newspaper was then published as the consolidated san bruno herald and peninsula news.byers,at.
in,bramble petitioned the trial court to vacate the adjudication on the ground that for one year prior to the filing of the petition,the mechanical work of printing of the newspaper had not been done in the city of san bruno.the proprietors of the san bruno herald and peninsula news conceded the mechanical work of printing the merged newspaper was not conducted in san bruno.bramble lost in the trial court.byers,supra,cal.at.
the supreme court noted that prior to,in mcdonald,supra,the court had held a newspaper was printed and published in a city or locality if it was issued and circulated there,although the mechanical work of producing the paper was done in some other city or locality.the court also explained the legislature changed the law in so that printed came to mean that the mechanical work of producing a newspaper of general circulation shall be performed at the place of its issue and circulation.byers,supra,cal.at.
at the supreme court,bramble argued that the san bruno herald and peninsula news lost its standing as a newspaper of general circulation because it did not meet the legal requirements to be a newspaper of general circulation.byers,supra,cal.at.the supreme court found bramble argument to be unpersuasive because the legislature had passed a law providing,nothing in this title shall be construed to alter the standing of any newspaper which,prior to the passage of this act,was an established newspaper of general circulation,irrespective of whether it has been printed in the place where it is published for a period of one year ibid.the supreme court explained that newspapers already established as newspapers of general circulation prior to were unaffected by the change in the law requiring printing to take place in the city relevant to the legal notices.id.at.since the peninsula news had already been adjudicated a newspaper of general circulation,it was unaffected by the change in the law.the supreme court affirmed the trial court denial of bramble petition.id.at.
as set forth ante,the exception at issue requires the newspaper be an established newspaper of general circulation prior to.the exception allows a newspaper that is no longer printed in city x to still be a newspaper of general circulation for city x,so long as it was a newspaper of general circulation for city x prior to.in order to be a newspaper of general circulation prior to,a newspaper must show it disseminated local or telegraphic news and intelligence of a general character had a bona fide subscription list of paying subscribers and was established,printed and published in the city where legal notices are desired to be given for at least one year.mcdonald,supra,cal.at.under mcdonald and byers,the requirement of established,printed and published means at some point prior to the newspaper was printed or in some manner produced in the city at issue.mcdonald,at newspaper office in relevant city byers,supra,cal.at,predecessor newspaper printed in relevant city in.
under section,the question is whether press enterprise newspaper was,prior to,a newspaper established,printed and published at regular intervals in corona at that time.in re anaheim daily gazette,supra,d at.press enterprise asserts we should apply the substantial evidence standard of review because this case involves competing inferences drawn from the evidence.for the sake of judicial efficiency,rather than analyze if the evidence is truly being disputed,we will apply the substantial evidence standard.see and frances berger foundation perez th,de novo standard applies when evidence is undisputed.
thus,the issue is whether there is substantial evidence press enterprise newspaper was printed or otherwise produced in corona prior to.in re anaheim daily gazette,supra,d at.the evidence reflects the newspaper was circulated in corona.however,the law requires more than circulation there must be an aspect of production of the newspaper in the relevant city.mcdonald,supra,cal.at paper must be produced in the community.there is no evidence that the newspaper was produced in corona prior to.as a result,press enterprise has not met the plain requirements of section because substantial evidence does not reflect the newspaper was printed or otherwise produced in corona prior to.
automatic qualification 
press enterprise contends its newspaper is a newspaper of general circulation in corona because it automatically qualified as such when corona incorporated.press enterprise asserts its newspaper met the requirements of a newspaper of general circulation for the county in,so when corona incorporated in,the newspaper automatically became a newspaper of general circulation for the newly incorporated city,because the change in the city incorporation status would not have changed the newspaper status.
we apply the de novo standard of review because this issue centers on interpreting the law.automotive funding group,garamendi th.
in re norwalk call concerns a newspaper known as norwalk call which,in the,petitioned to be declared a newspaper of general circulation in the city of norwalk.in re norwalk call,supra,cal d at.it was undisputed that,prior to,the newspaper company conducted its operations in the township of norwalk,then unincorporated,in a manner entitling it to be a newspaper of general circulation under the law then existing.id.at.norwalk call asserted it did not meet the requirement under the general rule,so it necessarily relied on the section exception.norwalk call,at.
the party opposing the petition asserted the newspaper could not be a newspaper of general circulation in the city of norwalk based upon the section exception because the city of norwalk was not incorporated until after.in re norwalk call,supra,cal d at.the supreme court explained that the purpose of having newspapers meet certain criteria was to ensure that the published notices come to the attention of a substantial number of people that may be in the affected area.therefore,changes in the political structure or names of governmental entities within the area,from unincorporated to incorporated,is irrelevant if the newspaper has been an established one of general circulation for a given territorial area.ibid.a divided supreme court affirmed the ruling establishing norwalk call as a newspaper of general circulation for the city of norwalk three justices dissented and would have reversed the judgment.id.at.
press enterprise asserts that,under in re norwalk call,since press enterprise newspaper was a newspaper of general circulation for the county in,which included the unincorporated area of corona,when corona incorporated in,the newspaper automatically became a newspaper of general circulation for the newly incorporated city.press enterprise has read in re norwalk call too broadly.in re norwalk call does not create an automatic qualification rule for any city incorporated in a county after the newspaper establishes itself as a newspaper of general circulation for the county.rather,in re norwalk call explains that if,prior to,a newspaper operated in an unincorporated area of a county and circulated in that area,and then that area incorporates as a city and the newspaper is still circulated in that original area,the newspaper can still be a newspaper of general circulation for that newly incorporated area.the primary point being,prior to,the newspaper operations took place in the unincorporated area that became the city.for example,prior to,norwalk call conducted its operations in the township of norwalk,then unincorporated,and later sought to be a newspaper of general circulation in the incorporated city of norwalk.in re norwalk call,supra,cal d at.
in sum,in re norwalk call does not create the rule posited by press enterprise there is not an automatic qualification rule.under in re norwalk call,press enterprise would need to show that it operated the newspaper in the unincorporated area that became corona.in re norwalk call,supra,cal d at.
we now apply the substantial evidence standard in determining whether press enterprise sufficiently established it operated the newspaper in the unincorporated area that became corona.see winograd american broadcasting th,substantial evidence standard applies to factual issues.press enterprise provides evidence that it circulated the newspaper in corona and published a notice of sale relevant to corona,but does not provide evidence that it printed or produced the newspaper in corona.since in re norwalk call retains the requirement,we find press enterprise argument to be unpersuasive because it has not shown a production connection with corona.
further,when corona incorporated,presuming the press enterprise newspaper was the sole newspaper in the area,corona residents could have still had the means to publish legal notices.for example,the law provides that if there is no newspaper of general circulation for a city,then a legal notice may be published in some other newspaper of general circulation published in the same county,if there is one,and if there is none,or if publication in such newspaper is refused,then,in lieu thereof,in some other newspaper of general circulation published in an adjacent county or in such other newspaper as the court shall direct,subd.b.thus,corona residents presumably could have still published legal notices in a newspaper of general circulation for the county,if there was not a newspaper of general circulation specifically for the newly incorporated city of corona.
