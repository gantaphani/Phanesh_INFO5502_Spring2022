spanish broadcasting system sbs appeals the dismissal with prejudice of its first amended complaint under sections one and two of the sherman act against clear channel cc and the hispanic broadcasting corporation hbc.sbs and hbc are the two largest owners of radio stations in the united states.sbs owns fourteen stations in seven radio markets,including five of the top ten radio markets,while hbc owns stations and operates in each of the top ten markets.cc owns the largest network of radio stations in the united states,covering some stations in more than markets.cc also owns of hbc.sbs sued cc and hbc,claiming that they had attempted to limit the ability of sbs to compete in the radio market and sought to drive sbs out of business by engaging in numerous practices made unlawful by the sherman act.
congress passed the sherman act,the first major piece of antitrust legislation,in.following the civil war,rapid industrialization under relatively limited governmental regulation allowed large firms and coordinated groups in several industries to amass considerable economic power at the expense of smaller rivals.congress sought to restore a competitive environment and limit the formation,persistence,and power of large,anticompetitive combinations.see,apex hosiery leader.discussing legislative history.section one of the act prohibits contracts,combinations and conspiracies in restraint of trade,while section two prohibits monopolization,attempted monopolization and conspiracy to monopolize.although congress has also barred specific practices through subsequent legislation,and although the interpretation and enforcement of these provisions has varied considerably over time,the sherman act remains the basic cornerstone of antitrust law.
because the sherman act contains only general language,courts have played an extremely important role in shaping the reach of the act and the requirements for stating a cause of action under each section.critically,under both sections,an antitrust plaintiff must show harm to competition in general,rather than merely damage to an individual competitor.see am.key cole,cir harm to competition is a necessary element of all private antitrust suits under sections and of the sherman act.as the supreme court has explained 
t he purpose of the sherman act is not to protect businesses from the working of the market it is to protect the public from the failure of the market.the law directs itself not against conduct which is competitive,even severely so,but against conduct which unfairly tends to destroy competition itself.it does so not out of solicitude for private concerns but out of concern for the public interest.
spectrum sports,mcquillan,d.this case turns in large part on whether sbs has met its obligation to allege facts that would support a showing of this harm to competition,rather than merely to itself.
the contained claims against both cc and hbc as follows cc and hbc have conspired to adversely affect sbs stock price by pressuring analysts not to cover sbs stock,by leaking confidential information about an attempted acquisition of sbs,and by encouraging investors to sell sbs stock cc and hbc have conspired to make it more difficult for sbs to acquire new radio stations by bidding up prices and by wrongfully appropriating business opportunities created by sbs and cc and hbc have induced various sbs employees to breach their contracts and join hbc.in addition,the complaint contained specific claims against cc alone cc hindered sbs ability to raise capital by spreading rumors about an sbs executive and by threatening to withdraw cc own business from an underwriting firm if it worked with sbs and cc leveraged its ownership of both concert venues and a hispanic entertainment company in order to discourage advertisers from purchasing time on sbs.
sbs alleged that these practices constituted an agreement between cc and hbc to restrain trade in violation of section one of the sherman act as well as attempted monopolization by both cc and hbc of the major radio markets in violation of section two of the act.in addition to federal antitrust violations,sbs claimed causes of action under florida and california statutes and under various common law theories.
the district court dismissed sbs complaint with prejudice,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,after concluding that sbs could not meet the requirements necessary to maintain a sherman antitrust suit.on appeal,sbs argues that the district court erred as a matter of law in dismissing the complaint,abused its discretion in failing to grant leave to amend the complaint,and erred in dismissing the complaint with prejudice.
we review de novo a district court decision to dismiss an antitrust complaint under rule b for failure to state a claim.lowell am.cyanamid,cir.we accept the factual allegations in the complaint as true and make all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.the threshold of sufficiency that a complaint must meet to survive a motion to dismiss is exceedingly low,and rule b dismissals are particularly disfavored in antitrust cases.quality foods de centro america,latin american agribusiness dev,cir.the complaint should only be dismissed with prejudice if it appears beyond doubt that sbs can prove no set of facts which would entitle it to relief.joseph,hosp.of,cir.
in this case,neither the complaint nor the appellate briefs are models of clarity in defining the precise claims brought under the antitrust laws or describing how the factual allegations in the complaint satisfy the necessary elements of each specific claim.nonetheless,we will attempt to categorize the claims in terms of existing antitrust case law.
sherman act section one 
section one of the sherman act provides 
every contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states or with foreign nations,is declared to be illegal.
thus,section one prohibits combinations and conspiracies that restrain interstate or foreign trade.this provision applies both to agreements between companies that directly compete with one another,called horizontal agreements,and to agreements between businesses operating at different levels of the same product production chain or distribution chain,known as vertical agreements.in addition,although some restraints on trade remain illegal per se,such as certain agreements to fix prices,most asserted antitrust violations now require the finder of fact to decide whether the questioned practice imposes an unreasonable restraint on competition,taking into account a variety of factors,including specific information about the relevant business,its condition before and after the restraint was imposed,and the restraint history,nature,and effect.state oil khan,d emphasis added.section one claims that do not allege per se antitrust violations are analyzed under this rule of reason,and the claims fail if the restraint on trade is reasonable.both parties accept that the rule of reason applies to the section one claims raised by sbs in this case.
section one applies only to agreements between two or more businesses it does not cover unilateral conduct.fisher city of berkeley,d even where a single firm restraints directly affect prices and have the same economic effect as concerted action might have,there can be no liability under in the absence of agreement.thus,for the purposes of our section one analysis,we only consider the alleged conspiracy between cc and hbc.unfortunately,sbs does not specify the precise nature of the agreement alleged in its complaint or connect it to any particular theory identified in the case law.even if we were to assume that cc and hbc acted in concert for purposes of section one,however,we would still affirm here,given that sbs failed to allege sufficient anticompetitive effect,a critical component of any antitrust claim.
under eleventh circuit case law,alleged section one agreements analyzed under the rule of reason require a plaintiff to prove the anticompetitive effect of the defendant conduct on the relevant market and that the defendant conduct has no benefit or justification.levine cent.med.affiliates,cir.in alleging the anticompetitive effect of the defendant conduct,an antitrust plaintiff must show harm to competition rather than to competitors.that is,the anticompetitive effects are measured by their impact on the market rather than by their impact on competitors.see,dickson microsoft,cir to have an anticompetitive effect,conduct must harm the competitive process and thereby harm consumers h arm to one or many competitors will not suffice.quoting united states microsoft.in order to prove this anticompetitive effect on the market,the plaintiff may either prove that the defendants behavior had an actual detrimental effect on competition,or that the behavior had the potential for genuine adverse effects on competition.levine,at internal quotations omitted.
in an attempt to meet this burden,sbs focuses upon the harm it allegedly suffered at the hands of hbc and cc,such as weakened stock prices,restricted access to capital markets,loss of employees,damaged reputation,and loss of advertising revenue.none of these allegations assert damage to competition itself rather than damage to sbs,one competitor in the advertising market.as the district court indicated,the amended complaint contains no allegations at all about a factual connection between the conduct alleged and overall impact on the advertising market.indeed,at oral argument before the district court,sbs stated that cc worked to keep advertising rates lower in order to maximize advertising revenues.
in aquatherm industries florida power light,cir,we upheld a rule b dismissal of a claim that the defendant actions,including the dissemination of false information,violated the sherman act.we emphasized that damage to a single competitor,even as a result of deliberate misinformation,does not state a claim under section one of the sherman act 
aquatherm does not show,or even claim,that the actions by fpl harmed competition in the relevant market.its only claim is fpl acted unfairly by disseminating false information,and this unfair competition in turn harmed aquatherm business.this claim of unfair competition is not sufficient to support a claim under or any other federal antitrust provision.as long as no restraint on competition occurred,there is no cause of action under.
aquatherm,at emphasis in original.here,as well,we find that although sbs may have alleged unfair competitive practices,it did not adequately allege actual harm to competition.
on appeal,the plaintiffs argue that because sbs is the primary competitor of hbc in the advertising market,any damage it suffers inherently damages competition in that market.they rely upon full draw productions easton sports,cir,and caribbean broadcasting system,cable wireless plc,as examples of complaints that survived motions to dismiss despite alleging damage to only one competitor.however,in those two cases,the plaintiffs also alleged harm to competition in general by pointing to the specific damage done to consumers in the relevant market.see full draw,at discussing the reduction in exhibition space at archery trade shows following the complete elimination of the sole competitor caribbean broadcasting,at discussing allegations that the defendants complete monopoly on caribbean fm radio advertising actually caused consumers to pay higher prices and that the defendants deceptive practices and frivolous objections to the plaintiff license application helped sustain that monopoly.in both cases,the defendants anticompetitive practices achieved a complete monopoly in the relevant market,leaving consumers with no alternative.that is simply not the case here.although damage to a critical competitor may also damage competition in general,sbs bears the burden of drawing that implication with specific factual allegations.it has not done so here 
concluding that no actual damage to competition has been sufficiently alleged in the plaintiff amended complaint,we turn to the alternative method for alleging an anticompetitive effect the potential for genuine adverse effects on competition.levine,at.at a minimum,this requires a plaintiff to define the relevant market and establish that the defendants possessed power in that market.maris distrib,cir see also levine,at.for this claim,we assume without deciding,as did the district court,that the plaintiffs have alleged adequate market power in the relevant market.however,market power alone can not be sufficient to show the potential for genuine adverse effects on competition.in ftc indiana federation of dentists,d,the case from which the eleventh circuit drew its test,see levine,at,the supreme court never stated that market power alone could establish the potential for genuine adverse effects on competition.rather,because the court found actual,sustained adverse effects on competition,there was no need for additional inquiry into market power.at.similarly,in an earlier case on vertical price restraints in this circuit,we noted that market power would not be enough to state a section one claim under the rule of reason 
the burden of proving unreasonable effects in a rule of reason case rests with the antitrust plaintiff.therefore,the plaintiff,after crossing the threshold of showing the defendant market power,was required to establish that the interbrand market structure was such that intrabrand competition was a critical source of competitive pressure on price,and hence of consumer welfare.
graphic prods,itek,cir internal citations and punctuation omitted.other courts of appeals have reached the same conclusion and required specific allegations linking market power to harm to competition in that market.as the second circuit recently stated 
even assuming this market share data implies that the defendant possessed market power,the plaintiff still would fail to satisfy its burden under the requirement.market power,while necessary to show adverse effect indirectly,alone is insufficient.a plaintiff seeking to use market power as a proxy for adverse effect must show market power,plus some other ground for believing that the challenged behavior could harm competition in the market,such as the inherent anticompetitive nature of the defendant behavior or the structure of the interbrand market.
tops,quality,cir citations omitted see also dickson,at.
in this case,sbs has not described how the defendants alleged behavior would be likely to harm competition.in fact,as the district court noted,sbs has expanded considerably over the past few years,has a share of the new york,chicago and miami markets somewhat comparable to that of hbc,and was itself engaged in merger talks with hbc.by its own admission,advertisers continue to shift larger portions of their budget toward the market as that market grows.sbs admitted that consumers currently pay less for advertising than they might in the absence of cc activities.given these alleged facts and in the absence of specific allegations detailing the threat to the advertising market,sbs did not state a claim for relief against cc or hbc under section one,and the district did not err in dismissing the section one claims of the first amended complaint.
ii.sherman act section two 
section two of the sherman act provides 
every person who shall monopolize,or attempt to monopolize,or combine or conspire with any other person or persons,to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several states,or with foreign nations,shall be deemed guilty of a felony 
thus,section two makes it a crime to monopolize,to attempt to monopolize,or to conspire to monopolize any part of interstate or foreign trade.this provision covers behavior by a single business as well as coordinated action taken by several businesses.
the first amended complaint alleged only attempted monopolization,which involves three distinct elements the defendant has engaged in predatory or anticompetitive conduct with a specific intent to monopolize and a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power.spectrum sports,at.
like claims under section one,section two claims require harm to competition that must occur within a relevant,that is,a distinct market,with a specific set of geographical boundaries and a narrow delineation of the products at issue.see anchor rule,cir defining a relevant product market is primarily a process of describing those groups of producers which,because of the similarity of their products,have the or take significant amounts of business away from each other.under section one,this relevant market must have been harmed by an unreasonable restraint on trade,draper son,cir,while under section two,the alleged monopolist must possess enough power or potential power in this relevant market in order to harm competition.morris communications pga tour,cir.as noted above,sbs explained that it considered the relevant market to be advertising purchased in the top ten markets and that hbc earned of the advertising revenue in that market.
we first address the allegations as they pertain to cc.there is no question that cc does not participate in the radio market.thus,cc can not attempt to monopolize that market.see aquatherm,at rejecting an attempted monopolization claim against a defendant who did not compete in the relevant market.sbs attempts to overcome this hurdle by pointing out that cc owns of hbc,implying that this either makes cc an effective participant in the relevant market or at least gives cc sufficient control over hbc to permit attempted monopolization.we reject this contention.absent allegations of significant control over the policies of a subsidiary,a minority ownership share does not convert a parent corporation into a competitor.in caribbean broadcasting,a case heavily relied upon by sbs,the circuit specifically rejected a claim against a parent corporation grounded upon a ownership interest in the plaintiff direct competitor.at.as the court noted,one company minority ownership interest in another company is not sufficient by itself to make the owner a competitor,for purposes of the antitrust laws,of the subsidiary rivals.to be a competitor at the level of the subsidiary,the parent must have substantial control over the affairs and policies of the subsidiary.id.
although the complaint alleges that cc has veto power over hbc merger and stock decisions,the complaint contains no allegations with respect to control over operations or general corporate policies in fact,the sealed second amended complaint contains factual allegations inconsistent with that level of influence.sbs has pointed to no case in which a minority shareholder can attempt to monopolize a market on behalf of its subsidiary,nor can we locate one.thus,the only section two claim available against cc might be conspiracy to monopolize,which was not raised in the first amended complaint accordingly,because cc does not participate in the relevant market,sbs attempted monopolization claim against cc was properly dismissed.
we therefore turn to the attempted monopolization claim against hbc.the first element of this claim requires a plaintiff to allege facts that show that the defendant has engaged in predatory or anticompetitive conduct.this anticompetitive conduct criterion captures the critical antitrust idea of harm to competition,rather than to competitors.regardless of the defendant power or intent,its conduct may be incapable of producing monopoly,and thus unable to satisfy the attempt requirement.areeda hovenkamp,iiia antitrust law.in fact,the conduct requirement is arguably the single most important aspect of attempted monopolization.northeastern.am,cir.
as with section one claims,conduct that injures individual firms rather than competition in the market as a whole does not violate section two.the supreme court has explained that e ven an act of pure malice by one business competitor against another does not,without more,state a claim under the federal antitrust laws.brooke group brown williamson tobacco,d.in this circuit,we have affirmed a directed verdict on an attempted monopolization claim in part because the plaintiff failed to demonstrate any cognizable anticompetitive effect of the defendant unfair competition.research greenlee tool,cir.we noted that o ur cases have recognized that injury to a competitor need not always result in injury to competition.the use of unfair means resulting in the substitution of one competitor for another without more does not violate the antitrust laws.id.similarly,the ninth circuit upheld the dismissal of an attempted monopolization claim for failure to state a claim because the complaint merely alleged an attempt to eliminate two firms from the market rather than injury to competition 
nowhere in their afa complaint,however,do appellants allege injury to the competitive market for pb polybutylene.instead,they allege that the actions between shell oil defendants and their overseas affiliates were taken for the purpose of eliminating appellants as representatives of shell chemical and as sellers of pb and products,and for the financial benefit of defendant shell chemical and the parties acting in concert with such defendant.thus appellants fail to state an antitrust claim based on defendants conduct with respect to pb and products.it is injury to the market or to competition in general,not merely injury to individuals or individual firms that is significant.
mcglinchy shell chem,cir see also joseph bauer william page,ii kintner federal antitrust law noting that practices that harm other firms without harming competition can not constitute unlawfully exclusionary conduct in the attempt context.
careful examination of the first amended complaint reveals no allegations of anticompetitive conduct that could sustain a claim under section two.with respect to hbc,sbs alleges that hbc leveraged its relationship with cc to obtain preferential treatment from auditors and investors,discouraged analysts and investors from dealing with sbs,misrepresented the state of sbs finances in order to adversely affect sbs stock price,and engaged in a bidding war with sbs over a los angeles radio station.as with the section one claims,sbs essentially urges us to equate harm to it with harm to competition as a matter of law.we do not believe the law supports this proposition.while some of these specific practices might be characterized as unsavory,or even illegal under other laws they do not give rise to a federal antitrust claim without factual allegations specifically addressing how these practices have harmed competition.as the supreme court has stated,the antitrust laws do not create a federal law of unfair competition or purport to afford remedies for all torts committed by or against persons engaged in interstate commerce.brooke group,at.internal quotation marks omitted.because sbs has not alleged any harm to competition in the market,nor explained how any of the actions taken by hbc could lead to monopolization of that market,sbs has not alleged anticompetitive conduct and thus has not stated a claim against hbc under section two 
iii.the second amended complaint 
following the dismissal of its amended complaint with prejudice,sbs filed a motion for reconsideration along with a proposed second amended complaint.the court conducted a careful review of the proposed second amended complaint and concluded that sbs can not allege facts to survive dismissal.order of,at.the court therefore denied the motion.
we review the denial of leave to amend for abuse of discretion.long satz,cir kennamer,cir.under the federal rules of civil procedure,leave to amend shall be freely given when justice so requires.a.the supreme court has emphasized that leave to amend must be granted absent a specific,significant reason for denial 
in the absence of any apparent or declared as undue delay,bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant,repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed,undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment,futility of amendment,leave sought should,as the rules require,be freely given.
