ii.background

at trial,evidence was introduced that in,minshall violated an agreement to protect the anonymity of a source by allowing a document to be aired showing the source name.introduced evidence that minshall appeared visibly intoxicated while accepting an award for a series on drunk driving at a emmy awards ceremony.minshall testified that he apologized for his conduct at the emmy awards ceremony and admitted that he was partially at fault for the disclosure of the source identity.kmgh did not threaten to terminate minshall over either of these incidents.
in april,kmgh hired melissa klinzing klinzing as news director.to promote kmgh news programs and boost ratings,klinzing initiated a news format known as real life,real news.klinzing designed real life,real news with the intention of reaching a younger demographic than that which historically watched kmgh news programs.to achieve this goal,the cosmetic look of the news programs was altered.klinzing considered the physical appearances of the anchors and reporters in making changes to the overall appearance of the news programs.
under klinzing direction,anchors ernie bjorkman bjorkman and bertha lynn lynn,individuals over the age of,were removed from the ten nightly news and replaced by anchor natalie pujo pujo who was between and years old.both bjorkman and lynn testified that they believed they were removed from the ten nightly news because of their age.ron allen allen,a weatherman at kmgh over the age of,testified that he was also given increasingly less favorable job assignments at kmgh.at trial,minshall also introduced evidence of several statements made by klinzing in reference to the news format,minshall,and other news personalities who were over the age of,however,presented evidence that reporters bill clarke clarke and paul reinertson reinertson,who were over years old,received no less time after klinzing was employed at kmgh.
minshall contract was set to expire in august.executive producer kathleen sullivan sullivan testified that she recommended klinzing not renew his employment.presented evidence that minshall submitted several stories late and submitted a report during a ratings period that was unacceptable.clarke,a reporter and news anchor,testified that minshall scripts were easily recognized for being incomplete and for containing factual errors.
anchors bjorkman and lynn,however,testified that they were of the opinion that minshall was a good reporter.lynn testified that his scripts were no worse than other reporters.allen testified that minshall was a motivated and tenacious reporter.minshall testified that,prior to klinzing employment,he had never been informed that his script writing or punctuality was a problem.
klinzing renewed minshall contract for six months in august.she,however,wrote minshall a detailed memorandum summarizing her expectations for his improvement.klinzing wrote,at the end of the months,if you performing up to expected levels,we talk about a new contract.by letter,minshall accepted the conditions of the august memorandum and the contract.
presented evidence that,after accepting the contract,minshall sometimes failed to attend morning staff meetings,failed to suggest ideas for new stories,and finished assignments immediately before deadlines.also presented evidence that,while under the contract,he was assigned to investigate a story for which he failed to interview any witnesses and tried to use videotape that was not of the reported business.further,presented evidence that on another story,minshall attempted to report about one vehicle while using videotape of another vehicle.
at the end of the contract,klinzing recommended that minshall contract not be renewed.on march,kmgh decided not to renew his contract.kmgh instructed klinzing not to interview anyone under the age of to replace minshall.
after kmgh decided not to renew his contract,minshall chose not to search for employment as an investigative reporter outside of denver because he did not want to relocate his family.minshall,however,made telephone calls and sent letters to other television stations in denver.after failing to obtain employment as an investigative reporter,he attempted to secure employment in public relations.a few months later,minshall was hired by bvp media to teach media training.at bvp media,he earned approximately in salary and benefits.minshall,however,quit this job after approximately one year to work as a media trainer.

age discrimination claims 
argues that minshall failed to present sufficient evidence to establish that it discriminated against him on the basis of age when deciding not to renew his contract.see fallis,cir holding that after a full trial on the merits of plaintiff discrimination claim,the remaining single overarching issue is whether plaintiff adduced sufficient evidence to warrant a jury determination that adverse employment action was taken against him on the basis of age.after reviewing the record as a whole,this court is satisfied that minshall offered sufficient evidence on which the jury could reasonably conclude decision not to renew his contract was impermissibly based on his age.
at trial,presented evidence that the decision not to renew the contract was based on minshall poorly written scripts,tardiness,violations of professional ethics in disclosing the identity of a confidential informant,improper use of video in stories,and public drunkenness at a emmy awards ceremony.minshall,however,presented contrary evidence that created a jury issue regarding purported reasons for not renewing his contract.
minshall presented the testimony of lynn that minshall scripts were no worse than any other reporter scripts.lynn and bjorkman both testified that they had never been confused in a newscast by any misspellings in minshall scripts.the evidence presented at trial showed that prior to klinzing employment at kmgh,minshall had never been informed that his spelling or punctuality was a problem or was grounds for termination.lynn and bjorkman,who worked with minshall for several years,testified that they thought minshall was a good reporter.further,allen testified that he believed minshall was a motivated and tenacious reporter.
argues that lynn,bjorkman,and allen testimony is irrelevant because they did not supervise minshall and likely did not see his unedited work.while this court does not sit as a department that the defendant business decisions,evidence indicating that an employer misjudged an employee performance is,of course,relevant to the question of whether the employer stated reason for its actions is masking prohibited discrimination.tyler mountain states,cir quotation omitted.lynn,bjorkman,and allen each had the opportunity to professionally observe minshall work while at kmgh.accordingly,their testimony was relevant in assessing the veracity of reasons for not renewing minshall contract.
minshall also presented evidence that he was never threatened with termination regarding the disclosure of the identity of a confidential informant or his conduct at the emmy awards ceremony.both of these incidents occurred over a year before kmgh decision not to renew minshall contract and prior to klinzing employment at kmgh.
finally,minshall presented evidence that several employees over the age of were treated adversely while klinzing was employed at kmgh.specifically,minshall introduced evidence that both lynn and bjorkman,who are over years old,were removed from the ten nightly newscast and were replaced by pujo,a woman in her late twenties or early thirties.minshall also introduced evidence that allen was given less favorable assignments as he aged.argues that because it presented evidence that clarke and reinertson,reporters over years old,had no less time after klinzing was employed,the jury could not reasonably infer that minshall contract was not renewed because of his age.the jury,however,could reasonably infer from the evidence,albeit conflicting,that kmgh was reducing the air time of people over years old and that minshall contract was not renewed because of his age.
in addition to introducing evidence to rebut the truthfulness of asserted reasons for not renewing his contract minshall introduced evidence that klinzing was motivated by animus and was principally responsible for the of his contract.as news director,klinzing developed the news format and was responsible for renewing minshall contract.klinzing testified that she created the news format,real life,real news,with the intention of reaching a younger demographic and that she considered the physical appearance of the anchors and reporters in making overall changes to the news programs.allen testified that klinzing told him not to wear a tie and to try to go with a younger look.allen also testified that klinzing said she did care if older people were watching television and that she was disgusted when she saw an old fart on television without a shirt.minshall testified that klinzing constantly talked to him about a younger presentation,a more youthful presentation,and that she wanted sexier stories that would appeal to a younger audience.minshall and lynn both testified that klinzing asked them about their ages.scott sobel,a former reporter and anchor at kmgh,testified that klinzing said allen was too fucking old for the news format.finally,minshall introduced evidence that klinzing said,in reference to her father,old people should die.
argues that the jury could not infer that age animus motivated klinzing decision not to renew minshall contract because she offered him a contract in august and others at kmgh agreed with klinzing assessment of minshall work performance.further argues that if klinzing was truly motivated by age animus she would have terminated minshall in august.finally,argues that klinzing was pleased with minshall performance.therefore,contends,the jury could not have reasonably concluded that klinzing was motivated by age animus when she recommended that minshall contract not be renewed.while the evidence could support interpretation,the jury reasonably rejected such an interpretation.
also argues that the statements attributed to klinzing were stray comments and constitute an insufficient basis from which to draw an inference of age discrimination.while i solated comments,unrelated to the challenged action,are insufficient to show discriminatory animus in termination decisions,a plaintiff can show such animus by demonstrat ing a nexus between the allegedly discriminatory statements and the defendant decision to terminate the plaintiff.rea martin marietta,cir holding that a causal nexus can be shown if the allegedly discriminatory comments were directed at the plaintiff,her position,or the defendant policy which resulted in the adverse action taken against the plaintiff quotation omitted 
in this case,klinzing statements regarding the news format,including her instructions to minshall and allen regarding their presentations,were not stray comments.minshall argued that his contract was not renewed because,under the news format,klinzing did not want to utilize reporters over years old therefore,there was a nexus between klinzing statements with respect to the news format and klinzing decision not to renew minshall contract.
with respect to klinzing statement that allen was too old for the news format,argues that this was a stray comment because it was not directed at minshall and there was no connection between allen loss of air time and the decision not to renew minshall contract.klinzing statement,however,pertained to her motivation in developing the news format.because minshall presented evidence that klinzing decision not to renew his contract was motivated by her desire to reduce the presence of reporters over years old under the news format,however,there was a nexus between klinzing statement regarding allen and her decision not to renew minshall contract.
further,klinzing statements regarding older people watching or being broadcast on television were not stray comments.klinzing testified that she considered the physical appearance of the reporters in making changes to the overall appearance of the news program.as stated above,there was a nexus between klinzing statements made regarding the news format and her decision not to renew minshall contract.similarly,there was a nexus between these statements and the decision not to renew minshall contract.in contrast,klinzing statement that old people should die was a stray comment.it is undisputed that klinzing made this statement in reference to her father.therefore,there is no connection between this statement and klinzing decision not to renew minshall contract 
viewing the record as a whole,this court is satisfied that the jury reasonably concluded that kmgh unlawfully discriminated against minshall on the basis of age when it decided not to renew his contract.accordingly,the district court did not err in denying motion for jmol.
willfulness under the adea 
a plaintiff may be awarded liquidated damages under the adea if the defendant violation was willful.b.in this case,the jury found that violation of the adea was willful and the court awarded liquidated damages.argues that the award was in error because minshall failed to present sufficient evidence to support the jury determination that its violation of the adea was willful.moreover,argues that it presented sufficient evidence that it acted with a good faith belief that its conduct was lawful.
under the adea,a violation is willful if the employer either knew or showed reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited by the statute.hazen paper biggins,d.argues that because minshall never complained klinzing was discriminating against him,it acted on a good faith belief that its decision not to renew his contract was lawful.klinzing,however,testified that she was instructed by kmgh not to hire anyone under the age of to replace minshall.from this evidence,the jury could reasonably conclude that knew its decision not to renew minshall contract was in violation of the adea or acted with reckless disregard over the matter.accordingly,the district court did not err in granting minshall liquidated damages.
motion for a new trial 
this court reviews the district court denial of new trial motion for abuse of discretion.sanjuan ibp,cir.this court will reverse the denial of a motion for a new trial only if the trial court made a clear error of judgment or exceeded the bounds of permissible choice in the circumstances.weese schukman,cir.
when the issue of whether to grant a new trial hinges on the admissibility of evidence,this court reviews the admission of the evidence for abuse of discretion.sanjuan,at.if the evidence was erroneously admitted,this court will set aside a jury verdict only if the error prejudicially affects a substantial right of a party.id.further,e vidence admitted in error can only be prejudicial if it can be reasonably concluded that without such evidence,there would have been a contrary result.id.quotation omitted.
statements made in connection with klinzing deposition 
because klinzing was no longer an employee of and was outside the district court subpoena power at the time of trial,excerpts of her deposition testimony were read to the jury.outside the presence of the jury,minshall counsel requested permission from the district court to explain to the jury that klinzing absence was motivated by her fear of being.the district court denied this request.
prior to the introduction of klinzing deposition testimony,the district court instructed the jury that klinzing was in new jersey and could not be subpoenaed.the district court instructed the jury as follows 
to the extent that you able,of course,you instructed that you should give the testimony of miss klinzing the same weight and credibility as you would as if she had appeared at the trial.
minshall counsel preserved an objection.
subsequent to the reading of klinzing testimony,the district court asked whether there were any portions of the deposition minshall counsel wanted read into the record.he responded,if klinzing were here,your honor,i her,but she not.
later during the trial,counsel questioned a witness on redirect so in this proceeding,we have one person saying it happened,another person,klinzing,saying it did happen is that right minshall counsel objected saying,that misstates the evidence.we have a deposition saying it did,and we have a live witness saying it did.the district court responded,all right.that more correct.
at closing argument,minshall counsel argued 
but let talk about the facts that we heard.all right.because really and truly,what it comes down to,the key witness on that witness stand,the witness that you have to consider in their case never bothered to come to this courthouse to swear an oath to tell the truth,to walk up to that witness stand and get by me.and that melissa klinzing.why is melissa klinzing here on that witness stand getting like every other witness in this case their excuse is,well,she lived more than a hundred miles out of the range of subpoena.ca subpoena her in.
the one witness,the main discriminator in this case,mailed it in.do you remember in her deposition she accused dave minshall he just mailing it in.no,she mailing it in,and they going to stand up here and ask you,oh,well you heard in her deposition where she said blah,blah,blah,blah.you did get to look at her.this court will instruct you,you can consider the demeanor of a witness on the witness stand and the method of testimony and you can toss the whole thing in the trash can if you want to.and that what it deserves.the discriminator denies discriminating in her testimony,where she wo even have the guts to come in here and get on that witness stand,look you in the eye,and tell you why she did what she did.
counsel attempted to explain klinzing absence in closing arguments.minshall counsel objected saying 
judge,i going to object to this that counsel knows full well why she did show up,and this is not a good faith statement by counsel.he represented to the court why she declined to come.
the district court overruled the objection.
drawing from these trial incidents,contends the following constitute reversible error minshall objection to the admission of klinzing deposition testimony statements made to the jury suggesting klinzing deposition testimony was not subject to the district court failure to curb counsel arguments regarding klinzing deposition testimony and the argument,made in closing,that klinzing deposition testimony be disregarded.
argues that minshall counsel improperly objected to the admission of klinzing deposition testimony because the district court had previously ruled in a motion in limine that it was admissible.while argues that the objection was already preserved,the objection was properly made contemporaneous with the introduction of klinzing deposition testimony.see united states,cir reasoning that p rudent counsel will renew objections ruled on by the district court in a motion in limine at trial because most objections will prove to be dependent on trial context and will be determined to be waived if not renewed at trial.therefore,minshall objection did not constitute reversible error.
also argues that the statements of minshall counsel to the jury regarding his inability to klinzing constitute reversible error.minshall counsel argued to the jury that he was unable to klinzing under oath.he was,however,able to klinzing during her deposition testimony.did not object to counsel statements at trial.moreover,the district court instructed the jury that t o the extent that you able,of course,you instructed that you should give the testimony of miss klinzing the same weight and credibility as you would as if she had appeared at the trial.therefore,the district court did not abuse its discretion,and,even assuming the statements of minshall counsel constituted error,such error was harmless.
finally,argues that the arguments made in closing,suggesting that klinzing deposition testimony be disregarded,and the district court failure to curb minshall counsel constitute reversible error.while raised the issue of what constituted permissible commentary regarding klinzing deposition in discussions with the district court,failed to object to comments in closing argument,failed to move for a mistrial or new trial prior to the return of the verdict,and failed to offer a proposed corrective instruction.although this court will correct error in rare instances where it appears that a verdict was the result of passion aroused through extreme argument which clearly stirred the resentment and aroused the prejudice of the jury even though no objection was made or exception taken at the time,this is not such a case.sill united states,cir quotation omitted.at closing,minshall counsel argued that the jury should consider klinzing failure to testify in person at trial when evaluating her testimony.the district court ultimately instructed the jury to c onsider each witness intelligence,motive,state of mind,demeanor and manner while on the stand.minshall argument pertained to the manner in which klinzing testified and was,therefore,permissible under the pertinent jury instruction to which there was no objection.even assuming that minshall arguments were improper,the district court further instructed the jury that the s tatements and arguments of counsel are not evidence,and that t o the extent that you able,of course,you instructed that you should give the testimony of miss klinzing the same weight and credibility as you would as if she had appeared at the trial.because the jury verdict is supported by the record and the district court gave proper limiting jury instructions,this court is satisfied that the verdict was not merely a result of passion aroused though extreme argument.see sill,at.
