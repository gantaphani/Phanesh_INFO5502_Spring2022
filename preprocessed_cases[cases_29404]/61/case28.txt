background 
santa rosa is an accomplished salsa singer,producer,and composer he lives in puerto rico and is known as the caballero de la salsa.combo is a record production company owned by ralph cartagena and located in new york.santa rosa states that sometime between and,he and combo came to an agreement by which he agreed to record four albums for combo and combo agreed to pay him artist royalties for all albums sold.santa rosa no longer has a copy of the purported agreement,but claims that a copy of this agreement exists and that combo has it.
santa rosa recorded four albums between and for combo,including good vibrations,keeping cool,de amor y de salsa,and salsa en movimiento combo later released el caballero de la salsa,a compilation of santa rosa songs.combo paid in advance royalties to santa rosa between and.since,combo states that it has continued to manufacture,distribute,and sell thousands of the albums and compilations but combo has never paid santa rosa any additional royalties or given him royalty statements for the sale of the aforementioned albums.santa rosa had not requested additional royalties until he brought the present suit.
on may,santa rosa and his,nélida acevedo rivera,filed suit against combo,ralph cartagena,combo insurance company,and all record distributors or other persons liable for the acts of combo,seeking rescission of his contract based on material breach and damages for unjust enrichment.on october,santa rosa filed an amended complaint which added claims for a declaratory judgment as to the ownership of the recordings and a violation of the lanham act on october,combo filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.on june,the district court granted combo motion to dismiss with prejudice.santa rosa filed a motion for reconsideration on july,which the district court denied on may.santa rosa now appeals from the dismissal of his complaint.
ii.discussion 
we review a decision to grant a motion to dismiss de novo,taking as true the facts of the complaint.isla nena air,cessna aircraft,cir.dismissal is appropriate only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.swierkiewicz sorema,d internal citation and quotations omitted.however,we need not only consider the grounds for dismissal relied upon by the district court we may affirm a dismissal on any ground fairly presented by the record.gabriel preble,cir.
claim for rescission 
santa rosa first claim against combo is that combo materially breached his contract.as such,santa rosa contends,he is entitled to rescission of that contract.combo responded,and the district court held,that santa rosa had failed to adequately plead the existence of a contract.we need not resolve the dispute over whether a contract had been sufficiently pled even assuming that a contract between santa rosa and combo existed,we find that santa rosa claim for rescission would be preempted by the copyright act.
a cause of action is preempted under the copyright act,a,if it does not require an element beyond mere copying,preparation of derivative works,performance,distribution or display.data grumman.support,cir quoting gates rubber bando chem,cir.we have never squarely decided the question of whether a simple breach of contract action that only seeks damages would be preempted by the copyright act we need not do so today because santa rosa asks not for damages,but rather for rescission of his contract.as we noted in royal leading edge products,santa rosa claim for rescission of his royalty contract presents an interesting quagmire 
i f the royalty agreement stands,then the plaintiff sole remedy for the breach of it would be money the copyright act need not be construed.if,however,as plaintiff suggests,the royalty agreement is subject to rescission because of defendant material breach thereof,then that agreement would vanish.
cir.because a successful claim for rescission would result in there being no written instrument signed by the parties,we would be required to resort to the interpretation of b to determine ownership of santa rosa recordings.see also rano sipa press,cir after an agreement is rescinded,any further distribution would constitute copyright infringement.
because santa rosa seeks rescission of his contract,if we were to grant him the relief that he sought,we would be required to determine his ownership rights by reference to the copyright act.in such a case,there is little question that we would be merely determining whether santa rosa was entitled to compensation because of mere copying or performance,distribution or display of his recordings.data,at.as such,a preempts santa rosa rescission claim.once it is determined that santa rosa rescission claim is preempted,his only remedy is a claim under the copyright act,and the court must then dismiss the contract claim for failing to state a cause of action.briarpatch phoenix pictures,cir.thus,we find no error in the dismissal of santa rosa rescission claim.
claim for declaratory judgment 
because santa rosa rescission claim is preempted,we are left only with his claim for a declaratory judgment of ownership,which arises under the copyright act.santa rosa claimed that the courts should resolve the uncertainty over ownership of his recordings by issuing a declaratory judgment that he is the sole owner of those recordings.combo responded that santa rosa declaratory judgment action was time barred.the district court agreed that santa rosa claim was barred by the statute of limitations and granted combo motion to dismiss.see lachapelle berkshire life ins,cir holding that dismissal is appropriate if the plaintiff allegations leave no doubt that the statute of limitations would bar the claim.we agree with the district court that the declaratory judgment action is time barred and that dismissal was appropriate 
b provides that n o civil action shall be maintained under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after the claim accrued.a claim accrues when the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the act which is the basis for the claim.municipality of caguas,cir quoting rodríguez nárvaez nazario,cir.thus,a claim for declaratory judgment of ownership accrues when the plaintiff knew of the alleged grounds for the ownership claim.margo weiss,cir see also merchant levy,cir n o uncertainty exists as to rights based on.a knows that he or she jointly created a work from the moment of its creation.it goes without saying that santa rosa was present when his performances were recorded by combo records,and thus knew from the moment that each recording was created that he had a potential claim for ownership of it.thus,there is little question that santa rosa claims for accrued as soon as he finished recording each album 
santa rosa points to the ninth circuit holding in zuill shanahan that a claim for a declaratory judgment would not accrue until a plain and express repudiation of is communicated to the claimant,cir.even applying this test for accrual of a claim,we can not think of a more plain and express repudiation of than the fact that combo openly,and quite notoriously,sold santa rosa records without providing payment to him according to documents provided by santa rosa,at least of the recordings in dispute were sold during the six month period between january and june of,almost four years before santa rosa filed suit in may.likewise,it is hard to believe that a singer of santa rosa stature would have been unaware that combo records was selling his recordings and thus claiming ownership over them until three years before this action
