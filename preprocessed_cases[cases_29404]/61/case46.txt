this appeal from the october,decision and order of the district court for the southern district of new york colleen mcmahon,district judge concerns the second round in a protracted freedom of information act foia litigation seeking disclosure of documents related to targeted killings by the use of drone aircraft.on the prior appeal,see new york times dep t of justice,cir nytimes i,we ordered disclosure of a document known as the olc dod memorandum,a page legal opinion prepared by the office of legal counsel olc in the department of justice for the department of defense dod,advising as to the legality of targeted drone attacks.see id.at.we ruled that prior disclosures by senior officials of the government,plus the release of what was referred to as the white paper,resulted in waiver of all applicable exemptions for protection of the olc dod memorandum.
we also remanded the case to the district court to review in camera several other documents prepared by the olc that the government had identified as responsive to the pending foia requests but had withheld on various grounds.we remanded for determination of waiver of privileges and appropriate redaction.id.at.the district court ruled,in a partially redacted opinion,that the government had properly invoked exemption documents classified by executive order,exemption intelligence sources and methods protected by statute,and exemption document protected by the deliberative process or privilege,and that most of these documents should not be disclosed that ruling is challenged on the pending appeal.the appeal also concerns disclosure of the redacted portions of the district court opinion,including three paragraphs that the district court wishes to disclose,and disclosure of redacted portions of the transcript of the june,oral argument presented by the government to this court ex parte and in camera.
background 
the background of the litigation was extensively set forth in nytimes i,at,and need not be repeated here.we recount only developments since our prior decision.
paragraph of the conclusion of nytimes i provided that other legal memoranda prepared by olc and at issue here must be submitted to the district court for in camera inspection and determination of waiver of privileges and appropriate redaction.id.at.in conformity with that direction,the district court examined in camera eleven sealed documents,identified as exhibits a,b,c,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,and l to a sealed affidavit submitted by john bies,deputy assistant attorney general in the olc.exhibit d is the olc dod memorandum,already disclosed.
on october,the district court filed under seal its opinion adjudicating claims for disclosure of these documents.the district court opinion was sealed because,in discussing the reasons for refusing disclosure of most of the documents at issue,the court necessarily discussed matters entitled to remain secret.the court submitted its opinion to the government ex parte for classification review.the government requested redaction of several portions of the district court opinion.the district court agreed to all of the redactions proposed by the government with the exception of three paragraphs on page of the court opinion judge mcmahon continued those paragraphs under seal,however,to abide the outcome of appellate review of her decision to disclose them.we will recount below the district court rulings with respect to each of the eleven documents.the district court certified its rulings for immediate entry of a partial judgment under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.
after the appellants and four united states senators,as amici curiae,filed their briefs,the government filed a redacted version of its brief and filed an unredacted version ex parte and in camera.the government later sought the opportunity to present oral argument to the court ex parte and in camera.we granted that request and heard government counsel ex parte and in camera on june,just prior to hearing both sides in open court.on june,we entered two sealed orders,both sent to the government ex parte.these orders afforded the government an opportunity to submit ex parte and in camera a brief and a supplemental declaration concerning matters that the court had raised with government counsel at the june ex parte and in camera hearing.on july,the government filed ex parte and in camera a transcript of the june argument,together with a redacted version of that transcript,which was filed in the normal course june redacted tr.see dkt.on july,the government filed its response to our june orders,submitting,ex parte and in camera,a brief and a supporting affidavit.on the same day,we asked the government to submit a letter justifying the transcript redactions.the government responded with a letter of july,filed ex parte and in camera.
discussion 
we emphasize at the outset,as we did before,see nytimes i,at,that the lawfulness of drone strikes is not at issue.this appeal,like the prior one,primarily concerns whether documents considering such lawfulness must be disclosed.
i.the eleven olc documents.
exhibits a,b,and c.the district court ruled that these documents were required to remain secret,but that the legal reasoning contained in exhibit b had been incorporated into exhibit k,which was appropriate for disclosure.we agree with the district court decision not to disclose exhibits a,b,and c,which contain intelligence information that was properly exempted.
exhibit this olc document,as described by the government,is the provision of legal advice in provided to the president close legal advisor about the e xecutive o rder.executive order,captioned united states intelligence activities,was signed by president reagan on.the district court withheld exhibit e partly on the ground that most of it discusses topics exempted from foia disclosure and not subject to any waiver.we agree with the district court ruling in that respect.as to one portion of exhibit e that discusses a topic referred to in subsequent statements of senior government officials,the district court withheld that portion because the discussion does not correspond to any legal analysis that has been disclosed.
at issue is whether the government waived its right to invoke exemption as the basis for withholding portions of the legal analysis in exhibit e by subsequently making public statements on topics related to some of the analysis contained in that document.our initial concern with disclosure of the portion that is similar to subsequent disclosures is the substantial time interval between the date of exhibit e and the subsequent arguably similar disclosures.in nytimes i,several relevant statements of government officials were made before the date of the july,olc dod memorandum and other statements were made less than three years afterwards with respect to exhibit e,there is no statement of a government official before the date of that exhibit that even arguably supports waiver of protection,and the earliest dates of subsequent statements that even arguably support waiver were made eight years after the date of exhibit 
we do not mean to imply that a government official public statement made after preparation of a legal opinion can never result in waiver of protection for that opinion.our reliance on some statements made soon after the date of the olc dod memorandum dispels such a broad implication.however,the passage of a significant interval of time between a protected document and a government official subsequent statement discussing the same or a similar topic considered in the document inevitably raises a concern that the context in which the official spoke might be significantly different from the context in which the earlier document was prepared.even if the content of legal reasoning set forth in one context is somewhat similar to such reasoning that is later explained publicly in another context,such similarity does not necessarily result in waiver.moreover,ignoring both the differences in contexts and the passage of a significant interval of time would risk requiring government officials to consider numerous arguably similar documents prepared long before and then measu
