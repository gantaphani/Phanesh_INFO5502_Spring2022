in this lawsuit,congressman bob barr charges that president clinton and one of his political advisors unlawfully conspired with larry flynt,publisher of hustler magazine,to gather and disseminate disparaging information about barr in order to retaliate for his role in the clinton impeachment proceedings.the district court dismissed the complaint,finding it time barred and,alternatively,that it failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.we affirm,but on different grounds.we affirm the dismissal as to clinton and his advisor because the complaint fails to allege that either took any action within the statute of limitations to further the conspiracy,and as to flynt because the complaint fails to allege that the disparaging information was either false or published with reckless or knowing disregard for its falsity,as required by the first amendment.

in support of this allegation,the complaint asserts that carville maintained files containing information about barr which he had obtained from confidential government sources and routinely disseminated this material to the media.id.in a january,press conference,flynt estranged daughter stated that flynt had likely been supplied by defendant carville with confidential fbi files to assist flynt in his search for dirt on congressmen,including barr,in an effort to prevent them from performing their official duties.id.as to clinton,the complaint alleges that he approved and ratified flynt efforts to intimidate barr.id.the complaint cites a los angeles times article stating clinton laughed about the fact that larry flynt,publisher of hustler magazine,had become the latest influence on the washington political debate and regaled his listeners with a description of a letter that flynt wrote to independent counsel kenneth starr congratulating starr for aiding the cause of pornography.elizabeth shogren,clinton puts his faith in history,times,at.
on january,flynt appeared on a television news program and,according to the complaint,divulged information from the government files,including that barr had not told the truth,under oath,in divorce proceedings,and that he had pressured his former wife into having an abortion.compl.during a interview on february,flynt not only repeated those accusations,but also announced that he intended to publish a issue called the flynt report,which would contain additional improperly obtained information about barr and other officials.id.

on march,barr filed suit in the united states district court for the district of columbia against defendants clinton,carville,flynt,and.in the only count at issue in this appeal,barr claimed that the defendants violated by conspiring to prevent him from performing his official duties.section makes it unlawful for two or more persons to conspire to prevent,by force,intimidation,or threat,any person from discharging any duties of public office or to injure him in his person or property on account of his lawful discharge of the duties of his office.among other things,section plaintiffs must allege the elements of civil conspiracy,including an agreement to take part in an unlawful action or a lawful action in an unlawful manner.hall clinton.seeking damages in excess of million,see compl,barr alleged that defendants
