afshin bahrampour seeks reversal of the summary judgment entered in favor of the prison officials of the oregon department of corrections collectively odc.in his pro se complaint,bahrampour alleged that odc violated his first and fourteenth amendment rights to freedom of speech and due process by refusing to deliver certain pieces of mail to him.in a separate,supplemental claim,he alleged that this conduct also violated his state constitutional right to freedom of speech under article,section of the oregon constitution.
we affirm the portion of the judgment regarding bahrampour claim.we vacate in part and remand because the district court failed to consider bahrampour supplemental state law claim.
afshin bahrampour is an inmate at the snake river correctional institution in ontario,oregon.he subscribed to the green lantern comic book,and purchased issues of muscle elegance magazine and white dwarf magazine.odc refused to deliver the green lantern comic book because prison regulations prohibited the receipt of bulk mail.odc subsequently purchased a subscription to the green lantern comic book for bahrampour after the bulk mail regulation at issue was declared unconstitutional.odc rejected issue number eight of muscle elegance magazine due to its sexual content.odc cited a of actual or simulated sexual acts or behaviors as the basis of its rejection of muscle elegance magazine.odc rejected the october,december,and january issues of white dwarf magazine because of their content.bahrampour contested the rejections of muscle elegance magazine and white dwarf magazine in administrative proceedings.odc actions were upheld.
oregon administrative rule oar prohibits prisoners from receiving certain types of mail.section excludes material containing portrayals of certain actual or simulated sexual acts or behaviors as prohibited mail which shall be confiscated or returned to the sender.such material still may be admitted if it has scholarly value,or general social or literary value.section prohibits receipt of material that contains or similar fantasy games or materials.although the restriction on the receipt of sexually explicit materials is quite detailed,and similar fantasy games are neither defined nor described in the regulations.when this action was initiated,oar prohibited the receipt by a prisoner of bulk mail.receipt of postal mail sent by express mail,priority mail,first class mail,or periodicals mail was permitted.
odc submitted an affidavit from supervisor kathy stevens regarding the purpose and implementation of the mail rules,and an affidavit from expert witness neil malamuth regarding the effect of sexually explicit materials on prison inmates.supervisor stevens stated that the materials would be highly valued as barter and may result in prohibited sexual activity or unwanted sexual behavior,including rape.in malamuth opinion,the regulations are justified because of the risks such material presents in increasing aggressive and inappropriate tendencies and behaviors by inmates.he concluded that the risks are amplified in the prison setting due to the lack of socially sanctioned sexual outlets,and the lack of the moderating influences of family and nonaggressive peers.
odc produced an affidavit from superintendent robert lampert,in which he explain ed the reason s why odc prohibits or similar fantasy games or materials.superintendent lampert stated that the prohibition is intended to prevent inmates from placing themselves in fantasy roles that reduce accountability and substitute raw power for legitimate authority.he also noted that games often contain dice,which are prohibited gambling paraphernalia.superintendent lampert stated that if dice are possessed for playing a game,either gambling will soon become a part of the game,or the dice will be utilized for other gambling purposes.
bahrampour asserted in his complaint that odc restrictions on prisoner mail violated his first and fourteenth amendment rights.he also filed a supplemental state law claim under article,section of the oregon constitution.the court denied bahrampour motions for partial summary judgment and a preliminary injunction.the district court granted odc motion for summary judgment.the district court dismissed the action without explicitly disposing of the supplemental state law claim.bahrampour has timely appealed the court final judgment pursuant to.
bahrampour contends that summary judgment was improper regarding his claim because the regulations have been applied inconsistently.he also argues that the district court erred in failing to make findings regarding whether the restricted materials contained sexually explicit or content.the district court stated that it is appropriate to defer to defendants decision that the white dwarf publication encourages or supports role playing fantasy games.however,i have reviewed publications submitted in camera and find that defendants determination is supported by the record before the court.bahrampour lampert,civ,at unpublished disposition internal citation omitted.
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.glenn jackson roe,cir.w hen a prison regulation impinges on inmates constitutional rights,the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.in our view,such a standard is necessary if prison administrators,and not the courts are to make the difficult judgments concerning institutional operations.turner safley,d alterations in original quoting jones north carolina prisoners union,d.
state prison officials are given deference in prison operations due to separation of powers and federalism concerns.turner,at.to defeat summary judgment,bahrampour must demonstrate that the regulations are not reasonably related to legitimate penological interests,or that there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding the applicability of the regulations to the materials.see,far out,oskar,cir.odc evidence adequately demonstrates that the regulations support the legitimate penological interests of reducing prohibited behaviors such as sexual aggression and gambling,and maintaining respect for legitimate authority.the regulations prohibit the receipt of materials that contain any amount of sexually explicit or or fantasy content.thus,the significant question is whether there is a genuine issue of fact regarding whether the magazines contained any prohibited content.
it is undisputed that two levels of prison officials found the materials violated the regulations.the district court reviewed white dwarf magazine in camera and agreed with the prison officials that it encourages or supports role playing fantasy games.we have also reviewed the rejected materials.we agree with the district court that receipt of white dwarf magazine violates oar k.bahrampour has produced insufficient evidence to show that viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to him,any reasonable person would conclude that white dwarf magazine contains no or fantasy content,or that muscle elegance magazine contains no sexually explicit material.see summers teichert son,cir holding that a mere scintilla of evidence will not be sufficient to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment rather,the nonmoving party must introduce some significant probative evidence tending to support the complaint.summary judgment may be granted if the evidence is merely colorable or is not significantly probative internal quotations and citations omitted.
oar enumerates the two relevant categories of prohibited mail to be confiscated or returned to the sender.six types of prohibited sexual acts or behaviors are listed in subsection a a in great detail.the regulations essentially prohibit any p ortrayal of actual or simulated penetration or stimulation,sexual violence,sexual contact between two people,or sexual contact between a person and an animal.oar a a.subsection e declares that s exually explicit material may be admitted if it has scholarly value,or general social or literary value.section lists eleven types of prohibited material that threatens or is detrimental to the security,safety,health,good order or discipline of the facility,inmate rehabilitation,or facilitates criminal activity.subsection k prohibits receipt of material that contains or similar fantasy games or materials.oar k.a game is not defined in the regulations.it is defined in the dictionary as a game in which players assume the roles of characters and act out fantastical adventures,the outcomes of which are partially determined by chance,as by the roll of dice.the american heritage dictionary of the english language ed.
white dwarf magazine is published by games workshop,a manufacturer of miniature figurines and accessories used in tabletop war games.the miniatures have predefined attributes and abilities.the outcome of the war game is determined by the roll of dice.the player directs fantastic or futuristic troops in battle as a general or overlord.we are persuaded that white dwarf magazine fits the definition of materials prohibited by subsection k because it simulates violent battles in an imaginary fantasy world in which the roll of dice determines which leaders have the power to crush their enemies.
odc prohibited the receipt of muscle elegance magazine because it includes portrayals of sexually explicit acts.muscle elegance magazine includes advertisements for videos where a woman applies brutal scissors domination to a man face between her legs,and where a woman has locked a man torso in what is described as painful,erotic domination.we conclude that there is no genuine issue of material fact in dispute as to whether the regulations prohibit the receipt of muscle elegance magazine and white dwarf magazine because of their sexually explicit or content.
bahrampour asserts that claims of vagueness and must be considered separately from the requirement that prison regulations must be reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.turner,at.he claims that past inconsistent applications of the and sexually explicit regulations demonstrate the vague and overbroad nature of the regulations.bahrampour argues that the broad dictionary definition of encompasses materials such as chess,theatrical scripts,and films.
in turner,the united states supreme court applied four factors to determine whether prison regulations were constitutional because they were reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.id.at.the district court applied the turner factors and concluded that the restrictions on the receipt of and sexually explicit materials were constitutional even if they do in some minor respect infringe on plaintiff first amendment rights.bahrampour lampert,at.
we have recognized that inmates do not give up their constitutional rights when they walk through the prison gates.morrison hall,cir.some rights are incompatible with incarceration,but others must be protected to the fullest extent possible while still maintaining a safe,efficient,and effective prison environment.id.at.we have previously applied the turner analysis to determine whether prison regulations impermissibly infringe on inmates constitutional rights,id.at,determining that commercial bulk mail prohibitions are unconstitutional,but that return address requirements are permitted prison legal news cook,cir holding that prohibiting bulk mail is unconstitutional.the turner analysis applies equally to facial and as applied challenges.morrison hall,at.
first,the regulations must be content neutral and rationally connected to a legitimate penological interest.turner,at.the link can not be so tenuous that the application is irrational or arbitrary.id.in the prison context,regulations that apply to specific types of content due to specific inherent risks or harms are considered to be content neutral.thornburgh abbott,d.
the next consideration is whether there are alternative means of exercising the right that remain open to prison inmates.where other avenues remain available for the exercise of the asserted right,courts should be particularly conscious of the measure of judicial deference owed to corrections officials in gauging the validity of the regulation.turner,at.alteration in original internal quotations and citations omitted.in turner,a regulation barring communication only with a limited class of other people with whom prison officials have particular cause to be concerned was upheld because it did not deprive prisoners of all means of expression.id.at.
the third factor requires an examination of the potential effects on the guards,other inmates,and prison resources if the asserted right is protected by the courts.id.at.if accommodations for a constitutional right would cause significant changes within the prison environment,the courts should give deference to the prison officials who are responsible for safe,effective,and efficient administration of the prison system.id.
the final factor focuses on alternative solutions that would preserve the constitutional rights of the inmate.id.if there are easily implemented and equally effective alternatives to the challenged regulations,the court may conclude that the regulations are an exaggerated response to the legitimate governmental interest.id.if an inmate provides an alternative solution that will protect his rights at de minimis cost to valid penological interests,it likewise is evidence of an exaggerated response.id.at.if there are no obvious alternatives,and if the inmate only presents solutions that will negatively impact valid penological interests,then courts will view the absence of ready alternatives as evidence of a reasonable regulation.id.
odc presented evidence demonstrating that there is a rational connection between the availability of sexually explicit materials and harmful inmate behavior such as rape and other forms of sexual predation.odc has also presented evidence that there is a rational connection between materials that are based on the impact of simulated physical power used to obtain dominance over others,as opposed to reliance on legitimate authority,and the harmful behavior that can result in a prison,including gambling.superintendent lampert declared in his affidavit that the failure to pay gambling debts results in violent debt collection activities.these categorical restrictions are neutral because they target the effects of the particular types of materials,rather than simply prohibiting broad selections of innocuous materials.inmates may exercise their free speech rights in many ways that are not prohibited.bahrampour can play chess and read about chess in lieu of playing and reading about games.oar permits an inmate to receive publications that show nudes or bodybuilders not engaging in,or simulating,sexual acts or behaviors,or that have scholarly value,or general social or literary value.
all four of the turner factors weigh in favor of odc.bahrampour has not demonstrated that the regulations are irrational or unreasonable,or that there are alternative solutions that are easy,obvious,and of de minimis cost to valid penological interests.turner,at.we conclude,therefore,that the regulations and odc actions pertaining to sexually explicit and materials are constitutional.
bahrampour contends that the prison officials are not entitled to qualified immunity regarding their rejection of the green lantern comic book subscription.he asserts that odc improperly relied on unpublished district court opinions in enforcing its bulk mail regulation,and ignored a published federal district court decision holding bulk mail restrictions unconstitutional.we review a district court determination of qualified immunity de novo.newell sauser,cir.a qualified immunity affirmative defense is subject to a analysis.saucier katz,d drummond ex rel.drummond city of anaheim,cir.the first step is to determine whether the alleged actions are unconstitutional as a matter of law.saucier,at.if so,the next step is to analyze whether the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity because the rights asserted were not clearly established at the time.id.the saucier order of analysis is significant because it serves to clarify the constitutional rights at issue,providing officials with prospective guidance as to the constitutionality of their conduct.see id.when a court merely observ
