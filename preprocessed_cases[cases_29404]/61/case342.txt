two former undercover police officers for the city of albuquerque brought suit against a local television station,for broadcasting their identities and their undercover status in the context of their suspected involvement in an alleged incident of sexual assault.the officers were never charged,and about a week after the broadcasts,the city police department announced publicly that it had concluded the officers were not involved in the alleged sexual assault.the officers sued for invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress.the district court dismissed their claims under.b.while we are sympathetic to the difficult and potentially dangerous situation undercover officers face after having their identities revealed to the public,we agree with the court below that the officers allegations do not support a tort claim for either invasion of privacy or emotional distress.because alvarado and flores fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,it is unnecessary for us to reach the issue of whether first amendment defense merited dismissal of the claims.accordingly,we affirm dismissal of their claims.
background 
vicente alvarado and steve flores were undercover police officers for the city of albuquerque in early.according to the facts alleged by alvarado and flores in their complaint,around may,syra roman called the albuquerque police department to report that she had been sexually assaulted by two undercover officers.the detective taking the call asked her to obtain a physical examination and follow up with him within a couple of days,but apparently she did neither.a week later,a detective with the police department apprehended roman on the basis of an outstanding warrant,and told her that,if she gave a statement about the alleged sexual assault,she would not be booked on that warrant.she gave the requested statement,describing her alleged assailants,and the police department released her.a couple of weeks later,one of roman friends contacted the detective who had taken roman statement.the friend suggested that alvarado and flores were the two officers involved in the sexual assault.
on june,a police department captain told alvarado and flores to report to the deputy chief office about some allegations,but they were not told the nature of those allegations.the same day,a state district judge signed warrants to authorize searches of their homes and vehicles.the judge sealed the warrants to the extent of alvarado and flores names and addresses,citing potential endangerment to the officers and interference with investigative activities.however,the court order sealing the warrants was not addressed to,nor did it mention the press generally.
at a time uncertain,someone provided with information about the sexual assault allegations and the investigation,naming alvarado and flores.on june,ran newscasts at and about the investigation in which alvarado and flores were named as being accused of the sexual assault.also ran video footage of alvarado and flores each answering the door to their respective homes and telling the reporter that they did not wish to comment.
at some point,someone informed that alvarado and flores were undercover narcotics officers.during the newscast on june,announced that the news station had learned they were undercover detectives and therefore blurred their faces.however,did not remove their names from that broadcast or subsequent broadcasts.ran coverage of the investigation for several days and posted the news stories on the internet,although no charges were brought.on june,reported that the officers had been cleared by dna evidence and by evidence that one of the officers was not in the state on the day of the alleged assault.furthermore,the accuser,roman,later recanted her allegations.but according to alvarado and flores,the damage was done.they claim their lives have been threatened since the time that their names and identities were released to the general public,and they continue to fear for their lives and that of their families.
alvarado and flores and their respective spouses,yvette alvarado and priscilla flores collectively,plaintiffs,brought suit against the city of albuquerque for defamation,false imprisonment and violations of their constitutional right to privacy the suit also named as a defendant,alleging invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress.plaintiffs specifically claimed that violat ed a court order and subject ed plaintiffs to serious physical harm or even death.the city removed the entire action to federal court because the plaintiffs brought a claim under and b,thus stating a federal question providing for federal district court jurisdiction under.
the united states district court of the district of new mexico ruled for on a rule b motion to dismiss.alvarado,llc,slip op.the court held that plaintiffs allegations d id not meet the contours of invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress.id.at.the court concluded also that,on the facts alleged,the first amendment would bar relief through tort law.id.further,the court decided that even if the order sealing alvarado and flores names from the search warrants applied to the media,it would have been an unconstitutional prior restraint.id.at.because the district court concluded that the plaintiffs claims against failed as a matter of law,it did not convert motion to dismiss into one seeking summary judgment,despite the fact that the parties had submitted to the court evidence outside the pleadings.id.at.
this appeal followed.we have jurisdiction over an appeal from a final order of dismissal from a district court,pursuant to the district court amended order of dismissal under.b.see.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court decision on a rule b motion for dismissal for failure to state a claim.jojola chavez,cir.we must accept all the allegations of the complaint as true and must construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.david city county of denver,cir.we look for plausibility in th e complaint.bell atlantic twombly,d 
in reviewing a rule b motion to dismiss,our first step is to review the factual allegations that should have been considered by the district court.see,prager lafaver,cir.on a rule b motion,if matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court,the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in rule,and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by rule.b.i n general,a motion to dismiss should be converted to a summary judgment motion if a party submits,and the district court considers,materials outside the pleadings.prager,at.however,notwithstanding the usual rule that a court should consider no evidence beyond the pleadings on a rule b motion to dismiss,the district court may consider documents referred to in the complaint if the documents are central to the plaintiff claim and the parties do not dispute the documents authenticity.jacobsen deseret book,cir.the failure to convert a b motion to one for summary judgment where a court does not exclude outside materials is reversible error unless the dismissal can be justified without considering the outside materials.gff associated wholesale grocers,cir emphasis added.
in the proceedings below,plaintiffs submitted to the district court a copy of the court order sealing alvarado and flores names and addresses,and submitted a certified transcript of excerpts of the audio portion of at least some of the broadcasts in question and a dvd containing copies of those broadcasts.in a hearing on the motion,the court acknowledged it had reviewed the transcript of the broadcasts.described some aspects of the video for the court,arguing that flores image was too fuzzy to identify him,and that the broadcasts never gave the addresses of either flores or alvarado.plaintiffs argued that they needed an opportunity to conduct discovery on all of the broadcasts,exactly what they released,adding that they were not sure produced all of them.plaintiffs also argued that dismissal on a rule b motion was inappropriate because they needed discovery on the circumstances under which alvarado and flores names were disclosed and what knew.
on appeal,alvarado and flores argue that the district court impermissibly viewed all of the facts in the light most favorable to the defendant,and that it ruled prematurely on the motion to dismiss and should have accorded them an opportunity for full discovery.although the district court stated it did not rely on the parties additional submissions,there would have been no error for the court to consider the court order sealing alvarado and flores identities,as the sealing order was central to plaintiffs claims against and the parties do not dispute the document authenticity.see id.however,the transcript and copy of the broadcasts likely should have been excluded,since plaintiffs argued to the district court that may not have released all of the relevant portions of the broadcasts 
yet,in this case dismissal can be justified without considering the outside materials,gff,at,because we agree with the district court that,given the facts alleged in alvarado and flores complaint,their claims fail as a matter of law.therefore,any error on the part of the district court in not excluding the broadcasts from the motion to dismiss was harmless.we conclude that the district court properly proceeded to dispose of the claims against on a rule b motion.
invasion of privacy claim 
alvarado and flores allege that invaded their privacy by broadcasting their names and images on local television.they claim that with negligence,gross negligence,or recklessness published private facts about plaintiffs and intruded into their private seclusion,thereby giving unreasonable publicity to their private lives and had no newsworthiness or other privilege to do so.however,new mexico follows most states in defining privacy torts strictly.we conclude that the facts as alleged by alvarado and flores can not state a claim for invasion of privacy.
new mexico recognizes the tort of invasion of privacy and its four categories false light,intrusion,publication of private facts,and appropriation.andrews stallings,app see also mcnutt state tribune,app characterizing the four torts as having in common the right to be let alone.plaintiffs complaint does not specify which categories their claims fall within,but the factual allegations relate only to the torts of intrusion and publication of private facts 
intrusion into solitude appears to be based on the manner in which a defendant obtains information,and not what a defendant later does with the information,which is covered by the branch.beauvais,app see also moore,at commenting,in dictum,that intrusion is distinct from but related to trespass,and involves an invasion of the plaintiff private space or on private conversations or peeping through the bedroom window,for example quotation omitted mcnutt,at defining the tort as an intrusion upon the plaintiff physical solitude or seclusion or into his private affairs alterations,quotation omitted.new mexico has not outlined the specific contours of this particular tort.therefore,we follow the lead of new mexico courts defining privacy torts generally,see,mcnutt,at,and moore,at,and thus look for guidance to prosser keeton on torts page keeton ed.ed hereinafter prosser keeton and the restatement second of torts restatement.
the comments to the restatement are particularly helpful,suggesting that the tort of intrusion becomes actionable only when it is deemed highly offensive to a reasonable person,and usually involves a physical invasion into someone space.restatement cmts.b and the invasion may be by physical intrusion into a place in which the plaintiff has secluded himself,as when the defendant forces his way into the plaintiff room in a hotel or insists over the plaintiff objection in entering his home.id.cmt.t here is no liability for knocking at the plaintiff door,or calling him to the telephone on one occasion or even two or three,to demand payment of a debt.it is only when the telephone calls are repeated with such persistence and frequency as to amount to a course of hounding the plaintiff,that becomes a substantial burden to his existence,that his privacy is invaded.id.cmt.d see also prosser keeton,at t here is no tort when the landlord stops by on sunday morning to ask for the rent.
alvarado and flores do not allege that reporters tried to badger their way into the officers homes,or that they repeatedly approached the alvarado and flores at home.although the tort of intrusion may be implicated when the plaintiff is merely in the seclusion of his home,id.at,alvarado and flores do not claim that obtained footage through their windows or other intrusive means the facts as alleged by alvarado and flores simply can not give rise to the claim of intrusion upon seclusion,and thus the district court properly dismissed this claim.
the appellants likewise fail to state a claim for the alternate theory of invasion of disclosure of private facts.the tort of public disclosure is defined in new mexico as disclosure which would be objectionable to a reasonable person,and a lack of legitimate public interest in the information,at citing prosser keeton,at and restatement unlike defamation,there is no requirement that the publicized information be false.mcnutt,at citing prosser.the tort of publication of private facts involves the publication of true but intimate or private facts about the plaintiff,such as matters concerning the plaintiff sexual life or health.moore,at quotation omitted.
the questions,then,are whether the disclosures of publication of the following facts,which alvarado and flores allege broadcast,would be objectionable to a reasonable person,and whether there is a lack of legitimate public interest in the information 
alvarado and flores names 
their home addresses,by virtue of film footage of each plaintiff answering his door at home,under appellants theory that albuquerque neighborhoods are very unique and it would be easy to identify where someone lived by such footage 
what they look personal appearance,by virtue of the same film footage and 
the fact that flores and alvarado were undercover police officers for the albuquerque police department.
a new mexico appellate court dealt with a somewhat similar fact pattern in mcnutt.there,police officers engaged in a gun battle with two members of a group known as the black berets and killed both of them.at.a newspaper printed the names and addresses of the officers,allegedly because they would not cooperate in giving the details about the incident.id.at.after the article was published,several officers and members of their families received threatening phone calls.id.the mcnutt court concluded that the officers addresses were not,as a matter of law,private facts.id.at.because t he address of most persons appears in many public records which are available to public inspection,an individual home address is a public fact and its mere publication,without more,can not be viewed as an invasion of privacy.id.likewise,a person image in and of itself is not a private fact.some commentators suggest that while pictures made of someone without their consent in a private place may trigger liability,anything visible in a public place can be recorded and given circulation by means of a photograph.prosser keeton at but plaintiffs complaint here does not allege that obtained images of alvarado and flores without their consent or in a private place.
however,alvarado and flores allege public disclosure of a unique private status as undercover officers.the mcnutt court had reasoned that t he plaintiff can not complain when an occupation in which he publicly engages is called to public attention,at quotation omitted,but here the appellants were not publicly engage d in being undercover police officers.alvarado and flores argue that undercover officers face special risks in that,if their identities are revealed,they are more likely than officers to be targets for revenge.in fact,they allege that they received threats as a result of the broadcasts.publicity of this kind of information is objectionable to a reasonable person.
for alvarado and flores to state a claim under the tort of public disclosure of private facts,they must allege a lack of a legitimate public interest.n ot all matters are of legitimate public interest.gilbert medical econs,cir applying colorado law.in gilbert,we endorsed the position taken by the restatement second of torts on what type of matters are of public interest 
the line is to be drawn when the publicity ceases to be the giving of information to which the public is entitled,and becomes a morbid and sensational prying into private lives for its own sake with which a reasonable member of the public,with decent standards,would say that he had no concern.
id.at quoting rest.cmt.h.as new mexico courts also rely on the restatement to define the contours of public disclosure of private facts,we believe they would agree.
courts have generally treated allegations of police misconduct as worthy of public interest.see,cowles publ g state patrol,we conclude that a law enforcement officer actions while performing his public duties or improper off duty actions in public which bear upon his ability to perform his public office do not fall within the activities to be protected under the comment h to of restatement second of torts as a matter of personal privacy.santillo phila.newspapers,police officers have no valid basis for believing that criminal conduct committed by them in their official capacity will not be publicized for all to read.
to the extent first amendment law informs our determination of whether alvarado and flores can allege facts showing that publicity of their identities and undercover status in the context of the alleged sexual assault was not a matter of public interest,we are among a number of courts that have found that police misconduct allegations specifically and officer qualifications generally are a matter of public interest in first amendment analyses 
street level policemen have such apparent importance that the public has an independent interest in the qualifications and performance of the person who holds such a position misuse of his authority can result in significant deprivation of constitutional rights and personal freedoms,not to mention bodily injury and financial loss.the strong public interest in ensuring open discussion and criticism of his qualifications and job performance warrant the conclusion that he is a public official.
gray udevitz,cir quotation omitted.see also meiners moriarity,cir the public is certainly interested in an important and special way in the qualifications and performance of federal agents,such as the defendants here,whose decisions to search and to arrest directly and personally affect individual freedoms.coursey greater niles twp.publ g,noting that the public has a far greater interest in the qualifications and conduct of law enforcement officers,even at,and perhaps especially at,an on the street level.an officer alleged involvement in a sexual assault,even if,surely bears upon his or her qualifications and fitness to be a police officer.publicity of undercover police officers allegedly involved in a sexual assault thus qualifies as a matter of public interest in first amendment law,and we have no reason to perceive a significant difference in new mexico tort law.
therefore,alvarado and flores privacy claim hinges on a proposed exception for undercover officers,that disclosure of their identities lacks legitimate public interest as a matter of law.we can find no precedent for such an exception,and we are not inclined to create one here merely on policy grounds,despite our concerns about the safety of undercover officers and the need to avoid disincentives for entering their profession.
there are many individuals who enter official roles knowing that there are inherent risks in doing so.all police officers,not just those undercover,face a risk of violent retaliation simply by having their names associated with an arrest or investigation.it would be impossible for courts to quantify the amount of risk that a person faces in having his or her name in the news,and to carve out an exception on that basis for purposes of tort law.in addition to the difficulty we would face in applying such a rule,we observe that such an exception could run afoul of the first amendment.
alvarado and flores point to a federal law,that criminalizes disclosure of the identity of covert intelligence agents as support for a policy exception for undercover officers generally.however,only criminalizes the disclosure of the identity of federal not city or state undercover agents,and only when that disclosure comes from someone who had authorized access to classified information that identifies a covert agent,had authorized access to classified information and learns the identity of a covert agent,or was engaged in a pattern of activities intended to identify and expose covert agents.in other words,congress arguably has not significantly implicated the public interest in an open discussion of law enforcement personnel,because the law only applies to disclosure by someone who had authorized access to classified information,a government official or someone engaged in a pattern with the intention of exposing agents.section does not represent a national policy of criminalizing publicity of a covert agent identity.if new mexico tort law is to be expanded to assign liability for such conduct,it will be up to new mexico to do so.indeed,our exercise in judicial restraint ought not to be misread as an effort to preclude the people of the state of new mexico from deciding for themselves whether to assign liability in tort to the public disclosure of the names or appearance of undercover police officers.to be sure,any rule of law adopted in this area would implicate core and vital first amendment values,and it is far from clear whether and how such a law might coexist with the freedom of the press.but any foray into these thickets is,in the first instance,for the instruments of government in the state of new mexico,not us,and therefore are not issues we need reach today.
moreover,courts have not defined the tort of public disclosure of private facts in a way that would obligate a publisher to parse out concededly public interest information,sexual assault allegations against two members of the police department,from allegedly private facts,the officers identities and undercover status.we have held that publication of a person photograph and name was in the public interest when it was substantially relevant to a newsworthy topic,in that case,medical malpractice,and because the additional identifying information strengthen ed the impact and credibility of the article.gilbert,at.other courts also appear to give public interest status to news material on an aggregate basis,rather than itemizing what in the news report would qualify and what could remain private.see,ross midwest commc ns,cir ruling on a privacy claim where a television show about the potential innocence of an accused rapist used a rape victim first name and photograph of her house at the time of the rape,holding that not only was the story behind the rape a matter of legitimate public interest,but also using her name and picture of her residence helped persuade the public,and in turn authorities,to a particular view of particular incidents.
in short,for alvarado and flores to state a claim under the tort of public disclosure of private facts,they must be able to allege facts from which we could conclude that the publication was not in the public interest.because allegations of police misconduct are in the public interest,and because there is no exception in the law for undercover officers,alvarado and flores claim can not survive a rule b motion to dismiss.
claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress 
alvarado and flores also fail to state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress,a tort that requires extreme conduct on the part of the defendant.even if we assume was aware of the sealing order shielding alvarado and flores identities from the search warrants,we can not conclude as a matter of law t
