the provisions of the cable television consumer protection and competition act cable act or cable act require cable operators to transmit,over their cable systems,the signals of certain broadcast stations operating in the same market.the statute also gives the federal communications commission fcc or the commission authority to modify a given broadcast station market,thus potentially changing the universe of cable operators required to carry that station.in this case,cablevision,a cable systems operator,petitions for review of the fcc decision to include certain long island communities in the market of wrnn,a station broadcasting from upstate new york,and the resulting order directing cablevision to carry wrnn on its long island cable systems.because we find no constitutional or legal error in the fcc decision,we deny the petition.
background 
i.the cable act and its provisions 
the provisions of the cable act require cable operators,such as cablevision,to carry the signals of a number of local commercial television stations.a.the statute caps the number of such stations that a cable operator must carry at up to of the aggregate number of usable activated channels on that operator system.id.b b.for our purposes,a local commercial television station is a broadcast station,a station that transmits its signal over the airwaves that,with respect to a particular cable system,is within the same television market as the cable system.id.h a.
a broadcast station market shall be determined by the commission by regulation or order using,where available,commercial publications which delineate television markets based on viewing patterns.id.h c i.currently,the commission relies on the commercial publications of nielsen media research that divide the nation into a series of coterminous geographic designated market areas dmas based on viewership patterns.e.for example,the new york city dma contains not only the five boroughs of the city,but also neighboring areas of long island,connecticut,new jersey,and upstate new york,as well as limited areas of pennsylvania,because people in those areas,in the aggregate,watch the same television channels.
the upshot of the provisions is that,in general,each cable operator is required to carry the signal of every broadcast station in its dma,until it has dedicated of the aggregate number of usable activated channels on its system to such channels.b b see also id.a b,h c.both cablevision and wrnn are located within the new york city dma,and cablevision currently has fewer than of its channels dedicated to stations.
the only relevant exception to this rule occurs under the statute market modification provision.pursuant to this provision,the fcc may,on written request,add certain communities to,or exclude certain communities from,a given broadcast station market to better effectuate the purposes of the statute.h c i.if a given community is excluded from a station market,cable operators in that community are no longer required to carry that station.if a given community is added,cable operators in that community must commence carriage of that station signal unless they already devote of their channels to local broadcast stations.see id.
in considering market modification requests,the statute instructs the fcc to 
afford particular attention to the value of localism by taking into account such factors as 
i whether the station,or other stations located in the same area,have been historically carried on the cable system or systems within such community the historical carriage factor 
ii whether the television station provides coverage or other local service to such community the local service factor 
iii whether any other television station that is eligible to be carried by a cable system in such community in fulfillment of the requirements of this section provides news coverage of issues of concern to such community or provides carriage or coverage of sporting and other events of interest to the community the other stations factor and 
iv evidence of viewing patterns in cable and noncable households within the areas served by the cable system or systems in such community the viewing patterns factor.
h c ii i iv.the fcc interpretation and application of this provision lies at the heart of this dispute.
ii.the turner litigation 
shortly after the passage of the cable act,several cable operators mounted a first amendment challenge to the legislation by claiming that the statute,on its face,impermissibly burdened the rights both of cable programmers,who produce television shows exclusively for cable distribution,hbo,tnt,and of cable operators,who actually transmit the programming to consumers via coaxial cable,cablevision.in turner broadcasting system,fcc turner i,d,the supreme court held that the statute requirements were content neutral,and therefore subject to intermediate scrutiny.the court majority opinion announced that,at least in the abstract,the statute served three important,interrelated interests articulated by congress in the statute findings preserving the benefits of free,local broadcast television,promoting the widespread dissemination of information from a multiplicity of sources,and promoting fair competition in the market for television programming.id.at.the majority,however,concluded that deficienc ies in the record prevented it from determining whether the statute was sufficiently tailored to further those interests without substantially burdening protected speech and remanded for further proceedings.id.at.
significantly,the majority noted that the district court had not addressed whether the language of the market modification provision,with its references to the value of localism and to stations provid ing news coverage of issues of concern to such community,altered the of the statute.id.at.quoting h c ii.the court did not address this point.id.in a dissent joined by three other justices,justice,relying in part on the language of the market modification provision,wrote that the regulation was,and thus subject to strict scrutiny,such that it could only be justified by a compelling governmental interest and would have to be narrowly tailored to achieve its intended purpose.id.at.
in,with a more fully developed record before it,the supreme court held that the provisions further important governmental interests and that the provisions did not violate the first amendment because they did not burden substantially more speech than necessary to further those interests.turner broad,fcc turner ii,d.none of the opinions in turner ii specifically mentioned or cited the market modification provision.
iii.market modification decisions in the new york city dma 
in,cablevision petitioned the fcc to exclude a number of communities from the markets of several local broadcast stations,including wrnn,a station licensed in kingston,new york that transmitted its signal from overlook mountain in woodstock,new york.the fcc cable services bureau the bureau granted cablevision request in part and denied it in part,excluding communities in long island nassau and suffolk counties from wrnn market,but declining to exclude communities elsewhere,such as new york westchester county and connecticut fairfield county.cablevision.csb order.in making both decisions,the bureau noted that,in the new york dma,reliance on the four enumerated factors alone would not allow it to take into account the particular difficulties faced by these stations in light of the purposes of the carriage rule.id.at.accordingly,the bureau also considered the station grade b contour,the area within which viewers can receive its broadcast signal over the air,and the geography and terrain separating the target communities from the broadcasting station.id.at.in,the fcc affirmed the bureau decision,noting that 
grade b contour coverage,in the absence of other determinative market facts where the four statutory factors by themselves define the market,where there is no clear proof that the contour fails to reflect actual coverage,or where there is a terrain obstacle such as a mountain range or a significant body of water is an efficient tool to adjust market boundaries because it is a sound indicator of the economic reach of a particular television station signal.
market modifications and the new york area of dominant influence fcc order,footnote omitted.
when wrnn and several other stations petitioned for review,this court endorsed the agency reliance on grade b contour in particular and factors not enumerated in the statute in general.we approved of the view that the four factors enumerated in the statute are not exclusive,and we held that t he fcc and the cable services bureau,experts in the area of regulation of the television industry,carefully and properly analyzed the particular facts of the various petitions under the four factors listed in the statute and under factors,fcc,cir.
iv.the current proceedings 
subsequent to the outcome of the proceedings,wrnn moved its transmitter to beacon mountain,new york,some miles closer to manhattan,and commenced broadcast operations.in,it petitioned the fcc to add back some of the communities in the new york city dma in its market so that time warner cable,which served the relevant communities,would have to carry wrnn on its system.relying primarily on grade b contour and local programming,the fcc media bureau the successor to the cable services bureau granted wrnn request.wrnn license.time warner cable did not appeal the decision to the full commission.
in,relevant to the present review,wrnn petitioned for of several communities,this time served by cablevision,in long island nassau and suffolk counties.the bureau denied the request as to a number of the suffolk county communities based on wrnn failure to comply with standardized evidentiary requirements.wrnn license bureau order.wrnn does not seek review of the bureau decision as to these communities.as to the remaining nassau and suffolk communities,which we will refer to as the long island communities,the bureau noted that the enumerated market modification factors did not offer strong support for wrnn position.the parties vigorously disputed the amount of long programming wrnn offered,and the bureau ultimately concluded that the local service factor weighed against carriage.as to the historical carriage factor,the bureau found it insignificant that both cable systems in neighboring communities and digital broadcast satellite operators in the long island communities carried wrnn.it also accorded little weight to the fact that verizon was scheduled to begin carrying wrnn on its fios system,which delivers television programming to subscribers over fiber optic phone lines,thus competing directly with cable television service.nonetheless,the bureau granted wrnn request to include the remaining long island communities,noting that commission precedent instructs us to give little weight to the level of viewership that station s like wrnn achieve and to treat grade b contour as a very relevant factor when the other enumerated factors would not add significantly to the analysis of a station market.id.at.in the bureau view,grade b contour weighed decisively in wrnn favor.
on appeal,the fcc affirmed the bureau order.wrnn license fcc order.it disagreed with the bureau analysis of the local service and historical carriage factors,finding that those factors lent additional support to the bureau decision to include the long island communities in wrnn market.id.at.the fcc also rejected cablevision claims that the bureau application of the market modification provision violated the first amendment and the takings clause of the fifth amendment.id.at.cablevision filed a timely petition for review in this court.
discussion 
in general,we will overturn an agency decision only if it was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.cellular phone taskforce fcc,cir quoting a.an agency factual findings must be supported by substantial evidence,which means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.id.internal quotation marks omitted.we review an agency disposition of constitutional issues de novo.see rural.coal.fcc.
in its petition for review,cablevision argues that the fcc order improperly analyzed the statutory factors,that its decision contravened the purpose of the statute,and that requiring cablevision to carry wrnn violates the first and fifth amendments.we address each of these arguments in turn.
i.the fcc analysis of the section h c factors 
a.the local service factor 
cablevision claims that the fcc failed to adequately explain its finding that wrnn provided significant programming targeted to the long island communities.by insisting,however,that at a minimum,the fcc was required to explain why cablevision arguments and evidence to the contrary were unpersuasive,cablevision br.at,cablevision overstates an agency duty to account for its actions.
an administrative agency has a duty to explain its ultimate action.see motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d t he agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action.however,it need not explain each and every step leading to this decision it is enough if the agency path may reasonably be discerned.id.internal quotation marks omitted.here,the reason for the fcc decision to affirm the media bureau order is perfectly clear it agreed with the reasoning of the bureau in most respects and disagreed in certain others,but only in ways that strengthened the validity of the bureau decision.in such circumstances,we will not require the fcc to sift through each piece of evidence offered by a party and explain why it is more or less compelling than the put forth by an opponent.
the fact that we review agency for substantial evidence supports our conclusion that the fcc explanation was adequate.to determine whether substantial evidence supports a finding,we need ask only whether a reasonable mind might accept it as adequate support.cellular phone taskforce,at internal quotation marks omitted.here,the agency found wrnn evidence that it had significant long programming to be more persuasive than cablevision evidence to the contrary.we need not know the agency precise rationale in order to conclude that it was reasonable for the agency to so find.while such an explanation might have aided our reasonableness inquiry,it is not indispensable.
both sides offered evidence regarding wrnn programming content.according to cablevision,its evidence showed that wrnn broadcast less than an hour of programming covering long island issues in a representative week.cablevision br.at.wrnn pointed to evidence that it had aired over long items between june and november.it would be reasonable for the agency to resolve this conflicting evidence in favor of wrnn and to conclude as it obviously did that cablevision failed to include some programming that should properly be considered as local to long island,or that its sample week was not actually representative.thus,substantial evidence supports the fcc finding on this factor.
we note that the bureau,on its initial consideration of this petition,made a contrary finding as to this factor.this fact,however,does not alter our assessment of the fcc ultimate determination.an agency conclusion may be supported by substantial evidence even though a plausible alternative interpretation of the evidence would support a contrary view.robinson transp.safety,internal quotation marks omitted.on questions of fact,our task on review is not to displace the agency final choice between two fairly conflicting views.universal camera nlrb.
b.the historical carriage factor 
after the bureau issued its order,but before the fcc affirmed it,verizon began carrying wrnn on its fios system to areas of nassau and suffolk counties.fcc order,at.the fcc concluded that this overlapping carriage provides support for with respect to the historic carriage factor.id.at.in a single paragraph in its brief,cablevision argues that this analysis is contrary to clear statutory language because c arriage initiated in the past few months does not constitute historical carriage.cablevision br.at.
cablevision,however,fails to supply a contrary,correct definition of historically carried,and does not discuss whether we should defer to the bureau interpretation of the term,in accordance with chevron,natural resources defense council,d,as we did with the statute generally in,fcc,at.even if cablevision could demonstrate error in the sense that the verizon carriage was not historical,they have failed to show why such error would warrant vacatur given that cablevision does not contest the propriety of considering verizon carriage as an unenumerated,factor,and the bureau decided to order carriage despite its belief that wrnn had not been historically carried in the relevant communities.accordingly,we decline to vacate the fcc order based on this asserted error in the fcc analysis of the historical carriage factor.
grade b contour 
in its fcc order involving cablevision and wrnn,the commission stated that grade b contour coverage,in the absence of other determinative market facts,a terrain obstacle such as a mountain range or a significant body of water,is an efficient tool to adjust market boundaries.fcc order,at.cablevision contends that the hudson river,the long island sound,and the skyline of new york city constitute such terrain obstacles,and it was therefore inconsistent with the fcc order for the fcc and the bureau to weigh grade b contour in wrnn favor here.cablevision br.at.the fcc order itself forcefully rejects this reasoning,because it explicitly endorses the use of grade b contour as proof of market in the new york city same context in which cablevision now contends that relying on grade b contour is inappropriate.because the fcc order establishes,rather than refutes,the relevance of grade b contour in market modifications within the new york city dma,the fcc decision here is consistent with its precedent.
d.the other stations and viewing patterns factors 
cablevision also alleges error in the fcc treatment of the two remaining statutory factors.in the instant order,the fcc stated that congress did not intend the coverage by other qualified stations factor to bar a request for extending a station market when other stations could be shown to serve the communities at issue.fcc order,at.
in essence,then,the fcc decided to give the factor significant weight when a lack of coverage by other stations favored including a community in a station market,but to discount its importance when the existence of coverage arguably cut against inclusion.cablevision argues that this decision is directly contrary to the statutory text.cablevision br.at.this argument is unavailing.the text of the statute directs the agency to consider a number of factors,and it is clear from the opinion that both the fcc and the bureau did consider this factor.upon doing so,the fcc saw no reason to depart from its normal policy,which is to discount the other stations coverage factor when it tends to cut against inclusion.unsurprisingly,cablevision cites no decision of this court vacating a decision because we disagree with an agency weighing of a statutory factor.the law is to the contrary.in interpreting another provision of the cable act that directs the fcc to undertake a factoral analysis,the circuit concluded that giving little or no weight to a statutory factor,as long as the factor is expressly considered,does not violate the statute 
t he statute by its terms merely requires the commission to consider the factors that means only that it must reach an express and considered conclusion about the bearing of a factor,but is not required to give any specific weight to it.therefore,when the commission,after expressly considering the potential role of the factor,ultimately concluded that it should not be given any weight,it did not violate the statute.
time warner entm t fcc,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.this sound reasoning is equally applicable here.
cablevision also argues that the fcc improperly weighed the evidence with respect to the viewership patterns factor.this argument fails for the same reasons.
ii.the fcc consideration of the purposes of the statute 
the market modification provision of the statute provides that the fcc may add or remove communities from a local broadcast station market to better effectuate the purposes of this section.h c i.cablevision argues that the fcc inclusion of the long island communities in wrnn market contravened the purposes of in two ways.first,expanding wrnn market in fact frustrates the goal of localism by necessarily decreasing programming relevant to the community wrnn has traditionally served the kingston community.and second,rewarding wrnn actions with broader rights encourages gamesmanship which frustrates the purpose of,which is to preserve,but not expand,a broadcast station market.we reject the first argument because it incorrectly presumes that wrnn can not increase long programming without decreasing programming.we reject the second because it rests on a conception of the statute purpose that is overly narrow,unsupported by precedent,and contrary to the language of the statute.
according to cablevision,the fcc decision defeats the purposes of the statute because a ny targeting of other spokes,communities that are remote from a dma metropolitan center necessarily comes at the expense of the station community of license.cablevision br.at.this argument rests on the false premise that wrnn programming consists entirely of either programming or long programming.as cablevision reminds us elsewhere,however,a great deal of wrnn content is programming that targets neither kingston nor long island specifically.see cablevision br.at claiming that of wrnn programming in a representative week consisted of home shopping and infomercials.it is entirely possible,and cablevision does not suggest otherwise,that wrnn could increase its long programming by decreasing its programming,leaving its programming unaffected.and to the extent that a kingston viewer might prefer certain programming to programming concerning long island,we do not see how frustrating that preference undermines localism.
essentially,cablevision claim is that,as a matter of law,a cable company in a community that is outside a dma metropolitan center,such as long island,should not be required to carry a station based in a different community that is also remote from the center,such as kingston in cablevision parlance,a spoke cable company should not be required to carry a station based in a different spoke.congress,however,did not share that view,and,as the fcc points out,the default rule is that wrnn must be carried by cable operators throughout the new york city dma.see a b,h c.
cablevision also contends that the fcc decision rewards gamesmanship because wrnn moved its transmitter and changed its programming simply to obtain privileges in other communities.cablevision br.at.in other words,they suggest that the fcc can not award wrnn a regulatory benefit if wrnn has changed its conduct in an attempt to receive that benefit.this rule,applied universally,would run counter to a central premise of the regulatory scheme that a regulated entity will change its conduct in socially desirable ways to achieve a regulatory benefit.accordingly,we reject it.
cablevision also argues that any decision that increases a station market is contrary to the purpose of the statute,because the purpose is to return broadcasters to their natural market,cablevision br.at thus,any fcc action which augments a broadcaster market contravenes this purpose.the purpose of the statute,however,is not to preserve a group of broadcast stations,or a particular conception of a station market,but,inter alia,to preserv e the benefits of free,television,and promot e the widespread dissemination of information from a multiplicity of sources.turner i,at.we do not think that these purposes are served only by granting broadcasters the minimum coverage necessary for survival or that these purposes are frustrated by actions which result in a station greater prosperity.accordingly,we conclude that the fcc did not violate the statutory admonition that market modifications should be made to better effectuate the purposes of this section.h c i.the remainder of cablevisio
