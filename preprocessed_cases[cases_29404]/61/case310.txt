we consider whether court records,originally filed under seal as attachments to motions in a civil action alleging police corruption,must be released to a newspaper under the common law right of access.this appeal stems from a suit by kenneth kamakana,a honolulu police detective,claiming retaliation by the city and county of honolulu for his whistleblower activities.although that suit settled and its merits are not at issue here,during the litigation scores of documents were filed under seal in accord with a stipulated protective order.on the motion of intervenor gannett pacific honolulu advertiser honolulu advertiser,the magistrate judge undertook a detailed and exhaustive review and unsealed virtually all of the pleadings and documents.the city and county of honolulu,as well as lee donohue and milton olmos in their official capacities collectively the city,with the united states as intervenor,challenge that order.we affirm.
background 
kamakana case 
kamakana was a detective in the honolulu police department hpd.from to,he was in the elite criminal intelligence unit ciu,which investigates organized crime.in september,kamakana was transferred out of ciu.the following year,the department internal affairs division initiated criminal and administrative investigations against kamakana.
shortly after his transfer in,kamakana filed a civil rights action against the city and others,alleging that the city violated his free speech rights,conspired to violate his civil rights,and retaliated against him as a whistleblower.the crux of his claim was that his transfer was in retaliation for his reporting misconduct and illegal acts by other hpd officers to his superiors and the federal bureau of investigation.
after discovery and other proceedings,the parties filed motions for summary judgment under seal.the district court denied,in large part,the city motion and kamakana for partial summary judgment on his whistleblowing claim.the case settled before trial and kamakana stipulated to dismiss all of his claims.
ii.sealed documents and the honolulu advertiser intervention 
we recount in detail the procedural background as it provides context for the unsealing order.in june,the magistrate judge approved an amended,stipulated protective order,which restricted access to discovery materials to parties and counsel and limited their use solely for the litigation.discovery began in earnest following entry of the protective order.in december,the city served the united states,a third party,with requests for witness depositions and documents.
in accord with the protective order,the parties sought court permission to file their summary judgment pleadings under seal.the district court granted the motion but stated,the court reserves the right to unseal materials filed under seal if,upon reviewing the sealed materials,the court determines that they should be available to the public or otherwise do not merit sealed status.
in the fall of,the honolulu advertiser filed a motion to intervene for the limited purpose of modifying the protective order and unsealing the judicial record.the magistrate judge granted the motion to intervene and modified the protective order.because the parties had simply stipulated to the protective order,a particularized showing of good cause to keep the documents under seal had never been made to the court as required by federal rule of civil procedure c.the magistrate judge ordered the parties to submit all materials they wished to keep sealed along with specific averments as to why good cause exists.the order noted that t he burden of showing good cause will be on the party seeking to keep the information documents confidential.the court declined at that time to determine whether the public had a common law right to access the documents because such a determination is necessary only after it is shown that good cause exists to restrict disclosure.
slightly different procedures applied to the city and the united states.the court ordered the city to submit its materials to a special discovery master for good cause determinations under rule c.though not yet an intervenor at the time,the united states was directed to submit materials directly to the magistrate judge for an in camera good cause analysis.
in february,the united states submitted transcripts and documents for the in camera review.in june,the magistrate judge ordered,subject to limited specified exceptions,the transcripts and documents to be unsealed.
after in camera inspection of the city documents,the discovery master issued a report and recommendation in february that listed general categories of documents to remain sealed and redactions to be made.the magistrate judge rejected the report and ordered the special master to identify specific documents to be sealed.following this directive,the special master submitted an amended report and recommendation,categorizing each document as sealed,unsealed,or unsealed with redactions based on the good cause standard.the magistrate judge adopted the report and the city immediately filed a motion to reconsider,which the judge took under advisement.
the city and the honolulu advertiser then met with the special master who took another look at various documents and issued another report and recommendation.in october,the magistrate judge adopted this report.in the same order,the magistrate judge noted that the ninth circuit had decided in foltz state farm mutual auto.insurance company,cir,that the presumption of access is not rebutted where documents which are the subject of a protective order are filed with the court as attachments to summary judgment motions and that to retain any protected status for documents attached to a summary judgment motion,the proponent must meet the compelling reasons standard and not the lesser good cause determination.
in response to this articulation of the controlling standard,the city and united states both sought reconsideration.the city motion did not set forth compelling reasons to keep its documents secret.instead,it asserted that the magistrate judge had not given the city enough notice to make such a showing.similarly the united states submission detailed no compelling reasons,arguing only that the honolulu advertiser had not objected to the united states proposed redactions.
in an order dated january,the magistrate judge directed the production of most of the city documents that were under seal.the magistrate judge reasoned that an intervening change in controlling law,the foltz case,compelled her to reconsider and conclude that almost all of the documents attached to the dispositive motions should be unsealed because no compelling reason rebutted the presumption of public access.after an in camera inspection of the sealed documents,described as an exhausting if not exhaustive process,the magistrate judge held that there was no good cause to keep sealed most of the other materials,mainly motions and attachments.the magistrate judge displayed the fruits of her in camera labors in three detailed indices attached to the a,b and 
as to the united states,in an order dated january,the magistrate judge required the unsealing of all the documents the united states had asked to keep protected,granting redactions related to the home addresses and social security numbers of law enforcement officers and kamakana.no detailed index was necessary because the united states requested redaction of a manageable number of documents,all of which were attached to dispositive pleadings.
the magistrate judge ordered the record unsealed by february.in advance of the deadline,the city,with the united states as amicus curiae,requested an emergency stay,which we granted.we also granted the united states motion for intervention on appeal.
the broad issue before us is whether the magistrate judge abused her discretion in determining that continued secrecy was no longer warranted for almost all of the documents currently under seal to answer the question,we first provide a general overview of the common law right of access to judicial records and then consider whether the documents the city and the united states seek to protect are subject to the right of access.
overview of the right of access to judicial records 
historically,courts have recognized a general right to inspect and copy public records and documents,including judicial records and documents.nixon warner commc ns,d.this right is justified by the interest of citizens in keep ing a watchful eye on the workings of public agencies.id.at.such vigilance is aided by the efforts of newspapers to publish information concerning the operation of government.id.
nonetheless,access to judicial records is not absolute.a narrow range of documents is not subject to the right of public access at all because the records have traditionally been kept secret for important policy reasons.times mirror united states,cir.our case law has identified two categories of documents that fall in this category grand jury transcripts and warrant materials in the midst of a investigation.id.
unless a particular court record is one traditionally kept secret,a strong presumption in favor of access is the starting point.foltz,at citing hagestad tragesser,cir.a party seeking to seal a judicial record then bears the burden of overcoming this strong presumption by meeting the compelling reasons standard.foltz,at.that is,the party must articulate compelling reasons supported by specific factual findings,id.citing san jose mercury news,dist,cir,that outweigh the general history of access and the public policies favoring disclosure,such as the public interest in understanding the judicial process.hagestad,at quoting eeoc erection,cir.in turn,the court must conscientiously balance the competing interests of the public and the party who seeks to keep certain judicial records secret.foltz,at.after considering these interests,if the court decides to seal certain judicial records,it must base its decision on a compelling reason and articulate the factual basis for its ruling,without relying on hypothesis or conjecture.hagestad,at citing valley broadcasting dist,cir.
in general,compelling reasons sufficient to outweigh the public interest in disclosure and justify sealing court records exist when such court files might have become a vehicle for improper purposes,such as the use of records to gratify private spite,promote public scandal,circulate libelous statements,or release trade secrets.nixon,at.accord valley broadcasting,at.the mere fact that the production of records may lead to a litigant embarrassment,incrimination,or exposure to further litigation will not,without more,compel the court to seal its records.foltz,at.
we acknowledged explicitly in san jose mercury news,at,and later confirmed in foltz,at,that the strong presumption of access to judicial records applies fully to dispositive pleadings,including motions for summary judgment and related attachments.we adopted this principle of disclosure because the resolution of a dispute on the merits,whether by trial or summary judgment,is at the heart of the interest in ensuring the public understanding of the judicial process and of significant public events.valley broadcasting,at accord foltz,at noting that summary judgment adjudicates substantive rights and serves as a substitute for trial quoting rushford v.the new yorker magazine,cir.thus,compelling reasons must be shown to seal judicial records attached to a dispositive motion.foltz,at.the compelling reasons standard is invoked even if the dispositive motion,or its attachments,were previously filed under seal or protective order.id.t he presumption of access is not rebutted where documents subject to a protective order are filed under seal as attachments to a dispositive motion.the compelling reasons standard continues to apply.internal citations omitted.
we have,however,carved out an exception to the presumption of access to judicial records,foltz,at,for a sealed discovery document attached to a motion,such that the usual presumption of the public right of access is rebutted.phillips general motors,cir emphasis added.there are,as we explained in foltz,good reasons to distinguish between dispositive and motions.at.specifically,the public has less of a need for access to court records attached only to motions because those documents are often unrelated,or only tangentially related,to the underlying cause of action.id.quoting seattle times rhinehart,d.
the public policies that support the right of access to dispositive motions,and related materials,do not apply with equal force to materials.phillips,at.we reasoned in phillips that when a district court grants a protective order to seal documents during discovery,it already has determined that good cause exists to protect this information from being disclosed to the public by balancing the needs for discovery against the need for confidentiality.id.the application of a strong presumption of access to sealed records,not directly relevant to the merits of the case,would eviscerate the broad power of the district court to fashion protective orders.id.thus a particularized showing,foltz,at,under the good cause standard of rule c will suffice to warrant preserving the secrecy of sealed discovery material attached to motions.id.at.
in sum,we treat judicial records attached to dispositive motions differently from records attached to motions.those who seek to maintain the secrecy of documents attached to dispositive motions must meet the high threshold of showing that compelling reasons support secrecy.id.at.a good cause showing under rule c will suffice to keep sealed records attached to motions.id.at.
it is important to emphasize the difference between the compelling reasons standard and the good cause standard,especially because the city suggests that they essentially collapse in this case a good cause showing will suffice to seal documents produced in discovery.c stating that if good cause is shown in discovery,a district court may issue any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance,embarrassment,oppression,or undue burden or expense.rule c gives the district court much flexibility in balancing and protecting the interests of private parties.id.
a good cause showing will not,without more,satisfy a compelling reasons test.see foltz,at phillips,at observing that even if a court finds good cause under rule c to seal a document,it must still determine whether the common law right of access compels production.different interests are at stake with the right of access than with rule c with the former,the private interests of the litigants are not the only weights on the scale.unlike private materials unearthed during discovery,judicial records are public documents almost by definition,and the public is entitled to access by default.see nixon,at.this fact sharply tips the balance in favor of production when a document,formerly sealed for good cause under rule c,becomes part of a judicial record.thus a good cause showing alone will not suffice to fulfill the compelling reasons standard that a party must meet to rebut the presumption of access to dispositive pleadings and attachments 
having in mind these differences in the nature of the sealed filings and the applicable standards,we bifurcate our analysis,first considering records to which the compelling reasons standard documents attached to dispositive motions that the city and united states seek to keep sealed.we then analyze records to which the good cause standard documents attached to motions that the city alone seeks to keep sealed.
ii.dispositive covered by the compelling reasons standard 
a.the city 
under our precedent,the city was required to present articulable facts identifying the interests favoring continued secrecy,foltz,at internal citation omitted,and to show that these specific interests overcame the presumption of access by outweighing the public interest in understanding the judicial process.hagestad,at citation omitted.instead,the city complains that it had no chance to present compelling reasons,and that the magistrate judge failed to even permit a fair opportunity to be heard on the matter.
but,in fact,the city did have a chance to show compelling reasons and squandered it.in the october order,the magistrate judge explicitly asked for motions for reconsideration of her order adopting the special master report.she pointed to the issuance of foltz,observing that the court concludes that,in order to retain any protected status for documents attached to a summary judgment motion,the proponent must meet the compelling reasons standard and not the lesser good cause determination.rather than identifying or even attempting to articulate compelling reasons,the city motion to reconsider simply objected that the city was not given enough time to articulate such compelling reasons.
the city further argues that the magistrate judge failed to articulate reasons for unsealing the record even though it was the city burden to articulate reasons for sealing the record,claiming that the january,order deprived the city of a meaningful discussion and analysis by the magistrate judge,of the factors she considered in her compelling reasons determination.this proposed approach is upside down.the judge need not document compelling reasons to unseal rather the proponent of sealing bears the burden with respect to sealing.a failure to meet that burden means that the default posture of public access prevails.
even so,the magistrate judge did not summarily order the production of the city documents.rather,she conducted an exhausting if not exhaustive in camera review of the materials after this review,the magistrate judge noted that the testimony and documents attached to the dispositive motions do not contain information that could be used for scandalous or libelous purposes,and that these documents did not contain sensitive personal information.she also determined that deposition testimony on confidential informants and criminal investigations was years old and largely resulted in criminal indictments which were made public over three years ago.she found,however,that the personal information of kamakana and various law enforcement officers home addresses and social security numbers met the compelling reason standard.
it is difficult to know what more detail the magistrate judge could have provided in addressing the city request to keep these documents sealed,especially since the city itself never provided specific compelling reasons to grapple with and consider.when sealing documents attached to a dispositive pleading,a district court must base its decision on a compelling reason and articulate the factual basis for its ruling,without relying on hypothesis or conjecture.hagestad,at.in the absence of specifically articulated reasons,meaningful appellate review is impossible.id.at it makes little sense,however,to require the same specificity where the court is simply effectuating the presumption of public access by unsealing documents covered by a blanket protective order.
a review of the record points up the inadequacy of the city declarations,which largely make conclusory statements about the content of the they are confidential and that,in general,their production would,amongst other things,hinder ciu future operations with other agencies,endanger informants lives,and cast hpd officers in a false light.these conclusory offerings do not rise to the level of compelling reasons sufficiently specific to bar the public access to the documents.under these circumstances,and given the detail of the judge analysis and the case law,we conclude that the magistrate judge did not abuse her discretion in declining to seal the documents attached to summary judgment motions 
b.the united states 
in appealing the magistrate judge order,the united states requested a limited number of specific redactions of documents filed with dispositive motions.these redactions have the virtue of being limited and clear,identifying specific names or references to be kept secret.the problem is the broad,categorical approach the united states took to justify these redactions.it asserted a blanket rule that,as a to the litigation,it was entitled to rely on the protections of the stipulated protective order.although the united states proposed specific redactions,it justified them by invoking general categories of privileges without elaboration.finally,the united states claimed that it sought redactions for information that was traditionally kept secret.
reliance on protective order 
the united states argues that,as a to the litigation,it relied on the stipulated protective order when consenting to provide depositions of federal witnesses and documents,and that such reliance constituted a compelling reason sufficient to overcome the presumption of access.we have no such categorical rule regarding protective orders.to the contrary,we have held that a reliance on a blanket protective order is unreasonable and is not a compelling reason that rebuts the presumption of access.foltz,at beckman,int l ins,cir noting that t he extent to which a party can rely on a protective order should depend on the extent to which the order induced the party to allow discovery and that reliance on a stipulated blanket protective order does not justify sealing court records.
the position of the united states illustrates the hazard of stipulated protective orders.these orders often contain provisions that purport to put the entire litigation under lock and key without regard to the actual requirements of rule c.like many pretrial protective orders,the judge signed off on the order without the benefit of making an individualized determination as to specific documents.the order here was geared primarily to discovery,but with a recognition that confidential documents may find their way into a court file or be used at trial.for example,in addition to recognizing that the court could modify the order at any time for good cause,the order required that the parties obtain a court order to file materials under seal.thus,the united states should have been on notice that confidential categorization of discovery documents under the protective order was not a guarantee of confidentiality,especially in the event of a court filing.although the magistrate judge expressly approved and entered the protective order,the order contained no good cause findings as to specific documents that would justify reliance by the united states.see beckman,at.thus,the claimed reliance on the order is not a compelling reason that rebuts the presumption of access.see foltz,at.
specificity of compelling reasons 
although the united states identifies the redactions it seeks by page number and line number,it does not provide similarly specific compelling reasons to justify these redactions.instead,the united states purports to justify each redaction by listing one of four general categories of privilege privacy,law enforcement,confidential source,and ongoing investigation.simply mentioning a general category of privilege,without any further elaboration or any specific linkage with the documents,does not satisfy the burden.
we note that these redactions and justifications are the same ones the united states offered under the good cause standard of rule c.the government took no steps to explain how these asserted privileges also met the more demanding compelling reasons standard.as we explained in foltz,a good cause showing without more will not satisfy a compelling reasons test.see id.at.because the united states simply resubmitted its good cause showing without more,the magistrate judge was well within her discretion to deny the redactions it sought under the compelling reasons standard.
a review of the united states proposed redactions supports the decision to unseal the records.for example,many names or references for which the united states sought redaction were either already publicly available or were available in other documents being produced to the honolulu advertiser.the magistrate judge noted an example of this phenomenon the united states sought redactions for references to marirose tangi and gabriel aio even though both were mentioned by name in a press release issued by the united states attorney office for the district of hawaii.
there are more examples.in one set of redactions,the united states sought to delete deposition references to events an
