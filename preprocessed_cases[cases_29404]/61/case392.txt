five journalists appeal a district court order holding them in contempt of court for refusing to answer questions regarding confidential sources in a deposition in a civil case.they contend that the district court improperly applied our precedent in zerilli smith,to overcome a journalist qualified privilege to keep sources confidential.we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding four of the five journalists in contempt and therefore affirm as to four of the appellants.because there was insufficient evidence to hold appellant jeff gerth in contempt we reverse the district court order as to him.
background 
the lee investigation 
appellee wen ho lee is a scientist who was employed by the department of energy doe between and.from lee was investigated by the doe and the federal bureau of investigation fbi on suspicion of espionage on behalf of the people republic of china.ultimately the government indicted lee on counts of mishandling of classified computer files.the case was resolved through a plea agreement in which the government dismissed counts of mishandling and lee pleaded guilty to one count.
shortly after his indictment,lee filed a privacy act action against the doe,the department of justice doj,and the fbi alleging that each of the defendant agencies of the government had improperly disclosed personal information about lee and about the investigation to members of the news media.the privacy act provides a private right of action against a government agency when records pertaining to an individual have been improperly disclosed by that agency.when a court finds that an agency made such a disclosure in a manner which was intentional or willful,the united states is liable for damages plus attorneys fees and costs.id.g.
the investigation was first disclosed in the wall street journal on january,followed by the washington post on february.the authors of these articles are not involved in this appeal.on march,appellants jeff gerth and james risen published an article in the new york times times.the times article did not identify lee by name,but referred to a computer scientist working in nuclear weapons at los alamos and provided considerable detail about the nature and scope of the government investigation.
some network news stations broadcast lee name on march,immediately after which appellant josef hebert wrote an article for the associated press revealing lee name.on march the times published another article by risen that named lee and described a lie detector test he had been given that indicated deception.on the same day the los angeles times published an article by appellant bob drogin that provided details about the investigation that were particular to lee,but did not include his name.on march,drogin identified lee by name in an article about the investigation.
the government investigation eventually shifted from espionage to mishandling of computer files.this shift was reported on april,in a times article authored by risen with assistance from gerth that cited anonymous government sources and included allegations that lee had mishandled computer codes for nuclear weapons by downloading them to an unsecured computer.appellant pierre thomas wrote a similar article published by cnn the same day giving lee name and information about the new investigative focus.on april drogin published an article quoting an unnamed government source who predicted that lee would be arrested by the fbi within days.
the privacy act case 
lee brought suit against the doe,the fbi,and the doj on december,alleging unlawful disclosures by employees of the defendant agencies designed to prejudice lee image and distract from the agencies own security breaches.he claimed that the leaked information included his and his wife employment history,their financial transactions,details of their trips to hong kong and china,details of the investigation and interrogation of lee,and purported results of polygraph tests,all of which were disclosed in the press and should have been part of personnel or classified records.lee requested damages of at least for each violation of the privacy act together with reasonable attorneys fees and costs.
discovery in the privacy act case began on july.lee made at least written discovery requests to the government defendants,but was largely rebuffed by assertions of law enforcement privilege and learned nothing identifying the source of the leaks.lee began deposing witnesses in october of,focusing on individuals identified by the government responses to interrogatories as those likely to have relevant information.he deposed six doe employees including former secretary of energy bill richardson,acting director of doe intelligence and counterintelligence notra trulock who had allegedly told minutes that he had reached out to the new york times,but retracted this statement in deposition,and edward curran,former director of the doe office of counterintelligence.these three individuals in particular had been identified as likely sources of the leaks,but were unable or unwilling to identify the leaker s.lee also deposed six doj and eight fbi officials,but was unable to locate the source of the leaks.
in august of lee issued subpoenas to appellants risen,gerth,drogin,hebert,and thomas seeking testimony and documents relating to the leaks,reasoning that his other discovery attempts had produced and would continue to produce no results.each of the journalists objected and moved to quash the subpoenas.on october,the district court denied the motions to quash and ordered the journalists to appear for the depositions and truthfully answer questions as to the identity of any officer or agent of defendants,or any of them,who provided information to them directly about wen ho lee,and as to the nature of the information so provided.joint appendix at discovery order.
the court based its conclusion on the governing precedent of zerilli smith,a case that laid out guidelines for balancing first amendment interests with a litigant need for information when a plaintiff seeks to subpoena a journalist in the context of a civil action zerilli set out two guidelines to determine when a plaintiff may compel a journalist to testify to the identity of his confidential sources.first,the information sought must go to the heart of the matter and not be merely marginally relevant.at.second,the plaintiff must have exhausted every reasonable alternative source of information so that journalists are not simply a default source of information for plaintiffs.id.the district court found that lee had met both of these guidelines to overcome the journalists qualified privilege.the court held that the information was clearly central to the case.it held that lee had exhausted all reasonable alternatives because the depositions showed a pattern of evasion and stonewalling and because lee used the five principal tactical devices given in the federal rules of civil procedure including analyzing responses to factual allegations in the answer to the complaint,requests for documents under,use of interrogatories under,requests for admissions under,and depositions under.b and b.the court also noted that lee actions were essentially the equivalent of a rule b deposition.
after the journalists had been deposed and refused to answer certain questions,the district court held them in contempt,refused to reconsider its holding on the privilege issue,and fined each per day,to be stayed pending appeal.at contempt order.these consolidated appeals followed.
ii.analysis 
in both the district court and before us,appellants rely on the theory that the first amendment and federal common law create a privilege that protects the right of a journalist to conceal confidential sources of information in the face of otherwise legitimate compulsion of testimony in federal courts not only the breadth of this claimed privilege,but its very existence has long been the subject of substantial controversy.in branzburg hayes,d,the supreme court considered a claim of such a privilege in the context of reporters refusal to reveal the identity of confidential sources in a grand jury investigation.each of the reporters in branzburg had been held in contempt for refusing to disclose the identity of informants or the nature of the information given him in confidence.the supreme court flatly rejected the existence of any such constitutional privilege,stating that the only testimonial privilege for unofficial witnesses that is rooted in the federal constitution is the fifth amendment privilege against compelled.id.at.the supreme court then expressly refused to create another by interpreting the first amendment to grant newsmen a testimonial privilege that other citizens do not enjoy.id.at.
while some would read the absolute language of the supreme court as foreclosing the possibility of any such privilege under any circumstance,our court,among others,has limited the applicability of the branzburg precedent to the circumstances considered by the court in is,the context of a criminal proceeding,or even more specifically,a grand jury subpoena.in carey hume,a libel case,we upheld a district court order compelling a journalist either on further deposition or in writing to identify the eyewitnesses referred to by him in a publication underlying the proceeding.id.at.however,we did so with at least the suggestion that some such privilege might survive branzburg in the context of a civil action.notably,we rejected the possibility that there either is,or should be,an absolute first amendment barrier to the compelled disclosure by a newsman of his confidential sources under any circumstances.id.emphasis added.a few years later,in zerilli,we actually held that despite branzburg there is a reporter privilege in civil actions,and that in the ordinary case the civil litigant interest in disclosure should yield to the journalist privilege.at.but zerilli,like carey,made it plain that any such privilege is qualified,not absolute.that brings us to the question whether the district court in this case complied with the guidelines of zerilli before holding appellants in contempt.
the parties dispute the proper standard of review.lee argues that both the discovery order and the contempt order should be reviewed for abuse of discretion because zerilli,at,and carey,at,applied this standard in reviewing determinations of journalist privilege.in zerilli,we upheld a refusal to compel testimony by journalists in a privacy act suit,while in carey this court upheld an order directing journalists to testify regarding sources in a libel suit.
the appellant journalists argue that we should review the order de novo.they base this argument principally on supreme court language in bose consumers union of united states,d,in which the supreme court analyzed the independent review duty of courts in certain first amendment cases drawn from new york times sullivan,d.more specifically,the bose court stated that in cases raising first amendment issues we have repeatedly held that an appellate court has an obligation to make an independent examination of the whole record in order to make sure that the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.bose,at.quoting new york times,at.we find the precedent of bose inapplicable for a number of reasons.first,this case does not involve a claim of forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.there is no suggestion that the court or any branch of government in any fashion attempted to interfere with or now attempts to interfere with the appellant journalists right to print or communicate anything they choose.both new york times and bose were libel cases in which a judgment of the court stood to punish or at least adversely affect the litigants based upon the exercise of their free expression.no such threat exists here.
furthermore,what we are reviewing is a discovery order,not the final judgment.in seattle times rhinehart,d,a case decided one month after bose,the supreme court itself made plain that no heightened first amendment scrutiny applied to discovery orders.id.at.as the supreme court stated in seattle times,t he trial court is in the best position to weigh fairly the competing needs and interests of parties affected by discovery.id.at.
further,in zerilli itself,we noted that the scope of review in this case is narrowly circumscribed.at.as we stated in zerilli,a motion to compel discovery is committed to the discretion of the trial court,and our function on appeal is solely to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in entering the challenged order.id.admittedly,the supreme court decided bose after zerilli.but bose did not announce a new doctrine indeed,the bose court made it plain that it was only clarifying the doctrine announced in new york times,a decision well zerilli.therefore,the precedent of zerilli stands unshaken,and binds us to the standard of review set forth therein.the doctrine of independent review is applicable in cases like bose and sullivan where the merits of the underlying case are at issue and free expression claims are involved.this case,however,involves underlying discovery orders like those challenged in seattle times,zerilli and carey.under the precedent of these cases we may review legal rulings of the trial court de novo but we will defer to the sound discretion of the trial court where the balancing of the relevant factors is involved.
appellants requested permission from the district court to appeal the discovery order directly but were not allowed to do so.they now appeal only the contempt order,but our review of that order logically includes a review of the underlying issue of whether the journalist privilege applies in this case.see united states philip morris usa,quoting yamaha motor,usa calhoun,d we review issues directly in the certified order as well as those decided earlier in the case but fairly included within the certified order.thus we first will review for abuse of discretion the discovery order holding that the journalist privilege does not protect appellants.we then will determine whether the district court abused its discretion in finding clear and convincing evidence that each reporter violated the discovery order.newspaper guild,local washington post.
a.the discovery order 
as we stated above,zerilli provides for a journalist qualified privilege in a civil action such as this one,where testimony of journalists is sought because government officials have been accused of illegally providing the journalists with private information.zerilli cites carey for the two guidelines determining when a court can compel a journalist to testify about a confidential source.first,the information sought must go to the heart of the matter.at quoting carey,at.second,the litigant must exhaust every reasonable alternative source of information.at quoting carey,at.when applying this analysis,however,the court must keep in mind that this privilege is not absolute.the supreme court has noted in the context of privilege in grand jury cases that it can not seriously entertain the notion that the first amendment protects a newsman agreement to conceal the criminal conduct of his source,or evidence thereof,on the theory that it is better to write about crime than to do something about it.branzburg,at,quoted in in re grand jury subpoena,judith miller.the same principle applies here the protections of the privacy act do not disappear when the illegally disclosed information is leaked to a journalist,no matter how newsworthy the government official may feel the information is.this does not leave journalists without protection.besides the qualified privilege described in zerilli,the usual requirements of relevance,need,and limited burdens on the subpoenaed person still apply.see.c.
applying the factors laid out in zerilli,we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in requiring the journalists to testify.first,it is clear that the information lee is seeking goes to the heart of his case.as in zerilli,the relevant information is the identity of the individuals who may have leaked information in violation of the privacy act.if he can not show the identities of the leakers,lee ability to show the other elements of the privacy act clai
