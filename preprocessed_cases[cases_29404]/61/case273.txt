plaintiffs william schechner and john lobertini were television news reporters at kpix tv,one of the two san francisco affiliates of cbs broadcasting,they were laid off after cbs issued a directive requiring each of its affiliates to reduce its annual budget by ten percent.schechner and lobertini were and years old,respectively,when they lost their jobs.they brought suit alleging that kpix discriminated against them on the basis of age and gender,in violation of california law.the district court granted kpix motion for summary judgment,dismissing all of plaintiffs claims.we affirm.we write to clarify that a plaintiff can make out a prima facie case of age discrimination using statistical evidence,even where that evidence does not account for the defendant legitimate reason for the discharge.
background 
this case demonstrates that reduced advertising revenues,whether caused by competition from online news outlets or our nation economic downturn,have taken a significant toll on local television news stations.schechner and lobertini were performing their jobs well when kpix laid them off.both are experienced reporters with distinguished careers that include numerous awards.kpix does not allege that performance issues played any role in the decision to lay off either schechner or lobertini.
in march,kpix was faced with the difficult task of reducing its annual budget by ten percent before the end of its first fiscal quarter.although the budget reduction mandate came from cbs headquarters in new york,the senior management at local stations decided how to implement the required cuts.ronald longinotti,the president and general manager of kpix tv and dan rosenheim,the vice president and new director at kpix tv were responsible for implementing the required cuts at kpix tv.
longinotti and rosenheim were responsible for hiring and firing decisions in the kpix news department in march.they had signed schechner to a new contract in,when schechner was years old,and to new contracts in and,when he was and years old,respectively.similarly,longinotti and rosenheim had signed lobertini to a new contract in october,when lobertini was years old.it is undisputed that kpix was under no obligation to sign schechner or lobertini to these contracts when it did so.longinotti and rosenheim also made the decision to lay off schechner,lobertini and three other members of the kpix news as part of a reduction in force necessitated by the budget cut.the other three employees that kpix laid off were tony russomanno,manny ramos,and rick quan 
kpix offered legitimate reasons for its layoff decisions.longinotti and rosenheim testified that they first decided that news anchors would not be subject to layoff because they are the face of kpix and longinotti and rosenheim wanted the reductions to be as invisible as possible to the viewing public.then,they decided that they would lay off general assignment reporters based on next date of contract expiration.rosenheim testified that they excluded specialty reporters,meaning those focusing on a specific beat,because they were the people that we were promoting and pushing the brand of the station.schechner and lobertini dispute whether kpix followed the model that longinotti and rosenheim described.
schechner and lobertini submitted reports by expert statistician william lepowsky.lepowsky reports compared the talent who were laid off with the entire pool of talent in the kpix tv news department.he concluded that those individuals laid off,as a group,are older than the group of those not laid off,and the disparity between the two groups is statistically significant.lepowsky found statistically significant age disparities using three different statistical methods and using a number of different groups of kpix tv talent.based on his statistical analyses,lepowsky opined that the age of kpix talent correlates closely with those selected for layoff.he acknowledged that his analyses assumed that all talent had an equal probability of being laid off,he did not exclude anchors from the pool of talent subject to lay off and did not account for contract expiration date.kpix statistical expert,bernard siskin,opined that lepowsky report failed to account for obvious,valid and important factors because it failed to account for the process that kpix said it followed.
the district court granted kpix motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs disparate treatment claim.the district court found that schechner and lobertini failed to make out a prima facie case of age discrimination.specifically,the district court concluded that where a plaintiff statistical analysis fails to preemptively account for a defendant legitimate reason for discharge,the statistical results can not show a stark pattern of discrimination.we disagree and write to clarify that a plaintiff who relies on statistical evidence to establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment bears a relatively low burden of proof.nonetheless,we affirm because plaintiffs have not carried their burden at step three of the mcdonnell douglas analysis.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction under and a.we have jurisdiction under.plaintiffs did not appeal the district court grant of summary judgment on their disparate impact age discrimination claim or their gender discrimination claim.we therefore do not address these claims.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.earl nielsen media research,cir.the court determines,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact,and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.id.as a general matter,the plaintiff in an employment discrimination action need produce very little evidence in order to overcome an employer motion for summary judgment.diaz eagle produce,cir quoting chuang of cal.davis,bd.of,cir.the requisite degree of proof necessary to establish a prima facie case on summary judgment is minimal and does not even need to rise to the level of a preponderance of the evidence.wallis simplot,cir.
because the district court concluded that plaintiffs failed to establish one of the elements of a prima facie case,it did not complete the remainder of the mcdonnell douglas analysis with respect to their disparate treatment claims.see diaz,at.we may affirm the district court on any grounds supported by the record.see townsend of alaska,cir.
iii.discussion 
schechner and lobertini allege that kpix discriminated against them on the basis of age,in violation of the california fair employment and housing act feha,when the station laid them off as part of its reduction in force.see cal.gov t code a.california applies the mcdonnell framework and other federal employment law principles when interpreting the feha.see guz bechtel,cal th,d,cal earl,at.
the district court held that schechner and lobertini failed to make a prima facie case of age discrimination under the familiar mcdonnell douglas burden shifting framework specifically,the district court concluded that under ninth circuit law,when a plaintiff relies on statistical evidence as the primary support for his prima facie case of age discrimination the mcdonnell douglas analysis collapses into a single step.the district court added that where a plaintiff statistical analysis fails to preemptively account for a defendant legitimate,reason for discharge,the statistical results can not show a stark pattern of discrimination unexplainable on grounds other than age.we clarify that a plaintiff statistical evidence need not necessarily account for an employer proffered reason for the adverse employment action to make a prima facie case of discrimination.
the employee in an age discrimination case makes a prima facie case of disparate treatment by demonstrating that he was at least forty years old,performing his job satisfactorily,discharged,and either replaced by substantially younger employees with equal or inferior qualifications or discharged under circumstances otherwise giving rise to an inference of discrimination.diaz,at quoting coleman quaker oats,cir.an in
