michael betzold,a freelance journalist,appeals a temporary restraining order tro and superseding preliminary injunction preventing him from disclosing information contained in the registration records of private security guards working at the site of an ongoing labor dispute.betzold received these records after requesting them from the ohio department of commerce odc,although the odc now takes the position that only law enforcement agencies are entitled to such information under ohio law.the district court,betzold argues,issued the tro and preliminary injunction in violation of rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.betzold also claims that the preliminary injunction should not have issued because it is a prior restraint of speech,thus violating his rights under the first amendment.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the judgment of the district court,dissolve the injunction against betzold,and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
this case arises from a labor dispute at ak steel corporation mansfield,ohio facility.ak steel locked out its unionized workforce in september of,and hired county security agency,csa,an ohio corporation,to provide security in the dispute.specific incidents of violence have included the placing of pipe bombs on ak steel premises,slashed tires,bricks thrown through windows,pigs heads placed on managers property,and security guards beaten as they escorted replacement workers to the facility.
under ohio law,all security guard companies operating in the state must obtain registration applications from their guard employees and promptly file these documents with the odc.ohio a,c.a mansfield ordinance in effect prior to september of required security guard employees to file copies of their registration applications with the mansfield police department.registration applications contain the security guards names,social security numbers,home addresses,home telephone numbers,dates of birth,fingerprints,and photographs.the district court declared the ordinance unconstitutional in january of,and permanently enjoined mansfield from enforcing it.among the district court grounds for finding the ordinance unconstitutional was that it violated the security guards constitutionally protected right of privacy.
following the district court decision on this issue,the local affiliate of the united steelworkers of america the union hired betzold and two others as freelance journalists to investigate and write a report that could form the basis for a published article about the companies providing security guards and hiring replacement workers in labor disputes.betzold then telephoned the odc,which is required by law to perform required background checks and maintain records on each licensed and registered security company and guard.ohio.
upon being informed by the odc that the applications of security guard companies doing business in ohio were public records available for public inspection,betzold submitted a written request to the odc on february,to examine any public information from the registration records of csa.the odc then faxed betzold documents that contained the names of the security guards,as well as their application dates,dates of hire,registration status,and whether they came from out of state.notably,these documents did not contain the security guards social security numbers,home addresses,telephone numbers,dates of birth,fingerprints,or photographs.
from the information he received,betzold determined that csa hired most of its guards from outside of ohio and that the odc had not expeditiously carried out the required background checks on the guards.betzold considered this information to be of interest to the public in mansfield and in ohio.he asserted,on the other hand,that he did not intend to publish the security guards names,because there would have been no news value in doing so.with the information he obtained from the odc,betzold began to prepare an article for publication that focused on the backgrounds of the security guards and the impact that the security companies have on the communities in which they operate.
on february,week after the odc honored betzold and ak steel the plaintiffs filed suit against the odc pursuant to,alleging that the divulging of information regarding the private security guards would violate the plaintiffs constitutional rights.they sought an order declaring that the security guards have a constitutionally protected privacy interest in preventing the public release of registration applications which contain their name,social security number,home address,home telephone number,date of birth,fingerprints and photograph,and enjoining the odc from allowing inspection of,or providing copies of,the registration applications containing such information with regard to any past or present employees of csa who have worked at ak steel mansfield facility.the plaintiffs also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction against the odc.both the complaint and motion for a preliminary injunction named the odc as the sole defendant.neither the summons,the complaint,the motion for a preliminary injunction,nor any supporting document mentioned betzold,and he was not served with process.
approximately one week later,on march,the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking a tro to prevent the odc and betzold from disclosing the information contained in the security guards registration applications.the plaintiffs asserted that they took this action because they had just learned that the odc had mistakenly released the information to betzold,and they suspected that betzold would turn it over to the union.they further feared that the union would use the information to harass and intimidate the security guards working at the ak steel facility during the lockout.
without notifying betzold,or requiring the plaintiffs to do so,the district court held an conference with counsel for the plaintiffs and the odc on the following day.the odc did not contest the issuance of the tro,and no effort was made to contact betzold during the proceeding.that afternoon,the district court issued the tro.it provided,among other things,that michael betzold and all other persons who have received the names and information concerning the security guards from the department of commerce are enjoined from disclosing such names and other information to anyone else.
betzold received a copy of the tro on march.because he personally did not want to continue when i had an injunction issued against me,betzold stopped working on the article.on march,the district court issued a notice of preliminary injunction hearing to be held on april,which was sent to counsel for the plaintiffs and the odc,but again not to betzold.two days later,betzold moved to intervene in the lawsuit that had spawned the tro.betzold states in his motion to intervene as of right that he was seeking to challenge the issuance of the tro on the grounds that any injunctive relief that issues or has issued against him is outside of the court authority under rule d of the federal rules of civil procedure,and this court does not have personal jurisdiction over him.in the alternative,betzold also argued that even if the court later decided that it did have jurisdiction over him,the odc release of the documents was lawful.although betzold motion to intervene states that he intended to contest any past or future injunctive relief against him on these grounds,the motion itself did not make these arguments.it was instead concerned with establishing the requirements for intervention under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.
on april,the district court signed an order granting betzold motion to intervene as of right.without notice to betzold and without holding a hearing,the district court also issued a stipulated preliminary injunction spi signed by counsel for the plaintiffs and the odc the following day.betzold motion to intervene was granted on april,the same day that the spi was entered of record.the spi enjoined the odc and betzold from releasing not only the names of the guards,but also any other information from the registration applications,noting that n either the department of commerce,nor its counsel,are willing to provide voluntary written assurance to plaintiffs that additional information will not be released before the court final determination of plaintiffs claim.the district court found that the odc disclosures to betzold,coupled with its failure to insure against further disclosures which might include the guards social security numbers,home addresses,home telephone numbers,dates of birth,fingerprints,and photographs,provided the plaintiffs with good reason to believe that unless the odc is enjoined by this court from releasing the registration applications,the guards private personal information may be released upon request.as a result of the tro and the spi,all efforts to publish betzold article were halted.the preliminary injunction hearing that had been scheduled for april,was never held.
on may,betzold filed a motion to dissolve the spi with respect to himself and any to the lawsuit or,in the alternative,to stay the injunction pending appeal.betzold supporting memorandum challenged the spi on jurisdictional,due process,rule,and first amendment grounds.when the district court failed to take action on his motion by may,the last day that he could timely appeal the spi,betzold filed a notice of appeal based upon the same grounds as his motion to dissolve the injunction.betzold also petitioned this court for a writ of mandamus,and moved for a stay of the spi pending a decision.
this court denied betzold mandamus petition and motion for a stay in june of,but,while retaining jurisdiction over betzold appeal,returned the case to the district court for a ruling on the motion to dissolve.on december,the district court denied the motion to dissolve,ruling on both betzold procedural and first amendment objections.betzold appeal then returned to this court.
ii.analysis 
the plaintiffs contend that betzold lacks standing to pursue this appeal because he suffered no injury in fact as a result of the spi.injury in fact is part of the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.as evidence of betzold alleged lack of injury,the plaintiffs note that betzold testified in his deposition that he did not intend to publish the security guards names because there would have been no news value in doing so.the spi,however,prohibits the disclosure of much more than the security guards names.as betzold points out in another part of his deposition testimony,t he injunction,in fact,says that i am prohibited from using the names and other information,which would include their dates of hire and their status.emphasis added.
the spi broad prohibition on the disclosure of other information in the materials betzold received from the odc results in a chilling effect on his ability to publish his news article,because betzold might be found in contempt of court if he were to do so.as a result,betzold has suffered an injury in fact sufficient to give him standing to appeal the tro and spi.see culinary workers union del papa,cir per curiam holding,in a case where a union sought a tro to enjoin the california attorney general from enforcing a statute that would prevent the union from distributing a handbill,that the union suffered an injury in fact,and therefore had standing,because of the chilling effect on its speech resulting from the attorney general letter threatening to enforce the statute against the union.
the tro expired days after it was issued on february,and was superseded by the issuance of the spi on april.thus,even if the tro was improperly granted,the issue is now moot.
procedural sufficiencya.personal jurisdiction 
betzold argues that because he was never served with process,the district court improperly subjected him to the terms of the spi.it is elementary that one is not bound by a judgment in personam resulting from litigation in which he is not designated as a party or to which he has not been made a party by service of process.zenith radio hazeltine research,d holding that an injunction was improper because the defendant had not been served with process.in order to object to a court exercise of personal jurisdiction,it is no longer necessary to enter a special appearance.instead,a defendant must attack the validity of service of process pursuant to rule b.haile henderson bank,cir.
betzold attempted in his motion to intervene to reserve his right to object to the district court exercise of personal jurisdiction.this attempt,however,was unsuccessful,because a motion to intervene is fundamentally incompatible with an objection to personal jurisdiction.united states oregon,cir holding that t he court below gained personal jurisdiction over the defendant when it intervened as of right city of santa clara kleppe,holding that b y voluntarily intervening in this action under rule,the defendant has submitted to the jurisdiction of this court.we therefore conclude that betzold has waived his objections to the district court exercise of personal jurisdiction over him.
rule d of the federal rules of civil procedure 
rule d provides that an injunction is binding only upon the parties to the action.d.betzold became a party when the district court granted his motion to intervene on april,the same day that the spi was issued.as a result,the district court issuance of the spi against betzold did not contravene rule d.
rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure 
pursuant to rule a,n o preliminary injunction shall be issued without notice to the adverse party.a.the type of notice required is not specified.in betzold motion to intervene,he objected to the district court issuance of any orders that might adversely affect his interests.betzold therefore demonstrated his actual notice of the fact that proceedings had been initiated that might result in a preliminary injunction against him.
but the notice requirement of rule a also implies a hearing in which the defendant is given a fair opportunity to oppose the application and to prepare for such opposition.williams mckeithen,cir internal quotation marks omitted.this court has held that rule contemplates that the issuance of a preliminary injunction shall be upon notice to the adverse party and after a hearing.carpenters dist.council cicci,cir emphasis added.
the plaintiffs argue that a hearing was not required because betzold did not contest the factual basis underlying the spi.a hearing on whether a preliminary injunction should issue,however,embodies the right to be heard on the controverted facts,as well as upon the law.id.emphasis added.in his motion to intervene,betzold gave the court notice of his intention to challenge the legal basis for the issuance of any future injunction against him.he was therefore entitled to a hearing before the spi issued.id.
the district court,in denying betzold motion to dissolve the injunction,held that his motion to intervene constituted a hearing prior to the issuance of the spi.we are of the opinion,however,that betzold motion to intervene can not be so construed.betzold motion to intervene quite properly focused on establishing the requirements for intervention.he reserved his right to argue the merits of any injunction in the future,and accordingly did not set forth such arguments as part of his motion to intervene.the district court could not fairly expect betzold to anticipate that his motion to intervene would constitute his only opportunity to be heard concerning the substantive basis for denying an injunction.his motion to intervene therefore did not constitute a hearing on the merits of the spi.the district court thus failed to comply with rule a when it issued the spi before betzold had an opportunity to be heard.
betzold,however,did eventually have a hearing.in his motion to dissolve the spi,betzold did not limit himself to arguing that the spi was procedurally deficient.instead,he set forth substantive arguments on the merits of the injunction,contending that it should not have issued because the odc lawfully disclosed to him the registration materials that he had received,and because the injunction was a prior restraint that violated his fi
