in late,renatta frazier,an police officer with the springfield police department,became the subject of an internal affairs investigation when she was accused of failing to prevent a rape while on duty.the incident occurred on october,when frazier allegedly failed to respond to a dispatch call.she left the department in november on a medical leave and apparently never returned due to the allegations that surrounded her conduct that day.that same year,she approached the black guardians,a group that advocates for the interests of police officers,who directed her to carl madison,an and president of the local national association for the advancement of colored people naacp chapter in springfield,illinois the city,for assistance in addressing the allegations.madison recommended legal counsel to frazier and discussed the investigation of frazier job performance with city representatives.after frequent discussions,frazier and madison disagreed as to the appropriate course of action regarding the dispute and parted ways.frazier was eventually cleared of the allegations surrounding the dispatch call and subsequently joined a lawsuit against the city that claimed racial discrimination in its hiring practices.see frazier harris,d.the parties reached a financial settlement in.
on march,an article was published in a city newspaper,the state journal register,stating that madison and the naacp dropped frazier case due to her lack of cooperation.on march,the black guardians sent madison and the naacp a letter,indicating that they no longer needed the naacp assistance in the discrimination cases including frazier pending against the city.
in,frazier began to write about her experiences with the department.these writings evolved into a book titled the enemy in blue the renatta frazier story the book,which was by frazier son,kourtney mitchell,and published in by renatta heart,an illinois corporation.the prologue describes the story as one woman fight against the enemy of racial and gender discrimination in the system of a police department.the beginning chapters of the book describe frazier background,including her childhood,family,and life as a probationary officer with the department.
relevant to this appeal,chapter seven,titled almost buried alive,relates the events surrounding october,frazier perplexity at the accusations that swirled around her conduct on that day,and the aftermath,including her medical and financial difficulties.the end of the chapter,also known as the fantasy sequence,begins with the words d uring this time of turmoil in my life,one day in my imagination i fantasized the following scenario and describes frazier imaginary interaction with various people.she imagined that she was lying in the streets of springfield,bleeding 
as i looked up,i thought i saw a lot of people standing in the distance.i was sure i had been beaten so badly,i felt dizzy and my vision was blurred.i began to yell as loudly as i could help help i thought maybe they could hear me.perhaps the pain had limited my ability to yell.even so,i began to drag my body with all the strength that remained.my faint yell for help seemed to go undetected.i decided to approach the man closest to me.he was standing with his back to me,and he appeared to have his arms folded across his chest.mister,i said,can you help me please,i been hurt and they left me for dead.as the man turned around to reveal his face,i was astonished and confused to see that he was black.he did say anything.he just shook his head in a motion.he turned his head and began to walk away.i approached other people one by people,leaders in the community,political figures,pastors,preachers,business owners.all black,and all too selfish,too afraid,and too complacent to practice what they preach.god forbid that they risk their comfortable homes to help me.so once again i was left for dead.
i n my mind,this imaginary experience was equivalent to a physical attack,a brutal beating.as i shared this imaginary account with my husband he made a profound statement that this was a modern day lynching.
chapter eight,entitled integrity is who you are when no one looking,describes how frazier contacted madison,the naacp,and the black guardians,in late,for insight on how to defend herself against the city accusations 
in the weeks that followed,i began to feel that the president of the local naacp branch was not working in my best interest.i spoke to him daily over the phone,and his conversation seemed more centered around my letting this matter go than fighting for the truth.let forget it,and sweep it under the rug.i repeated,man,whose side are you on,mine or theirs i trying to get you back to work and put this behind you,he said.i replied,i know damn well they are all wrong and they are trying to destroy my life.he said,renatta,they willing to make this go away,but i need your cooperation.i replied,oh,yeah tell them it not going away and neither am i.as a matter of fact,tell them that when they start talking dollars,then we can talk.
later in chapter eight,frazier writes that she met with a naacp lawyer to discuss a possible lawsuit against the city.after the meeting frazier decided not to hire the lawyer 
it was then that i made my decision to sever my ties with the local naacp branch.i spoke with carl madison on the phone and said,to him,i do not believe you are acting in my best interest.i am notifying you at this time that i will no longer consult with you concerning my case.later,i read and heard that madison had decided to drop me.i could believe what i was reading and hearing.the guardians were outraged.we knew as well as he did that it did happen like that at all.the severing of the ties had been done long before he made this statement.maybe he planned to run for some political office or was trying to obtain a politically connected employment opportunity.whatever the reason,my respect for him diminished to nothing.
following this alleged phone call to madison,frazier had many other brushes or encounters with him,mostly from a distance.however close or far away the encounters may have been,i could bring myself to speak to him or even recognize his presence.real men do lie.i thought,real men do sell out.
in,madison,now a citizen of ohio,filed this diversity action against frazier,mitchell and renatta heart,collectively the defendants,complaining that the fantasy section and statements in chapter eight of the book amounted to libel and portrayed him in a false light.defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint or alternatively,for summary judgment.after reviewing the facts on the record such as the respective parties affidavits and frazier deposition testimony,the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants,finding that the fantasy section was fictional and capable of innocent construction,the descriptions of the events in chapter eight were judgmental opinions,and the phrase real men do lie,in the context in which it was used,was per se defamatory,but not actionable because madison failed to establish that the defendants acted with actual malice.madison filed this timely appeal.
madison argues that the district court erred in finding that the imaginary black man in the fantasy sequence was capable of innocent construction statements in chapter eight accuse madison of selling out and lying for purely selfish reasons to run for some sort of political office or was trying to obtain a politically connected employment opportunity,and that these statements have injured his reputation within the community the statement that madison was a liar was not an opinion,but a factual statement concerning madison and defamatory statements about madison,who is a public figure,were made with actual malice,where defendants failed to review any source material while writing the book,and frazier purported recollection of the events was inaccurate.
we review de novo the district court decision to grant summary judgment,construing all the facts and inferences in favor of madison.see republic tobacco north atlantic trading,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with any affidavits,show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.the initial burden is on the moving party to demonstrate that there is no material question of fact with respect to an essential element of the party case.cody harris,cir.if the moving party meets this burden,the party must submit evidence that there is a genuine issue for trial.e ptasznik joseph,cir.the existence of merely a scintilla of evidence in support of the party position is insufficient there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the party.id.we apply the substantive law of illinois,the state in which this diversity case was filed.see global relief,new york times,cir.
defamation is the publication of any statement that tends to cause such harm to the reputation of another that it lowers that person in the eyes of the community or deters third persons from associating with him.seith chicago,d,quoting bryson news america publications.to prove a defamation claim,the evidence must show that a defendant made a false statement concerning the plaintiff,that there was an unprivileged publication of the defamatory statement to a third party by the defendant,and that the plaintiff suffered damages as a result.seith,at.some statements are considered defamatory per se because they are so obviously and materially harmful to a plaintiff that his injury may be presumed and he does not need to prove actual damages to recover,bryson,at,while other statements are considered defamatory per quod,which requires the plaintiff to allege both extrinsic facts to establish that the statement is defamatory and special damages with particularity.myers levy,d.madison relies on the theory of defamation per se.
illinois recognizes five categories of statements which are considered actionable per se two are pertinent to this case those imputing an inability to perform or want of integrity in the discharge of one duties of office or employment and those that prejudice a party,or impute lack of ability,in his or her trade,profession or business.bryson,at.although a statement may fit into one of these categories,this fact,standing alone,has no bearing on whether the alleged defamatory statement is actionable,hopewell vitullo,d,because certain factors may render defamatory statements nonactionable as a matter of law.for example,if a defendant statements are capable of an innocent,nondefamatory construction,a plaintiff can not maintain an action for defamation per se.see bryson,at.further,the first amendment affords protection from liability to a speaker expressing an opinion that does not misstate actual facts.see milkovich lorain journal,d moriarty greene,d.madison believes that various statements made in the book impute a want of integrity on his part,that as the president of the local naacp chapter,he is involved with many issues of racial equality within the city businesses and public offices,and that the statements prejudiced his reputation as a hard working advocate for the community.
fantasy sequence 
madison argues that the district court erred in finding that the fantasy sequence was subject to innocent construction because the sequence directly precedes the next chapter which names madison,and therefore sets the stage for the discussion of madison relationship with frazier and madison is the only in the book portrayed in an unfavorable light.defendants argue that the sequence was clearly identified as fantasy,madison was never identified by name in the fantasy sequence,and frazier presented the sequence as fiction from the outset.
the innocent construction rule in illinois requires a court to consider the statement in context and give the words of the statement,and any implications arising from them,their natural and obvious meaning.solaia,llc speciality publ g.a statement that may innocently or reasonably be construed as referring to a person other than the plaintiff can not be actionable per se.salamone hollinger int l,d.while this rule favors a defendant because a tougher standard is warranted where damages are presumed,it does not require courts to strain to find an unnatural innocent meaning for a statement when a defamatory meaning is far more reasonable.tuite corbitt.our court,as well as illinois courts,have said that w hether a statement is reasonably capable of an innocent construction is a question of law for the court to decide.knafel chicago,cir kolegas heftel broad.
it is reasonable to read the statements made in the fantasy sequence and not call into question madison integrity or his reputation.in the fantasy,frazier is beaten and left to die,and she approached other people for help,who were all black,and all too selfish,too afraid,and too complacent to practice what they preach.the imaginary scenario fails to identify madison,or anyone else,by name,and therefore is very capable of innocent construction.
furthermore,statements that can not reasonably be interpreted as stating actual facts are protected under the first amendment.these statements or opinions can not give rise to a cause of action for defamation in the interest of provid ing assurance that public debate will not suffer for lack of imaginative expression or the rhetorical hyperbole which has traditionally added much to the discourse of our nation.milkovich,at,d see lifton bd.of educ.of the city of chicago,cir holding that illinois law requires that an allegedly defamatory statement must contain an objectively verifiable factual assertion pease int l union of operating engineers local,et,d,words that are mere name calling or found to be rhetorical hyperbole or employed only in a loose,figurative sense have been deemed nonactionable.the illinois supreme court considers several nonexclusive factors in determining whether a statement constitutes an opinion or factual assertion whether the statement has a precise and readily understood meaning whether the statement is verifiable and whether the statement literary or social context signals that it has factual content.maki constr.chicago reg l council of carpenters,d,citing tuite,at.whether a statement is an opinion or fact is a question of law.moriarty,at.
the fantasy sequence purports to be a symbolic representation of frazier frustration and contempt for the events that had consumed her life over the previous years.illinois law is clear that allegedly defamatory words are to be interpreted as they appear to be used and according to the idea they were intended to convey to the reasonable reader.bryson,at.clearly the statements convey to the reasonable reader that frazier imagined she had been beaten and needed someone to come to her assistance a reasonable reader would perceive that the imaginary event was a reference to her she believed she was being persecuted because of her race and had no one to turn to for help.no reasonable reader would construe frazier fantasy to have specific factual content.frazier did not claim to have been actually beaten and left for dead.the literary context and setting in which the fantasy sequence was published leads easily to the conclusion that the sequence was a dream without factual support.
we are cognizant that prefatory language does not control whether statements labeled as fiction may be actionable,republic tobacco,at bryson,at however even the most careless reader must perceive that this fantasy was no more than rhetorical hyperbole.we find that the fantasy sequence can not be actionable per se.
chapter eight 
next,madison argues that the district court erred in finding that the statements made in chapter eight were not actionable assertions of fact and were opinions.madison points to the statements such as who side are you on,mine or theirs,and m aybe he planned to run for some sort of political office or was trying to obtain a politically connected employment opportunity,and argues that these statements are factual assertions that he was acting on behalf of interests that did not include frazier,and thus could not be opinions.we disagree,and find these statements to be vague and unprovable allegations which do not give rise to a defamation claim.see hopewell,at w e note that in one sense all opinions imply facts however the question of whether a statement is actionable is one of degree t he vaguer and more generalized the opinion the more likely the opinion is as a matter of law.clearly,frazier was frustrated that she had parted ways with madison,however,as the district court noted,she wondered about his motives she did not state that madison was in fact motivated by political concerns.the very word maybe implicates subjective judgment.frazier speculations fail to amount to verifiable assertions of fact,lacking precise and readily understood meaning.see wilkow forbes,cir applying illinois law and finding that i f it is plain that the speaker is expressing a subjective view,an interpretation,a theory,conjecture,or surmise,rather than claiming to be in possession of objectively verifiable facts,the statement is not actionable.quoting haynes alfred knopf,cir.
real men do lie 
we reach the last statements of the book that madison believes to be defamatory.he contends that the statement r eal men do lie real men do sell out refers to madison,and it imputes that he was acting on behalf of the city instead of frazier he was incapable of performing his role at the naacp with competence and integrity and the statements lowered him in the eyes of the community.frazier concedes that she was referring to madison and all men in general when she made the statement.
in illinois,to succeed under the relevant categories of defamation per se in this case,a plaintiff must have been accused of lacking ability in his trade or doing something bad in the course of carrying out his job.cody,at clarage kuzma,d.we have found that statements deemed to be defamatory per se in illinois under these categories have been related to job performance,as opposed to attacks related to personal integrity and character.cody,at clarage,at finding accusations of lying to government officials were defamatory per se,where the plaintiff was not accused of lying to family and friends,but rather to government officials with whom it was his job to communicate honestly heying simonaitis,d,statements made by doctors regarding personality conflicts between the plaintiff nurse and her fellow employees did not impugn her ability as a nurse.however,sometimes personal integrity is so intertwined with job skills,that an attack upon it could constitute defamation per se.see kumaran brotman,d,holding that a newspaper article accusing a teacher of filing scam lawsuits was defamatory per se because part of a teacher job is to set a good example and serve as a role model for her students.calling madison a liar and a to the community,in the context of an ongoing public battle with the city and its discrimination policies,imputes a lack of integrity in his duties as naacp president,specifically his involvement with issues of racial equality within the city businesses and public offices.
so to determine whether the statement can be reasonably interpreted as stating actual facts protected under the first amendment,we look at whether the statement has a precise and readily understood meaning whether the statement is objectively verifiable as true or false and whether the statement literary,social,or public context signals that it has factual content.bryson,at.
in this context,referring to someone as one who lies has a clearly precise meaning to create a false or misleading impression or to make an untrue statement with intent to deceive.collegiate dictionary ed online at.in addition,referring to someone as a sell out in this context refers to one who betrays one cause or associates especially for personal gain.id.frazier statements were made within the context of accusing madison of failing to tell the truth about who dropped whom first,and the overall literary context of the book represents a professional and personal struggle about false allegations of misconduct as a police officer,as told through the eyes of the woman who experienced the accusations first hand.the book accusations and accounts were directed at the department and its allegedly discriminatory hiring practices,frazier involvement in that controversy,and her belief that madison and the naacp failed to come to her assistance.
the question,however,is whether these statements are objectively verifiable as true or false.a false assertion of a fact can be defamatory even when couched within an apparent opinion or rhetorical hyperbole.solaia,at dubinsky united airlines master executive council,d,finding that calling someone a crook was not an actionable statement because it was not made in any specific factual context,and o ne can not rely on an assumption that those who heard the statement were completely apprised of all the developments in the controversy so as to create a definitive factual context for the use of the word crook see also milkovich,at,d finding that the phrase i n my opinion,plaintiff is a liar may still imply a false assertion of fact if the facts on which the speaker bases his opinion are either incorrect or incomplete,or if his assessment of them is erroneous.
we find that the phrase sell out is incapable of being verified as a statement of fact it is merely an opinion that madison betrayed his race.free speech is not restricted to compliments m embers of a free society must be able to express candid opinions and make personal judgments.and those opinions and judgments may be harsh or still not subject the speaker or writer to civil liability.van duyn smith,d,citing sloan hatton,d.
at first blush,the statement at issue,real men do lie seems to be nothing more than a difference of opinion.frazier believes madison lied when he said he cut off ties with her first madison believes he did not lie in making this statement.however,we must determine whether the context behind the phrase real men do lie makes the statement defamatory per se.in piersall sportsvision of chicago,the plaintiff,a sports announcer,accused the defendant of calling him a liar.the court held that the general statement that someone is a liar without being put in a context of specific facts,is merely opinion.d.the court reasoned that in order to determine whether a statement is fact or opinion,a court must evaluate the totality of the circumstances and should consider whether the statement is capable of objective verification as true or false.id.here,the context of the statement was stated that she called madison weeks before the article was published to tell him that she was no longer interested in his help in the department investigation against her.insinuating that madison lied referred to madison actions or omissions in response to the events that had taken place,in particular,the conversation with frazier that ended the relationship.frazier was making the case that she was in possession of objectively verifiable she called madison therefore his assertions were false.
we are willing to accept the fact that frazier referred to madison as a liar,and even to accept that under this specific context,the statement was defamatory per se.but even assuming the same,madison can not prevail.madison concedes that he is a public figure,therefore he can not maintain a suit for defamation unless he can prove that the defendants acted with actual malice.a public figure plaintiff may hold a speaker liable for the damage to reputation caused by publication of defamatory statements only if he establishes actual malice,that is,he must show that the utterance was false,and it was made with knowledge of its falsity or in reckless disregard of whether it was false or true.hustler magazine falwell,d piersall,at.reckless disregard is not measured by whether a reasonably prudent man would have published,or would have investigated before publishing.amant thompson,d costello capital cities communications.this inquiry is a subjective must be sufficient evidence to permit the conclusion that the defendant published defamatory statements despite a high degree of awareness of probable falsity or entertaining serious doubts as to its truth.amant,at,d chicago dist.counsel of carpenters pensio
