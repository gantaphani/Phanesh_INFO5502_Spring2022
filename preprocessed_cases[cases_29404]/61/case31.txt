amended opinion 
the oenologist creed teaches that we should drink no wine before its time.much the same principle applies to summary judgment it is a deliciously helpful device if properly timed,but one that can leave a sour taste if brought to bear on an insufficiently fermented record.
this appeal,which follows on the heels of a substantial verdict in a defamation suit,is a paradigmatic example of the point.the briefs before us raise a plethora of first amendment issues.at the threshold,however,lies the preliminary question on which the appeal ultimately hinges did the district court,ruling on a pretrial motion,appropriately determine that the plaintiff,a maryland assistant state attorney,was a private figure and not a public official for purposes concluding,as we do,that the court ruling was premature,we answer that question in the negative.accordingly,we vacate the judgment below and remand for a new trial.
i.the legal landscape 
in order to put this appeal into perspective,we think it is useful to begin by rehearsing a salient aspect of the substantive law of defamation the public figure dichotomy.
it is apodictic that the first amendment prohibits a public official from recovering damages for a defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he proves that the statement was made with actual malice that is,with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.new york times sullivan,d.the new york times rule extends not only to public officials but also to public figures,whether or.see gertz robert welch,d.
the distinction between public figures and public officials,on the one hand,and purely private figures,on the other hand,has potentially profound consequences in a defamation case.generally speaking,the status that the plaintiff occupies along the continuum will determine what he must prove in order to recover damages.leaving to one side the imposition of liability without fault as to which certain restrictions pertain,states may shape their own standards of liability when a defamation action involves a plaintiff.see id.at.under massachusetts law,for example,that standard is negligence.see stone essex county newspapers.that is far less demanding,from the plaintiff standpoint,than the actual malice standard that obtains when the plaintiff is a public official or public figure.see new york times,at.a plaintiff status,therefore,shapes the course of any defamation litigation.if he is a public official or public figure,he must prove actual malice with convincing clarity.id.at.if,however,he is a purely private figure,it suffices at least in massachusetts to prove negligence by a preponderance of evidence.see stone,at.
in defamation cases,status has the same legal ramifications as the two terms are not synonymous.see generally kassel gannett,cir.public officials,as the term implies,are those who hold particular kinds of public office.see,time,pape,d deputy chief of detectives new york times,at.elected city commissioner.public figures may or may not be public officials they are persons who have assumed roles of especial prominence in the affairs of society.gertz,at.commonly,those classified as public figures have thrust themselves to the forefront of particular public controversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved.id.for present purposes,we need not dwell either on the distinction between public officials and public figures or on the exact dimensions of status the defendants do not contend that the plaintiff is a public a public official.
the classification eludes precise definition.see kassel,at.not every public employee is a public official for purposes.see hutchinson proxmire,d.to the contrary,only public employees with substantial responsibility for or control over the conduct of governmental affairs should be deemed public officials for purposes.rosenblatt baer,d.moving from the general to the particular is,however,a daunting task it is difficult to tell how far down into the lower ranks of government employees the designation extends.new york times,at.
ii.facts and proceedings below 
in its january,issue,the boston phoenix,a weekly newspaper,published a special report authored by kristen lombardi.written as an exercise in investigative journalism,the piece ran for nine pages under the title children at risk.its central thesis bemoaned what the reporter had determined to be an apparent trend in family courts that when a mother accuses a father of child abuse in a child custody dispute,those courts,to handle such charges,often award full custody to the father.the article reviewed three scientific studies of outcomes and recounted the personal experiences of four families enmeshed in the system.
one such case history chronicled a custody clash between sarah fitzpatrick and marc mandel who was,at the time,an assistant state attorney in maryland.that case history appeared under the subheading losing custody to a child molester.the story recounted the sordid battle waged by the couple over custody of their two minor children,and pseudonymously referred to by lombardi as amy and james,and dwelt in some detail on fitzpatrick allegation that mandel was a child molester.for example,it reported fitzpatrick suspicions about mandel relationship with and gave prominent play to a baltimore county department of social services dss investigation into allegations that mandel had abused his daughter from a previous marriage.in that regard,the article related that a report conducted for the baltimore county dss determined that mandel had assaulted.the article went on to state that despite the claims of abuse,a maryland family court judge awarded mandel full custody of and and denied fitzpatrick any visitation rights,labeling her a pathological liar,or a purposeful liar,or both.
after the phoenix published the article in print and on the internet,mandel began receiving negative work evaluations.he later left his post and became in the private practice of law.
invoking diversity jurisdiction,see a,mandel filed suit for defamation against,inter alia,the phoenix,its various corporate personas,two of its editorial gurus peter kadzis and susan,and lombardi collectively,the defendants in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.shortly after answering the complaint,the defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings or,in the alternative,summary judgment.mandel for partial summary judgment.the district court denied both motions,ordered discovery to be completed within three months,and offered to entertain renewed motions at that juncture.
the parties completed discovery and for summary judgment.following a hearing,the court denied the defendants motion and granted mandel motion for partial summary judgment on the issue.mandel boston phoenix,d.reasoning that mandel was only a prosecutor who did ordinary legal work,id.at,did not interact with the press,and did not assume a risk of diminished privacy through his employment,the court concluded that he was not a public official within the purview of the libel laws,see id.at.
the litigation morphed into a jury trial.once mandel had presented his case in chief,the defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law.see.a.the court granted that motion in part,concluding that mandel had not adequately established actual malice at the close of all the evidence,the defendants moved again for judgment as a matter of law.see id.the court denied that motion.
the court submitted the case to the jury,which found for mandel and awarded him in damages.as indicated on a special verdict form,it found two statements in the article actionable i the subheading losing custody to a child molester and ii the comment that a july report conducted for the baltimore county dss determined that mandel had assaulted his daughter from an earlier marriage.the report states that mandel daughter accused him of seven incidents of fondling 
in the aftermath of the trial,the defendants moved to alter or amend the judgment,see.e,on the ground that evidence adduced at trial and not previously available demonstrated beyond hope of contradiction that mandel was a public official within the purview of the libel laws.the defendants also moved for judgment as a matter of law,see.b,claiming that mandel evidence was insufficient to establish i the falsity of the two statements,ii negligence in their publication,or iii any incremental harm.the court denied both motions.this timeous appeal followed.
iii.analysis 
at the epicenter of this appeal lies the district court status determination.we start there finding reversible error in the timing of that determination,we abjure review of the vast majority of the other issues raised by the defendants.the lone exception is the district court refusal to grant the motion for judgment as a matter of law.that decision still must be scrutinized after all,if mandel did not present sufficient evidence of the elements of a defamation claim,the case would be over as he certainly could not meet the heightened burdens associated with status.
a.the status determination.
typically,courts approach the analysis as if it were a stool,taking into account i the extent to which the inherent attributes of a position define it as one of influence over issues of public importance ii the position special access to the media as a means of and iii the risk of diminished privacy assumed upon taking the position.see kassel,at.here,however,we focus on a procedural district court pretrial determination that the record was sufficiently developed to permit it to decide whether mandel was public official.
given the significance of status determinations in litigation,it is often perfectly reasonable to attempt to decide whether a plaintiff is a public official or public figure during pretrial proceedings.see,nicholson promotors on listings,see also miller transam.press,cir advising that the question of status be answered as soon as possible.but although status determinations normally are grist for the court not the jury mill,pendleton city of haverhill,cir,such questions are inescapably,see id.at describing conclusion as factbound penobscot indian nation key bank,cir acknowledging that a finding of public figure status necessitates a detailed determination.
in other words,a plaintiff status,though calling for a legal determination,is heavily dependent on the underlying factual record.consequently,there are cases in which it may not be possible to resolve the issue until trial.miller,at pendleton,at,upholding district court ruling,made at the conclusion of the evidence,that the plaintiff was a public figure.
it is common ground that appellate review of an order granting summary judgment is confined to the record before the district court at the time it made the challenged ruling.see voutour vitale,cir per curiam.such review is de novo and engenders consideration of the record as then constituted and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most hospitable to the summary judgment loser.houlton citizens coal.town of houlton,cir.when the facts,so marshalled,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law,summary judgment is generally thought to be appropriate.c see depoutot raffaelly,cir.the presence of for summary judgment neither dilutes nor distorts this standard of review.see alliance of auto.mfrs.gwadosky,cir blackie maine,cir.
as noted above,summary judgment requires that the moving party exhibit an entitlement to a judgment as a matter of law.see.c.that requirement is not a hollow one.summary judgment should be granted only where further inquiry into the facts is not desirable to clarify the application of the law.stevens howard johnson,cir.in the case at bar,the factual record,at the summary judgment stage,was too uncertain to warrant a legal conclusion either way about mandel status.we explain briefly.
to begin,the factual record was disturbingly thin.mandel summary judgment motion relied almost exclusively on facts derived from three sources his own affidavit,his deposition testimony,and the deposition testimony of his supervisor,kim detrick.these materials indicated that,as an assistant state attorney,mandel received only a modest salary,had little supervisory authority,neither created nor directed policy,and made no decisions that significantly affected government operations.he prosecuted only minor crimes in maryland court and participated in only one jury trial assisting the lead attorney.as a matter of practice,he directed all press inquiries to a supervisor.
the defendants also made some modest contributions to the summary judgment record.they culled a few additional facts from the mandel and detrick depositions and supplemented them with excerpts from the deposition of another supervisor sue schenning,a letter from a vehicular accident victim whose case mandel had handled,and mandel employment file.this proffer painted a different,though not altogether inconsistent,picture as an assistant state attorney,mandel handled crimes with penalties of imprisonment,sexual offenses,and violations of protective orders.he conducted pray jury trials at the state circuit court level,a murder trial in which he gave the opening statement and conducted some direct examination,nolle prossed a vehicular accident case,and represented to a court that a witness could not testify even though she was present.he interviewed victims of crimes,discussed cases with other attorneys,and had access to the media.his employment file indicated that he was a prosecutor for the state of maryland and a sworn law enforcement officer or person whose principal responsibilities are unique to the criminal justice system.
this factual record,on which the district court based its status determination,contains several gaps,and what facts there are give rise to conflicting inferences.perhaps most notably,neither side seems to have focused on the question of whether mandel experience as an assistant state attorney was a reflection of the attributes inherent in the position or,alternatively,whether he simply was given less responsibility because of his particular proclivities.this is a crucial distinction in the calculus.see kassel,at recognizing that t he inherent attributes of the position,not the occurrence of random events,must signify the line of demarcation between and status.moreover,the record,as it stood,cried out for a special sort of judgment call which job,given in anticipation of litigation,or those contained in his employment accurately depicted the inherent attributes of the position.that judgment call could not be made under the constraints of rule.see anderson liberty lobby,d explaining that c redibility determinations,the weighing of the evidence,and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are not functions to be performed by a judge on summary judgment.at trial,however,the district court,as the arbiter of mandel status,could have resolved those uncertainties.pendleton,at,miller,at.
finally,better evidence was readily obtainable.there was a high likelihood that a trial or,perhaps,even more pointed discovery would lead to materially improved development of the record and,thus,clarify the application of the law to the facts.indeed,at the motion hearing mandel counsel candidly admitted that the question was so that the status determination could only be made after the court and the jury had all the evidence.
the testimony actually adduced at trial confirms the accuracy of this prediction.for instance,mandel testified that his reputation was important to him professionally because he was dealing with the public on a daily basis prosecuting criminal cases.similarly,schenning offered insights not apparent from her deposition,especially her trial testimony that assistant state attorneys are the face of the state attorney,with tremendous power,even at a very early point in their career,making decisions whether to nolle prosse a case,dismiss a case,go forward with a case,and what kind of sentence to ask for.the fact that this testimony came to light even though the status determination had been made prior to trial is telling with the issue on the table,it seems evident that even greater clarification of a
