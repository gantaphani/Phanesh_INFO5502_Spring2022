in its petition for review,the ucc contends that the order violates because it is contrary to the plain language of and that the commission erred in relying upon the definition of broadcasting from its subscription video decision on the ground that congress was assuming a different definition of broadcasting when it enacted in.the ucc further contends that the fcc has inadequately explained its departure from agency precedent that prohibited broadcasting of advertisements by noncommercial public television stations and restricted the transmission of subscription television by those stations.
the court review of the commission order is confined to determining whether it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.our review is thus deferential,presuming the validity of the commission action,and the court must affirm unless the commission failed to consider relevant factors or made a clear error in judgment.davis latschar,see,citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d,abrogated on other grounds by califano sanders,d.for challenges to the commission construction of the statute it administers,the court review is governed by the familiar framework in chevron,natural res.def.council,d.under the first step of the analysis the court must determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.id.at.at,if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.at footnote omitted.for this purpose the court must first exhaust the traditional tools of statutory construction,including legislative history and statutory structure.bell atl.fcc,quotations omitted.under the second step of the analysis,if congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue,the court must decide whether the agency action is a permissible construction of the statute,to which the court must defer.chevron,at.at.the court review of the commission interpretation of its own regulations,in turn,is more deferential,giving controlling weight to the commission interpretation unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.high plains wireless,fcc,quotation omitted see thomas jefferson shalala,d.
