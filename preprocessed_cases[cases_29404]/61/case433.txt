discussion

the statute goes on to define special damages as those damages suffered in respect to plaintiff property,business,trade,profession or occupation including monies expended as a result of the alleged libel,subd.b and general damages as those for loss or reputation,shame,mortification and hurt feelings,subd.a.
prior to this time,common law provided that a plaintiff could recover general damages without proving actual injuries.kapellas kofman cal d.
in,section was enacted to include both visual and sound radio broadcasting within the definitions of radio,radio broadcast and broadcast as used in the division of the civil code containing section.
petitioners contend the trial court erred in applying section to claims arising from or relating to the show because the statute is only meant to apply to media which are engaged in the business of immediate dissemination of news.we examine the words of the statute,the case law,and the facts presented by the parties in determining whether the trial court ruling was correct in holding that petitioners were subject to the retraction requirements of section.
statutory interpretation 
we first examine the language of the statutes.real parties argue that the plain language of sections and does not distinguish between types of the content in visual and sound radio broadcasting,and thus the retraction requirement applies to all television shows whether or not they are engaged in the immediate dissemination of news.
in interpreting a statute,the objective is to ascertain the legislature intent and thereby effectuate the purpose of the statute.olson automobile club of southern california cal th,d,smith superior court cal th,d.to ascertain that intent,we begin with the statutory language,giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning.nolan city of anaheim cal th,d.if there is no ambiguity,then we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.day city of fontana cal th,d,see also smith superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
if,however,the statutory terms are ambiguous,then we may resort to extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.citation.in such circumstances,we select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.day city of fontana,supra,cal th at,d.
we do not construe a statute in isolation,but rather construe in context with reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is part so that the whole scheme may be harmonized and still be effective.landrum superior court cal d.we presume that when enacting a statute,the legislature was aware of existing laws and judicial decisions in effect at the time and intended to maintain a consistent body of rules.stone street capital,llc california state lottery com.th,d.
given this framework,the plain language of section only applies to publications of a libel in a newspaper or of a slander by radio broadcasts.section does not qualify what type of newspaper or radio broadcast,nor does it mention the content of a particular newspaper or broadcast.similarly,section does not qualify the type of visual or sound broadcast which comes under its purview.thus,real parties contend,there is no ambiguity in the section,and there is no necessity to look at extrinsic sources such as legislative history.
we note that reviewing courts may examine the legislative history of an unambiguous statute if it supports or bolsters their interpretation of that statute.in re gilbert th,d.in any event,we find nothing in the legislative history of section to alter our interpretation of its language.the first version of section,enacted in,included only newspapers.the amendment added radio broadcasts to the statute reach.nothing in the committee reports or communications from the governor office shows any intent to limit the types of radio broadcasts to those engaged in the dissemination of breaking news.nor is there anything in the legislative history of section whi
