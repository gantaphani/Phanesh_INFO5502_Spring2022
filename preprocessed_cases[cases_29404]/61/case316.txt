we must decide whether a news organization may recover actual damages under the copyright act for acts of infringement that mostly occurred outside the united states.
the copyrighted works at issue here the works are two video recordings,the beating of reginald denny and beating of man in white panel truck,which depict the infamous events at florence and normandie during the los angeles riots.los angeles news service lans,an independent news organization which produces video and audio tape recordings of newsworthy events and licenses them for profit,produced the works and two other videotapes not at issue here while filming the riots from its helicopter.lans copyrighted the works and sold a license to rebroadcast them to,among others,the national broadcasting company nbc network,which used them on the today show.
visnews international usa,visnews is a joint venture among nbc,reuters television,and the british broadcasting company bbc.pursuant to a news supply agreement between nbc and visnews,nbc transmitted the today show broadcast by fiber link to visnews in new york visnews made a videotape copy of the works,which it then transmitted via satellite to its subscribers in europe and africa and via fiber link to the new york office of the european broadcast union ebu,a joint venture of visnews and reuters.the ebu subsequently made another videotape copy of the works,and transmitted it to reuters in london,which in turn distributed the works via video feed to its own subscribers.
lans sued reuters television international,reuters america holdings,reuters america,collectively,reuters,and visnews for copyright infringement and certain other claims not relevant here.the district court subsequently granted reuters and visnews partial summary judgment on the issue of extraterritorial infringement,holding that no liability could arise under the copyright act for acts of infringement that occurred outside the united states.news serv.reuters television int l,reuters i.however,the district court held that visnews act of copying the works in new york was a domestic act of and rejected a claimed defense of fair use.id.at.
the district court further concluded that lans had failed to prove any actual damages arising domestically and that damages arising extraterritorially were unavailable under the act,which meant that lans was limited to statutory damages.id.at after a bench trial on the issue of statutory damages,the district court awarded lans a total of.news serv.reuters television int l,reuters ii.
lans appealed the district court ruling on actual damages,and reuters and visnews the fair use ruling and the statutory damages calculation.we subsequently reversed the district court actual damages ruling,disagreeing with its interpretation of the copyright act extraterritorial application.news serv.reuters television int l,reuters iii,cir.we concluded that although the district court was correct to hold that the copyright act does not apply extraterritorially,an exception may apply where an act of infringement is completed entirely within the united states and that such infringing act enabled further exploitation abroad.id.at.relying on sheldon pictures,cir,aff,which held that profits from overseas infringement can be recovered on the theory that the infringer holds them in a constructive trust for the copyright owner,we reversed the grant of summary judgment.reuters iii at.we held that lans was entitled to recover damages flowing from exploitation abroad of the domestic acts of infringement committed by defendants.id.at.
turning to the other issues,we affirmed the fair use ruling and the statutory damages calculation.id.at.however,we vacated the award of statutory damages so that lans could make a new election on remand.id.at.after the supreme court denied certiorari,reuters television int l,news,d,the case returned to the district court,where reuters and visnews moved for summary adjudication of the claim for actual damages.they asserted that the reuters iii decision permitted lans to recover only defendants profits attributable to extraterritorial actual damages for injuries the infringements caused lans overseas.reuters and visnews further asserted that no factual dispute remained as to the amount of such profits.
after a hearing,the district court agreed with reuters and visnews on both points and granted the motion.the court concluded that reuters iii had held only that lans could recover any profits or unjust enrichment from domestic infringers,on the theory that the infringers held such profits in a constructive trust for lans.to permit lans to recover damages other than defendants profits or unjust enrichment,the court stated,would effectively permit lans to recover damages for extraterritorial acts of infringement.
having determined that lans could recover only defendants profits,if any,the district court concluded that reuters and visnews had reaped no such profits from their infringement.the court held that lans speculative testimony about the competitive advantage that exclusive footage gives a subscription broadcaster was insufficient to create a factual dispute.it accordingly granted the motion for summary adjudication.in its order,the district court stated that lans could elect to take the in statutory damages awarded in reuters ii and affirmed in reuters iii.in its haste,lans timely appealed to this court,but failed to make the required election as to statutory damages.because there was no final decision,we dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.lans subsequently cured the jurisdictional defect by making such election,and its appeal with this court.
lans claims that the district court erred by disallowing recovery for actual damages.lans,however,does not challenge the court further conclusion that lans had failed to show that reuters and visnews had earned any profits from the overseas infringement.summary adjudication was therefore appropriate if the district court correctly concluded that lans could not recover actual damages for overseas effects of defendants infringement.
both parties engage in detailed exegesis of our opinion in reuters iii.on lans reading,the reuters iii court use of the term damages is dispositive.the statute uses actual damages and profits separately and distinctly,and provides that an infringer may recover both in the ordinary case.lans asserts therefore that the reuters iii court should be read as having meant what it said damages means actual damages.
but lans interpretation does not fit with the context in which the reuters iii court discussed the recoverability of damages.there,we relied on judge learned hand opinion in sheldon and discussed damages entirely in the context of that case,which dealt exclusively with the recovery of the defendants profits.
the sheldon court had previously affirmed the defendants liability for infringing the plaintiffs copyright by incorporating their play into a movie.sheldon pictures,cir.after a remand,the defendants appealed the district court decision to award the plaintiffs all the defendants profits from exhibiting the motion picture.sheldon,at.the second circuit,inter alia,determined that the profits traceable to overseas exhibition of the infringing movie should be included.although a t first blush it seemed that the overseas profits should be excluded because the overseas exhibition of the infringing movie was not tortious under american copyright law,the court nonetheless concluded that the plaintiffs could recover the overseas profits under a different theory,based on one defendant having made the negatives in the id.at.the court elaborated 
the negatives were records from which the work could be reproduced,and it was a tort to make them in this country.the plaintiffs acquired an equitable interest in them as soon as they were made,which attached to any profits from their exploitation,whether in the form of money remitted to the united states,or of increase in the value of shares of foreign companies held by the defendants a s soon as any of the profits so realized took the form of property whose situs was in the united states,our law seized upon them and impressed th
