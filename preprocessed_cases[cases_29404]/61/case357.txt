this appeal arises out of an intellectual property dispute between a professional photographer and multiple defendants regarding the distribution and publication of photographs of a customized motorcycle.todd latimer sued kawasaki motors,kawasaki,hachette filipacchi media,hachette,roaring toyz,roaring toyz,and robert fisher for copyright infringement and unfair competition,alleging that defendants copied and used his protected work without permission or authorization.defendants maintain they were permitted to use the photographs and,as unauthorized derivative works,the photographs fail to qualify for copyright protection.the district court granted summary judgment to all defendants on the unfair competition claim and to kawasaki and hachette on the copyright infringement claims.the district court held that latimer unfair competition claim is preempted by the copyright act the photographs are not unauthorized derivative works and thus they qualify for copyright protection,latimer granted kawasaki an implied license to use the photographs in its press release materials,and hachette subsequent publication of the photographs was fair use.we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
factual background 
we state the facts in the light most favorable to the party,todd latimer,as required by the law controlling summary judgment.
todd latimer is a professional photographer who specializes in motorcycle photography.latimer passion for motorcycles and background in glamour and fashion photography helped him develop a reputation as a respected motorcycle photographer.latimer is known for portraying motorcycles in a unique and artistic style.latimer photographs have appeared on the covers of motorcycle enthusiast magazines such as two wheel tuner,super street bike,and cycle scene.
in late or early,latimer was introduced to roaring toyz by his friend and roaring toyz employee,bruce casner.roaring toyz is a florida based company that specializes in customizing sport motorcycles and manufacturing parts for the same.casner was familiar with latimer work and approached him to photograph aftermarket parts for a roaring toyz catalog.several months later,casner hired latimer to help with the roaring toyz booth at the west palm beach motorcycle show.casner arranged for models to appear in the booth and latimer conducted several photo shoots during the show to generate interest in the roaring toyz display.during the show latimer met roaring toyz president and founder,robert fisher.
in late,fisher retained john del cioppo,owner and operator of graphics,a new jersey corporation that had recently relocated to florida,to manage roaring toyz websites and advise him on marketing and public relations issues.prior to del cioppo involvement,fisher managed roaring toyz marketing efforts with assistance from his employees.
kawasaki,a prominent motorcycle manufacturer,planned to unveil its highly anticipated sport motorcycle at daytona bike week in march.the promised to be the fastest production motorcycle ever built and as such,news of its release generated a lot of excitement within the motorcycle community.while preparing for the introduction of the,kawasaki noted a trend developing in the marketplace for customized motorcycles.the main competition,the suzuki hayabusa,was particularly sought after for customization projects.in addition,many aftermarket parts were readily available for the hayabusa,which increased its attractiveness to potential buyers.as a result,kawasaki marketing plan for the focused on the bike customization potential and availability of aftermarket parts.
in an effort to further their marketing plan,kawasaki engaged roaring toyz to customize two motorcycles.kawasaki director of product planning,patrick kelly,discovered roaring toyz online and was impressed by their work.in january,kawasaki delivered two motorcycles to roaring toyz.the customized motorcycles were to be delivered to daytona and displayed alongside the production model during bike week.decisions regarding how the customization should be done,as well as what the final product should look like,were left to roaring toyz.
roaring toyz customized the mechanical features of motorcycles,leaving paint and body work to outside contractors.as such,roaring toyz commissioned ryan hathaway,an independent painter,to apply custom paint and graphics to the motorcycles.hathaway had provided paint services to roaring toyz for five or six years,during which he also produced work for other companies and individuals.fisher and hathaway discussed graphic styles and color schemes but hathaway made the final decisions as to the paint design and colors for the.during january and february,hathaway worked in his shop designing the artwork,selecting the paint colors,and painting the bodywork for the motorcycles.
meanwhile,latimer was assigned by two wheel tuner magazine to follow roaring toyz customization of the motorcycles.specifically,latimer assignment was to provide photographs of the motorcycles at various stages of the customization process for inclusion with a magazine article.as a result of the assignment,latimer was frequently present at the roaring toyz shop photographing the motorcycles.during one of his visits to roaring toyz,latimer was approached by fisher to photograph several other customized motorcycles for use on the roaring toyz website.on february and,latimer photographed three yamaha and three suzuki hayabusas,as requested by fisher.
as roaring toyz worked to complete the project in time for daytona bike week,kawasaki was planning the world press introduction,to be held in late february in las vegas,nevada.the world press introduction was an important event for kawasaki and was carefully orchestrated to garner positive media exposure for the motorcycle release.kawasaki carefully selected its press invitees with a focus toward motorcycle enthusiast publications.one such publication in attendance was cycle world,which is owned by hachette.
as the press event approached,kawasaki realized that in order to effectively implement its marketing plan,it needed to exhibit the customized to the media.the customized motorcycles were not scheduled to be completed until daytona bike week in early march,and as such would not be available for the world press introduction in las vegas.thus,kawasaki only alternative was to exhibit photographs of the customized motorcycles.
kawasaki public relations firm,freeman mccue,contacted del cippo to obtain photographs of the customized motorcycles.when del cippo responded with unsatisfactory images taken by the roaring toyz staff,freeman mccue pleaded for usable,reproducible photos of the motorcycles.on february,fisher contacted latimer and explained kawasaki urgent request for photographs of the customized.latimer agreed to conduct a photo shoot that evening to meet kawasaki february,deadline as long as he was paid for the photographs taken on february and.latimer claims that fisher told him the photographs would be used on a placard to be displayed beside the motorcycles at daytona bike week.however,fisher and del cippo insist that they told latimer the photographs would be used by kawasaki for the press release in las vegas.latimer denies being told this by either fisher or del cippo.latimer also claims that he made it clear to both fisher and del cippo that the photographs could not be leaked before the publication of his article in two wheel tuner.
latimer worked throughout the night of february photographing the customized,as requested by fisher and del cippo.the photographs were taken at roaring toyz facility since there was only one kick stand for the two motorcycles.due to the short deadline,roaring toyz employees assisted latimer by running extension cords and power cables for lights and cameras and setting up the background and flooring.however,latimer made all decisions regarding lighting,appropriate camera equipment and lens,camera settings and use of the white background,which was consistent with the industry practice he had noted in studying other advertising photographs.
when the photo session concluded on the morning of february,latimer asked to be paid for the photographs taken on february and.fisher gave latimer a check for and in return latimer gave fisher a compact disc containing edited images of the three yamaha and three suzuki hayabusa motorcycles.fisher claims that payment for the and hayabusa motorcycles was never discussed and that latimer payment request pertained to that night photo session.
after arriving home that morning,latimer began digitally editing the photographs for use on the placard.later that same morning,latimer emailed del cioppo a selection of edited images of the customized motorcycles.each of the images latimer delivered to del cioppo contained a file that provided the viewer with technical information and copyright notice for the photograph.del cioppo immediately forwarded the images to kawasaki via email.
later that day,del cioppo informed latimer that kawasaki was impressed by the photographs and wanted to include five of his images in its presentation at the press event in las vegas,nevada.latimer informed del cioppo that kawasaki could use his images of the motorcycles conditioned on kawasaki giving him credit as the photographer.latimer claims that he understood kawasaki request to be limited to using the photographs in a screen presentation.however,in an email to del cioppo on february,latimer wrote kawasaki will list you guys on the flyer for sure.please forward my credit info to them so that they might attach it on the back of the flyer,that would be cool.thanks,todd.
during the press event,kawasaki distributed press kits to approximately thirty members of the media,including a representative of cycle world magazine.the press kits contained a selection of digital images on compact disk,including copies of latimer photographs,with their respective metadata attached.
del cioppo posted latimer photographs of the customized motorcycles on two roaring toyz to promote and advertise the sale of its merchandise and customization services.del cioppo also testified that he spoke to a publisher at cycle world about publishing latimer photographs of the customized motorcycles.according to del cioppo,he called in some favors and talked to one of the publishers to give him an exclusive,the opportunity to come in and photograph the at roaring toyz.he declined.subsequently,cycle world published three of the five photographs that were included in the press kits distributed by kawasaki in las vegas.the photographs were published in conjunction with a feature article written by don canet that appeared in the june issue of cycle world.
on june,the register of copyrights granted latimer application for copyright registration of his photographs of the customized motorcycles,under certificate of registration no.five of these protected works are at issue in this appeal.latimer claims he learned that his photographs were being used without his permission when he read a copy of the june issue of cycle world while in a barber shop.believing that confronting defendants about the unauthorized use of his photographs would be tantamount to professional suicide,latimer delayed taking action until august when he contacted kawasaki and informed them that his photographs were being used without his permission.
procedural background 
in october,latimer brought this action against defendants alleging federal copyright infringement under and unfair competition under florida common law.latimer specifically alleges that roaring toyz used his protected work without authorization by displaying the photographs on its websites to promote and advertise the sale of merchandise,kawasaki used his protected work without authorization by including the photographs in its press kits that were distributed to the media,and hachette used his protected work without authorization by publishing the photographs in the june issue of cycle world magazine.latimer seeks a permanent injunction preventing defendants from infringing his copyright,an order directing defendants to tender all infringing copies of his protected work or destroy the protected work under a writ of destruction pursuant to,and actual damages suffered as a result of the infringement disgorgement of defendants profits not taken into account in computing actual damages.
in december,defendants moved for summary judgment arguing that latimer photographs are unauthorized derivative works based upon protectable preexisting works created and owned by ryan hathaway,and as such do not qualify for copyright protection.the district court granted summary judgment to all defendants on latimer unfair competition claim holding that it is preempted by the copyright act.the district court also granted summary judgment to kawasaki and hachette on latimer copyright infringement claims holding that the photographs are not derivative works but that latimer granted kawasaki an implied license to use the photographs in its press release materials,and hachette subsequent publication of the photographs was fair use.
latimer moved for reconsideration arguing that he had no notice the issues of implied license or fair use were to be considered on summary judgment.latimer stated that the court order goes beyond the matters briefed by the parties and sua sponte grants kawasaki summary judgment on the theory of implied license and hachette summary judgment based upon fair use.latimer argued that the district court power to grant summary judgment sua sponte is tempered by rule requirement that the nonmoving party be given an opportunity to oppose the motion.the district court disagreed with latimer assertion that he did not have sufficient notice of the issues but nevertheless granted his motion for reconsideration giving him the opportunity to brief the issues.on reconsideration,the district court again granted summary judgment to kawasaki and hachette repeating its prior holdings.the district court certified the case for immediate appeal under rule b and this appeal followed.
the district court also held that there are genuine issues of material fact,which preclude granting summary judgment to roaring toyz and robert fisher on latimer copyright infringement claim.that ruling is not before us.
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,considering all the evidence and factual inferences in the light most favorable to the party.see wilchombe teevee toons,cir.under.c,a motion for summary judgment is properly granted when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.celotex catrett,d.
courts have historically viewed summary judgment as inappropriate in the copyright infringement context because of the inherently subjective nature of the inquiry.see oravec sunny isles luxury ventures,cir.wrongful appropriation is typically shown by proving a substantial similarity of copyrightable expression.see nichols universal pictures,cir,cert.denied.because substantial similarity is an extremely close question of fact,see arnstein porter,cir,summary judgment has traditionally been frowned upon in copyright litigation,see id.at.however,in cases such as this,where substantial similarity is undisputed by the parties,may be determined as a matter of law on a motion for summary judgment.herzog castle rock entm t,cir recognizing that summary judgment is appropriate where the similarity between two works concerns only elements of the plaintiff work,or because no reasonable jury,properly instructed,could find that the two works are substantially similar.
iii.discussion 
copyright infringement 
to establish a prima facie case of copyright infringement,two elements must be proven ownership of a valid copyright,and copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.feist publ ns,rural.serv,d.to satisfy feist first prong,a plaintiff must prove that the work is original and that the plaintiff complied with applicable statutory formalities.bateman mnemonics,cir quoting lotus dev.borland int l,cir,aff by,d.in a judicial proceeding,certificate of a registration made before or within five years after first publication of the work shall constitute prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright and of the facts stated in the certificate.c.once the plaintiff produces a certificate of registration,the burden shifts to the defendant to establish that the work in which copyright is claimed is unprotectable for lack of originality.bateman,at.
in the instant case,latimer brought claims against,kawasaki and hachette,pursuant to,alleging that they infringed his copyright in the photographs.latimer produced a certificate of copyright registration granted june,less than four months after the photographs were initially published.thus,latimer benefits from a rebuttable presumption that his copyright is valid.
to satisfy feist second prong,a plaintiff must establish,as a factual matter,that the alleged infringer actually copied plaintiff copyrighted material.see id.factual proof of copying,however,is only an element in satisfying the second prong of feist.id.t he plaintiff must also respond to any proof advanced by the defendant that the portion of the work actually taken does not satisfy the constitutional requirement of originality as set forth in article i,cl.id.at see also feist,at.at noting that t he sine qua non of copyright is originality,as well as emphasizing that it is a constitutional requirement.if a plaintiff survives a challenge to the originality requirement,they must also prove that the copying of copyrighted material was so extensive that it rendered the offending and copyrighted works substantially similar.lotus,at.
in the instant case,actual copying of latimer photographs is undisputed.distributed and published digital copies,which were indistinguishable from latimer original photographs.as such,substantial similarity is not at issue.do not repeat their previous claims that latimer work lacks sufficient originality,and is incapable of constituting copyrightable subject matter.instead,on this appeal,challenge latimer copyright by arguing that the photographs are unauthorized derivative works based upon protectable preexisting works created and owned by ryan hathaway,and for which uses latimer has not requested nor received a license.
derivative works 
the subject matter of federal copyright includes derivative works,but the copyright in such works extends only to the material contributed by the author,and does not affect any copyright protection in the preexisting material.b.under,a derivative work must incorporate a substantial element of a preexisting work of authorship and recast,transform,or adapt those elements.shl imaging,artisan house,d.furthermore,protection for a work employing preexisting material in which copyright subsists does not extend to any part of the work in which such material has been used unlawfully.a.it is undisputed that the artwork on the customized motorcycles is the original,creative expression of ryan hathaway,and as such entitled to copyright protection.the fact that hathaway artwork appears on useful articles does not diminish his copyright protection.see a.thus,latimer photographs do not qualify for copyright protection if they are derivative works made without ryan hathaway authorization.
federal courts have historically applied a generous standard of originality in evaluating photographic works for copyright protection.schrock learning curve int l,cir.except for a limited class of photographs that can be characterized as slavish copies,courts have recognized that most photographs contain at least some originality in their rendition of the.see also rogers koons,cir elements of originality in a photograph may include posing the subjects,lighting,angle,selection of film and camera,evoking the desired expression,and almost any other variant involved.yet,courts have been reluctant to find that photographs of a preexisting work are derivative works.schrock,at we will assume without deciding that each of schrock photos qualifies as a derivative work within the meaning of the copyright act ty,publ ns int l,cir stating that photographs of beanie babies are derivative works from the copyrighted beanie babies themselves but basing that statement entirely on the parties concession that the photographs were derivative works skyy spirits,cir sidestepping the derivative works question by holding that a vodka bottle,a useful article not subject to copyright protection,does not qualify as a preexisting work within the meaning of the copyright act.at least one influential district has held that photographs of preexisting works are not always derivative works.see shl imaging,d at a photograph of a sculpture merely depicts that sculpture it does not recast,transform,or adapt the authorship found in the preexisting work.
relying exclusively on shl imaging,the district court concluded that latimer has not recast,transform ed,or adopt ed sic hathaway artwork,thus the photographs were not derivative works.we tend to agree with that this apparent incongruity tears a gaping hole in copyright protection that runs counter to every other section of the copyright act clear intent to protect original works of authorship against misappropriation.if a photograph,which satisfies the originality requirement for copyright protection,does not recast,transform,or adapt an underlying work,then all original works are vulnerable to misappropriation by the photographer lens.however,offer no precedential support for their assertion that photographs of preexisting works are derivative works.
further weakening argument is the fact that the motorcycles were the subject matter and primary focus of latimer photographs.latimer photographs can best be described as being based upon the motorcycles,useful articles not subject to copyright protection.the fact that hathaway artwork appears in the photographs is merely incidental.however,we need not resolve the derivative work question if the photographs were made with hathaway authorization.
even if the photographs are derivative works,they must also be unauthorized for argument to succeed.as noted previously,the copyright in a derivative work is defeated only when the underlying work has been misappropriated.whether the copyright owner of an original work of authorship has granted a license to create a derivative work is a threshold question that must be answered before turning to the more difficult question of whether the derivative work qualifies as such.thus,we need not resolve the derivative works question if the photographs were made with hathaway authorization.
implied license 
the copyright act requires a writing for all exclusive transfers of copyright.see a.however,licenses are exempt from this writing requirement,see,and may be granted orally,or may even be implied from conduct,jacob maxwell,veeck,cir.an implied license is created when one party creates a work at another person request delivers the work to that person and intends that the person copy and distribute the work.see id.because an implied license is an affirmative defense to a claim of copyright infringement,the alleged infringers have the burden of establishing an implied license.atkins fischer.
implied licenses may be limited and a defendant who exceeds the scope of an implied license commits copyright infringement.see id.courts focus on objective evidence revealing the intent of the parties to determine if an implied license exists,and this inquiry also reveals the scope of that license.see wilchombe teevee toons,cir gracen bradford exchange,cir the scope of an implied license may be proven through parol evidence.in asset marketing systems,gagnon,the ninth circuit held that a copyright owner must express the intent to restrict the scope of a license when they deliver the copyright work,cir.thus,an implied license will be limited to a specific use only if that limitation is expressly conveyed when the work is delivered.
did hathaway grant an implied license 
hathaway never executed a document granting an exclusive license in his original artwork.thus,the photographs are unauthorized unless hathaway granted a license,either orally or through conduct.because allege that latimer photographs infringe on hathaway original work,latimer has the burden of establishing an implied license.
hathaway conduct satisfies all three prongs of the implied license test.kawasaki requested that roaring toyz customize the motorcycles,and roaring toyz in turn asked hathaway to apply custom paint and graphics to the motorcycles.hathaway thus created the original artwork at kawasaki request.hathaway knew the customized motorcycles,which sported his custom paint work,were to be used by kawasaki to promote their new motorcycle.thus,when hathaway delivered the painted bodywork to roaring toyz,he constructively delivered the artwork to kawasaki.hathaway knew the customized motorcycles would be publicly displayed at daytona bike week and photographed by the media.hathaway also knew that both kawasaki and roaring toyz sought as much media exposure as possible for the customization project.thus,it is reasonable to infer that hathaway intended that his artwork be photographed and distributed by kawasaki,roaring toyz,and the media.at a minimum,hathaway granted kawasaki and roaring toyz an implied license to copy and distribute his original work.
did latimer exceed the scope of the license 
while it is clear that hathaway granted kawasaki and roaring toyz an implied license,the question remains whether this implied license extends to latimer use of hathaway artwork.latimer argues that his use of hathaway work was merely incidental but nevertheless fell within the scope of hathaway implied license.hathaway knew that kawasaki and roaring toyz intended to promote the customized motorcycles as widely as possible and did not expressly restrict the scope of the license when he delivered the work.thus,hathaway implied license at least encompassed uses that promoted the motorcycle.latimer photographs were such a use.roaring toyz asked latimer to photograph the motorcycles,which sported hathaway artwork,in response to kawasaki request for high quality promotional images.roaring toyz provided latimer with access to the motorcycles and assisted his efforts in producing the images.as such,latimer use of hathaway artwork fell within the scope of what hathaway intended when he granted the implied license.thus,latimer photographs are not infringing works and qualify for copyright protection.
did latimer grant kawasaki an implied license 
claim that,even if latimer photographs enjoy copyright protection,they did not commit copyright infringement because latimer granted them a implied license to use his work.the district court agreed and granted summary judgment to kawasaki on this issue.we also agree that latimer granted kawasaki an implied license to use his photographs but find that kawasaki use might have exceeded the scope of that license.
like hathaway,latimer never executed a document granting an exclusive license in his work and latimer oral representations regarding the use of his photographs are disputed by the parties.however,latimer conduct satisfies all three prongs of the implied license test.kawasaki requested that roaring toyz provide it with photographs of the customized,and roaring toyz in turn asked latimer to create those photographs.latimer thus created the photos at kawasaki request.latimer deposition testimony indicates that he knew roaring toyz would send the photographs to kawasaki to create the placard.thus,when latimer delivered the photographs to del cioppo,he constructively delivered them to kawasaki.in addition,latimer also testified that he consented to kawasaki request to use the photographs in a slide show or powerpoint presentation or whatever is flashed up on a screen.thus,latimer granted kawasaki an implied license to use his photographs.latimer created the photographs at kawasaki request,delivered the photographs to kawasaki,and intended that kawasaki use the photographs on a placard and in a screen presentation.
latimer contradicts some of his deposition testimony described above in an affidavit submitted after the district court vacated its first summary judgment order.argue that this affidavit should be dismissed as a sham because it contradicts prior sworn testimony.
a court may determine that an affidavit is a sham when it contradicts previous deposition testimony and the party submitting the affidavit does not give any valid explanation for the contradiction.see van junkins,cir.however,t his rule is applied sparingly because of the harsh effect it may have on a party case.allen bd.of pub.educ.for bibb county,cir.as such,courts must find some inherent inconsistency between an affidavit and a deposition before disregarding the affidavit.id.
in his affidavit,latimer states i did not know that del cioppo or fisher forwarded the photographs to kawasaki until fisher or del cioppo told me that kawasaki was impressed with my photographs and wanted to use them in some type of slide show or powerpoint presentation where the photographs would be flashed upon a screen.the affidavit contradicts both latimer april deposition testimony that he knew and intended that roaring toyz would forward his photographs to kawasaki,and his september deposition testimony that he knew when he sent the photos that kawasaki might use them.given that there is an inherent inconsistency between the affidavit and the two previous depositions,and latimer has failed to provide an explanation for the contradiction,the affidavit may be dismissed as a sham.
did kawasaki exceed the scope of its license 
it is clear from the record that latimer gave kawasaki an implied license to use his photographs.the question remaining is whether kawasaki exceeded the scope of that license by including latimer photographs in its press kit.in reaching the conclusion that kawasaki has not exceeded the scope of the implied license,the district court relied on an email sent by latimer to roaring toyz.in the email,latimer stated i know that kawasaki will list you guys on the flyer for sure.please forward my credit info to them so that they might attach it to the back of the flyer,that would be cool.the district court asserts,without explanation,that this email confirms that latimer did not limit kawasaki use to placards or a computer generated presentation flashed on the screen.the district court obviously understood the term flyer to mean a handbill or circular for mass distribution.webster third new international dictionary ed.however,latimer claims that he used the term flyer to refer to the placard to be displayed at bike week,and not to kawasaki press kit.when asked about the use of the word flyer,latimer testified that it was j ust a poor choice of words because it was a display,flyer,poster,placard.i think they all run sic about the same thing.
on summary judgment,latimer evidence must be taken at face value,and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.neither we nor the district court are to undertake credibility determinations or weigh the evidence.although it may be a stretch,a reasonable person could believe that latimer meant placard when he typed flyer.consequently,the district court reasoning in this regard is insufficient to sustain summary judgment on this issue.we may,nevertheless,affirm the district court judgment if alternative grounds exist for finding that kawasaki did not exceed the scope of the implied license.
kawasaki asserts that latimer did not expressly communicate to kawasaki any restrictions on the use of the photographs.however,latimer contends that all of his communications with kawasaki went through roaring toyz and that he granted kawasaki permission to use the photographs for a specific media display at bike week.thus,the question here is whether latimer delivered a warning adequate to put kawasaki on notice that certain uses of latimer photos would constitute copyright infringement.
kawasaki relies on asset marketing systems,as support for its argument that latimer was required to expressly communicate the restriction directly to kawasaki.at.however,in asset marketing systems,the parties were in direct communication with one another and the copyright holder did not attempt to limit the scope until after he had d
