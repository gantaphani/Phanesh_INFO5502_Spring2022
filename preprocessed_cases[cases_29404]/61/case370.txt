this appeal presents an issue of first impression in this circuit whether the cable communications policy act ccpa,c a,empowers a district court to issue an ex parte order authorizing a freeze of assets or a search and seizure of property belonging to an alleged violator of the act.after discovering that richard marmer and his company,tech communications,collectively,marmer,were selling pirate cable descramblers in violation of a,broadband filed suit against marmer and sought an ex parte order freezing marmer assets and allowing to seize property related to its claims.the district court granted the order and we affirm.
background 
contends that marmer is involved in the sale of illegal cable descrambling devices that allow buyers to receive cable television programming for free.filed suit against marmer alleging violation of a of the ccpa,and,on the same day,filed an ex parte motion for,inter alia,an asset freeze and seizure of marmer business records see.as evidence of marmer illegal activity,submitted the affidavits of two security personnel craig frappier,manager of security and jeffrey marin,an security investigator.
frappier affidavit detailed lost revenue due to the sale of illegal cable descramblers.specifically,frappier explained that provides its subscribers with a decoder that unscrambles its television signals so that cable subscribers can receive television signals.at.the decoders are programmed to authorize viewing of purchased services only.pirate decoders,or descramblers,allow the possessor to receive all of scrambled programming without payment.id.
marin affidavit indicated that marmer website,offered for sale several illegal cable descrambling devices,including the matrix and the coolbox avenger at.marin,posing as an ordinary customer,ordered the matrix.the package arrived,carrying a return address belonging to a mail boxes,store.marin connected the matrix and found that it was capable of receiving all of scrambled premium and services in a certain viewing area.
after searching through public records,marin and frappier discovered marmer home pagosa began observing activity outside his home.marin followed marmer from the pagosa court address to a facility at south deerfield avenue.marin observed marmer carrying a black bag consistent with the size and shape of a laptop computer.id.he also observed marmer drive to the mail boxes,location listed as the return address for the matrix,where marmer retrieved packages consistent with the size and shape of the illegal matrix descrambler that marin purchased from marmer.id.marmer then traveled from the mail boxes,to the deerfield avenue warehouse,where he unloaded the packages and then loaded additional packages retrieved from the warehouse.after marmer departed,marin searched a garbage dumpster near the warehouse and found several items that he concluded were consistent with the operation of an illegal descrambler sales company.id.this suit and the orders at issue followed.
the district court initially denied ex parte request for an asset freeze pending a showing of the specific assets to be frozen.the district court also initially denied ex parte request to seize certain of marmer property because failed to show a likelihood that evidence will be destroyed or unavailable if such an order is not granted.at.however,the district court granted request for an injunction and enjoined marmer from 
the sale,transfer,advertisement,movement offer for sale,modification,manufacture,storage and distribution of cable television decoding devices and related equipment the rendering of any assistance whatsoever in the sale,transfer,advertisement,movement,modification,manufacture,storage or distribution of such equipment and from destroying,altering,removing or secreting any of marmer books and records which contain information whatsoever concerning the business or finances of marmer or otherwise reflect transactions of any kind involving decoding devices 
two days later,on november,filed an emergency motion to supplement the record and modify the district court initial denial of an asset freeze and seizure of property.submitted a supplemental affidavit from frappier,and the affidavit of daniel lefkowitz,an attorney who represented another cable company in an identical,prior litigation.frappier supplemental affidavit stated that marmer was cutting off suppliers shipping labels and shredding documents,ex.b at.b ased on his extensive experience,frappier stated his opinion that,absent a seizure,marmer is likely to destroy evidence.id.lefkowitz affidavit identified the need for ex parte seizures in cable piracy cases based on numerous examples of defendants in other cases who destroyed or transferred sales records,pirate decoders,and business assets once provided with notice of legal action,ex.c at.
based on this evidence,the district court granted emergency motion for an ex parte asset freeze and seizure of property on november.the district court stated that,with the assistance of united states federal marshals,was permitted to search marmer pagosa court and deerfield avenue addresses and 
seize and remove any and all correspondence with customers,sales invoices,purchase orders,return forms,receipts,bank records,safe deposit box records,proceeds of sales,insurance policies,safes,shipping labels and tax returns of other business records,including all computer terminals,hard drives,servers,disks and tapes in their possession,which plaintiff reasonably believes contain or indicate the names or addresses of distributors,suppliers,manufacturers,purchasers of decoding devices or any related equipment,or which contain,indicate or otherwise reflect or pertain to any transactions of any kind involving decoding devices or other business activities,and any and all decoding devices,and the illicit proceeds of the sales of such decoding devices.
at.marmer was also restrained from transferring,removing,encumbering or permitting the withdrawal of any assets of property real or personal,tangible or intangible.id.at.in addition,the district court ordered marmer to show cause why this temporary restraining order should not be confirmed and a preliminary injunction entered.id.at.
on november,the day before the scheduled show cause hearing,and marmer filed a preliminary injunction and agreed order,wherein marmer consented to be permanently enjoined and restrained from participation in the distribution of cable descramblers.at.marmer also consented to the continuation of the asset freeze,with the stipulation that he could challenge its imposition at a later date.at unnumb.on december,marmer filed a motion to dissolve asset freeze and a motion for return of all items seized.
responded to marmer motions with another affidavit of marin stating that,during the search of marmer residence,discovered several fake driver licenses bearing marmer photograph but not his legal name.at.also seized in cash located in a briefcase concealed under a stairwell behind a water heater.id.in addition,seized tax returns indicated that marmer set up a new corporate identity to sell illegal cable descramblers every twelve months on average.id.
the district court denied marmer motions.regarding the property seizure,the district court found that probable cause justified the search of marmer warehouse facility and that the leon good faith exception applied to the search of marmer residence at.regarding the asset freeze,the district court concluded that,based on the information contained in marin second affidavit marmer should not be allowed to use his remaining assets to further other cable theft enterprises.at.the district court also noted that g iven the showing of a likelihood that assets unfrozen would not be available to satisfy any damage award,unfreezing this aspect of the november order is premature at this time.id.at.marmer now appeals.
ii.discussion 
we first address whether we have jurisdiction over marmer appeal.after concluding in the affirmative,we state the proper standard of review.we then consider the district court imposition of and refusal to dissolve the asset freeze,and,finally,we review the order permitting search and seizure of property from marmer residence and refusal to return the seized property.
jurisdiction 
before we address the merits of marmer appeal,we must first determine whether we have jurisdiction to hear his claims.while the grant of a motion for a preliminary injunction is appealable,the grant of a motion for a temporary restraining order tro is not.a smith,cir.marmer argues that the district court denial of his motions to dissolve the asset freeze and return seized property was the denial of a request for modification of a preliminary injunction,and,therefore,is immediately appealable pursuant to a.we agree.
generally,our jurisdiction is limited to final orders and judgments of the district court.a final decision is one which ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.pitney bowes,mestre,cir citation omitted.one exception to this general rule permits appeals from interlocutory orders granting or denying preliminary and permanent injunctions.see a cable holdings of battlefield,cooke,cir see also.a.specifically,under a,we have jurisdiction to review district court orders granting,continuing,modifying,refusing or dissolving injunctions,or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions.
in deciding whether to characterize an order as one granting a tro or as one granting a preliminary injunction,the label placed upon the order is not necessarily dispositive of its appealability.see mcdougald jenson,cir.an order granting a tro may be appealable as an order granting a preliminary injunction when three conditions are satisfied the duration of the relief sought or granted exceeds that allowed by a tro ten days,the notice and hearing sought or afforded suggest that the relief sought was a preliminary injunction,and the requested relief seeks to change the status quo.id.at,at.
in this case,all three conditions were satisfied requested relief that would extend well beyond ten days gave notice to marmer before the entry of the agreed preliminary injunction and order,which is evident by the fact that the order was by consent and sought to change the status quo by significantly altering marmer state of affairs.moreover,both parties agreed to the confirmation of the district court november tro as a preliminary injunction.at unnumb.thus,we will construe the district court orders denying marmer motions to dissolve the asset freeze and for return of seized property as orders denying requests for modification of a preliminary injunction.as a result,we have jurisdiction to hear marmer appeal.
standard of review 
we review de novo the legal grounds upon which the district court relied to issue its order permitting marmer assets to be frozen and his property to be seized.this that and the other gift and tobacco,cobb county,cir.we then review the district court decision to issue the order for an abuse of discretion.id.
asset freeze 
marmer argues that the district court denial of his motion to unfreeze his assets was improper for two primary reasons the district court lacked statutory authority under c a of the ccpa to issue the order,and the district court abused its discretion by refusing to dissolve the asset freeze after the parties entered an agreed injunction we conclude that the district court had the legal authority to issue the asset freeze,and that denial of marmer motion to dissolve the order was not an abuse of discretion.
statutory authority 
the ccpa provides that,no person shall intercept or receive or assist in intercepting or receiving any communications service offered over a cable system,unless specifically authorized to do so by a cable operator.a.district courts are authorized to grant temporary and final injunctions on such terms as they may deem reasonable to prevent or restrain violations of subsection a.id.c a.marmer maintains that the district court order was improper because c a does not explicitly authorize the district court to freeze assets to prevent violations of a.we disagree.
the supreme court has dictated that,unless the underlying statute clearly and validly limits the equitable jurisdiction of the district court,all the inherent equitable powers of the district court are available for the proper and complete exercise of that jurisdiction.porter warner holding.in other words,u nless a statute in so many words,or by a necessary and inescapable inference,restricts the court jurisdiction in equity,the full scope of that jurisdiction is to be recognized and applied.id.moreover,when the public interest is involved,the district court equitable powers assume an even broader and more flexible character.id.
our court applied porter in ftc oil gas,cir per curiam,where we were asked to decide whether the district court properly ordered an asset freeze under section b of the federal trade commission act ftca,b,which expressly permitted the district court to grant preliminary and permanent injunctions.we determined that congress,when it gave the district court authority to grant a permanent injunction also gave the district court authority to grant any ancillary relief necessary to accomplish complete justice because it did not limit that traditional equitable power explicitly or by necessary and inescapable inference.id.at quoting ftc singer,cir ftc gem merch,cir see also ftc southwest sunsites,cir reasoning that section b authorization to issue preliminary injunctions authorized a grant of ancillary equitable relief under the doctrine of inherent equitable jurisdiction.thus,we concluded that the asset freeze entered by the district court was a proper use of the court equitable powers.id.
the ccpa contains language substantially similar to the language contained in section b of the ftca.moreover,as in oil gas,this case involves the public interest in preventing the sale of pirate cable descramblers.see,at,reprinted in,theft of service is depriving the cable industry of millions of dollars of revenue each year which it should otherwise be receiving.the committee believes that theft of cable service poses a major threat to the economic viability of cable operators and cable programmers,and creates unfair burdens on cable subscribers who are forced to subsidize the benefits that other individuals are getting by receiving cable service without paying for it.thus,based on prior precedent,and considering porter admonition that the district courts equitable powers apply even more broadly when the public interest is involved,we hold that the district court in this case had proper legal authority to issue its order freezing marmer assets.see csc holdings,redisi,cir tkr cable cable city,cir general instrument of elecs,cir.we now consider whether the district court abused its discretion by refusing to dissolve the asset freeze.
propriety of the order 
the third and seventh circuits have concluded that an asset freeze,issued to prevent future violations of a,is an appropriate equitable remedy.redisi,at tkr cable,at,at.after considering this caselaw,we conclude that the asset freeze in this case was also appropriate.
in,the defendants altered legally manufactured cable decoders to enable them to receive all signals sent by the cable programmer,whether the decoder owner had paid for the programming or not.at.a jury found the defendants guilty of violating a of the ccpa,and the district court subsequently imposed an injunction permanently enjoining the defendants from manufacturing or distributing the modified descrambler boxes.id.at.the third circuit affirmed the district court imposition of the injunction as an appropriate use of discretion because the defendant did not refute the district court finding that no identifiable legitimate business existed.id.at.moreover,the third circuit held that the defendant business enterprise essentially facilitated cable theft in violation of.to stop such an operation is a primary purpose of the injunction likewise,the defendant should not be allowed to use its remaining assets,which in all likelihood can serve only to further other cable theft enterprises.id.at quoting district court opinion with approval.
two years later,the third circuit revisited in tkr cable.a
