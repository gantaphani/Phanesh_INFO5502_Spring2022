granada biosciences,and granada foods corporation sued forbes,publisher of forbes magazine,and writer william barrett for business disparagement.the trial court rendered summary judgment for forbes and barrett,and the court of appeals reversed.we hold that the court of appeals erred in reversing the trial court summary judgment because the plaintiffs produced no evidence that forbes and barrett acted with actual malice in publishing the article that is the subject of this controversy.accordingly,we reverse the court of appeals judgment and render judgment for forbes and barrett.
in its issue dated november,forbes published an article entitled the incredible shrinking empire.the article,authored by barrett,focused on the financial condition of the granada,a privately held company,and on its chairman,david eller.granada was the parent of a number of other private and public entities.while the granada organization consisted of dozens of entities,the article only named two of the public entities,granada foods gfc and granada biosciences,gbi.in general,the granada entities were engaged in developing and applying advanced technology in the area of agriculture,primarily cattle production.the article noted that the wall street journal had described granada as a corporate star of the future in,and that the organization,under eller stewardship,had garnered much favorable publicity.but,the article said,there is less to granada than meets the eye.actually,its total revenues,billion as recently as,will scarcely be million for.profits zilch.granada work force has shrunk to below from its cattle herd has dwindled to from million.the article identified gfc and gbi as the two publicly traded stock companies within the granada organization,and said that they were so broke they have been able to publish their annual reports.it went on to say that granada is beset with a series of serious shareholder lawsuits,including one filed by fort worth edward bass.it is undisputed that,while a person with that name had sued one of the granada entities,it was not the fort worth.furthermore,the article described a number of other signs of serious financial trouble possibly anticipating a bankruptcy filing,former granada employees say officials in recent months have moved some farm equipment and vehicles off granada books and gotten rid of backup documentation.
according to barrett affidavit,he used the term granada in a generic sense to describe the various entities controlled by eller,and when he intended to specifically address granada biosciences,or granada food corporation,he did so by name.the day the article was released,the shares of gbi and gfc dropped precipitously,and trading was permanently suspended in early.
gbi,gfc,eller,and his wife,linda,sued barrett,forbes,and cheryl munke,an employee of a former granada affiliate,for damages allegedly caused by the article publication.forbes and barrett collectively forbes filed joint motions for summary judgment,which the trial court granted.on appeal,the seventh district court of appeals,to which the case was transferred,reversed,holding that forbes summary judgment motion did not address the plaintiffs business disparagement claims.granada biosciences,barrett,pet.denied on remand,forbes filed a renewed and supplemental summary judgment motion under rule c and i,which specifically addressed the plaintiffs business disparagement claims.the trial court again granted summary judgment in forbes favor,but the fourteenth district court of appeals reversed,concluding that several fact issues precluded summary judgment.the court determined that there were fact issues concerning whether the article as a whole and several specific passages in the article were false and disparaging.at.the court agreed with forbes contention that,to recover on their business disparagement claims,the plaintiffs were required to satisfy the constitutional standard the united states supreme court established in new york times sullivan,d,but held that a fact issue on forbes state of mind at the time of publication precluded summary judgment.we hold that gbi and gfc presented no evidence of actual malice under the new york times standard,and thus reverse the court of appeals judgment.
to prevail on a business disparagement claim,a plaintiff must establish that the defendant published false and disparaging information about it,with malice,without privilege,that resulted in special damages to the plaintiff.hurlbut gulf atl.life ins.a business disparagement claim is similar in many respects to a defamation action.id.the two torts differ in that defamation actions chiefly serve to protect the personal reputation of an injured party,while a business disparagement claim protects economic interests.id.in hurlbut,a suit brought by an insurance agent against his former employer,we noted that a business disparagement defendant may be held liable only if he knew of the falsity or acted with reckless disregard concerning it,or if he acted with ill will or intended to interfere in the economic interest of the plaintiff in an unprivileged fashion.id.emphasis added quoting restatement second of torts,cmt.g.
the court of appeals noted in this case that gbi and gfc did not dispute forbes contention that they were public figures for the purpose of discussing their respective financial statuses,a conclusion that gbi and gfc do not challenge here.at.the court then held that ill will or intent to interfere with the plaintiff economic interest will not suffice to establish malice in a business disparagement claim brought by a public figure against a media defendant.id.at.instead,the court held that the constitutional interests at stake the conflict between free expression and a state power to award damages based on a defendant statements require proof of actual malice under the standard the united states supreme court articulated in new york times.id.at.accordingly,the court held that gfc and gbi must establish that forbes published the article with knowledge that it made false statements about them,or with reckless disregard as to the statements truth.id.in this court,gbi and gfc do not challenge the court of appeals application of the constitutional malice standard.we thus assume without deciding that the new york times standard applies in a public figure business disparagement suit against a media defendant 
the actual malice standard articulated in new york times fortifies our constitution guarantees of free speech and a free press.new york times,at.the relatively demanding standard honors our profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited,robust,and,and that it may well include vehement,caustic,and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on public figures.new york times,at.the standard recognizes that erroneous statement is inevitable in free debate,and it must be protected if the freedoms of expression are to have the breathing space that they need to survive.id.at.quoting button,d.thus,public figures can not recover for damaging statements made about them absent proof of actual malice.new york times,at,mclemore.
actual malice,in this context,is a term of art.it is not ill will,spite,or evil motive.huckabee time warner,citing casso brand.instead,actual malice requires proof that the defendant made a statement with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was true or not.huckabee,at quoting new york times,at.to establish reckless disregard,a plaintiff must prove that the defendant entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication.huckabee,at quoting amant thompson,d.reckless disregard is a subjective standard,focusing on the defendant state of mind.bentley bunton.mere negligence is not enough.id.rather,the plaintiff must establish that the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication,or had a high degree of awareness of the probable falsity of the published information.id.quoting,connaughton,d.constitutional malice generally consists of c alculated falsehood.bunton,at quoting garrison louisiana,d.when the defendant words lend themselves to more
