plaintiffs,a putative class of retail cable and satellite television subscribers,appeal the dismissal of the third version of their complaint against television programmers programmers and distributors distributors the complaint alleged that programmers practice of selling cable packages violates section of the sherman act.in essence,plaintiffs seek to compel programmers and distributors of television programming to sell each cable channel separately,thereby permitting plaintiffs to purchase only those channels that they wish to purchase,rather than paying for packages,as occurs under current market practice.plaintiffs appeal the dismissal with prejudice of their complaint for failure to state a claim.we affirm.
the television programming industry can be divided into upstream and downstream markets.in the upstream market,programmers such as nbc universal and fox entertainment group own television programs such as law and order and television channels such as nbc bravo and msnbc,and fox entertainment group fox news channel and fx and sell them wholesale to distributors.in the downstream retail market,distributors such as time warner and echostar sell the programming channels to consumers 
according to plaintiffs third amended complaint,programmers have two categories of programming channels channels with high demand and a large number of viewers,and a group of less desirable,channels with low viewership.plaintiffs allege that e ach programmer defendant,because of its full or partial ownership of a broadcast channel and its ownership or control of multiple important cable channels,has a high degree of market power all distributors,and that programmers exploit this market power by requiring distributors,as a condition to purchasing each programmer broadcast channel and its must have cable channels,to also acquire and resell to consumers all the rest of the cable channels owned or controlled by each programmer and agree they will not offer unbundled,individual cable channels to consumers.as a consequence,plaintiffs contend,distributors can offer consumers only prepackaged tiers of cable channels which consist of each programmer entire offering of channels.plaintiffs allege that these business practices impair competition among distributors for consumer business,and therefore the programmers and distributors are in violation of section of the sherman act.plaintiffs seek monetary damages under plaintiffs also seek an injunction to compel programmers to make channels available on an individual basis.
the district court dismissed plaintiffs first amended complaint without prejudice on the ground that plaintiffs failed to show that their alleged injuries were caused by an injury to competition.in their second amended complaint,plaintiffs alleged that programmers practice of selling packaged cable channels foreclosed independent programmers from entering and competing in the upstream market for programming channels.the district court subsequently denied defendants motion to dismiss,holding that plaintiffs had adequately pleaded injury to competition.
after preliminary discovery efforts on the question whether the programmers practices had excluded independent programmers from the upstream market,the plaintiffs decided to abandon this approach pursuant to a stipulation among the parties,plaintiffs filed their third amended complaint,which deleted all allegations that the programmers and distributors contractual practices foreclosed independent programmers from participating in the upstream market,along with a motion requesting the court to rule that plaintiffs did not have to allege foreclosure in the upstream market in order to defeat a motion to dismiss.the parties also agreed that programmers and distributors could file a motion to dismiss,and that if programmers and distributors prevailed,this third complaint would be dismissed with prejudice.the district court entered an order on october,granting programmers and distributors motion to dismiss the third amended complaint with prejudice because plaintiffs failed to allege any cognizable injury to competition.the district court also denied plaintiffs motion to rule on the question whether allegations of foreclosed competition are required to state a section claim.plaintiffs timely appeal.
section of the sherman act prohibits e very contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states.while section could be interpreted to proscribe nearly all contracts,the supreme court has never taken a literal approach to its language,texaco dagher,see also bd.of trade of chi.united states.rather,the court has repeatedly observed that section outlaw s only unreasonable restraints.state oil khan.
we generally evaluate whether a practice unreasonably restrains trade in violation of section under the rule of reason.see leegin creative leather,psks.in its design and function the rule of reason distinguishes between restraints with anticompetitive effect that are harmful to the consumer and restraints stimulating competition that are in the consumer best interest.id.at.the parties do not dispute that the rule of reason applies in this case and the pleading requirements for a rule of reason case therefore apply.
we review de novo a district court dismissal of a complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim.kendall visa,cir.in order to state a section claim under the rule of reason,plaintiffs must plead four separate elements.first,plaintiffs must plead facts which,if true,will prove a contract,combination or conspiracy among two or more persons or distinct business entities by which the persons or entities intended to harm or restrain trade or commerce among the several states,or with foreign nations which actually injures competition.id.at see also oltz peter cmty,cir same.in addition to these elements,plaintiffs must also plead that they were harmed by the defendant contract,combination,or conspiracy,and that this harm flowed from an aspect of the practice under scrutiny.atl.richfield usa petroleum.this fourth element is generally referred to as antitrust injury or antitrust standing.see,id.
in order to plead injury to competition,the third element of a section claim,sufficiently to withstand a motion to dismiss,a section one claimant may not merely recite the bare legal conclusion that competition has been restrained unreasonably.les shockley racing,hot rod ass n,cir.rather,a claimant must,at a minimum,sketch the outline of the injury to competition with allegations of supporting factual detail.id.at.such allegations must raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of an injury to competition.bell atl.twombly.thus,a complaint allegation of a practice that may or may not injure competition is insufficient to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.twombly,at see also ashcroft iqbal,where a complaint pleads facts that are merely consistent with a defendant liability,it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.quoting twombly,at internal quotation marks omitted.in addition,plaintiffs must plead an injury to competition beyond the impact on the plaintiffs themselves.mcglinchy shell chem,cir.
in sketching the outline of an injury to competition for purposes of this third element,the claimant must identify a contract,combination or conspiracy that has an anticompetitive effect.courts have held that agreements between competitors in the same market referred to as horizontal agreements may injure competition.for example,a horizontal agreement that allocates a market between competitors and restrict s each company ability to compete for the other business may injure competition.united states brown,cir.a horizontal agreement either explicit or tacit to set prices may injure competition because the result of such an agreement,if effective,is the elimination of one form of competition,namely price.united states socony vacuum oil,quoting united states trenton potteries.or a group of competitors may act in concert to harm another competitor or exclude that competitor from the market and thus protect dealers from real or apparent price competition from the targeted competitor.united states.motors.plaintiffs complaint does not allege the existence of any horizontal agreements.
courts have also concluded that agreements between firms operating at different levels of a given product market referred to as vertical agreements,such as agreements between a supplier and a distributor,may or may not cause an injury to competition.vertical agreements that foreclose competitors from entering or competing in a market can injure competition by reducing the competitive threat those competitors would pose.some types of vertical agreements can also injure competition by facilitating horizontal collusion.see leegin,at.other types of vertical agreements do not necessarily threaten an injury to competition.continental,gte sylvania,such restrictions,in varying forms,are widely used in our free market economy and there is substantial scholarly and judicial authority supporting their economic utility.
the complaint in this case focuses on a type of vertical agreement that creates a restraint known as tying.tying is defined as an arrangement where a supplier agrees to sell a buyer a product the tying product,but only on the condition that the buyer also purchases a different or tied product pac.ry.united states.the potential injury to competition threatened by this practice is that the tying arrangement will either harm existing competitors or create barriers to entry of new competitors in the market for the tied product,jefferson parish hosp.dist.hyde,abrogated in part on other grounds by.tool works indep.ink,cascade,at,or will force buyers into giving up the purchase of substitutes for the tied product,united states loew,abrogated in part on other grounds by.tool works.
but courts distinguish between tying arrangements in which a company exploits its market power by attempting to impose restraints on competition in the market for a tied product which may threaten an injury to competition and arrangements that let a company exploit its market power by merely enhancing the price of the tying product which does not.jefferson parish,at.for example,in blough holland realty,we concluded that an alleged tying arrangement did not threaten an injury to competition,cir.in that case,plaintiffs entered into contracts with to purchase undeveloped lots plus newly constructed homes.in order to purchase the developed lots,plaintiffs were required to pay a percentage fee to on top of the purchase price.id.plaintiffs alleged that the homebuilders were unlawfully tying the realtors services to the sale of developed lots in violation of the sherman act.id.we disagreed,holding that because the plaintiffs would not have otherwise purchased realtor services,the percentage fee was best viewed as part of the cost of purchasing the developed lot.id.at.
further,market conditions may be such that a specific tying arrangement does not have anticompetitive effects.see driskill dall.cowboys football club,cir.for example,in driskill,the plaintiff alleged that defendant,the dallas cowboys,had unlawfully tied the sale of undesirable preseason tickets to the sale of season ticket packages.id.at.but the court noted that the dallas cowboys had a lawful monopoly in the market for the tied product,preseason tickets,so the tying arrangement could not adversely affect competition in the tied product market there was no competition to affect.id.at.as the supreme court has noted,when a purchaser is forced to buy a product he would not have otherwise bought even from another seller in the tied product market,there can be no adverse impact on competition because no portion of the market which would otherwise have been available to other sellers has been foreclosed.jefferson parish,at see also blough,at w here there is no competition in the tied market,there can be no antitrust violation.quoting reifert cent.mls,cir.
indeed,courts have noted that a tying arrangement may be a response to a competitive market rather than an attempt to circumvent it.see jefferson parish,at buyers often find package sales attractive a seller decision to offer such packages can merely be an attempt to compete effectively conduct that is entirely consistent with the sherman act.like other vertical restraints,tying arrangements may promote rather than injure competition.see continental,at identifying ways in which vertical restraints may benefit competition leegin,at noting that even though vertical price restraints can lead to higher prices,prices can be increased in the course of promoting effects.in continental,the supreme court made clear that vertical restraints,even when their intent and competitive impact is to limit the freedom of the retailer to dispose of the purchased products as he desire s,are often.at.while such restraints limit intrabrand competition,they may increase interbrand competition,such as by induc ing retailers to engage in promotional activities or to provide service s that might not be provided by retailers in a purely competitive situation.id.at.
therefore,a plaintiff bringing a rule of reason tying case can not succeed in stating the third element of a section claim merely by alleging the existence of a tying arrangement,because such an arrangement is consistent with behavior.see hirsh martindale hubbell,cir i ntru sion upon consumers freedom of choice by compelling the purchase of unwanted products has been implicitly rejected by the supreme court as a sufficient independent basis for antitrust liability.rather,the plaintiff must allege an actual adverse effect on competition caused by the tying arrangement.jefferson parish,at.
plaintiffs may not substitute allegations of injury to the claimants for allegations of injury to competition.plaintiffs must plead antitrust injury,the fourth element necessary to state a section claim,in addition to,rather than in lieu of,injury to competition.see atl.richfield,at.that is,in order to state a claim successfully,plaintiffs must allege both that defendant behavior is anticompetitive and that plaintiff has been injured by an aspect of the practice under scrutiny.id.at i t is inimical to the antitrust laws to award damages for losses stemming from continued competition.quoting cargill,monfort of.specifically,to plead this element,plaintiffs must allege facts that if taken as true would allow them to recover for an injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants acts unlawful.big bear lodging ass snow summit,cir quoting atl.richfield,at internal quotation marks omitted.
we consider whether plaintiffs have stated a section claim in their third amended complaint in light of these principles.the key issue raised by this appeal is whether plaintiffs have adequately pleaded that the alleged programmer distributor agreements actually injure competition.
there is no dispute that the complaint alleges the existence of a tying arrangement.in fact,according to the plaintiffs complaint,the programmer distributor agreements at issue consist of two separate tying arrangements.first,in the upstream market,each programmer requires each distributor that wishes to purchase that programmer channels the tying product to purchase all of that programmer channels the tied product as well second,in the downstream market,distributors sell consumers cable channels only in packages consisting of each programmer entire offering of channels.thus,consumers,like distributors,are allegedly required to purchase each programmer channels,which they do not want the tied product,in order to gain access to that programmer channels,which they do want the tying product.
but as explained above,tying arrangements,without more,do not necessarily threaten an injury to competition.therefore,the complaint allegations regarding the two separate tying arrangements do not,by themselves,constitute a sufficient allegation of injury to competition.rather,plaintiffs must also allege facts showing that an injury to competition flows from these tying arrangements.we conclude that such all
