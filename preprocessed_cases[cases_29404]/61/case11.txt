in the aftermath of a substantial snowstorm,four customers sued cable provider charter communications entertainment i,llc,and its parent company,charter communications,collectively,charter,on behalf of themselves and a putative class of others claimed to be similarly situated.the plaintiffs contend that charter violated contractual,statutory,and common law duties by failing to provide credits to its customers for their loss of cable,internet,and telephone service during the storm.we hold that the district court properly exercised its jurisdiction under the class action fairness act,d,but erred in granting charter motion to dismiss.we therefore vacate in part the district court opinion and remand for further proceedings.
background 
except where otherwise noted,the facts in this opinion are taken from the plaintiffs complaint,with all reasonable inferences drawn in the plaintiffs favor.see maloy ballori lage,cir.we bear in mind,however,that in assessing jurisdictional issues,we must weigh the evidence without favoring either party.valentin hosp.bella vista,cir.
plaintiffs bruce cooper,john romito,roy baker,and whitney taylor thompson are residents of massachusetts who purchase cable television,internet,or telephone services from charter.the district court has not yet considered any motion for class certification,so for now they are the only plaintiffs.
beginning on october,massachusetts experienced a severe snow storm that damaged trees,made travel impossible on many roads,and took down power and cable lines.during the storm,the plaintiffs did not receive services from charter,either because they lost electrical power and therefore could not use television or internet devices,or because charter own equipment failed to provide service even where power was available,or due to some combination of the two.
cooper,romito,and baker filed the complaint in this case in massachusetts state court on november.two weeks later,having not yet served the complaint on charter,the plaintiffs attorneys sent the company a demand letter seeking relief on behalf of the three original plaintiffs and others similarly situated.this letter was later incorporated into the plaintiffs first amended and second amended complaints,the latter of which is the operative complaint here.the demand letter specified when the three customers services were interrupted.according to the letter,for example,cooper and baker lost service at pm on october,and did not receive it again until pm on november.as to thompson,who was added as the fourth plaintiff after the demand letter was sent,the record contains no information regarding when her service was interrupted,aside from the allegation in the amended complaint that her interruption lasted more than consecutive hours.
a month after receiving the plaintiffs demand,charter sent a letter to their attorneys,informing them that charter had issued credits to the accounts of cooper,baker,and romito,which the company said fully compensated them for the time they were without service.
after the first amended complaint was served on charter in february,the company removed the case to federal court,invoking the class action fairness act.charter then filed a motion to dismiss,asserting that the plaintiffs claims were moot and that the complaint failed to state a claim.see.b,b.the district court ruled that removal was proper and granted charter motion to dismiss.the court found that the claims of cooper,baker,and romito were moot because they had received credits covering the time they were without service.the court also found that,as to the fourth plaintiff,thompson,the complaint failed to state a claim.this appeal followed.
ii.legal standard 
this case presents two threshhold jurisdictional questions whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction under the class action fairness act and whether the plaintiffs claims are moot.we review both questions de novo.see amoche guarantee trust life ins,cir anderson ex rel.dowd city of boston,cir.however,where the district court assessment of a jurisdictional issue turns on findings of fact,we accept those findings unless they are clearly erroneous.amoche,at valentin hosp.bella vista,cir.
as to charter motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,we also review de novo.maloy ballori lage,cir.we ask whether the complaint state s a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,accepting the plaintiff factual allegations and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.id.quoting bell atl.twombly,d.to cross the plausibility threshhold,the plaintiff must plead factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.id.quoting ashcroft iqbal,d.
iii.analysis 
jurisdiction under the class action fairness act 
charter invokes federal jurisdiction under the class action fairness act.the act grants jurisdiction to federal courts to hear class actions if there is minimal diversity of citizenship between the parties,as the parties agree there is here,and the amount in controversy exceeds five million dollars d.here,although a class has not been certified,the district court properly treated the complaint as asserting a class action,and therefore went on to consider the size of the proposed class and the potential recovery.see college of dental surgeons of puerto rico connecticut life ins,cir cafa applies to any class action before or after the entry of a class certification order by the court with respect to that action.quoting d.the party asserting jurisdiction bears the burden to show with a reasonable probability that the amount in controversy requirement is satisfied.amoche guarantee trust life,cir.
the parties agree that for purposes of calculating the amount in controversy,the plaintiffs seek at least for each member of the proposed class.the parties also agree that approximately charter customers lost power during the storm.the company provided that estimate in an affidavit,and the plaintiffs then incorporated the figure into their own complaint,characterizing it as a minimum number of affected customers.the complaint asserts that all of these customers failed to receive services from charter,and the plaintiffs have offered no reason to exclude any of those affected from their proposed class.
with a putative class of at least people,and possible damages of at least per class member,the amount in controversy is at least.the district court exercise of jurisdiction was therefore proper.
charter contends that the claims of cooper,baker,and romito became moot when,after this suit was filed,they accepted credits proportional to the time they were without service there is no dispute that thompson claims remain live.
the dispute between the plaintiffs and charter focuses on whether and when charter must provide a credit or rebate to any subscriber whose service is interrupted.the plaintiffs say that the service outages in october and november of triggered a duty to provide credits or rebates under.laws ch,l,and under charter licensing agreements.importantly,they also claim that charter was obligated to provide those rebates or credits to each affected customer without waiting to first receive a request from that customer.charter rejects both contentions.
yet,the plaintiffs have not contested that cooper,baker,and romito accepted credits from charter proportional to the time they were without service.and although the plaintiffs allude to the existence of other types of damages they might have suffered,they fail to identify any such damages,even by type or category.in short,the individual damages claims of these three putative class representatives were fully satisfied after they filed this action.consequently,they also may not receive statutory or treble damages under the massachusetts unfair business practices law,which makes such relief available only where a defendant has failed to offer a settlement reasonable in relation to the injury actually suffered.see.laws ch,
were the three original plaintiffs seeking only monetary damages,and were thompson not joined as a plaintiff,the foregoing chronology would present complicated issues of standing and mootness in the context of a putative class action.see,genesis healthcare symczyk,d analyzing the viability of a collective action under the fair labor standards act,after assuming that the plaintiff individual damages claim was moot.in this case,though,the plaintiffs also seek a declaration that massachusetts law and charter licensing agreements require the company to pay credits without request.see allowing federal courts to issue declaratory relief.charter avows no agreement with the plaintiffs interpretation of charter duties under either massachusetts law or under the licensing agreements.indeed,charter has made clear that it gave credits to the plaintiffs under a policy it adopted voluntarily,which was limited to this storm,and which,according to charter,exceed ed requirements under the law.
charter also fails to argue that the request for declaratory relief is itself either moot or unripe.nor would it appear unlikely that the new england weather will produce another severe winter storm,as evidenced by the fact that massachusetts passed a law to address the situation in the first place.in these circumstances,we find the dispute between the plaintiffs and charter about the extent of charter duties to the plaintiffs under massachusetts law and its licensing agreements to be live and proper for judicial consideration.see already,llc nike,d holding that a defendant bears the formidable burden of showing that it is absolutely clear the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur when it claims that its own voluntary conduct has made a plaintiff claim moot internal quotation marks omitted knox service employees int l union,local,d finding no mootness where the defendant union had offered a full refund of money the plaintiffs claimed was collected unlawfully because the union continue d to defend the legality of its action,making it not clear why the union would necessarily refrain from collecting similar fees in the future 
all four plaintiffs therefore may pursue their unrequited requests for declaratory relief regarding their present dispute with charter over the nature of its obligations to them.and thompson has an unsatisfied damages claim to pursue as well.
failure to state a claim 
each of the plaintiffs claims arises under massachusetts statutory or common law,and so we look to that law in assessing the plausibility of their claims.see daigle maine med,cir.
with one exception,the plaintiffs claims revolve around a provision in massachusetts law requiring that 
in the event a license is issued to provide cable service,each licensee shall agree to the following l in the event its service to any subscriber is interrupted for or more consecutive hours,it will grant such subscriber a pro rata credit or rebate.
charter has indeed included such language in its licensing agreements,almost verbatim,albeit with the presumably reasonable limiting gloss that credits or rebates need be provided only when the interruption was not caused by the subscriber and the licensee knew or should have known of the service interruption.
the parties dispute how to interpret the statute language,and thus the nearly identical language of the licensing agreements.charter asserts that the language only requires the company to provide credits or rebates to subscribers who ask for them.we reject this claim as inconsistent with the statute actual language.the language imposes no such limitation,instead flatly imposing a duty to provide a credit or rebate to any subscriber whose service is interrupted for sufficient duration.charter nevertheless claims that the legislature would have used the plural form,subscribers,rather than the term any subscriber,if it intended cable providers to give credits to all subscribers who lost service.charter does not cite any legal precedent,nor any grammatical rule,to support its argument,and we find it illogical the statute language plainly applies without limitation to all subscribers who lose service for hours or more,just as a rule prohibiting any person less than years old from becoming president applies to all such people despite its use of the singular word person.see const.art.ii,cl.similarly,we see no basis for charter claim that the legislature would have used the term automatic if it intended cable providers to grant refunds to all subscribers who lost service.although inclusion of that word in the statute would have provided support for our conclusion,it does not follow that the word absence leads us to disregard the clear meaning of the words the legislature actually used.
even the implicit limitation made express in charter agreement that charter knows or should have known of the interruption is not so limited as to apply only when charter knowledge arises from a consumer complaint or request.if charter knows,for example,that it is not transmitting to an entire area because one of its own facilities is not passing along a signal,we can conceive of no reason why the massachusetts legislature would have intended but not written into the statute a requirement that subscribers in that area must communicate to charter what it already knows or should know in order to receive a credit.
of course we do not know or suggest that charter failed to provide a credit or rebate to subscribers whom it knew or should have known suffered a service interruption for or more hours.also not raised by this appeal is when exactly service is interrupted under the statute on a review of dismissal of this complaint under rule b,rather,we assume that plaintiffs suffered a covered service interruption,of which charter was aware,simply because it is plausibly alleged.
we therefore assume that charter has conducted itself and is currently asserting a right to continue conducting itself in a manner that we find to be violative of the licensing term that massachusetts legislature viewed as sufficiently important as to be a required term of all such licensing agreements.the question is whether plaintiffs can maintain a private cause of action as a result of this assumed breach.we now analyze that question,bearing in mind that the following discussion,to the extent it considers claims for damages,applies only to plaintiff thompson.
contract claims 
the plaintiffs contend that they can sue as beneficiaries to enforce the licensing agreements incorporating the statutory mandate.under massachusetts law,to prevail on a beneficiary claim,a plaintiff must establish that the language and circumstances of the contract show that the parties to the contract clearly and definitely intended the beneficiary to benefit from the promised performance.cumis ins.soc y,bj wholesale club,internal quotation marks,alterations omitted.because government contracts by their very nature tend to benefit the public,massachusetts courts apply a presumption against finding liability in assessing those contracts,overcome only where the language and circumstances of the contract make it particularly clear that the parties intended members of the public to possess enforcement power.see mackenzie flagstar bank,fsb,cir applying massachusetts law.in assessing attempts by third parties to enforce government contracts,we pay special heed to t he distinction between an intention to benefit a third party and an intention that the third party should have the right to enforce that intention,with only the latter supporting enforcement.murray,corbin on contracts,ed quoted in laguer onewest bank,fsb,wl,at.
here,the plaintiffs submitted with their complaint a copy of one licensing agreement between charter and a massachusetts municipality.we will assume for the purposes of this opinion that the agreement is identical in all material respects to any other licensing agreement,with a different municipality,that might apply to the plaintiffs claims.the contract requires charter to grant a pro rata credit or rebate to any subscriber whose entire cable service is interrupted for or more consecutive hours,if the interruption was not caused by the subscriber and the licensee knew or should have known of the service interruption.the plaintiffs are co
