advantage media advantage submitted permit applications to eden prairie,minnesota the city to construct fourteen large commercial billboards.all of advantage applications were denied because each proposed billboard violated multiple provisions of the eden prairie sign code.advantage then brought this action under,claiming that the sign code is unconstitutionally overbroad under the first and fourteenth amendments and that its own constitutional rights were violated by the denial of its applications.the district court granted summary judgment to the city,and advantage appeals.concluding that advantage overbreadth challenge to the sign code fails for lack of standing and that its own rights were not violated,we affirm.
advantage is an outdoor advertising company.it rents commercial advertising space for profit on billboards which it owns,although in its pleadings it stated that it would also be willing to make some space available for nonprofit advertising.on february,advantage submitted permit applications to the city for construction of thirteen square foot,double sided freestanding billboards,ranging in height from to feet.each billboard was to contain trivision technology,which displays three different triangular images that rotate every ten seconds to allow for multiple displays.advantage also applied to construct one square foot billboard attached to an existing building.
eden prairie,like many other municipalities,regulates what signage may be erected within its limits through its sign code.the sign code stated purpose is to encourage creativity,freedom of choice,and effective communication while preserving the city visual amenities and protecting residents from annoyance and danger.the sign code regulates sign dimensions,construction,height,location,and setback location from walkways,roadways,and property lines.it favors smaller signs over larger ones,dispersion over clustering,signs in commercial or industrial areas rather than residential,and signs located on the premises of a business accessory signs over those advertising a business or service located elsewhere non accessory signs.it prohibits motion signs signs with movable displays,signs of more than square feet in size or feet in height,freestanding signs with bases of more than square feet,some types of multi faced signs,and all commercial non accessory signs.noncommercial signage is exempt from many parts of the code and completely exempt from regulation for a specified period before and after elections.
the city reviews and approves sign applications through a permitting process.permit applications must include a complete description of the proposed sign,a sketch,and such other information as shall be necessary to inform city officials of the sign kind,size,material,construction,and location.under minnesota law the city must grant or deny permit applications within days,subd.a,although it can extend the deadline to days upon written notice to the applicant,subd.f.until december the city practice was to evaluate permit applications for compliance with the sign code and then subject them to additional review and approval by the city manager or a designee.the normal designee,a city planner named steven durham,stated in an affidavit that even when this extra step was in place he did not feel he had the discretion to deny permit applications which were otherwise in compliance with the sign code.the city nevertheless amended the code to eliminate this final review step.in it also added the day limit for reviewing permit applications mandated by state law to the sign code itself.denial of a permit application is appealable to the city board of appeals and adjustments the board.
after advantage submitted its permit applications on february,it received a reply letter from durham dated february informing it that the applications were incomplete and requesting additional information related to setback and location.advantage responded by providing scaled aerial photographs of all the proposed sign locations.on march advantage received a second letter from durham,informing it that the review period would be extended to days due to the number of permit applications it had submitted and their uniqueness.finally on may,advantage received letters from durham denying each application for numerous reasons.among the reasons listed for the denials were that all of the proposed signs exceeded the size and height limits in the sign code and the thirteen proposed double sided freestanding signs had excessively large bases,were too close to nearby roadways,had too much space between each sign face,and violated the city prohibitions on motion signs and commercial non accessory signs.the record does not indicate that advantage appealed to the board.
approximately two months after its permit applications were denied,advantage brought this action in the district court.advantage argued that the sign code substantive regulations are unconstitutionally overbroad under the first and fourteenth amendments because they favor commercial over noncommercial speech and some types of noncommercial speech over others,thereby chilling a wide array of protected expression without being narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest.advantage also claimed that its own free speech rights had been violated by the denial of its sign permit applications.finally,advantage argued that the sign permit process,as it existed when advantage applications were denied,was both facially invalid and invalid as applied because it lacked necessary procedural safeguards and afforded city officials unbridled discretion.advantage argued that the sign code should be declared invalid in its entirety and requested injunctive relief,damages,and attorney fees.
the city moved for summary judgment,arguing that advantage lacked standing under article iii of the constitution to bring facial or applied challenges to the sign code on its own behalf or on behalf of other potential speakers.in the alternative,the city argued that advantage also lacked prudential standing to bring an overbreadth challenge on behalf of noncommercial speakers and that the applied challenges on its own behalf failed on the merits.the district court agreed with all of the city arguments and granted the motion.advantage appeals,arguing that it did have standing to bring a facial overbreadth challenge to the sign code and that the applied challenges had merit.
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,using the same standard as the district court.bunch canton marine towing,cir.summary judgment should not be granted unless there is no issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.lund hennepin county,cir.an issue of fact can not result from mere denials or conclusory allegations in the pleadings but must be based on specific factual allegations.see celotex catrett,d.
advantage argues that it has met the constitutional standing requirements necessary to bring a facial overbreadth challenge to the sign code in its entirety.the city disagrees.the supreme court has held that the irreducible minimum of constitutional standing consists of three elements an injury in fact which is actual,concrete,and particularized a causal connection between that injury and defendant conduct and a likelihood that the injury can be redressed by a favorable decision.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.
advantage first contends that it has constitutional standing regardless of whether it has met the lujan test.citing broadrick oklahoma,d,it claims that the supreme court has created an exception to normal standing requirements for overbreadth challenges under the first amendment.so long as it has demonstrated an injury in fact and that it will satisfactorily frame the issues in the case,secretary of state of maryland joseph munson,d,advantage claims that its facial overbreadth challenge to the sign code may proceed.the city counters that facial overbreadth challenges are not exempt from normal constitutional standing requirements and that advantage must satisfy the lujan test.
article iii of the constitution limits federal jurisdiction to cases and controversies,and the core component of standing is an essential and unchanging part of the requirement.lujan,at.whether a party has established the traditional elements of article iii standing is thus an inescapable threshold question.see also mosby ligon,cir litigants must satisfy normal requirements of article iii standing even when bringing facial challenges.advantage reliance on broadrick and munson to support its assertion of an exception to this prerequisite for first amendment overbreadth challenges is misplaced.as the eleventh circuit recently explained,those cases are better understood to create an exception to additional prudential standing doctrines which normally prevent parties from litigating the rights of others in federal court.see camp legal defense fund,city of atlanta,cir.because the first amendment free speech guarantees need breathing space,the court has allowed litigants whose own speech could constitutionally be regulated to challenge overly broad regulations which affect them.see broadrick,at.under no circumstances,however,does the overbreadth doctrine relieve a plaintiff of its burden to show constitutional standing.advantage overbreadth challenge must therefore meet the requirements set forth in lujan.
advantage argues in the alternative that it has met all three of the lujan requirements.the parties agree that advantage was injured by the denial of its permit applications.advantage further maintains that since the provisions of the sign code are not amenable to severance,its injury should be understood to have been caused by enforcement of the code in its entirety and to be redressable by invalidation of the entire code the city responds that advantage can not challenge the sign code in its entirety,but only the provisions which were applied to it.as a result advantage can not show causation and redressability for any overbreadth challenge.most of the code provisions it alleges to be unconstitutional were not factors in the denial of its permit applications which was based on other provisions whose constitutionality is undisputed.
the interpretive approach that advantage urges with respect to severability is inconsistent with the clear intent of the drafters of the eden prairie city code and with the intent of the minnesota legislature,from which the city derives its regulatory authority.see lilly city of minneapolis,a city is a political subdivision of the state.the supreme court has described legislative intent as the touchstone for any decision about remedy.ayotte planned parenthood of northern new england,d.in this case the city code contains a comprehensive severability provision,under which every chapter,section,subdivision,paragraph or provision of the city code shall be,and is hereby declared,severable,such that if any provision of the code is held invalid that ruling has no effect on the other valid provisions.eden prairie.the minnesota legislature has stated a similar preference for severance of an unconstitutional provision from an otherwise valid statutory framework,except where the remaining provisions are so dependent upon the invalid provision that a court can not presume the legislature would have enacted one without the other,see.ann,a showing advantage has not made here.we should be sensitive to such expressions of legislative preference for severance.see ayotte.at united states booker,d also ins chadha,d a provision is presumed severable if what remains after severance is fully operative as law.
advantage approach to severability has been rejected in analogous situations by several other circuits.see tanner advertising group,llc fayette county,georgia,cir.june,en banc brazos valley coalition for life,city of bryan,texas,cir granite state outdoor advertising,city of clearwater,florida,cir gospel missions of america city of los angeles,cir.the eleventh circuit decisions in tanner and granite state are directly on point.in each of these cases an outdoor advertising company represented by advantage counsel in this action sought to use denial of its sign permit applications under one part of a municipal code to challenge other provisions of the code which had not been applied to it,and in each case the challenges failed for lack of standing.tanner,at granite state,at.brazos and gospel missions reached similar results,except that those cases dealt with noncommercial speakers different forms of speech.see brazos,at antiabortion protesters lacked standing to challenge sign code provisions never applied to them and from which they appeared to be exempt gospel missions,at nonprofit religious corporation lacked standing to challenge restrictions on professional fundraisers which were not applied to it.advantage cites to no persuasive case which has taken the approach it advocates 
instead advantage relies on the supreme court holding in metromedia,city of san diego,d plurality opinion.metromedia involved a sign company facial challenge to a newly enacted municipal prohibition on outdoor advertising signs which exempted on premises signs and twelve largely content based categories of off premises signs.id.at.the court held that the company had standing to challenge the ordinance as a whole.id.at.severability was not raised as an issue in metromedia and severance would likely have been inappropriate given the interrelated structure of the ordinance in question.in contrast,here we are confronted with a more comprehensive regulatory framework enacted piecemeal over a number of years,one in which universally applicable restrictions related to size and location can easily be severed from those which may necessitate more scrutiny.metromedia is not applicable on the issue of severability.
advantage also argues that even if severance might be appropriate,the severability of a statutory provision goes to the merits and should not factor into a standing determination.we disagree.the supreme court has incorporated severability analysis into standing determinations when there was clear evidence of legislative intent,see chadha,at,as there is here.moreover,severance of particular statutory provisions to limit standing promotes important goals,notably the avoidance of unnecessary constitutional adjudication and the sharpening of legal issues facing the court.contractors ass of eastern pennsylvania,city of philadelphia,cir.the district court properly considered the provisions of the sign code to be severable in making its overbreadth standing determination.
because the code provisions are properly considered severable,advantage must show injury,causation,and redressability with respect to each provision it challenges as overbroad.lujan,at.to establish causation a plaintiff must show that its injury is fairly traceable to a challenged statutory provision.republican party of minnesota klobuchar,cir.since most of the content based restrictions and procedural mechanisms which advantages claims violate the first amendment rights of other parties were not factors in the denial of its own permit applications,it can not show causation with respect to them.gospel missions,at.these challenges fail for lack of constitutional standing.
as for redressability,it is established by a more than merely speculative showing that the court can grant relief to redress the plaintiff injury.planned parenthood of and eastern kansas,ehlmann,cir.in this case a favorable decision for advantage even with respect to those sign code provisions which were factors in the denial of its permit applications would not allow it to build its proposed signs,for these would still violate other unchallenged provisions of the sign code like the restrictions on size,height,location,and setback.see harp advertising illinois,village of chicago ridge,illinois,no standing to challenge sign code ban on off premises signs where proposed sign also violated unchallenged zoning restrictions.on an overbreadth challenge advantage would also be barred from collecting damages which are available only for violations of a party own constitutional rights.memphis cmty.sch.dist.stachura,d tanner,at.even attorney fees under would be unavailable because they can be awarded only to
