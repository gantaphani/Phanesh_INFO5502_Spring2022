background 
cti,a nevada corporation,is a development stage company,which promotes business ventures by selling stock to raise capital one of its products in development is a breast imaging system the project,which promised to provide higher resolution mammography to detect and treat breast cancer.
to fund the project,cti initiated a private placement of securities in december,offering subscribers units of shares of common stock and warrants at a price determined on november.the private placement of these restricted securities included a typical discount of the market price of the stock at the commencement of the public offering as an incentive for investors,who would then bear the risk of future price volatility.cti extended the offering until february,to generate more capital.
representing it had raised million,cti then applied for a listing on nasdaq and issued a press release.to shareholders meeting in june,it announced that nasdaq approved the listing and the fda had extended approval of the project,driving its stock price up to per share.
the day after the shareholders meeting,however,nasdaq inquired about an outstanding million default judgment for racketeering and fraud against cti ceo,david johnston,prompting the company to issue another press release to report nasdaq had placed the listing on hold to investigate the matter.the following day,david evans,a reporter for bloomberg news,headlined his story,computerized thermal raises capital at discount to market,and wrote that cti sold million shares of its stock at an percent discount to its market price in march,according to a filing it made with regulators last week.david evans,computerized thermal raises capital at discount to market,bloomberg news,june.evans proceeded to describe the private placement,quoting cti cfo,it would have been nice for us to go out at or bucks a share in the sale,instead of but that not what happened.id.john coffee,a securities professor at columbia law school,commented for the piece,that r aising capital from investors at such a large discount is a red flag the market price is well above what more informed parties think it should be.id.adding that computerized thermal needs the money to fund operations,and that it had struggled to sell its breast imaging systems,selling only one to a hospital in thailand in,evans included statements from a radiology professor and other doctors who questioned the accuracy and efficacy of the new technology.id.
cti demanded a retraction.bloomberg news then published a second,substantially similar article in july,computerized thermal imaging raises money at discounted price correct,bloomberg news,july,in which evans principally corrected the percent discount rate to read percent discount to the market price and explained that cti extended the offering because it had not received the minimum amount it said it needed.both articles the articles were available on the internet.
a month later,cti filed suit alleging the articles instantaneously published over bloomberg website contained malicious defamation tending to impeach the honesty,integrity,virtue or reputation of its business,and,thus,constituted libel under utah code ann.the articles,cti alleged,led to the loss of capitalization of the project,cancellation of ongoing efforts to expand its business into central and south america ctii de mexico,disruption of its nasdaq listing,and derailing of fda approval.cti sought special damages in excess of million as well as punitive damages.
bloomberg moved to dismiss the complaint,countering that the alleged defamatory statements did not constitute libel per se or libel per quod under utah law and,in any event,were protected expressions of opinion and fair comment under utah and federal law.the district court agreed,focusing its analysis on five alleged defamatory statements in the articles which,it concluded,were not libelous per se under baum gillman,utah,an action for slander nor libelous per quod,despite the falsity of two of the statements,because cti neither properly pled nor proved special damages.the latter conclusion rested on allred cook,utah,an action for slander,and cox hatch,utah,an action for libel.
ii.utah defamation law 
seeking de novo review of the district court interpretation and application of utah law,fields farmers ins,cir cti contends the court erred when it collapsed the separate causes of action for slander and libel into a single,undifferentiated claim and,then,dismissed its complaint solely alleging libel.to arrest the growth of this hydra,cti offers us seegmiller ksl,which,it insists,expressly endorsed the very distinctions between libel per se and slander per se it advances in this appeal.utah.
seegmiller,however,was an action to redress the alleged defamatory words spoken by an investigative television reporter,that is,slander,in which the utah supreme court had to decide the degree of fault which a private figure must prove in a defamation action against a media defendant and whether the defendant is entitled to the benefit of a conditional privilege permitting comment on a matter of public interest.id.at.in that endeavor,the court quoted utah code ann,the legislative directive for privileged broadcasts id.at.in the same footnote,the seegmiller court wondered what the legislature had in mind when it used the words libelous,slanderous or defamatory per se,and cited william prosser,law of torts ed,and a colorado case to support its reminder that t he concepts of slander per se and libel per se are distinct and the term per se has different meanings depending on context.id.thus,although seegmiller has since provided the decisional ground for cases involving privilege,its utility here is marginal.see,van dyke kutv,utah college official investigated for sexual harassment occupied a position that invited public scrutiny,shielding the reporter comments with a qualified privilege.
instead,this case easily aligns with the progenitor of utah common law of libel,nichols daily reporter,utah,there,nichols,a candidate for office in the salt lake city typographical union and delegate to the national convention,sued the daily reporter for printing and publishing a card which stated,on one side,vote for honest jake bosch for delegate,and,on the other,explanatory nichols owes the daily reporter a balance of for printing done in.draw your own conclusions and vote for nichols,if you think he is not able to pay this debt.id.at.the meaning of these words,nichols alleged,was clear unable to pay his debts,unworthy of credit,this typographer was not to be trusted all statements of contempt and ridicule which damaged him in his reputation,good repute,and credit.id.because nichols claimed the publication was false and defamatory on its face,he did not allege special damages.
writing on a clean slate the utah supreme court stated 
it,of course,is conceded that written derogatory or disparaging words which impute to a person the commission of a crime,or degradation of character,or which have a tendency to injuriously affect him in his office or trust,profession,trade,calling or business,or which tend to degrade him in society,or expose him to public hatred,contempt,or ridicule,are libelous and actionable.it also is the rule that when the words are libelous per se,it is not necessary to allege or pr
