national labor relations board regional director james mcdermott the regional director appeals the district court denial of temporary injunctive relief under section j of the national labor relations act nlra,j.the district court decided that a significant risk of a first amendment violation would arise if ampersand publishing,llc,doing business as the santa barbara,were forced,among other things,to reinstate employees it discharged for union activity directed at pressuring the newspaper owner and publisher to refrain from exercising editorial control over news reporting.mcdermott ex rel.nlrb ampersand publ g llc,dist.lexis,at.may.weighing the equitable factors generally applicable to a claim for interim injunctive relief with an eye toward the greater burden needed to grant an injunction that threatens to infringe first amendment rights,the district court denied the petition.we affirm.
the first amendment protects the right of a newspaper to control its content.the main thrust of the employees campaign to secure representation by the graphic communications conference,international brotherhood of teamsters the union appears to have been to block or limit the influence of the owner and publisher of the over the content of the news sections of the paper and to focus that authority in the employees themselves,as reporters and editors.we conclude that the district court correctly required a heightened showing of equitable need under our case law,because the interim relief sought by the government in support of union activity aimed at obtaining editorial control poses a threat of violating the rights of the under the first amendment.applying the supreme court recent guidance on the general standard for granting preliminary injunctions,we further determine that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to order the interim injunctive relief sought by the regional director.
background 
as described in more detail below,an nlrb administrative law judge alj presided over a trial and produced a lengthy recommended decision and order in this case,currently pending before the board itself.the factual narrative provided here is largely drawn from the findings of fact made by the alj as part of that decision.
the is a daily newspaper published in santa barbara,california.the owner and copublisher,wendy mccaw,purchased the paper in through her company,ampersand publishing.
beginning in,mccaw voiced concerns that the paper news reporting was sometimes biased.she took various actions to try to eliminate the bias she perceived,including issuing warning letters to reporters and conducting staff training sessions.early in july,following a series of clashes over what the district court described as issues of content,several editors and reporters resigned from their positions at the to protest what they perceived as unethical interference in the function of the newspaper by mccaw and her,arthur von weisenberger.
the alj found that these resignations prompted the remaining newsroom employees to seek out the union.on july,about thirty employees met with union representatives.after discussions with the union,the employees drafted a letter to the,dated july,listing four demands 
restore journalism ethics to the santa barbara implement and maintain a clear separation between the side of the paper and the side.
invite back the six newsroom editors who recently resigned 
negotiate a contract with the newsroom employees governing our hours,wages,benefits and working conditions.
recognize the union as our exclusive bargaining representative.
the next day,july,the union and its employee supporters held a rally in front of the building where these same four demands were read aloud.at another event staged four days later,reporters held up four signs,each stating one of the demands from the july letter.
the delivered its response to the employees july letter on july.the response stated that the newspaper respected the employees right to decide whether or not to have union representation but declined to recognize the union or to invite back the editors who had resigned.at an internal staff meeting in late july,city editor scott steepleton answered employees questions concerning mccaw involvement in the news department by saying that,as the owner of the paper,mccaw had the right to be part of whatever she wants to be part of.the paper later published editorials criticizing the union and proclaiming that it was standing firm against allowing outside union organizers to influence news coverage or interject bias into reporting.
at an event on july,the employees unveiled their campaign to persuade readers to cancel their subscriptions by september if the employees demands were not met.they distributed pledge cards at that event and at various other functions in the months that followed that said 
i,support the santa barbara newsroom staff in its effort to restore journalistic integrity to the paper,obtain recognition and negotiate a fair employment contract.cancel my subscription by,if the employees demands have not been met to their satisfaction 
the alj found that this subscription cancellation effort became the centerpiece of the union campaign concerning the.on september,the union and its supporters held a press conference announcing that the employees demands had not been met and asking the public to cancel their subscriptions to the to show their support.on september,employees organized a rally and fundraiser complete with a large banner bearing the message cancel your newspaper today.during the campaign,union supporters made public statements such as do let mccaw control the news and help us take back the.
the union filed a petition with the nlrb on august,to represent a unit of news department employees at the.the nlrb conducted an election on september,which the union won by a vote of to.overruling the objections to the election,the nlrb certified the union as the exclusive bargaining representative of the news department employees on august.negotiations for a agreement commenced on november.no agreement has been reached.
between august and march,the union filed a series of charges with the nlrb alleging that the had engaged in a variety of unfair labor practices.on may,the regional director issued an amended and consolidated complaint against the.among other things,the complaint alleged that the had violated paragraphs a and a of the by discharging eight employees because they engaged in union activity.one of those employees was terminated in october,another in january,and the other six in february.the complaint also alleged that the had committed a host of additional unfair labor practices ranging from improperly reprimanding employees to failing to provide employees with adequate raises and bonuses.
a trial before an alj was conducted on the allegations in the complaint.on december,the alj issued a recommended decision and order.he concluded that the had committed numerous unfair labor practices and recommended that relief be granted,including reinstatement of the eight discharged employees,constituting more than percent of the newsroom staff.
regarding the first amendment defenses,the alj observed that a purpose of the union activities of the employees was directed toward what they viewed as a need to restore journalistic integrity at the.he identified the first amendment protection of freedom of the press as the starting point in this analysis.the alj recognized that this protection belongs to the publisher of a newspaper and not to the reporters in their role as employees.
nevertheless,he concluded that the first amendment does not limit collective bargaining aimed at restoring editorial integrity.such collective bargaining was warranted,the alj reasoned,because the had engaged in conduct that employees believe undermines their credibility as journalists and adopted policies that could be viewed as vague and ambiguous.thus,the alj concluded that the matter of journalistic integrity may be a matter over which employees may bargain through its representative.
the alj rejected the notion that the employees were attempting to gain entrepreneurial control of the newspaper and instead credited the testimony of one employee that the union campaign was not part of an effort to let the reporters rather than management control the content of the newspaper.having decided that first amendment rights did not come into play,the alj found that the failed to establish that it would have taken the same actions even if the employees had not engaged in protected union activities.
the parties each filed numerous objections to the alj recommended decision and order.the case remains pending before the board.
the regional director had previously requested permission from the board to file a section j petition seeking an injunction against the.the board denied this request on june.on december,the then board,anticipating that it would soon have fewer than the three members needed for a quorum,see b,entered a temporary delegation order.through this order,which became effective on december,the board gave the general counsel full authority on all court litigation matters that otherwise would require board authorization.nlrb press release,
specifically,the board temporarily delegated to the general counsel full and final authority and responsibility on behalf of the board to initiate and prosecute injunction proceedings under section j.id.
over two months after this delegation of authority became effective,and despite the board initial refusal to authorize the petition,the regional director filed a section j petition for a temporary injunction on march,this petition sought an injunction compelling the,among other things,to offer interim reinstatement to each of the eight terminated employees.
the district court denied the petition for section j relief on may.mcdermott,dist.lexis.the court held that the requested injunction,in its entirety,posed a significant risk of violating the first amendment rights since the employees activity had as a central demand the ceding of an aspect of the editorial discretion.id.at.accordingly,the district court applied the heightened burden for obtaining relief set forth in overstreet ex rel.nlrb united brotherhood of carpenters and joiners of america,cir.considering the traditional equitable criteria for interim injunctive relief and the first amendment implications of the petition,the district court concluded that the regional director fell short of establishing that relief would be just and proper and therefore denied the section j petition.mcdermott,dist.lexis,at.
the regional director timely appealed the district court decision.
ii.discussion 
we apply the same standard of review to the district court denial of relief under section j as we would to the denial of any other preliminary injunction.miller ex rel.nlrb cal.pac.med,cir en banc.accordingly,we will reverse the denial of section j injunctive relief only where the district court abused its discretion or based its decisions on an erroneous legal standard or on clearly erroneous findings of fact.id.whether the district court applied the correct legal standards is reviewed de novo.see also overstreet,at.
ordinarily the nlrb enjoys primary jurisdiction over labor disputes,subject only to narrow judicial review.see miller,at.section j of the nlra,however,permits the nlrb to petition a federal district court for appropriate temporary relief or restraining order pending the board resolution of an unfair labor practice charge.j.the district court is given authorization to grant such temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper,keeping in mind that the underlying purpose of section j is to protect the integrity of the collective bargaining process and to preserve the board remedial power while it processes the charge.miller,at.
to decide whether granting a request for interim relief under section j is just and proper,district courts consider the traditional equitable criteria used in deciding whether to grant a preliminary injunction.see id.at.in evaluating the validity of the district court analysis of the equitable factors,we must employ the supreme court recent interpretation of the threshold showing necessary for granting such an extraordinary remedy.winter natural res.def.council.our now defunct precedents had provided that when a plaintiff demonstrates a strong likelihood of prevailing on the merits,a preliminary injunction may be entered based only on a possibility of irreparable harm.id.at see,scott ex rel.nlrb stephen dunn,cir using this standard in evaluating section j petitions for injunctive relief.shunning the more lenient standard adopted by our circuit,the supreme court in winter held that a party seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits,that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief,that the balance of equities tips in his favor,and that an injunction is in the public interest.at.to the extent that our cases have suggested a lesser standard,they are no longer controlling,or even viable.am.trucking ass n,city of los angeles,cir.
in overstreet,a case decided before winter,we held that a higher bar than usual is set for those seeking injunctive relief pending a board decision in instances where there is at least some risk that constitutionally protected speech will be enjoined.at emphasis added.the nlrb regional director in that case sought to enjoin members of a trade union from displaying banners that announced a labor dispute,alleging that the action constituted an unfair labor practice.id.at.we held in overstreet that the significant first amendment implications of enjoining peaceful speech activity meant the ordinary principles of deference to board interpretation of the act d id not apply.id.at.further,in light of the risk that protected first amendment speech would be restrained,we concluded that only a particularly strong showing of likely success,and of harm as well,could suffice to justify issuing the requested injunction.id.at.
we see no reason why overstreet rule that a particularly strong showing is required to grant a section j injunction when the proposed relief risks violating the first amendment should not survive winter change to our baseline preliminary injunction standard.nothing in winter conflicts with our requirement that those seeking such injunctive relief must establish particularly strong showings of likelihood of success and irreparable harm if there is some risk of offending first amendment rights in the process.nothing in overstreet suggests that the heightened standard it announced for granting injunctive relief that risks licensing first amendment violations was tied to the prevailing general preliminary injunction framework.see overstreet,at to say that miller applies to this case does not fully delineate the applicable standards for judging the propriety of the requested interim relief because of the first amendment backdrop in this case.we hold,therefore,that overstreet first amendment precepts remain intact after winter.
overstreet heightened equitable relief standard applies here 
the regional director argues that the district court erroneously applied overstreet elevated standard because the record and the law establish that there is no risk of first amendment infringement.the responds that the employees central demand in their union campaign was for the to relinquish editorial control over the content of its news reports and that the employees backed up this demand with economic coercion,notably by urging readers to cancel their subscriptions.the maintains that giving employees a protected entitlement under the imprimatur of the nlra to apply economic pressure on the to cede editorial control would create a significant risk of infringing upon the first amendment rights.we conclude that the district court correctly determined that granting the requested injunction would present at least some risk of compromising the first amendment right to exercise editorial control.
recognizing the union argument that enjoining its members from displaying banners about a labor dispute would be unconstitutional was a plausible,and quite possibly meritorious one,overstreet held that interpreting the nlra to prohibit the union activity would pose a significant risk of violating the first amendment.at.accordingly,applying the constitutional avoidance principle of statutory construction,we interpreted the nlra so as not to prohibit the conduct at issue.see id.at.since the board could not establish the irreducible minimum showing of a fair chance of success on the merits,we affirmed the district court denial of interim relief.id.at,internal quotation marks omitted.
resolving whether overstreet heightened equitable standard for awarding section j relief controls here does not require us to decide whether the first amendment does protect the challenged activity,or even whether it probably does.id.at.rather,we need only determine whether granting the regional director injunction request would create at least some risk that constitutionally protected speech will be enjoined.id.at.b ecause constitutional decisions are not the province of the nlrb or the nlrb regional director or general counsel,the tasks of evaluating the constitutional pitfalls of potential interpretations of the nlra are committed de novo to the courts.id.at.
newspapers are not entitled to blanket immunity from general regulations,and the nlra prohibition on deterring union activity is no exception.in associated press nlrb,the supreme court considered an order by the nlrb directing the associated press to stop penalizing its employees for engaging in union activity and to reinstate an editor whom the nlrb found was fired because of his union activity.id.at.the court upheld the nlrb order and rejected the ap contention that it must have absolute and unrestricted freedom to employ and to discharge news editors at will,observing that t he business of the associated press is not immune from regulation because it is an agency of the press.id.at.
the court did not hold,however,that first amendment concerns were entirely irrelevant and should always be set aside in the face of an nlrb order.to the contrary,the court emphasized that enforcement of the order at issue there had no relation whatsoever to the impartial distribution of news.id.at.the court explicitly noted that the order did not in any way circumscribe the full freedom and liberty of the ap to publish the news as it desires it published or to enforce policies of its own choosing with respect to the editing and rewriting of news for publication.id.with this caveat,the court signaled that application of regulations that restricted those press liberties could be constitutionally problematic.see passaic daily news nlrb,the court implied in associated press that should the press freedom and liberty to publish the news as it desires it to be published be circumscribed,the nlra would have to yield to the first amendment.
it is clear that the first amendment erects a barrier against government interference with a newspaper exercise of editorial control over its content.elaborating on the constitutional guarantees afforded to newspaper publishers,the supreme court has explained 
the choice of material to go into a newspaper,and the decisions made as to limitations on the size and content of the paper,and treatment of public issues and public fair or the exercise of editorial control and judgment.it has yet to be demonstrated how governmental regulation of this crucial process can be exercised consistent with first amendment guarantees of a free press 
miami herald publ g tornillo,see also associates aldrich times mirror,cir holding private newspapers can not be compelled to publish advertisements free from editorial control of their content.the court in tornillo thus struck down a state statute that forced newspapers to publish a political candidate reply to stories criticizing the candidate,holding that such a law impermissibly intrudes on a newspaper right to choose what to print.see tornillo,at.
following tornillo,the circuit declined to enforce part of an nlrb order requiring a newspaper to reinstate a columnist found to have been discharged for engaging in union activity and to resume printing his weekly column subject to lawful employment and publication standards.passaic daily news,at.passaic deemed the nlrb order constitutionally defective because it invites the board to review the company publication standards and to become directly involved with the company exercise of editorial control and judgment.id.at.according to the court,a n order that merely directed the company to not discriminate against the fired columnist on the basis of his union activity would present a much closer case.id.
the district court noted that the proposed injunctive relief in this case is more indirect than the orders at issue in tornillo and passaic daily news,because it would not force publication of specific content,as did the orders in those cases.mcdermott,dist.lexis,at nonetheless,it concluded that the requested injunction would burden the exercise of editorial discretion by the.id.at.it specifically found that the employees activity had as a central demand the ceding of an aspect of the editorial discretion.id.at.the district court further found that the employees sought to force the to give in to their demand for the relinquishment of editorial control through economic pressure tactics.id.at.these findings of fact are not clearly erroneous and are supported by the record.see supra at.
the union organizing campaign arose in the wake of an extended dispute between the management and newsroom employees regarding allegedly biased reporting and newspaper content.the first of the four demands was for the to r estore journalism ethics to the newspaper implement and maintain a clear separation between the side of the paper and the side.this demand reflected the belief of some news reporters that there had been a breakdown of a wall that should separate the publisher control of the opinion pages of the newspaper from control over the news reporting pages.melinda burns,one of the lead union organizers and one of the terminated employees whose reinstatement would be ordered by the proposed injunction,testified 
to keep its credibility,a newsroom has to have independence from the editorial side of the paper the editorial side is the opinion side.the publisher opinion is in the editorials.the news side has to have the independence and freedom to report the news,gather the news and not to be pressured by the publisher to report it or gather it in a certain way.
she wanted,in short,to be able to report the news as truthfully as i can and as fairly as i can without a publisher telling me how to write it.emphasis added.the employees demand was repeated at various demonstrations leading up to the union election.
the cancellation drive was also tied to the employees desire for editorial independence from management.pledge cards specifically asked recipients to support the newsroom staff in its effort to restore journalistic integrity to the paper by cancelling their subscriptions.this history persuades us that the union campaign aspired in large part to compel the publisher of the to relinquish to the newsroom staff editorial control over the reporting of the news,which lies at the core of a newspaper first amendment rights.
under these circumstances,as the district court aptly observed,it does not seem possible to parse,at least in the manner the alj sought to do,the newspaper animus toward the union generally from its desire to protect its editorial discretion.the motives necessarily overlapped in this case.mcdermott,dist.lexis,at.we agree.
we also observe that the alj appeared to believe that the fact that editorial integrity was a proper subject for collective bargaining supported a conclusion that first amendment rights were not at issue.that simply does not follow,and the qualifications drawn by the supreme court in associated press indicate otherwise.that employees may want to bargain collectively over a given subject does not necessarily mean that there can be no first amendment implications.the rights of employees to organize and engage in collective bargaining may,understandably,be the primary focus and concern of the nlrb,but they do not supersede the first amendment.as we noted in overstreet,at,we owe no deference to the administrative agency view of the first amendment.
deploying the nlra to protect the employees efforts in support of the union would risk circumscrib ing the full freedom and liberty of the to publish the news as it desires it published and to enforce policies of its own choosing with respect to the editing and rewriting of news for publication.associated press,at.the injunction the regional director seeks here would prevent the from taking action against employees for engaging in activities calculated to pressure the into limiting its exercise of editorial discretion.we conclude that the requested interim relief would risk violating the constitutionally protected editorial discretion by removing an otherwise available weapon to resist employees attempts to seize control over the newspaper content.see tornillo,at governmental restraint on publishing need not fall into familiar or traditional patterns to be subject to constitutional limitations on governmental powers.
we do not pass judgment on the validity of the employees concerns with respect to journalistic integrity.we can not,however,ignore the supreme court teaching on the subject a responsible press is an undoubtedly desirable goal,but press responsibility is not mandated by the constitution and like many other virtues it can not be legislated.id.no matter how laudable the goals of the fired reporters in promoting the union to,as the alj put it,restore journalistic integrity,the risk that granting an injunction will infringe the right to publish what it pleases is inescapable.see id.declaring that any compulsion exerted by government on a newspaper to print that which it would not otherwise print is unconstitutional see also laird tatum,c onstitutional violations may arise from the deterrent,or chilling,effect of governmental regulations that fall short of a direct prohibition against the exercise of first amendment rights.for that reason,we conclude that the district court did not err in concluding that the additional requirements of overstreet must be met in evaluating whether to grant the section j petition.
the dissenting opinion concludes that the proposed injunction does not pose a significant risk of infringing the first amendment because it does not directly require the paper to change its editorial policy or dictat e what a newspaper must publish.infra at.we think that approach closes its eyes to what the underlying labor dispute here is about the ability of the newspaper owner and publisher to exercise control over the news pages of the.see tornillo,at white,concurring t he first amendment erects a virtually insurmountable barrier between government and the print media so far as government tampering,in advance of publication,with news and editorial content is concerned.intervening to support the employees effort to limit the control of the owner over its news pages necessarily poses some risk to that owner first amendment rights.see pacific gas electric public utilities,i nterference with the exercise of editorial control and judgment creates a peril for the liberty of the press like government control over what is to go into a newspaper.internal quotation marks omitted see also regan taxation with representation of washington,blackmun,concurring it hardly answers one person objection to a restriction on his speech that another person,outside his control,may speak for him.tornillo,at observing that a newspaper is more than a passive receptacle or conduit for news,comment,and advertising and holding that government action fails to clear the barriers of the first amendment when it intru des into the function of editors.
telling the newspaper that it must hire specified persons,namely the discharged employees,as editors and reporters constituting over percent of its newsroom staff is bound to affect what gets published.to the extent the publisher choice of writers affects the expressive content of its newspaper,the first amendment protects that choice.see hurley gay,lesbian and bisexual group of boston,holding that because every participating unit affects the message conveyed by a parade private organizers,a state court interpretation of a law to require inclusion of one group of prospective marchers violates the fundamental rule of protection under the first amendment,that a speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his own message see also first bank of boston bellotti,in the realm of protected speech,the legislature is constitutionally disqualified from dictating the speakers who may address a public issue.
the dissenting opinion also contends that the first amendment rights of the and its owner would be unaffected because the newspaper would be free to operate as it did before,without change.but that assumes that the union efforts to effect a change will fail.it is surely not the premise of the alj decision or the proposed injunction that the newspaper owner will prevail and that the employees efforts are bound to be for naught.there would be no point to requesting or ordering interim relief here unless it was expected to have an impact.the proposed injunction is aimed at strengthening the union hand against the owner,and that will impair the owner right to control the newspaper content.it may be true,as the dissenting opinion states,infra at,that t here is no more reason to expect the would be forced to agree to reestablish a firewall than to expect it to be forced to capitulate to employees other contract demands.but employers are regularly forced by unions to capitulate to more traditional wage and hour demands.see nlrb trimfit of california,cir affirming an nlrb order requiring reinstatement of former employees see also codifying the rights of employees to bargain collectively and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection emphasis added.the risk of that happening is far from zero.
first amendment rights are not jeopardized when it comes to those wage and hour newspaper is not protected by the first amendment against having to pay more money to its freedom of the press is jeopardized when the employees primary demand is for the publisher to cede control of her newspaper content.in sum,we do not share the view of the dissenting opinion that the ability to control its content would not be put in at least some risk by the requested injunction.as a result,we agree with the district court that overstreet heightened equitable relief standard applies.
b.the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding the equities did not weigh in favor of granting relief 
the district court concluded that the regional director failed to meet the heightened burden for interim relief,given the first amendment concerns it identified.though the district court may have been guided by the too lenient preliminary injunction standards of our cases,we will not disturb its denial of relief unless the denial itself constituted an abuse of discretion see am.trucking ass n,at the district court applied our approach,but because it denied relief that,itself,does not require reversal.if we would affirm the denial of an injunction under our prior standard,we would necessarily affirm the denial of that injunction under the more stringent winter standard.johnson couturier,cir affirming the grant of injunctive relief a lthough the validity of the district court approach was questionable,when its analysis impliedly supported the necessary finding of irreparable harm.
in light of the first amendment issues in this case,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to grant preliminary injunctive relief.the standard for such relief is a tough one,taking into account overstreet increased demands.see at w here,as here,there is at least some risk that constitutionally protected speech will be enjoined,only a particularly strong showing of likely success,and of harm to the defendant as well,could suffice.see also miller,at where the board and the respondent each make a showing of hardship,the district court must exercise its sound discretion to determine whether the balance tips in the board favor.accord winter.at in each case,courts must balance the competing claims of injury and must consider the effect on each party of the granting or withholding of the requested injunctive relief.internal quotation marks omitted.
we start the analysis,as did the district court,by considering the likelihood of success.in this case,success for the regional director is defined by whether the board would adopt the findings and recommendations of the alj and whether,in that event,our court would conclude that the board order should be enforced.
as a preliminary matter,we note that we do not presume that the regional director position will ultimately be adopted by the board.a board itself deciding to file a section j petition might signal its future decision on the merits,assuming the facts alleged in the petition withstand examination at trial.see overstreet,at.in this case,however,the board initially declined to file a petition for relief.it was only after the board delegated its authority to its general counsel that a petition for interim relief was actually filed.see id.remarking that since regional directors determine whether to file section l petitions such filings suggest nothing about how the board will ultimately resolve the case.the fact that the general counsel issued a complaint and an alj ruled in favor of the general counsel by no means foreordains the board decision.id.
for the most part,the district court appeared to address the factors relevant to the question of likelihood of success within its discussion of overstreet application in light of the first amendment interests implicated by the requested relief.having already concluded that the first amendment rights of the were at risk of being infringed,the district court simply concluded that it could not find that the regional director has such a strong likelihood of success as to presume irreparable harm.mcdermott,dist.lexis,at.as revealed in its discussion of the subsequent factors,the most the district court appeared willing to grant the regional director position was the unexplored possibility that it presented serious questions going to the merits.id.at.under winter,of course,that would not be enough to support the entry of a preliminary injunction,regardless of the other factors.as suggested in our own discussion of overstreet above,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in this portion of its evaluation.
the next element to be considered is irreparable harm.the regional director contends that a failure to grant the requested injunction will result in irreparable harm to the discharged employees and the union collective bargaining efforts.the district court concluded,however,that entering a preliminary injunction would not actually make much difference,primarily due to the passage of time.specifically,the court found little basis to believe,given the long delay,that an interim order at this point will provide any genuine reassurance to employees beyond that provided by a final board order that unfair labor practices committed by the will be timely remedied.id.at.we do not disagree with that assessment.
we note that d elay by itself is not a determinative factor in whether the grant of interim relief is just and proper.aguayo ex rel.nlrb tomco carburetor,cir,overruled on other grounds by miller.the factor of delay is only significant if the harm has occurred and the parties can not be returned to the status quo or if the board final order is likely to be as effective as an order for interim relief.id.most of the delay in this case has resulted from the time taken by the litigation process itself,and the regional director can not be faulted for that.but at least some of the delay was caused by the regional director deferred petition for preliminary injunctive relief.
among other measures,the regional director requests reinstatement of eight employees who were discharged between october and february.the section j petition requesting the employees interim reinstatement was not filed until march,some to months after the employees were discharged.the regional director asserts that the decision to seek section j authorization was prudently postponed until the alj issued its decision,but in june,two months before the hearing before the alj,the board refused the regional director request for permission to bring a section j petition in this case.the board temporary delegation of authority to the general counsel to initiate section j proceedings became effective just two days after the alj decision was issued.the regional director waited over two months after that to file the instant petition.
under the circumstances,it is not apparent to us that the district court was wrong in concluding that a preliminary injunction would not actually make a practical difference here.at this point,the parties appear to be waiting for the board adjudication.it seems unlikely that a final order of the board would be any less effective as a result of the denial of interim relief.
moving to the balance of hardships,the district court concluded that the balance did not tip sharply in favor of granting equitable relief,again applying the standard under which preliminary injunctive relief could be supported by serious questions on the merits plus a strong showing of irreparable harm and a sharp tipping of the balance of hardships.we are not entirely confident that the district court gave appropriate weight to the rights of the discharged employees in weighing this balance,because it appeared to express equal concern for what would happen to the jobs of employees hired by the to replace the discharged union members.the rights of improperly discharged employees,assuming they were in fact wrongfully terminated,are superior to those of their replacements.aguayo,at.primarily,though,the district court focused on what is,in fact,the primary conflict here the rights of the employees to organize versus the right of the newspaper to exercise and defend what it asserts are its first amendment rights.we agree with the district court determination that the regional director has not made a showing that the balance of hardships tips in his favor to the degree that would be necessary to support the interim relief sought here 
iii.conclusion 
in sum,we affirm the district court denial of the regional director section j petition for interim relief.the factual findings on which its decision rests are not clearly erroneous.the district court correctly applied overstreet increased demands given the first amendment concerns at issue and did not abuse its discretion in concluding that relief was not just and proper based on its assessment of the traditional equitable factors.
the majority relies on cases in which the party seeking an injunction was attempting to enjoin speech,claiming the result here necessarily follows from cases reviewing a decision forcing a union to cease expressing its views through bannering,overstreet united of carpenters,local union,cir,seeking to compel a newspaper to publish content from a political candidate,miami herald publ g tornillo,or reviewing an order requiring a newspaper to resume publishing a weekly column to which it objected,passaic daily news nlrb.in other words,the majority finds the grounds for its conclusion in cases seeking to enjoin or compel speech or its content.
this is not such a case.the injunction here only seeks reinstatement for terminated employees.period.it does not enjoin speech.rather,the injunction addresses troublesome,retaliatory terminations and disciplinary actions the took only after union organizing began.the injunction addresses terms and conditions of employment,and it leaves the right to publish its desired content entirely intact under the injunction,the was and is perfectly free to insist on total editorial control in labor negotiations,leaving it able to lockout employees who do not agree to such terms.
the sees this case as one in which it may have to withstand economic pressure from its employees who are unhappy with the paper management.exerting such pressure is the very essence of union activity.t he reason for labor organizations is to give laborers opportunity to deal on an equality with their employer.nlrb jones laughlin steel.where,as here,an injunction does not implicate first amendment concerns,this core purpose of the national labor relations act nlra is properly protected through a section j injunction when organizing employees are fired because of their union activities.
three facts are critical here.first,this case is not about the six editors and reporters who resigned citing editorial differences with the.it is about the eight newsroom employees who responded to what they saw as arbitrary management by seeking union protection,and were then fired for their union activities.second,only after the fired employees engaged in the protected union activity did the bring any issue regarding their alleged bias or disloyalty to the employees attention or note such issues in their personnel files.third,examining these facts in a thoughtful,opinion,following a trial,the alj concluded the committed numerous unfair labor practices,and the employees union activities prompted the challenged actions.the alj thus recommended relief,including reinstatement of the eight discharged employees.
deference to the board 
the majority opinion turns in part on finding overstreet controlling.however,beyond the magic words of the national labor relations act and the first amendment,the facts of overstreet,a secondary boycott case,are fundamentally different 
in overstreet,the outcome turned in part on whether the union bannering activities constituted threaten ing,coerc ing,or restrain ing any person engaged in commerce under section b ii of the nlra.the opinion characterized those words as vague and their application as far from.overstreet,at.given this ambiguity,the court inquired into whether the board proposed construction of the act would give rise to serious constitutional questions and therefore require construing ambiguous statutory language to avoid such questions.id.at quoting nlrb catholic bishop of chicago.overstreet held serious constitutional questions are implicated where an injunction would present a significant risk that the first amendment will be infringed even without deciding whether the proposed injunction would actually violate the first amendment.id.quoting catholic bishop of chicago,at.because one permissible interpretation of section b ii avoided those questions and the risk of infringing the first amendment,the court applied the uninfringing interpretation.see id at.
unlike overstreet,here,the nlra protections of employees rights to assist labor organizations and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection clearly apply to media employees,because the supreme court has held an agency of the press has no special immunity from application of the nlra or any general law.associated press nlrb,see nlra section.
section declaration of an unfair labor practice when employers interfere with,restrain,or coerce employees in the exercise of section rights by discrimination in regard to hir ing or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization,as the alj found the did here,unambiguously applies.see a.therefore,the overstreet standard should not guide the present outcome,and the board determination on the merits will be given considerable deference.miller ex rel.nlrb cal.pac.med,cir.
finding the overstreet standard inapplicable is further buttressed by comparing its facts to this case.in overstreet,the board sought an injunction prohibiting union bannering of retail stores selling products from firms with which the union had a labor dispute,pending nlrb resolution of the complaint.overstreet,at.the injunction thus had direct bearing on the union ability to continue its speech.that situation bears no resemblance to the facts in this case,an organizing case in which pretextually terminated employees are seeking reinstatement.indeed,the conceded at argument that the terms of the injunction do not require the paper to change its editorial policy,nor give employees the power to direct the editorial policy.overstreet thus has no application to an injunction which simply does not implicate the first amendment risk the alleges.
first amendment concerns 
the argues the nlra should yield to first amendment protections accorded the press in this case because of a publisher total discretion to determine the contents of its newspaper.the majority follows suit,noting the union campaign aspired in large part to compel the publisher of the to relinquish editorial control over its free reporting of the news.the contends that unlike associated press,where the ap sought a blanket entitlement to discharge the employee,this case directly concerns the full freedom and liberty of a newspaper to publish the news as it desires and to control the editing and rewriting of news for publication.put another way,the,and the majority,find distinguishing between an injunction reinstating employees,and an order dictating what a newspaper must publish,a distinction without a difference.i disagree.
the alj found all eight employees were fired because of their union activities and the allegations of biased reporting pretextual as in associated press,therefore,this case does not present the question of whether congress has the power to interdict an employee discharge if a newspaper believed its policy of impartiality was likely to be subverted by an employee continued service.at.unlike the order requiring a newspaper to reinstate a columnist and resume publication of his weekly column at issue in passaic,at,the injunction the regional director sought here would only have required the to rehire reporters,leaving intact all of its policies and procedures related to article publication and editorial approval process.on remand after passaic,an order requiring the newspaper to restore the columnist to his position and decide whether to publish his submissions based upon any factors other than his union or protected activity went unchallenged.herald news,nlrb.
indeed,as the district court acknowledged,the injunctions at issue in miami herald publishing tornillo,at,and passaic sought in some fashion to force publication of specific content by the newspapers at issue,thus actually directing the publishers exercise of their editorial discretion,whereas the injunction sought in this case seeks to prevent respondent only from disciplining its employees who engaged in activities aimed to pressure it into limiting its exercise of its editorial discretion.mcdermott ex rel.nlrb ampersand publ g llc,dist.lexis,at.may.the district court nevertheless concluded that because these demands were not mere requests but were instead backed by public concerted activity placing economic pressure on the to acquiesce,the sought after injunction amounts to state action limiting respondent ability to combat pressure placed on it to limit its exercise of editorial discretion.id.at.
the argues along similar lines,claiming it has a first amendment right to discharge its employees notwithstanding any provision of the nlra because of their collective advocacy of a boycott directed,in part,toward forcing the to reestablish certain journalistic standards.citing newspaper guild,local nlrb,the district court accepted this argument,noting the circuit required the board to strike a balance between an employer freedom to manage his business in areas involving the basic direction of the enterprise and the right of employees to bargain on subjects which affect the terms and conditions of their employment.ampersand,dist.lexis,at quoting newspaper guild,at.citing the inapposite tornillo opinion,the majority similarly concludes the injunction here would remov e an otherwise available weapon to resist employees attempts to seize control over the newspaper content.
contrary to these assertions,the director has not sought to force the to capitulate to its employees demands.in fact,unlike in newspaper guild,the director has not even ordered the to bargain over these demands in good faith.newspaper guild,at.the proposed injunction would allow the to continue to operate without a firewall between the editorial and news departments if it so chose.it would also leave the with complete editorial control,including what kind of opinion pieces,if any,to publish in relation to its disputes with its employees.the and the majority are essentially arguing for a newspaper first amendment right to be free from its employees public criticism of its practices because their criticism and call for a boycott is coercive.the argues it must be free to respond to this economic coercion with discharge or other economic weapons of its own or else it will have no choice but to capitulate.
in concluding t he injunction the regional director seeks here would prevent the from taking action against employees,the majority proves too much.a company always has the legal right to discipline an employee in a nondiscriminatory fashion for improper conduct.further,any company subject to a j injunction is theoretically subjected to the risk of which the complains.nlrb,cir.
in addition,employees generally may advocate a boycott of the employer product,as long as the boycott is tied to a labor dispute and does not disparage the employer product.firestone tire rubber,nlrb,enforced,f d cir.consumer boycotts pressure,but do not compel,targeted employers to capitulate to employees demands,whether those demands relate to traditional compensation matters or to other terms of employment.there is no more reason to expect the would be forced to agree to reestablish a firewall than to expect it to be forced to capitulate to employees other contract demands.employees who desire to bargain over policies related to journalistic integrity should not thereby be stripped of their section rights.even if,as in newspaper guild,a balancing between an employer freedom to manage his business and the right of employees to bargain were required,f d at,an employer desire to be free from public criticism of its practices is not equivalent to its first amendment right to choose what to publish on its pages.it thus does not outweigh employees nlra rights to protest or bargain over the conditions of their employment.
given the limited scope of the injunction and the employees clear right to organize,there is no significant risk of a first amendment infringement due to the requested relief,and,therefore,the criteria for considering the injunction should have been applied with the typical deference to the board.see miller,at.
balancing of equitable criteria 
by necessity,the granting of injunctive relief requires adjustment of the parties rights without full adjudication of the facts.yet here we benefit from the alj having created a substantial factual record to overlay against the requirements of equity practice.hecht bowles.when determining whether interim relief under j is just and proper,district courts should consider traditional equitable criteria through the prism of the underlying purpose of j,which is to protect the integrity of the collective bargaining process and to preserve the board remedial power while it processes the charge.miller,at.
in winter natural resources defense council,the supreme court clarified the traditional equitable criteria,explaining a party seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits,that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief,that the balance of equities tips in his favor,and that an injunction is in the public interest,
rejecting overstreet applicability in this case,i would find the district court abused its discretion in denying the injunction.though the district court was conscientious in its analysis,finding the director unlikely to prevail on the merits was grounded in the erroneous legal premise that employees attempts to negotiate aspects of the editorial process strip them of the nlra protection.with the proper protection and deference to the board in place,the alj findings show a clear likelihood of success on the merits,and the other equitable factors are met as well.
when concluding overstreet standard of review does not apply,courts view the director probability of prevailing in light of the fact that ultimately,the board determination on the merits will be given considerable deference.miller,at.here,the alj extensive factual findings detail a variety of unfair labor practices orchestrated by the and include reasonable findings that key testimony offered on the behalf was not credible and the justifications advanced for its actions were in large part pretextual.
under the facts here there are multiple irreparable injuries due to the terminations and subsequent rejection of the injunction.to permit illegal employer conduct to go unaddressed while the board corrective machinery grinds toward resolution would subvert the underlying purposes of section j and allow those who commit unfair labor practices to reap the benefits of that conduct.scott ex rel.nlrb stephen dunn,cir.thus,unlawful,unremedied discharges create adverse impacts on employees interests in union organizing,and the union ability to bargain irreparably deteriorates as this situation is allowed to continue.see pye ex rel.nlrb excel case ready,cir t he discharge of active and open union supporters risks a serious adverse impact on employee interest in unionization and can create irreparable harm to the collective bargaining process.internal quotation marks omitted,at as time passes the likelihood of union formation diminishes,and the likelihood that the employees will be irreparably deprived of union representation increases.
an unlawful discharge also causes the irreparable harm of removing union supporters from the workplace at the time when the union is in most need of support.see,f d at.here,the longer the complaint sits with the board without action,the weaker the union appears to remaining employees and the less energy exists in support of unionization,injuries that are immeasurable and irreparable.
the balance of hardships and the public interest also tip in favor of ensur ing that an unfair labor practice will not succeed because declining to issue the injunction will permit the allegedly unfair labor practice to reach fruition and thereby render meaningless the board remedial authority.miller,at.
the majority puts significant emphasis on the board delay in filing an injunction,citing the passage of time as the only factor supporting its conclusion that denial of the injunction resulted in no irreparable harm.yet the majority entire discussion of the board delay and thus its entire discussion of irreparable harm cites only one case,and in that case this court actually rejected the argument the majority recycles regarding the importance of the board delay in filing the injunction.
in aguayo ex rel.nlrb tomco carburetor,cir,overruled on other grounds by miller,at,we dismissed an argument made pursuant to the fifth circuit decision in boire pilot freight carriers,which,like the majority,found board delay critical to denying an injunction,see,cir.we noted the delay argument was not persuasive,stating d elay by itself is not a determinative factor in whether the grant of interim relief is just and proper.aguayo,at.yet the majority references aguayo and then proceeds to reason from the premise aguayo rejected,claiming the board delay is so important here that it constitutes the entire irreparable harm analysis.
perhaps the majority cites no cases for this proposition because we have specifically rejected the reasoning underlying an approach attaching such importance to board delay.we have previously noted that the view boire and the majority advance actually hinders rather than protects the collective bargaining process because the underlying purposes of section j are to protect the integrity of the collective bargaining process and to preserve the board remedial power while the board resolves the unfair labor practice charge.scott,at quoting miller,at.
