introduction 
the federated university police officers association fupoa,a labor union representing university of california uc police officers,has filed a petition for writ of mandate from a trial court order requiring the release of unredacted reports containing the names of uc police officers under the california public records act cpra,et.the public records requests were made by real parties in interest los angles times communications llc and the mcclatchy company doing business as the sacramento bee newspapers,to gain access to complete,unredacted versions of two reports commissioned by the university of california board of regents the regents.the reports studied a november,incident on the uc davis campus during which uc davis police officers were videotaped pepper spraying demonstrators who were nonviolently protesting escalating college costs on the uc davis campus pepper spray incident.the reports reviewed the facts leading up to the pepper spray incident,made conclusions regarding responsibility for the incident,and concluded with policy recommendations to ensure that such a polarizing incident did not reoccur.however,the names of more than a dozen uc police officers who planned,participated in,witnessed the pepper spray incident were redacted from the reports.
in seeking writ relief,fupoa asserts that the court erred in ordering disclosure because the redaction of the officers names was necessary to protect the confidentiality of their personnel records as required under penal code section,subdivision a the union argues that the officers identities can only be disclosed pursuant to the procedures set out in evidence code sections through for granting a motion under pitchess superior court cal d pitchess.
we agree with the trial court that the identities of the officers named in the reports must be disclosed because this information does not fall within any category of exempted information under section,subdivision a.consequently,fupoa request for writ relief is denied.
facts and procedural history 
on november,a uc davis police officer,later identified as lieutenant john pike pike,was videotaped methodically pepper spraying a row of nonviolent,seated protestors at close range after they failed to obey orders to disperse.the pepper spray incident took place after the students and their supporters had gathered on the campus to protest rising college costs.videotapes of the spraying of the demonstrators were posted on the internet and went viral,triggering widespread criticism of how the police handled the protest.
in response,uc president mark yudof announced that he had hired former new york city police commissioner and los angeles police chief william bratton and his consulting company,kroll,to provide the chancellor and the entire university of california community with an independent,unvarnished report about what happened at davis.he also announced the appointment of former california supreme court justice cruz reynoso to chair a task force the reynoso task force to examine the pepper spray incident.
the reynoso task force was comprised of a of individuals from the uc davis community,including students and academic officials.president yudof asked the reynoso task force to receive and review the report from kroll concerning the pepper spray incident,to issue findings regarding responsibility,and to provide recommendations to uc davis chancellor linda katehi and president yudof on improvements to police procedures,command protocols,and campus policies that would help ensure the rights and safety of nonviolent protestors in the future.
in preparing its report,kroll interviewed approximately uc police officers about the pepper spray incident.the officers were ordered by the uc davis acting chief of police to appear for an interview with kroll and to cooperate with their sic investigation however,the officers were assured that uc will not use any information that you provide to kroll against you in any disciplinary proceeding.additionally,kroll did not interview police officers who were the target of any citizen complaints,or the subject of any internal affairs investigations with respect to their role in the pepper spray incident.the kroll report states as personnel investigations are deemed confidential under california law,this report does not include information obtained from any interview of any officer whose use of force is being reviewed or who has been deemed a potential subject of discipline only witness officers have been interviewed.
furthermore,while kroll obtained documents from uc davis,its investigation was conducted without uc davis sharing any information generated by the internal affairs process.the kroll report states,t he kroll team has had virtually no contact with the internal affairs ia investigative team.the ia investigative team has not provided or shared any information with the kroll team including a witness list.basically,as clarified in the kroll report,the report of the internal affairs investigation will be confidential,pursuant to california law,while the kroll report is intended to be public.
the kroll report is extensive and detailed.it collects and recites facts regarding all aspects of the incident,including how the uc davis administration process worked the administration communicated instructions to the uc police officers,including the content of those instructions and the uc police officers planned and executed the clearing of demonstrators from the campus.following this careful recital of facts,the kroll report provides an analysis,in which the report discusses a cascading series of errors which set the stage for the use of pepper spray.the kroll report identifies three types of failures that set the stage for the use of pepper spray failures of leadership,failures of communication and failures of documentation.
consistent with the kroll report declared limited mission,it does not recommend any discipline for any police officer,stating it was not address ing the issue of discipline to be imposed,if any,on individual officers for any use of force that occurred on november.instead,it restricts its recommendations to by the uc davis administration,the statewide reorganization of the uc police force,and proposed training for uc police officers.
the reynoso task force report the reynoso report derives its facts entirely from the kroll report.it contains one blunt overall finding the incident that took place on november,should and could have been prevented.original boldface.the reynoso report assigns responsibility to nearly everyone involved in the pepper spray incident,from the uc davis campus administration to the police officers who were on duty that day.after considering various decision points occurring during the incident,the reynoso report describes how and why those decisions were made by specific individuals.the report then assigns responsibility to specific individuals,including police officers,for these failed decisions.several pages of recommendations are made for the uc davis administration,the uc davis police,as well as the uc system in general.however,the reynoso report clarifies that t he charge to the task force did not include requesting recommendations for disciplinary action.
the kroll report and the reynoso report the reports were issued on april.when issued,the names and ranks of all of the officers both witness and subject officers were redacted with the exception of two individuals whose identities were widely known,pike the officer captured on the video recording actively participating in the pepper spray incident,and davis police chief annette spicuzza.instead of identifying the officers by name,pseudonyms are used,such as officer f successfully removed arrestees from the site and i f lts.sic pike and officer p had been aware of officer f success,they may have considered a different tactic.
the redaction of the officers names in the reports was the result of the first round of litigation.fupoa and pike originally sought to stop the release of the reports in their entirety.they claimed t his relief is necessary to stop the unlawful release of confidential peace officer personnel information as protected by section,subdivision a.in this earlier action,the regents advocated for the publication of the reports without redaction of police officer names and ranks.however,the regents eventually agreed to a settlement with fupoa to end that litigation.the settlement allowed for the release of the reports,so long as the names and ranks of the police officers were redacted,other than pike and spicuzza.importantly,in making this settlement,the parties expressly agreed that it did not affect any obligation the regents might have to produce the requested records pursuant to the cpra.
after the reports were released,the newspapers submitted a series of requests under the cpra for the complete,unredacted versions.on may,the newspapers commenced the instant matter,and filed a verified petition for writ of mandate to compel uc to disclose the complete,unredacted reports.after a hearing,the court granted the petition,and ordered that the officers names be disclosed and that the pseudonyms be removed from the reports.the court concluded the names of officers were not made confidential by section,subdivision a,because the names were not records relating to complaints or investigations of complaints concerning an individual officer performance of duties.the court was not persuaded that either the l egislature or the california supreme court intended penal code section to apply whenever public entities conducted broad policy reviews that involve an examination of law enforcement policies,procedures,or actions and to preclude all public entities from disclosing the results of those reviews if the review touches however tangentially on the conduct of individual police officers.
in the trial court proceedings,fupoa also relied on certain exemptions to the cpra found in government code sections,subdivision c and,arguing that the officers faced a risk of harm if their names were disclosed,and that the alleged harm outweighed the benefit of disclosure.the court rejected this argument as well,pointing out that some of the officers names had been discovered not as a result of any action by the parties to this proceeding,and there was no evidence that they had been subject to intimidation or harassment.therefore,neither exception to the cpra applied.we note that there is no challenge in this writ proceeding to the court conclusion that fupoa had failed to demonstrate that any of the officers quoted or referred to in the reports were likely to suffer harmful consequences as a result of the disclosure of their names.
pursuant to government code section,subdivision c,the trial court stayed the effect of its order and judgment through july,to permit the filing of a petition for extraordinary writ relief to seek review of this ruling.on july,fupoa filed the instant petition for writ of mandate in this court seeking review of the trial court disclosure order.on july,we stayed the trial court order pending our decision.we also requested real parties in interest,the newspapers,to file opposition to the petition,and gave fupoa an opportunity to reply to the opposition.the regents also filed a brief indicating they were taking no position on the merits of this litigation,but stand ready to abide by the court ruling.
after reviewing the parties briefing,this court summarily denied the petition on september,but granted a stay so that fupoa could seek review of the matter by the california supreme court.fupoa then filed a petition for review in the california supreme court case no.on september.fupoa requested that the supreme court either grant and hold this matter until a decision is rendered by the supreme court in a case with a related,but not identical issue,long beach police officers association city of long beach,case no.or remand the case to this court for a decision on the merits.
on october,our supreme court unanimously granted review in this case,and transferred the matter back to this court with directions to vacate its order denying the petition for writ of mandate and to issue an order directing respondent superior court to show cause why the relief sought in the petition should not be granted.the supreme court also stayed the trial court june,order directing the regents to disclose the unredacted reports,including the names of police officers identified in the reports,pending further order of this court.
pursuant to the supreme court order,on october,this court vacated its order denying the petition for writ of mandate and ordered the superior court to show cause why the relief sought in the petition should not be granted.real parties in interest,the newspapers,filed a return to the petition on november,and fupoa filed a reply on december.on december,we granted permission for the american civil liberties union foundation of northern california,aclu to file an amicus curiae brief on behalf of the newspapers 
discussiona.the california public records act 
the cpra is based on the principle that access to information concerning the conduct of the public business is a fundamental and necessary right of every person in this state.as the california supreme court has explained implicit in the democratic process is the notion that government should be accountable for its actions.in order to verify accountability,individuals must have access to government files.such access permits checks against the arbitrary exercise of official power and secrecy in the political process.cbs,block cal d,fn.omitted cbs.to achieve these goals,the supreme court has declared that m aximum disclosure of the conduct of governmental operations is necessary.id.at.these policies are especially salient when the subject is law enforcement.in order to maintain trust in its police department,the public must be kept fully informed of the activities of its peace officers.citation.commission on peace officer standards training superior court cal th,post.
however,the right to obtain public records is not absolute,and in adopting the cpra,the legislature also declared it was mindful of the right of individuals to privacy.accordingly,the legislature enacted a number of exceptions that are designed to protect an individual privacy rights.one such exception protects from disclosure r ecords,the disclosure of which is exempted or prohibited pursuant to federal or state law,including,but not limited to,provisions of the evidence code relating to privilege,subd.k.this provision incorporates into its exemption the protections of section,subdivision a,making police personnel records confidential.city of richmond superior court th,city of richmond.
there is no dispute that the names of officers,who are referred to by pseudonyms in the reports,fall within the cpra broad coverage of public records,subd.e,nor is there any question that uc is an agency covered by the cpra,subd.d.consequently,the information requested by the newspapers must be disclosed unless the proponent of nondisclosure,in this case fupoa,meets its burden of showing that one of the exemptions to the cpra applies.international federation of professional technical engineers,local,afl cio superior court cal th,cbs broadcasting,superior court th,t he burden of proof of establishing that an exemption to the cpra applies is on the proponent of nondisclosure.in this regard,we emphasize an important rule of statutory construction in cpra cases that exemptions from the general rule of disclosure are construed narrowly.sacramento county employees retirement system superior court th,brv,superior court th,same bakersfield city school dist.superior court th,same.this rule of construction serves as the predicate for this court determination of whether the statutory exemption for peace officer personnel records codified in section,subdivision a,can be interpreted as exempting the names of officers interviewed and referred to in the reports.
legislative enactment of section,subdivision a and standard of review 
california law governing the protection of police personnel records is found in a series of statutes enacted in,specifically sections and,and evidence code sections through.warrick superior court cal th,warrick.these statutes are commonly referred to as pitchess statutes in reference to the california supreme court case pitchess,supra,cal d.in pitchess,our supreme court recognized the right of criminal defendants,who are entitled to a fair trial and an intelligent defense in light of all relevant and reasonably accessible information,to discover the contents of a peace officer personnel records in order to perfect and develop claims that the defendants were acting in.id.at.
following the pitchess decision,criminal defendants began to make fishing expeditions for information from police officer personnel files to determine if the arresting officers had faced complaints made by others.in response,rather than produce the documents as required by pitchess,certain police agencies began engaging in wholesale shredding of personnel files.city of san jose superior court cal th,san francisco police officers superior court d.the statutory scheme addressed this situation by requiring that citizen complaints of police misconduct be preserved.at the same time,the pitchess statutes sought to protect police officers strong privacy interest in their personnel records by providing that,under evidence code sections through,discovery could not be made without intervention of a neutral trial judge,who examines the personnel records in camera and orders disclosed to the defendant only those records that are found both relevant and otherwise in compliance with statutory limitations.in this manner,the legislature has attempted to protect a criminal defendant right to a fair trial and the officer interest in privacy to the fullest extent possible.citation.people mooc cal th,mooc.
in enacting these statutes,the major focus of the legislature was the type of record at issue in pitchess records of citizen complaints against police officers.post,supra,cal th at,italics added.the statutes ensured that these records were maintained,while at the same time providing assurances to police officers that citizen complaint records would remain confidential unless specific procedures were followed.see haggerty superior court th,haggerty warrick,supra,cal th at mooc,supra,cal th at.
while the parties briefs on appeal debate the competing policy arguments favoring or opposing disclosure of the officers identities in this case,in enacting the pitchess statutes,the legislature itself made the necessary policy choices when it decided which information should be public and which information should be exempt from disclosure.see post,supra,cal th at in enacting pitchess statutes,the legislature drew the line carefully,with due concern for the competing interests.having made those policy choices,this case turns on whether,as a matter of statutory interpretation,the exemption provided by section,subdivision a,applies to protect the officers identities in this case.this is a legal question,and is accorded de novo review.mkja,fit franchising,llc th.

scope of confidentiality under section,subdivision a 
in this request for writ relief,fupoa makes a single argument that all of the names of the officers that were redacted from the reports were protected information and not subject to disclosure under section,subdivision a.it is generally recognized that there are two broad categories of information protected from disclosure by section,subdivision a records relating to a mandated investigation of citizens complaints against an officer as defined in section and police personnel records,meaning records maintained under an officer name by his or her employer and containing personal data and employment history,including disciplinary documentation,as defined in section,subdivisions a through f.rosales city of los angeles th,quoting city of richmond superior court th,section imposes confidentiality upon peace officer personnel records and records of investigations of citizens complaints.importantly,as we have already noted,these exemptions are to be narrowly construed.
citizens complaints 
as for the first category of exempted material,section,subdivision a provides,in pertinent part,r ecords maintained by any state or local agency pursuant to section,or information obtained from these records,are confidential and shall not be disclosed in any criminal or civil proceeding except by discovery pursuant to sections and of the evidence code.italics added.section requires all departments or agencies that employ peace officers to establish procedures to investigate allegations of officer misconduct,subd.a,and to preserve records from their investigations for at least five years,subd.b.therefore,under section,subdivision a,the records of an investigation stemming from a citizen complaint,which potentially could be relevant to a criminal defendant defense in a pitchess proceeding,are considered confidential and exempt from disclosure as part of an officer personnel records.
fupoa claims that berkeley police city of berkeley th berkeley police,stands for the broad proposition that any investigative materials and findings that concern a police officer are confidential.this is not a fair reading of berkeley police rationale,nor is that case factually similar to our own.there,the court was required to address whether the proceedings conducted by a police review commission,which was established to investigate citizens complaints,but not to impose discipline,fell within section.in that case,the commission was a standing body that received written complaints from citizens,investigated the substance of the allegations,held public hearings on the complaints,required the subject officers to provide information,and then announced its findings on each allegation,which could be exonerated,unfounded,not sustained,or sustained.id.at.not surprisingly,the court in berkeley police found that the commission proceedings fit the description of a section proceeding,and the commission practice of holding public hearings on citizen complaints necessarily violated section,subdivision a,by disclosing confidential police officer personnel information,including the identity of the officer subject to the complaint.id.at.
in contrast to berkeley police,the reports here are not the result of an investigation of any citizen complaint under section.moreover,nothing in the reports identifies any officer who was the subject of a citizen complaint,or who was disciplined in connection with the pepper spray incident.to the contrary,even if a citizen had submitted a complaint about a specific officer conduct in connection with the pepper spray incident,it is clear from the text of the reports that they were not prepared in response to any such complaint,but were prepared at the behest of uc for other purposes,and using entirely different protocols from those commonly involved in conducting disciplinary investigations or proceedings.
thus,unlike a citizen complaint procedure,which addresses a specific complaint about a specific police officer actions,the reports focus took a larger view and examined the internal workings of the uc and the uc davis police department.they assessed how the policies and procedures that were in effect on november,influenced how the police officers handled the protestors,and whether institutional changes were appropriate.most telling,while the reports make policy level recommendations,they expressly do not make any recommendations regarding whether it was appropriate to admonish or discipline any police officer in conne
