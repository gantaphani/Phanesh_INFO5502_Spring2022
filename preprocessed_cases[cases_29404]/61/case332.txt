this appeal concerns the restriction on viewing lethal injection executions imposed on the public and the press by san quentin institutional procedure.we hold that procedure is an exaggerated,unreasonable response to prison officials legitimate concerns about the safety of prison staff and thereby unconstitutionally restricts the public first amendment right to view executions from the moment the condemned is escorted into the execution chamber.
factual and procedural background 
in assessing the reasonableness of procedure viewing restriction,it is helpful to understand the execution process.california executions take place in san quentin state prison,in a sealed octagonal room that has four large windows facing an adjoining witness area.the witness area accommodates as many as people to watch the execution,including four prison guards,official witnesses,news media witnesses and up to five individuals requested by the prisoner.a curtain may be drawn over the windows to obscure the witnesses view of the execution chamber.approximately minutes before the execution is scheduled to take place,four guards escort the condemned inmate from a special overnight holding cell to the execution chamber.though his legs are free,the condemned is handcuffed and his wrists are shackled to his waist.upon entering the execution chamber,the condemned is laid on a gurney,to which he is secured with six straps.next,two of the four guards leave and two medical technicians enter to insert two intravenous lines one is redundant,in the event the main line fails.once the intravenous lines are inserted,a saline solution begins to flow into the inmate veins and all staff exit the chamber.the warden then gives the order to dispense a progression of pentothal,to render the inmate unconscious,followed by pancuronium bromide,to stop his lungs,and finally potassium chloride,to stop his heart.
historically,representatives of the public and the press have been allowed to witness california entire execution process from start to finish.during the era of the gas chamber beginning in,that meant watching the prison staff escort the prisoner into the execution chamber the same chamber where lethal injection executions now take place,strap him into the chair and administer the lethal gas until he was declared dead.however,for the execution of william first lethal injection execution in quentin officials implemented procedure,which prohibits witnesses from observing the execution until after the execution team members exit the chamber.thus,witnesses were not permitted to watch bonin as the guards brought him into the chamber,tied him down to the gurney,inserted the intravenous lines and left him alone to await the warden order to dispense the chemicals.rather,by the time prison officials opened the chamber curtains,permitting the witnesses to see inside the chamber,bonin lay motionless on the gurney,appearing to be asleep or sedated.bonin had not,in fact,been sedated.the lethal chemicals were then any announcement to the after several minutes,bonin was declared dead.the witnesses,therefore,observed bonin as he died,but were unable to see the processes leading to that point.
following bonin execution,the california first amendment coalition and the society of professional journalists,northern california chapter plaintiffs,whose members attend and report on executions in california,sued in federal court and obtained a preliminary injunction prohibiting the named prison officials defendants from preventing witness observations of executions from at least just before the time intravenous tubes are inserted to at least just after death.two days later,keith daniel williams was executed,and witnesses were permitted to observe the insertion of the intravenous lines.we affirmed the preliminary injunction in an unpublished memorandum disposition.cal.first amend.coalition calderon,wl cir,cal.first amend.i.
the district court subsequently granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs and entered a slightly broader permanent injunction,directing defendants to allow the witnesses to executions by lethal injection to view the procedure at least from the point in time just prior to the condemned being immobilized,that is,strapped to the gurney or other apparatus of death,until the point in time just after the prisoner dies.cal.first amend.coalition calderon.on appeal to this court,we reversed the district court summary judgment for plaintiffs because we concluded that procedure did the record then before the whatever first amendment right plaintiffs might have to view executions.rather,absent substantial evidence that procedure was an exaggerated response by prison officials to asserted concerns directly related to prison security,staff safety,and the orderly operation of the institutional procedure,we were prepared to defer to those officials.cal.first amend.coalition calderon,cir cal.first amend.iii internal quotation marks omitted.we remanded to the district court to determine whether plaintiffs have presented substantial evidence that procedure represents an exaggerated response to defendants security and safety concerns.id.at 
in accordance with our remand instructions,the district court heard evidence during two days of trial regarding the prison officials security and safety concerns and the reasonableness of procedure in addressing them.the district court agreed that ensuring prison staff safety is a legitimate safety concern,but found on the evidence presented that restricting public access to view lethal injection executions to a degree greater than that afforded to view lethal gas executions is an exaggerated response to defendants safety concerns.cal.first amend.coalition woodford,no,wl at.july,see also id.at discussing specific reasons for so finding.it therefore permanently enjoined the defendants from preventing uninterrupted viewing of executions from the moment the condemned enters the execution chamber through to,and including,the time the condemned is declared dead.id.at.
as a result of the appellate proceedings,which reversed the district court injunction,procedure was in effect at the executions of thomas thompson on july,jaturan siripongs on february,manuel babbitt on may,and darrell keith richard on march.following the district court entry of its injunction,california executed robert lee massie on march,and stephen wayne anderson on january.
standard of review 
we review de novo the constitutionality of procedure,the district court conclusions of law and its determinations on mixed questions of law and fact.see neal shimoda,cir.we review the district court findings of fact for clear error,and we will not disturb those findings without a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.jones united states,cir.if the district court account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,we may not reverse even if we are convinced that had we been sitting as the trier of fact,we would have weighed the evidence differently.id.
the issues presented involve the balance between the state ability to carry out executions in a safe and orderly manner and the public right to be informed about how the state and its justice system implement the most serious punishment a state can exact from a criminal penalty of death.given our previous opinion in california first amendment iii,we do not write on a blank slate.nonetheless,because the issues are important and procedure will govern future,there have been seven during the pendency of this review the historical and constitutional context informing our analysis.
we first consider whether the public has a first amendment right to view executions.in california first amendment iii,we assumed without deciding that the public had a severely limited first amendment right to view executions.cal.first amend.iii,at.in section i,we reach the question and conclude that the public does indeed enjoy a first amendment right of access to view executions from the moment the condemned is escorted into the execution chamber.however,as we discuss in section we articulate the level of scrutiny that applies to procedure public right of access may be reasonably limited.finally,in section iii,we reach the merits of this case and determine that procedure is an exaggerated response to defendants legitimate penological concerns.
the first amendment right to view executions 
to challenge the constitutionality of procedure successfully,plaintiffs must demonstrate that they have a first amendment interest in viewing the portion of the execution that procedure seeks to conceal.it is that the first amendment guarantees the the qualified right of access to governmental proceedings see.superior court,d preliminary hearings.ii.superior court,d voir dire.i globe newspaper superior court,d testimony of child victim of sex offense richmond newspapers,virginia,d criminal trials.this right of access is premised on the common understanding that a major purpose of the first amendment was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs.globe newspaper,at.quoting mills alabama,d.by guaranteeing that the individual citizen can effectively participate in and contribute to our republican system of,the first amendment right of access ensures that this constitutionally protected discussion of governmental affairs is an informed one.id.at.citations omitted.therefore,although the right of access is not enumerated in the first amendment,it is encompassed within the amendment as a right that is nonetheless necessary to the enjoyment of other first amendment rights.id.at.
our precedent extends the right of access to a broad range of criminal proceedings.for example,we have recognized that the public and the press have a right of access to criminal proceedings and documents filed therein,and we have found no principled basis for affording greater confidentiality to documents and proceedings than is given to pretrial matters.cbs,united states dist.court,cir.we have also found a public right of access to pretrial suppression hearings,united states brooklier,cir,pretrial release proceedings and documents,seattle times united states dist.court,cir,transcripts of closed hearings that occurred during the course of jury deliberations,phoenix newspapers,united states dist.court,cir,and plea agreements and related documents,oregonian publ g united states dist.court,cir.
the question before us now is how the constitutional principles that animate granting public access to governmental those comprising the process of trying,convicting and sentencing criminal over to the process of executing a condemned inmate within the confines of the prison.both the supreme court and this circuit have held that,under the first amendment,there are at least qualified rights of access to gather information from prison inmates and to observe some prison operations.in pell procunier,the court recognized that the conditions in this nation prisons are a matter that is both newsworthy and of great public importance.id.at.in affirming the california prison regulation prohibiting interviews between the press and individual inmates,the court noted that this regulation is not part of an attempt by the state to conceal the conditions in its prisons or to frustrate the press investigation and reporting of those conditions.indeed,the record demonstrates that both the press and general public are accorded full opportunities to observe prison conditions.id.at.the court similarly stressed in saxbe washington post,d,that,except for the nearly identical federal regulation forbidding interviews between the press and individual inmates,members of the press are accorded substantial access to the federal prisons in order to observe and report the conditions they find there.id.at.as emphasized in california first amendment iii,the supreme court has never flatly held that the press has no first amendment right to view events inside prison walls only that such a right is with the public right to the same information.at 
finally,two complementary considerations inform our determination that the public has a first amendment right of access to governmental proceedings in general and executions in california in particular whether the place and process have historically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant positive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.ii,at.the supreme court test leads us to conclude that the public has a first amendment right to view executions.
a.the historical tradition of public access to executions 
historically,executions were open to all comers.in england,from to,the city of tyburn hosted up to public executions.see john laurence,a history of capital punishment.the old bailey,opposite newgate,was the site of public executions from to.see id.at.tyburn and newgate both drew large and disorderly crowds in a crowd as large as congregated at newgate.see id.at see also david cooper,the lesson of the scaffold.
executions were fully open events in the united states as well.see john bessler,televised executions and the constitution recognizing a first amendment right of access to state executions,fed.comm,neil nussbaum,film at eleven does the press have a right to attend and videotape executions,cent,roderick patrick,hiding death,new eng.on crim.civ.confinement.california abolished public executions in,moving them within prison walls,and the last town square execution in the united states took place in.see bessler,fed.comm.at nussbaum,cent.at.approximately people watched a hanging in galena,missouri.nussbaum,cent.at.the year before,thousands observed a public hanging in owensboro,kentucky.id.
when executions were moved out of public fora and into prisons,the states implemented procedures that ensured executions would remain open to some public scrutiny.in abolishing public executions in,for example,california provided that a minimum of twelve respectable citizens should be present at the private execution.cal.first amend.iii,at noting also that the current version of the statute,code,is virtually identical to the statute.every state authorizing the death penalty currently requires that official witnesses be present at each execution.see bessler,comm.at.further,when public executions were first abolished in america,the press was still allowed to attend.see louis massur,rites of execution oxford university press.but see bessler,fed.comm.at noting that minnesota did not permit press access to executions holden,at.in california,the press has been a constant presence since executions were moved into prisons.cal.first amend.iii,at.currently,in addition to the official witnesses who attend california executions,news media witnesses are also invited.thus,there is a tradition of at least limited public access to executions.that only select members of the public attend does not erode the public nature of official witnesses act as representatives for the public at large.richmond newspapers,at.noting that people now acquire information about trials chiefly through the media rather than first hand,and validating the media claim that it functions as a surrogate for the public.
defendants argue that the public does not have a right to view the initial execution procedures,but rather only the execution itself,which defendants define as beginning when the lethal chemicals start to flow.this definition,however,is simply of defendants own making.the public and press historically have been allowed to watch the condemned inmate enter the execution place,be attached to the execution device and then die.as we noted in california first amendment iii,before california adopted the lethal gas method of execution,witnesses were permitted to view hangings in their entirety,from the condemned ascent up the gallows to the fall of the trap door.at.thereafter,witnesses were also permitted to observe lethal gas executions from the time the condemned was escorted into the gas chamber until pronouncement of death.id.accordingly,historical tradition strongly supports the public first amendment right to view the condemned as the guards escort him into the chamber,strap him to the gurney and insert the intravenous lines.
b.the functional importance of public access to executions 
independent public possible by the public and media witnesses to an a significant role in the proper functioning of capital punishment.an informed public debate is critical in determining whether execution by lethal injection comports with the evolving standards of decency which mark the progress of a maturing society.trop dulles,d.to determine whether lethal injection executions are fairly and humanely administered,or whether they ever can be,citizens must have reliable information about the initial procedures,which are invasive,possibly painful and may give rise to serious complications.globe newspaper,at.public scrutiny of a criminal trial enhances the quality and safeguards the integrity of the factfinding process,with benefits to both the defendant and to society as a whole.this information is best gathered or from the media,which serves as the public surrogate.see richmond newspapers,at.people in an open society do not demand infallibility from their institutions,but it is difficult for them to accept what they are prohibited from observing.further,public access fosters an appearance of fairness,thereby heightening public respect for the judicial process.globe newspaper,at.accord richmond newspapers,at.finally,public observation of executions fosters the same sense of catharsis that public observation of criminal trials fosters.although this may reflect the dark side of human nature,the supreme court has recognized that the public must be permitted to see justice done,lest it vent its frustration in extralegal ways.see richmond newspapers,at.the crucial prophylactic aspects of the administration of justice can not function in the dark no community catharsis can occur if justice is done in a corner or in any covert manner.internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.accordingly,the same functional concerns that drove the court to recognize the public right of access to criminal trial proceedings compel us to hold that the public has a first amendment right to view the condemned as he enters the execution chamber,is forcibly restrained and fitted with the apparatus of death.
because there is both an historical with entirely public executions and continuing with the practice of inviting official a functional importance of public access to executions,both prongs of the test articulated in the richmond newspapers line of cases have been satisfied.we therefore hold that the public enjoys a first amendment right to view executions from the moment the condemned is escorted into the execution chamber,including those initial procedures that are inextricably intertwined with the process of putting the condemned inmate to death.
the proper level of scrutiny 
given the public first amendment right to view executions,the question then is whether procedure permissibly burdens that right by prohibiting observers from seeing all of the proceedings in the execution chamber.in evaluating defendants justification for their restrictive policy,we must first address the proper level of scrutiny that governs our review.
under the public right of access line of cases,once the right of access attaches to a governmental proceeding,that right may be overcome only by an overriding interest based on findings that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.ii,at.internal quotation marks omitted accord press enter.i,at.see also globe newspaper,at.richmond newspapers,at.as richmond newspapers itself recognized,however,penal institutions by definition,are not open or public places.at.it is a truism that prisons are institutions where public access is generally limited.saxbe,at.internal quotation marks omitted.because the executions at issue here take place within prison walls,are administered by the same individuals who run san quentin and are staffed by the same personnel who participate in the daily operations of the prison,our level of scrutiny must be guided by the line of cases addressing constitutional challenges to prison regulations,rather than by those governing access to governmental proceedings.
the supreme court has formulated a unitary,deferential standard for reviewing prisoners constitutional claims.shaw murphy,d emphasis added.in general,federal courts take a attitude towards problems of prison administration because they are complex and intractable and,more to the point,they are not readily susceptible of resolution by decree.most require expertise,comprehensive planning,and the commitment of resources,all of which are peculiarly within the province of the legislative and executive branches of government.procunier martinez,d,limited on other grounds by thornburgh abbott,d accord lewis casey,d thomas,concurring.thus,in reviewing a challenge to a prison regulation that burdens fundamental rights,we are directed to ask whether the regulation is reasonably related to legitimate penological objectives,or whether it represents an exaggerated response to those concerns.turner safley,d quoting pell,at.the legitimate policies and goals of the corrections system are deterrence of future crime,protection of society by quarantining criminal offenders,rehabilitation of those offenders and preservation of internal security.pell,at.in determining whether a restriction on the exercise of rights is reasonable or exaggerated in light of those penological interests,four factors are relevant whether there is a valid,rational connection between the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental interest put forward to justify it whether there are alternative means of exercising the right that remain open to prison inmates what impact accommodation of the asserted constitutional right will have on guards and other inmates,and on the allocation of prison resources generally and whether there exist ready alternatives that fully accommodate the prisoner rights at de minimis cost to valid penological interests.turner,at.
the supreme court has never applied turner in a case such as this one,where the regulation promulgated by prison officials is centrally concerned with restricting the rights of outsiders rather than prisoners in procunier martinez,the supreme court held that regulations censoring outgoing prisoner mail must be justified by a showing that the regulation furthers an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of expression and that the limitation of first amendment freedoms must be no greater than is necessary or essential to the protection of the particular governmental interest involved.at.the court noted the argument that prisoners enjoy limited free speech rights,but it declined to adopt a more deferential approach on that basis,reasoning that w hatever the status of a prisoner claim to uncensored correspondence with an outsider,it is plain that the latter interest is grounded in the first amendment guarantee of freedom of speech.id.at.the court subsequently determined that,in light of turner,the standard of review advocated in martinez would be restricted to regulations concerning outgoing prisoner correspondence.abbott,at.the court also recognized,however,that w here,as in martinez,the nature of the asserted governmental interest is such as to require a lesser degree of discretion,a closer fit between the regulation and the purpose it serves may safely be required.id.at.emphasis added.
in california first amendment iii,we decided that the district court should apply pell deferential exaggerated response test the supreme court originally formulated to determine whether prisoners rights had been unconstitutionally restricted and that is incorporated in turner reasonableness standard.see cal.first amend.iii,at remanding case and quoting language of pell,at.see also turner,at.stating inquiry as whether a prison regulation that burdens fundamental rights is reasonably related to legitimate penological objectives,or whether it represents an exaggerated response to those concerns.we are bound by our previous panel decision.see united states scrivner,cir the law of the case doctrine provides that one panel of an appellate court will not as a general rule reconsider questions which another panel has decided on a prior appeal in the same case.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.therefore,we will apply the exaggerated response test here.however,our prior panel did not consider the relevance of the court statement in abbott that regulations that are broad in nature and do not require substantial discretion must exhibit a closer fit to their purported purposes.
as we shall see,procedure is by its nature similar in material respects to the outgoing correspondence regulation in every case it automatically censors a communication to outsiders that poses no serious threat to security inside the prison.pell,at.noting that the challenged regulation was not part of an attempt by the state to conceal the conditions in its prisons or to frustrate the press investigation and reporting of those conditions and that the press and public were accorded full opportunities to observe prison conditions.accordingly,as we review the district court findings,we shall do so with the supreme court own qualifier in a closer fit between procedure and defendants legitimate penological interest in the security of the execution team.
procedure is not reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest 
defendants try to our review,arguing that we are bound by the law of the case to reverse the district court conclusion that procedure is unconstitutional.isolating our statement that we hold that procedure does not violate the first amendment rights of the either the press or the public,at,defendants insist that california first amendment iii predetermined that procedure does not violate the first amendment.not california first amendment iii made clear that it was ruling on the limited record before it,a record it expressly recognized was subject to further development.id.at we do not have substantial evidence indicating an exaggerated response here emphasis added.indeed,we could not have been conclusively deciding the constitutional question,because we delegated that task in the first instance to the district court,remanding with the instruction to determine as a matter of fact whether procedure represented an exaggerated response to the defendants security concerns.id.the record we now review is different from the summary judgment record that was before us in california first amendment iii.whereas the california first amendment iii panel had before it declarations,submitted in support of the parties summary judgment papers,we now have before us the record of the bench trial,where the declarants testified live and were subjected to extensive.it is the superseding record upon which we determine procedure constitutionality.
we turn now to the central issue of whether procedure is a reasonable or an exaggerated response to legitimate penological concern for staff safety and institutional security.cal.first amend.iii,at.specifically,defendants have attempted to justify procedure as necessary to protect the anonymity of the execution staff,who,according to defendants,face possible retaliation from prisoners in the general population defendants assert for the first time in their reply brief on death penalty opponents.the district court agreed that ensuring staff safety is a legitimate safety concern,but found that defendants had presented no evidence that execution staff had ever been,or were ever likely to be,publicly identified or attacked.moreover,the district court with there was a ready alternative to procedure that would fully accommodate defendants concerns and plaintiffs first amendment interests at a de minimis cost.defendants assert that the suggested execution team members wear surgical garb to conceal their identities from the be ineffective and unsafe,but the district court found otherwise.finally,the district court found that procedure was motivated,at least in part,by a concern that the strapping of a condemned inmate,the injection of intravenous lines or other aspects of a lethal injection execution would be perceived as brutal by the public and thus was,to that extent,prompted by considerations other than legitimate concerns for prison personnel safety.cal.first amend.coalition woodford,wl at.as we explain,the district court factual findings are fully supported by the evidence and are not clearly erroneous.in light of those findings,we agree that procedure is an exaggerated response to defendants concerns about the safety of prison personnel.
valid,rational connection between the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental interest put forward to justify it 
as its third reason for striking down procedure,the district court found that the procedure was motivated at least in part by a desire to conceal the harsh reality of executions from the public.we find no clear error in the district court factual finding.however,even if we were to give defendants the benefit of the doubt by assuming that procedure is neutral and reflects their legitimate concern for the security of prison personnel,abbott,at,we must still conclude that it fails constitutional scrutiny.based on the evidence in the record,defendants fear that execution team members will be publicly identified and retaliated against is an overreaction,supported only by questionable speculation.moreover,procedure does not rationally address the purported problem.see morrison hall,cir explaining that the first turner prong requires the reviewing court to determine whether the defendant regulation is legitimate and neutral and assess whether there is a rational relationship between the governmental objective and the regulation internal quotation marks omitted.
ordinarily,even in the absence of or general social science evidence,as long as it is plausible that prison officials believed the policy would further a legitimate objective,the governmental defendant should prevail on turner first prong.frost symington,cir.however,if the regulation challengers present sufficient pre or post trial evidence that refutes the connection between a legitimate objective and a prison regulation,the state must present enough to show that the connection is not so remote as to render the policy arbitrary or irrational.id.quoting mauro arpaio,cir.
for several reasons,plaintiffs have refuted the connection between procedure and the safety of execution staff and demonstrated that the connection is too remote to satisfy turner first prong.first,witnesses were as likely to identify execution team members under the lethal gas regime and presumably during hangings,earlier as under the lethal injection regime.during lethal gas executions,execution team members were fully visible for at least one minute.yet warden vasquez testified at trial that it takes only a few seconds to catalog an individual defining physical features.indeed,during robert harris execution,witnesses saw the execution team escort harris into the chamber more than once.although lethal injection executions require the team to be present in the chamber for well more than one minute,the district court made three relevant findings that diminish the importance of this fact.first,the time for preparing inmates for execution by lethal injection has shortened with each execution.during the bonin execution,minutes passed between the time bonin entered the execution chamber and the time the saline solution was set and running,which is the point at which execution staff leave the chamber.similarly,during the williams execution,it took minutes to escort williams into the chamber,secure him to the gurney and insert the intravenous lines.for the siripongs execution,the same process took only minutes,and it took about six minutes for the babbitt execution.second,it takes only about one minute for ordinary medical personnel to insert an intravenous line.thus,the individuals who insert the intravenous lines into the inmates should not have to be present in the room for much longer than that amount of time.third,execution team members have their backs turned to the witnesses for most of their time in the chamber.thus,although the duration of exposure is greater,the evidence supports the district court finding that the difference between the potential for identification during lethal gas and lethal injection executions is not material.morrison,at rejecting prison argument that mail restriction was necessary to prevent introduction of contraband because defendants have failed to present any evidence that the risk of contraband in first or second class mail is any lower than the risk of contraband in mail that is sent bulk rate,third,or fourth class.
second,as the district court found,procedure contains loopholes that undermine its rationality and the credibility of defendants concerns for anonymity.most significantly,even with procedure in place,the condemned arguably has the strongest motive to seek the opportunity to disclose the execution team members identities to the outside world.warden woodford testified that m embers of the execution team are with the condemned inmate continuously from the day before the execution until the execution is completed after midnight.during this same period of time,the condemned inmate may freely call his attorney,friends and family.even though the inmate knows he is interacting with the same individuals who will ultimately put him to death,there is nothing to prevent him from revealing the at least detailed physical these execution team members.a similar loophole exists with respect to the five to ten prison guards who stand in the witness area during the entire execution.these guards have always been present and their physical features have never been concealed,even under procedure.
third,even assuming an execution team member were identified by a witness,the notion of retaliation is pure speculation.no execution team member has ever been threatened or harmed by an inmate or by anyone outside the prison because of his participation in an execution.the guards standing in the witness have always been visible to the witnesses for a prolonged period of never been threatened or harmed in any way.additionally,as the district court pointed out,there are also many individuals whose participation in the implementation of executions is essential,including the warden,the governor and judges of the courts who reject the condemned appeals.if defendants professed concern about politically motivated retaliation by death penalty opponents is to be credited,retaliation is at least as likely to be directed against these decision makers as against low level execution staff.yet defendants presented no evidence of such retaliation.pell,at.noting that restriction on media contact with prisoners was imposed in response to a violent episode and that prisoners who became virtual public figures often became the source of severe disciplinary problems turner,at.identifying specific security problems involving correspondence between inmate gang members.although prison officials may pass regulations in anticipation of security problems,casey lewis,cir friedman arizona,cir,they must at a minimum supply some evidence that such potential problems are real,not imagined.here,defendants fail to explain why we should disregard the history of safety surrounding those officials whose identities have always been publicly known.
in sum,defendants fear that execution team members will be identified and retaliated against is speculative and contradicted by history.this is relevant not only to our discussion of the first turner factor,but also to our conclusion in part ii,that procedure is analogous to the outgoing correspondence restriction in restriction reasonably implicates security inside the prison.see abbott,at.noting that outgoing correspondence by its very nature does not pose a serious threat to prison order and security even correspondence that magnifies grievances or contains inflammatory racial views can not reasonably be expected to present a danger to the community inside the prison emphasis in original.moreover,the connection between execution team safety and procedure is questionable in light of procedure loopholes.the turner reasonableness standard is not toothless,abbott,at,particularly as applied with martinez in mind.thus,although we credit defendants safety concerns to a point,we conclude that defendants failed to establish the requisite rational link between execution team safety and procedure.
we shall consider the remaining turner factors,although the first factor is arguably dispositive.compare morrison,at holding that once the first turner factor is resolved in either the plaintiff or defendant favor,other factors need not be considered,and prison legal news cook,cir the rational relationship of the turner standard is a sine qua non,with mayweathers newland,cir holding that plaintiffs had a strong likelihood of success on the merits of a prison regulation challenge even though the first turner factor favored governmental defendants.
alternative means of exercising the right 
of great significance,procedure prevents the public from having any knowledge of the events that take place behind the curtain.the witnesses may not observe the condemned inmate demeanor as he enters the execution chamber,has intravenous lines inserted into his body and realizes that the saline solution has begun to flow.the witnesses may not observe the manner of the guards as they restrain the prisoner.indeed,a memorandum from warden calderon,articulating his concerns about the present lawsuit,the district court procedure reflects defendants interest in avoiding any public perception that executions involve the use of excessive force 
in the event of a hostile and combative inmate,it will be necessary to use additional force and staff to subdue,escort and secure the inmate to the gurney.it is important that we are perceived as using only the minimal amount of force necessary to accomplish the task.in reality,it may take a great deal of force.this would most certainly be misinterpreted by the media and inmate invited witnesses who do appreciate the situation we are faced with.
because witnesses can not see the manner in which the intravenous lines are injected,they will not be privy to any complications that may arise during this initial,invasive procedure.consequently,the public will be forced to rely on the same prison officials who are responsible for administering the execution to disclose and provide information about any difficulties with the procedure.for example,during the bonin execution,the execution staff encountered difficulty in inserting the intravenous lines.the witnesses were unable to see for themselves whether bonin experienced pain as a result of the complications,or how severe the problem was,and instead had to rely on the prison officials version of events.procedure thus entirely eliminates independent,public eyewitness observation of several crucial steps of the execution process.
by way of contrast,in pell the court stressed that the inmates had at least two alternative means of communication with the media.first,the medium of written correspondence affords inmates an open and substantially unimpeded channel for communication with persons outside the prison,including representatives of the news media.at.second,inmates enjoyed an unrestricted opportunity to communicate with the press through their permitted visitors families,friends,clergy or attorneys.id.at.here,once the curtain is drawn,there is no alternative to accommodate the public first amendment right to view the execution.
we consider this factor to be particularly relevant because of our conclusion that it is critical for the public to be reliably informed about the lethal injection method of execution.in california first amendment iii,we noted that e yewitness media reports of the first lethal gas executions sparked public debate over this form of execution and the death penalty itself.at.an informed public debate is the main purpose for granting a right of access to governmental proceedings.prison officials simply do not have the same incentives to describe fully the potential shortcomings of lethal injection executions.as warden calderon memo demonstrates,a prison official perception of the execution process may be vastly markedly less that of the public.
c.the impact that accommodation would have
