when tragedy strikes and a family member suffers a violent death,we try to remember our dearly departed as they were in life,not as they were at the end.but suppressing gruesome mental images of their demise becomes difficult when autopsy or crime scene photographs are published for the world to see.we consider whether individuals have a federal privacy right to control public dissemination of a family member death images.
factual background 
in,brenda marsh son,phillip buell,died from a severe head injury while in the care of her,kenneth marsh.charged with phillip death,marsh claimed that phillip was injured when he fell off the couch and landed on the fireplace hearth.marsh was convicted of murder and imprisoned.almost two decades later,he filed a second habeas petition,which the san diego county superior court granted at the request of the san diego district attorney.the da expert could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that phillip was the victim of child abuse.marsh conviction was set aside and he was released.
after his release,marsh sued the county of san diego and the medical personnel who conducted phillip autopsy.during this proceeding,marsh attorneys deposed jay coulter,the san diego deputy district attorney who had prosecuted marsh for murder in.coulter disclosed that,while he was deputy district attorney,he photocopied sixteen autopsy photographs of phillip corpse.coulter also mentioned that,after he retired,he kept one of these as a memento of cases that i handled.coulter eventually gave a copy of this photograph,along with a memorandum he wrote titled what really happened to phillip buell,to a newspaper and a television station.
brenda marsh sued coulter and the county of san diego under alleging that the copying and dissemination of phillip autopsy photographs violated her fourteenth amendment due process rights.defendants moved to dismiss the claims relating to coulter conduct after he retired,which the district court granted.the parties then for summary judgment,which the district court granted in favor of defendants.marsh appeals.we review de novo.zimmerman city of oakland,cir motion to dismiss smolen deloitte,haskins sells,cir summary judgment.
ii.analysis 
to prevail under,a plaintiff must prove that he was deprived of a right secured by the constitution or laws of the united states,and that the alleged deprivation was committed under color of state law.am.mfrs.mut.ins.sullivan,d.a plaintiff must also show that the federal right was clearly established at the time of the violation,otherwise government officials are entitled to qualified immunity.see davis scherer,d.
federal right 
marsh claims she has a federal right to control the autopsy photographs of her child.she ca point to a federal statute guaranteeing this right,but she argues that such a right exists as a matter of substantive due process and also as a liberty interest protected by procedural due process.
substantive due process 
the supreme court has recognized that one aspect of the liberty protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment is a right of personal privacy,or a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy.carey population servs.int l,d quoting roe wade,d.this right to privacy protects two kinds of interests one is the individual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters,and another is the interest in independence in making certain kinds of important decisions.whalen roe,d footnote omitted.with respect to the latter,we held that the right encompasses the most basic decisions about family and parenthood california,cir see also roe,u.at noting that the constitutional right to privacy extends to marriage,procreation,contraception,family relationships,child rearing and education.
no court has yet held that this right encompasses the power to control images of a dead family member,but the supreme court has come close in a case involving the freedom of information act.in national archives and records administration favish,d,the court held that death scene photographs fell under an exemption to foia general requirement of public access to government information,which carved out law enforcement records or information that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.b c.the court found that the right to personal privacy included the surviving family members right to personal privacy with respect to their close relative death scene images.at.
the court had little difficulty finding in our case law and traditions the right of family members to direct and control disposition of the body of the deceased and to limit attempts to exploit pictures of the deceased family member remains for public purposes.id.at.family members have a personal stake in honoring and mourning their dead and objecting to unwarranted public exploitation that,by intruding upon their own grief,tends to degrade the rites and respect they seek to accord to the deceased person who was once their own.id.at finding the right grounded in the common law,the court had no need to determine whether it is also grounded in the constitution.see id.at it would be anomalous to hold in the instant case that the statute provides even less protection than does the common law.
other courts have also recognized family members privacy right in a decedent death images.see melton bd.of cnty.comm rs of hamilton,d,f amilies have a right not to be embarrassed or humiliated by the outrageous display or exposure to public view of the remains of a loved one.catsouras dep t of cal.highway patrol,th,d recognizing a violation of a right to privacy over death images where publicity ceases to be the giving of information to which the public is entitled,and becomes a morbid and sensational prying into private lives for its own sake,with which a reasonable member of the public,with decent standards,would say that he had no concern internal citations and quotation marks omitted.however,like favish,these cases described the common law right,not a constitutional right.so far as we are aware,then,this is the first case to consider whether the common law right to with a family remembrance of a decedent is so ingrained in our traditions that it is constitutionally protected.we conclude that it is.
a common law right rises to the level of a constitutional right if it is deeply rooted in this nation history and tradition,and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.washington glucksberg,internal citations and quotation marks omitted.the favish court considered our history and traditions,and found that th e cultural tradition acknowledging a family control over the body and death images of the deceased has long been recognized at common law.favish,at.for precisely the same reasons,we conclude that this right is also protected by substantive due process.
the tradition of respecting family members privacy in death images partakes of both types of privacy interests protected by the fourteenth amendment.first,the publication of death images interferes with the individual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters whalen,at.few things are more personal than the graphic details of a close family member tragic death.images of the body usually reveal a great deal about the manner of death and the decedent suffering during his final moments all matters of private grief not generally shared with the world at large.
second,a parent right to control a deceased child remains and death images flows from the substantive due process right to family integrity.see rosenbaum washoe county,cir the substantive due process right to family integrity or to familial association is well established.the interest of parents in the care,custody,and control of their children is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests troxel granville,d.a parent right to choose how to care for a child in life reasonably extends to decisions dealing with death,such as whether to have an autopsy,how to dispose of the remains,whether to have a memorial service and whether to publish an obituary.therefore,we find that the constitution protects a parent right to control the physical remains,memory and images of a deceased child against unwarranted public exploitation by the government.
to violate substantive due process,the alleged conduct must shock the conscience and offend the community sense of fair play and decency.rochin california.given that burial rites have been respected in almost all civilizations from time immemorial and are a sign of the respect a society shows for the deceased and for the surviving family members,the favish court reasoned that unwarranted public exploitation of death images degrades the respect accorded to families in their time of grief.favish,at.mutilation of a deceased family member body,desecration of the burial site and public display of death images are the kind of conduct that is likely to cause the family profound grief and therefore shocks the conscience and offend s the community sense of fair play and decency.rochin,at.
marsh claims that when she learned that coulter sent her son autopsy photograph to the press,she was horrified and suffered severe emotional distress,fearing the day that she would go on the internet and find her son hideous autopsy photos displayed there.marsh fear is not unreasonable given the viral nature of the internet,where she might easily stumble upon photographs of her dead son on news websites,blogs or social media websites.this intrusion into the grief of a mother over her dead son without any legitimate governmental purpose shocks the conscience and therefore violates marsh substantive due process right 
procedural due process 
the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment protects individuals against deprivations of life,liberty,or property.a liberty interest may arise from the constitution itself,by reason of guarantees implicit in the word liberty,or it may arise from an expectation or interest created by state laws or policies.wilkinson austin,d internal citations and quotation marks omitted.like property rights,liberty interests can be defined by state law.states may under certain circumstances create liberty interests which are protected by the due process clause.sandin conner,d.once a state creates a liberty interest,it ca take it away without due process.see swarthout cooke,d.a state official failure to comply with state law that gives rise to a liberty or property interest may amount to a procedural rather than substantive due process violation,which can be vindicated under.see carlo city of chino,cir.
not every state law respecting privacy will create a liberty interest protected by the constitution.state law can create a right that the due process clause will protect only if the state law contains substantive predicates governing official decisionmaking,and explicitly mandatory language specifying the outcome that must be reached if the substantive predicates have been met.james rowlands,cir quoting bonin calderon,cir.in order to contain the requisite substantive predicates,the state law at issue must provide more than merely procedure,it must protect some substantive end.bonin,at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
california code of civil procedure states 
n o copy,reproduction,or facsimile of any kind shall be made of any photograph,negative,or print,including instant photographs and video tapes,of the body,or any portion of the body,of a deceased person,taken by or for the coroner at the scene of death or in the course of a post mortem examination or autopsy made by or caused to be made by the coroner,except for use in a criminal action or proceeding in this state which relates to the death of that person,or except as a court of this state permits,by order after good cause has been shown and after written notification of the request for the court order has been served,at least five days before the order is made,upon the district attorney of the county in which the post mortem examination or autopsy has been made or caused to be made.
this section shall not apply to the making of such a copy,reproduction,or facsimile for use in the field of forensic pathology,for use in medical,or scientific education or research,or for use by any law enforcement agency in this or any other state or the united states.
the legislative counsel digest explained that the law serves california policy of protecting individuals and families against unconscionable invasions of their privacy and that t he reproduction,for unrelated or improper purposes,of any photograph of the body of a deceased person taken in the course of a post mortem examination or autopsy is contrary to such policy.the sponsoring,james bear,described the purpose of section as vindicating the family of a deceased person right of privacy to limit reproduction of gruesome autopsy photographs.thus,it clear that this law was intended to create a liberty interest in a family member death images.but to determine whether it is a liberty interest protected by the constitution,we must look for the required substantive predicates and mandatory language.james,at.
section meets the first requirement because it contains substantive limits on official discretion.the law provides that no copy of an autopsy photograph may be taken except for use in a criminal action or a proceeding related to the death of that person.the law thus provides substantive criteria whether an action is criminal or related to the death of the person that cabins an official discretion.see carlo,at.
section also satisfies the second requirement of explicit and mandatory language limiting an official discretion n o copy,reproduction,or facsimile of any kind shall be made of any autopsy photograph unless court approval is obtained or other specific exemptions apply.emphasis added.these exceptions limit the protected liberty interest by allowing the use of autopsy images in criminal trials relating to the decedent,with court approval,for use by law enforcement,or for medical and scientific education and research.id.
coulter initial use of the autopsy photographs in the section case against kenneth marsh was clearly for use in a criminal action or proceeding which relates to the death of that person,and is therefore exempted.marsh argues that coulter later instances of copying and distribution were not for permissible purposes under the statute.coulter argues that he was entitled to access the autopsy photographs after the trial concluded because kenneth marsh brought successive habeas petitions and so the photographs might be necessary for any.
it debatable whether coulter retention of phillip buell autopsy photograph after he retired is a violation of section.he had no need for the photograph for any criminal trial once he was no longer a prosecutor.but coulter claims that the photograph was part of his training materials for child abuse detection seminars,and therefore falls under section exemption for use in medical,or scientific education or research.marsh at least raises a triable issue of fact on whether coulter had a valid educational purpose in keeping the photograph after he retired.
it clear that coulter submission of the autopsy photograph to the press after he retired was not for legitimate law enforcement,criminal investigation or educational purposes.rather,it appears coulter was frustrated that kenneth marsh conviction was overturned,and wanted to prove that marsh was in fact guilty by publishing his story,what really happened to philip buell,along with what he thought was a damning photograph.coulter interest in being vindicated in the court of public opinion is not the type of use that section exempts.marsh sufficiently alleges a violation of section and,therefore,a deprivation of a liberty interest.
the district court held that section does not give rise to a liberty interest because it believed that constitutionally protected interests are limited to core prisoners rights.the court relied on sandin,where the supreme court explained that liberty interests will be generally limited to freedom from restraint which imposes a typical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.sandin,at.but this limitation only applies to cases involving prisons.sandin
