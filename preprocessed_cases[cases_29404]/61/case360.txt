this case involves the newsworthiness exception to the georgia state law right of publicity,which arises out of the constitutional right to privacy.the district court found that lfp publishing group,llc lfp publication of twenty year old nude photographs of nancy benoit fell squarely within the newsworthiness exception.we reverse.
background 
maureen toffoloni is the mother and the administrator of the estate of nancy benoit.benoit and her son,both georgia residents,were murdered by her husband,christopher benoit,in june.christopher benoit then committed suicide.prior to her death,benoit was a model and professional woman wrestler.christopher benoit was a professional wrestler.their deaths garnered a great deal of domestic and international media attention.
approximately twenty years before her death,benoit posed nude for photographer mark samansky,who took both photographs and a video of her.toffoloni alleges that,immediately after the shoot,her daughter asked samansky to destroy the photographs and video and believed that samansky had destroyed them.however,samansky kept the video,from which he extracted nude and partially nude photographic stills of benoit.samansky conveyed the photographic stills to lfp,which published them in the march issue of hustler magazine.
in february,toffoloni brought suit against lfp in georgia state court,seeking to enjoin the publication of the photographs and seeking damages for violation of benoit right of publicity.lfp removed the case to the united states district court for the northern district of georgia.on october,the district court granted lfp motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,concluding that there is no dispute that benoit death was a legitimate matter of public interest and concern.therefore the publication of benoit nude photographs can not be described as a mere commercial benefit for lfp although lfp like nearly all journalistic outlets no doubt seeks to profit from its publications.toffoloni lfp publ g,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.toffoloni appealed to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit.
b.the right of publicity under georgia law 
georgia recognizes a right of publicity to protect against the appropriation of another name and likeness without consent and for the financial gain of the appropriator whether the person whose name and likeness is used is a private citizen,entertainer,or a public figure who is not a public official.martin luther king.ctr.for soc.change,am.heritage.the right of publicity may be defined as an individual right to the exclusive use of his or her name and likeness.id.at citation omitted.violation of the right of publicity is a state tort.id.at.see also alonso parfet,the courts in this state have long recognized that one who makes an unsanctioned appropriation of another name or likeness for his own benefit may be liable to that person in tort.citation omitted.
the right of publicity grew out of a recognition of the right to privacy under georgia law.see pavesich new england life ins.rooted in the right to privacy,the right of publicity is also characterized by an economic concern that individuals be allowed to control the use of their image in order to maximize the profit they can receive from its publication.we will first discuss the privacy right underpinnings of the right of publicity and then turn to its economic element.
i.the right to privacy underpinning the right of publicity 
as the supreme court of georgia has explained,to each individual member of society there are matters private,and there are matters public so far as the individual is concerned.pavesich,at.all will admit that the individual who desires to live a life of seclusion can not be compelled,against his consent,to exhibit his person in any public place,unless such exhibition is demanded by the law of the land.id.at.thus,t he right of privacy within certain limits is a right derived from natural law,recognized by the principles of municipal law,and guaranteed to persons in georgia by the constitutions of the united states and of the state of georgia,in those provisions which declare that no person shall be deprived of liberty except by due process of law.id.at.
furthermore,o ne who desires to live a life of partial seclusion has a right to choose the times,places,and manner in which and at which he will submit himself to the public gaze.id.at.the right to withdraw from the public gaze at such times as a person may see fit,when his presence in public is not demanded by any rule of law is also embraced within the right of personal liberty.id.importantly,the supreme court of georgia has specifically held that,except as required by law,the body of a person can not be put on exhibition at any time or at any place without his consent.id.
concern about the publication of private photographs of individuals without their consent fueled samuel warren and justice louis brandeis famous article,the right to privacy,which was substantially relied upon by the supreme court of georgia in pavesich,when the court first recognized the right to privacy.see samuel warren louis brandeis,the right to privacy,harv,pavesich,at.warren and brandeis maintained as follows 
recent inventions and business methods call attention to the next step which must be taken for the protection of the person,and for securing to the individual what judge cooley calls the right to be let alone.instantaneous photographs and newspaper enterprise have invaded the sacred precincts of private and domestic life and numerous mechanical devices threaten to make good the prediction that what is whispered in the closet shall be proclaimed from the t he law must afford some remedy for the unauthorized circulation of portraits of private persons 
warren brandeis,harv.at.relying on warren and brandeis,the supreme court of georgia sought to protect individuals from exhibition against their will by recognizing the right to privacy.
the tort of invasion of privacy protects the right to be free from unwarranted publicity,or the unwarranted appropriation or exploitation of one personality,the publicizing of one private affairs with which the public had no legitimate concern.pontiac,zerbst,emphasis added internal quotation marks,citation,and alterations omitted.from this right to be free of the public illegitimate gaze,georgia extrapolated a right of right to control if,when,and under what circumstances one image is made public and subject to scrutiny.
georgia first recognized the right of publicity in cabaniss hipsley.the court held that the plaintiff,who was an exotic dancer,could recover from the atlanta playboy club for its unauthorized use of her photograph in an entertainment magazine advertising the club.the court explained that u nlike intrusion,disclosure,or false light,appropriation does not require the invasion of something secret,secluded or private pertaining to plaintiff,nor does it involve falsity.it consists of the appropriation,for the defendant benefit,use or advantage,of the plaintiff name or likeness the interest protected is not so much a mental as a proprietary one,in the exclusive use of the plaintiff name and likeness as an aspect of his identity.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.since the right of publicity is a proprietary right,the measure of damages is the value of the use of the appropriated publicity.martin luther king,at.
subsequent to cabaniss,the georgia courts have expanded the right of publicity to recognize the rights of private citizens,as well as entertainers,not to have their names and photographs used for the financial gain of the user without their consent,where such use is not authorized as an exercise of freedom of the press.id.citations omitted.additionally,the supreme court of georgia held that the right of publicity survives the death of its owner and is inheritable and devisable.id.at.
the restatement second of torts,however,tempers the right of publicity,providing that 
no one has the right to object merely because his name or his appearance is brought before the public,since neither is in any way a private matter,and both are open to public observation.it is only when the publicity is given for the purpose of appropriating to the defendant benefit the commercial or other values associated with the name or the likeness that the right to privacy is invaded.
restatement second of torts cmt.d emphasis added.thus,the restatement clarifies that the right of publicity does not attach to that which is open to public observation.id.accordingly,the right of publicity must attach to that which is not open to public observation and is appropriated for the commercial benefit of another 
ii.economic concerns inherent in the right of publicity 
the supreme court of the united states has underscored the economic concern inherent in recognition of a right of publicity.the supreme court considered the right of publicity in a case where a broadcasting company transmitted an entertainer entire performance without his permission,essentially appropriating the entertainer potential viewing audience.the court held 
t he rationale for protecting the right of publicity is the one of preventing unjust enrichment by the theft of good will.no social purpose is served by having the defendant get free some aspect of the plaintiff that would have market value and for which he would normally pay.
zacchini broad,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.thus,when a media outlet appropriates some aspect of an individual that would have market value and for which he would normally pay,without that individual permission,the media outlet is subject to damages in a tort suit for violation of the right of publicity.id.
c.the newsworthiness exception to the right of publicity 
the right to privacy and corresponding right of publicity are necessarily in tension with the first amendment protection of freedom of speech and of the press.the first amendment provides that congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech,or of the press const.amend.additionally,the georgia state constitution provides that e very person may speak,write,and publish sentiments on all subjects but shall be responsible for the abuse of that liberty.const.art.i,i,para.v.as the supreme court of georgia has explained,t he right preserved and guaranteed against invasion by the constitution is therefore the right to utter,to write,and to print one sentiments,subject only to the limitation that in so doing he shall not be guilty of an abuse of this privilege by invading the legal rights of others.pavesich,at.
both the rights to freedom of speech and freedom of the press,as guaranteed by the first amendment,and the right to privacy,as guaranteed by the due process clause,are fundamental constitutional rights.the constitution directs no hierarchy between them.thus,courts are required to engage in a balancing,with an eye toward that which is reasonable and that which resonates with our community morals,in order to protect the constitution as a whole.
in order to navigate between the competing constitutionally protected rights of privacy and publicity and the rights of freedom of speech and of the press,the georgia courts have adopted a newsworthiness exception to the right of publicity.the supreme court of georgia has held that where an incident is a matter of public interest,or the subject matter of a public investigation,a publication in connection therewith can be a violation of no one legal right of privacy.waters fleetwood.
the georgia supreme court has further distinguished commercial use from newsworthy use,stating that t here is in the publication of one picture for advertising purposes not the slightest semblance of an expression of an idea,a thought,or an opinion,within the meaning of the constitutional provision which guarantees to a person the right to publish his sentiments on any subject.pavesich,at.accordingly,where a publisher may be precluded by the right of publicity from publishing one image for purely financial gain,as in an advertisement,where the publication is newsworthy,the right of publicity gives way to freedom of the press 
analysis of lfp publication of the nude photographs 
this case requires us to consider the nature and extent of the newsworthiness exception to the right of publicity.it is in the determination of deciding whether published or broadcast material is of legitimate public courts must struggle most directly to accommodate the conflicting interests of individual privacy and press freedom.shulman group w,cal th,d,cal.toffoloni argues that she should be allowed to sue for damages incident to the publication of nude pictures of her deceased daughter because those photographs were published against her express direction and were violative of her daughter right of publicity.lfp responds that it published an article on the life,career,and tragic death of benoit,which includes comment on the modest beginnings of benoit career,and is accompanied by images of benoit from that time.lfp argues that the article and related images are of substantial public interest and are therefore newsworthy.
our resolution of this case commands an intensive review of both the relationship between the published photographs and the corresponding article,as well as the relationship between the published photographs and the incident of public murder.we review the district court grant of lfp motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,de novo.berman blount parrish,cir.
i.the incidental relationship between the article and photographs 
first,it seems clear that had lfp published the nude photographs of benoit by,without a corresponding news publication would not qualify within the newsworthiness exception.the fact of benoit nudity is not in and of itself newsworthy.while one who is a public figure or is presently newsworthy may be the proper subject of news or informative presentation,the privilege does not extend to commercialization of his personality through a form of treatment distinct from the dissemination of news or information.gautier,citations omitted.the nude photographs impart no information to the reading public.mccabe vill.voice.the photographs,by themselves,serve no legitimate purpose of disseminating news and needlessly expose aspects of the plaintiff private life to the public.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.indeed,people are nude every day,and the news media does not typically find the occurrence worth reporting.
here,however,lfp published the photographs alongside a biographical piece on benoit career.the biographical piece,in and of itself,certainly falls within the newsworthiness exception.see generally hustler magazine falwell,d.the question before us is whether a brief biographical piece can ratchet otherwise protected,personal photographs into the newsworthiness exception.
as the second circuit has held,it is appropriate for a court to consider whether the public interest aspect of the publication is merely incidental to its commercial purpose.titan sports,comics world,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.although lfp argues that the photographs were illustrative of the substantive,biographical article included in hustler,our review of the publication demonstrates that such is not the case.these photographs were not incidental to the article.rather,the article was incidental to the photographs.
the magazine cover advertises wrestler chris benoit murdered wife nude.the table of contents lists nancy benoit exclusive nude pics of wrestler doomed wife.neither the cover nor the table of contents makes any reference to the accompanying article.the article is entitled nancy benoit au naturel the images of wrestler chris benoit doomed wife.the title and page frame,which reads exclusive pics exclusive pics,comprise about of the first page.a second third of the page is devoted to two nude photographs of benoit.the final third of the page discusses benoit murder and her nude photo shoot,twice referencing her brief desire to be a model.the second page of the article is entirely devoted to photographs,displaying eight additional photographs of benoit.the heart of this article was the publication of nude the corresponding biograph
