lateirra sublett,an woman,sued john wiley sons,and wiley publishing,to whom we refer collectively as wiley,alleging that they failed to promote her,gave her unwarranted poor performance reviews,and retaliated against her for filing a complaint about race discrimination in violation of both title vii of the civil rights act,et,and.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of wiley.although some of sublett allegations,if true,reflect unfortunate behavior,we conclude that she failed to establish a prima facie case or pretext with respect to any of her claims.we therefore affirm the district court judgment.
on june,wiley predecessor,idg books worldwide,idg,hired sublett as a customer care representative ccr.her qualifications for this position included a high school diploma,certification as an administrative assistant based on her completion of an training course at midwest career college,and an employment history including work as a food server,a customer service representative at another company,a telemarketer,and an insurance collector.at the time sublett was hired,she was the only employee in the customer care department.
in,idg created four senior ccr positions.sublett supervisor felicite pickens,an woman who had been hired after sublett,encouraged her to apply for one of these positions.pickens,however,was fired soon thereafter and played no role in determining who was selected.instead,supervisors breea hosier and linda perkins interviewed sublett for one of the available positions.hosier and perkins filled three of the slots with white employees.initially,they did not select sublett for the fourth available position because they thought that she was insufficiently enthusiastic about the job in her interview and that she had a conflict with another employee,vicki bess.sublett had more seniority at the company than some of the employees who were selected for the promotion.
when sublett found out that she did not receive the ccr position,she emailed chad secrist,an employee in the human relations department,to find out what steps she could take if she thought the reason for her lack of success was racial discrimination.this email triggered a series of events that eventually led to a meeting among sublett,hosier,perkins,and sherry marcuson,another employee in the human relations department.at this meeting,sublett informed hosier and perkins that she did not have a conflict with bess and was in fact enthusiastic about the position.after the meeting,perkins and hosier promoted sublett to a senior ccr position effective august.
in september,sublett received her annual performance review.the review covered six categories with four possible ratings for each category outstanding performance,exceeds performance expectations,proficient,and needs improvement.sublett,who had been evaluated by hosier and perkins,received the proficient rating in each category.based on this review,sublett received a merit pay increase.around the same time,john wiley sons,acquired idg which had since become hungry minds and changed the company name to wiley publishing.
in february,wiley restructured its customer care department.as a result of this reconfiguration,two team leader supervisory positions became available,a position and a position.hosier asked sublett which position she preferred,and sublett replied that she was interested in the position.sublett was one of five employees and the only to express interest in the position.ultimately,hosier and perkins hired mary roberts,a white woman,for the job.the reason they gave to sublett for her lack of success was that they did not think that she was ready to assume the responsibilities of a team leader.later,in june,another team leader position became available.hosier and perkins again considered sublett for the position,but they eventually hired michael shoptaw,a white male from outside the company.on june,after sending several emails to wiley supervisors complaining about not receiving a promotion,sublett filed a claim with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,asserting race discrimination and retaliation.
on august,the director of human resources,along with marcuson,hosier,and perkins,held a meeting with sublett to discuss her complaints.at this meeting,sublett expressed her belief that she had been passed over for the available promotions because of her race.perkins disagreed,claiming instead that she had not been selected because she lacked the requisite leadership skills and was not as qualified for the position as the applicants that were hired.as a result of this meeting,sublett received a development plan,which detailed the areas in which she would need to improve in order to qualify for future promotions.
in september,sublett received her annual performance review,which also used four possible ratings substantially exceeded,fully met,acceptable,and less than acceptable.sublett received two fully met ratings,four acceptable ratings,and a merit pay increase.
on october,sublett filed a second eeoc charge for race discrimination and retaliation.in addition to complaining about the and promotion decisions,she alleged that wiley retaliated against her by giving her poor performance reviews in and.shortly after sublett filed this claim,hosier and perkins promoted her to a team leader position that had recently become available.
on december,the eeoc issued sublett a letter sublett filed her complaint in federal district court on march.when the time came for the district court to consider wiley motion for summary judgment,sublett responded with evidence of wiley failure to promote her in and and her negative performance reviews in and.she also submitted the testimony of felicite pickens,her former supervisor.pickens testified that supervisors hosier and perkins rarely talked to employees.in addition,pickens claimed that on at least one occasion,perkins asked her to change the performance evaluation of a white employee to reflect a more positive rating than pickens believed the employee actually deserved.additionally,sublett submitted testimony from secrist,the human relations employee to whom she initially complained.secrist alleged that another human relations employee who had some role in the company promotion decisions commented that she did not like black people.on a separate occasion,according to secrist,wiley vice president of operations told secrist that he would never accept anyone for a position at the company that did not have an ethnically neutral voice.sublett claimed generally that while supervisors hosier and perkins fired a number of employees during her tenure at wiley,including felicite pickens,they hired and promoted only white employees.she also accused marcuson of treating white people more favorably than minorities in fact,sublett claimed,marcuson treated employees at the company with disgust.
sorting through this evidence and correlating it to sublett specific claims,the district court concluded that sublett had failed to establish a prima facie case with respect to any of her discrimination or retaliation claims.the court accordingly granted wiley motion for summary judgment.we review the district court order de novo,construing all facts and drawing all reasonable inferences from those facts in favor of sublett.see koszola bd.of educ.of city of chicago,cir.
as a preliminary matter,we briefly address certain alleged procedural errors that sublett claims prejudiced her.first,she argues that the district court improperly based its decision on an issue that wiley failed to raise in its motion for summary judgment,namely,that sublett had not presented evidence supporting a finding that wiley proffered reasons for failing to promote her in were pretextual.sublett asserts that wiley raised only a statute of limitations defense with regard to this claim.this switch in grounds,sublett argues,deprived her of the opportunity to argue the issue of pretext before the district court.
it is true that in its motion for summary judgment,wiley argued only that sublett claim based on the promotion was untimely because she filed her eeoc claim outside the period specified by title vii and her claim after the two years permitted under indiana statute of limitations.in an intervening decision,the supreme court held that claims are subject to a statute of limitations,see jones donnelley sons,d this change does not affect our decision.as a general matter,if the moving party does not raise an issue in support of its motion for summary judgment,the nonmoving party is not required to present evidence on that point,and the district court should not rely on that ground in its decision.see edwards honeywell,cir when a party moves for summary judgment on ground a,his opponent is not required to respond to ground ground the movant might have presented but did not.quoting malhotra cotter,cir.
the problem with sublett argument is that it does not reflect everything that happened in the district court.the record establishes that the question of pretext was briefed thoroughly before the district court.for example,in her brief in opposition to wiley motion for summary judgment,sublett specifically noted that the reasons for not promoting her in were undisputed to be false and that this was evidence of the defendants plan,motive,intent,and pretext.emphasis added.in response,wiley argued that sublett failed to create a genuine issue of pretext with respect to the promotion,as part of an extensive discussion of pretext.emphasis added.sublett was also permitted to file a surreply brief,in which she argued that the fact that she did not actually have a conflict with another is evidence that perkins had not sic basis to believe that sublett had a conflict with another perkins was simply dishonest and had no basis for such a statement when the defendants lie about the plaintiff,it is evidence of pretext.because sublett had a meaningful opportunity to come forward with all of her evidence about pretext,simpson merchants recovery bureau,cir quoting celotex catrett,d,the district court was entitled to rely on this ground in its summary judgment decision.
sublett also challenges the district court finding that she did not name the correct defendant with respect to her claim about the promotion.the district court concluded that in,sublett employer was either idg or hungry minds,neither of which is a party to this suit.our review of the record reveals that there has merely been a series of name changed its name to hungry minds,and hungry minds became wiley publishing.in the end,none of this matters the district court offered this reason as one of several for rejecting sublett claim.we proceed on the to these changes of ownership have no effect on wiley liability.
on the merits,we consider first sublett challenge to the district court rejection of her claim that the reason why she did not initially receive a promotion to the senior ccr position in was because of her race.racial discrimination of this kind is,of course,prohibited both by title vii and.see a.furthermore,a lthough section and title vii differ in the types of discrimination they proscribe,the methods of proof and elements of the case are essentially identical.johnson city of fort wayne,cir.the discussion that follows thus applies with equal force to sublett claims under both statutes.
a plaintiff can support her title vii claim for failure to promote in one of two ways she may directly show that racial discrimination motivated the employment decision,or,as is more common,she may rely on the indirect,method set forth in mcdonnell douglas green,d.perdomo browner,cir citations omitted.sublett proceeds under the latter method.she therefore has the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of race discrimination by showing that she is a member of a protected group she was qualified for the position sought she was rejected for the position and the employee promoted was not a member of the protected group and was not better qualified than the plaintiff.johnson nordstrom,cir.
if she passes that hurdle,the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for its action,which if believed by the trier of fact,would support a finding that unlawful discrimination was not the cause of the employment action.mary honor center hicks,d citing.of cmty.affairs burdine,d.at that point,t he plaintiff resumes her original burden of proof and must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant proffered reasons are pretextual.perdomo,at.
even assuming that sublett established a prima facie case with respect to wiley failure to promote her in,there is not enough evidence of pretext in this record to survive summary judgment.pretext is a lie,specifically a phony reason for some action.russell,cir.in order to demonstrate a material issue of fact as to pretext sublett must show that it is more likely that a discriminatory reason motivated the employer than the proffered reason or that an employer explanation is not credible.hudson chicago transit,cir citing guerrero ashcroft,cir.
wiley has consistently asserted that it did not initially select sublett for a promotion in because it believed that she had a conflict with another and that she did not express enough enthusiasm in her interview.after the responsible officials met with her and learned that their assumptions were wrong,she received the promotion.it is true that if wiley initial decision not to promote sublett was based on race,its later decision to promote her does not erase the earlier discrimination.see molnar booth,cir the mere fact that the adverse employment action was reversed and plaintiff career put back on track does not diminish its importance during the time it lasted the short duration is naturally relevant to the degree of damage plaintiff suffered.sublett,however,has not offered any evidence that,if believed by a trier of fact,would demonstrate that wiley proffered justification for its initial decision was pretextual,rather than simply mistaken.
the other evidence to which she points does not do the job.she relies,for example,on evidence indicating that perkins told pickens,her former supervisor,to change the evaluation of a white employee to reflect a more positive rating.the problem with this evidence,however,is that sublett provides no supporting facts or explanatory details with respect to these events.nothing indicates whether this request,which we assume was made,was based on race or on an honest disagreement with pickens assessment of the employee.nor is there anything else in the record from which a trier of fact could determine whether perkins systematically discriminated against minority employees or if she merely show ed favorable treatment to one employee who happened to be white.jordan summers,cir.because there is insufficient evidence of pretext,the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of wiley with respect to the failure to promote in claim.
sublett also challenges the district court rejection of her claim that wiley discriminated against her in when it did not promote her.in,as we noted earlier,wiley considered sublett for promotions in february,march,and june.with respect to the february and june decisions,we agree with the district court that sublett failed to establish the fourth element of the prima facie the employer promoted someone who was not in the protected class and was not as qualified as the plaintiff.although neither of the successful candidates roberts and shoptaw is,their qualifications for the team leader position were undeniably superior to those of sublett.for example,the job description for the team leader position rated past supervisory experience as highly desirable.at the time she was being considered for these promotions,sublett had no supervisory experience.the successful candidates,in contrast,had two and nine years of supervisory experience respectively.see payne milwaukee county,cir.the job description also indicated that some college study was desirable.sublett education was limited to an administrative assistant training program.roberts,on the other hand,had a bachelor of science degree in business,and shoptaw had an associates degree in business and was enrolled in college marketing classes for two years.
