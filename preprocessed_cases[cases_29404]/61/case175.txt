on january,thomas nixon,a patrol officer with the houston,texas police department hpd,filed a suit against the city of houston and chief of police harold hurtt appellees for employment retaliation in violation of his first amendment right to free speech.specifically,nixon claims that his temporary suspension and his later indefinite suspension termination from hpd for making various statements during media interviews and in publications he authored violated his first amendment rights.
in this appeal,nixon seeks a reversal of the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of appellees.because we find that nixon speech was not protected by the first amendment,we affirm.
background 
nixon the insider articles 
between may and january,nixon wrote a monthly column entitled the insider in magazine,a local houston periodical in such articles,nixon identified himself as a police officer,discussed his activities,commented on his duties as an officer and hpd policies,to caustic,offensive,and disrespectful statements regarding certain groups of citizens,including minorities,women,and the homeless.
hpd eventually received a citizen complaint about nixon articles thereafter,on or about september,hpd initiated an internal affairs investigation to determine if nixon and his articles violated any hpd policies.the investigation determined that nixon activities related to authoring and publishing the articles violated numerous hpd policies and undermined the efficiency of the services provided by hpd.consequently,hpd temporarily suspended nixon for fifteen days without pay beginning on february.
nixon january media statements 
on january,there was a highly publicized police pursuit involving state and local law enforcement officers,including hpd officers,and a fleeing suspect.after the fleeing suspect had been identified,hpd supervisors ordered all hpd officers to discontinue the pursuit but permitted them to follow at a distance.nonetheless,the fleeing suspect eventually collided with an innocent motorist.although nixon was not involved in the pursuit,he knew about it from local television reports he saw while he was,at home,and preparing for his shift.
as soon as his shift started,nixon proceeded to the scene of the though he was never instructed to do so upon arriving,nixon asked a supervisor if anyone was going to make a statement to the media and suggested that he nixon do so.after the supervisor failed to respond other than by laughing,nixon proceeded to speak to the media.nixon,however,was not designated as an hpd spokesperson and was not authorized to make statements to the media at the scene.in his statement,nixon criticized hpd decision to disengage the pursuit and stated he was embarrassed to be a police officer because the department did not stop fleeing suspects.
the next day,on january,nixon continued his criticism of hpd and its pursuit policy by voluntarily calling into multiple radio talk shows and by giving television interviews after his remarks on both days,nixon informed the hpd media relations office that he had spoken to the media,presumably in an attempt to comply with his employer media policy.
in response to these statements,hpd launched an investigation against nixon.on june,hpd terminated nixon employment.
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.atkins hibernia,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the record establishes that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
iii.discussion 
to establish a claim for employment retaliation related to speech,a must show he suffered an adverse employment action,alexander eeds,cir he spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern,garcetti ceballos,d his interest in the speech outweighs the government interest in the efficient provision of public services,pickering bd.of,d and the speech precipitated the adverse employment action.eeds,at.
in the case at hand,neither party disputes that nixon suspension and later termination constituted adverse employment actions or that his speech precipitated the adverse employment actions.thus,we must determine was speaking in his role as an employee or as a citizen on a matter of public concern,and if he was speaking as a citizen,interest in speaking outweighed the government interest in efficiency.
under garcetti,for an employee speech to qualify for first amendment protection,he must be speaking as a citizen on a matter of public concern.at emphasis added.an employee is not speaking as a rather in his role as an he make s statements pursuant to his official duties.id.at.restricting speech that owes its existence to a public employee professional responsibilities does not infringe any liberties the employee might have enjoyed as a private citizen.garcetti,however,did not explicate what it means to speak pursuant to one official duties.williams dallas indep.sch,cir.
in williams,the fifth circuit defined when an employee is speaking pursuant to his official duties.id.at.this court first noted that a formal job description is not dispositive,nor is speaking on the subject matter of one employment.id.at citing garcetti.at.the court went on to state that speech required by one position as an employee is not protected by the first amendment williams,at.however,because the speech at issue in williams was not required by williams job responsibilities,the court went on to determine the extent to which,under garcetti,a public employee is protected by the first amendment if his speech is not necessarily required by his job duties but nevertheless is related to his job duties.id.emphasis added.this court ultimately concluded that a ctivities undertaken in the course of performing one job are activities pursuant to official duties.id.
if a court determines that an employee is not speaking in role as an employee,but rather as a citizen on a matter of public concern,the possibility of a first amendment claim arises.garcetti.at.to determine whether the first amendment protects the employee speech,a court proceeds to the pickering balancing test and determines whether the interest of the government employer in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees outweighs the employee interests,as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern.pickering,at.pertinent considerations in this balancing test are whether the statement impairs discipline by superiors or harmony among,has a detrimental impact on close working relationships for which personal loyalty and confidence are necessary,or impedes the performance of the speaker duties or interferes with the regular operation of the enterprise.rankin mcpherson,d.furthermore,b ecause police departments function as paramilitary organizations charged with maintaining public safety and order,they are given more latitude in their decisions regarding discipline and personnel regulations than an ordinary government employer.tindle caudell,cir.
with this framework in mind,we turn to the speech at issue in this case nixon january media statements and nixon the insider magazine articles.
nixon january media statements 
under garcetti and williams,it is clear that nixon january,media statement at the scene of the accident is not protected by the first amendment because it was made pursuant to his official duties and during the course of performing his job.nixon spoke to the media while on duty,in uniform,and while working at the scene of the accident.before he made the statement,he made an attempt to get the approval of a supervisor to do so.his statement was intended to inform the public of the circumstances of the chase,the subsequent accident,and hpd chase policy.quite simply,there is no relevant analogue to speech by citizens.garcetti.at.the fact that nixon statement was unauthorized by hpd and that speaking to the press was not part of his regular job duties is not statement was made while he was performing his job,and the fact that nixon performed his job incorrectly,in an unauthorized manner,or in contravention
