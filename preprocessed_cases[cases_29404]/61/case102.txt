this case involves the efforts of certain news organizations to intervene to secure access to documents filed under seal in regard to a motion for summary judgment.it calls upon us to determine,inter alia,whether the media intervenors can appeal a district court order that was not a final judgment,whether such documents constitute judicial documents,and whether an immediate right of access under both the common law and first amendment obtains.
in june,the herald company and capital newspapers division of the hearst corporation newspapers sought to intervene in daniel lugosch,iii et robert congel et,in which various plaintiffs,none of whom are parties to this appeal,alleged various financial improprieties in the business operations of defendant pyramid company of onandaga,new york and its majority general partner robert congel.in particular,the newspapers sought access to certain documents filed under seal in connection with the defendants motion for summary judgment,arguing that these were judicial documents to which they had an immediate right of access under both the common law and first amendment.approximately nine months after the filing of the newspapers intervention motion,the magistrate judge treece,to whom the motion had been referred issued an order holding the motion in abeyance until after the district court mordue,ruled on the summary judgment motion,reasoning that it was not in a position to assess the strength of the newspapers argument until that time.approximately four months after that,still without having ruled on the summary judgment motion,the district court upheld the magistrate judge decision to hold the newspapers intervention motion in abeyance.the herald company now appeals this decision.we conclude that the district court erred in holding the motion in abeyance because the contested documents are judicial documents to which a presumption of immediate access applies under both the common law and the first amendment.because we are not in a position to assess whether the presumption is overcome by countervailing factors,we remand for the district court to make.
background 
the underlying litigation in the district court pits the plaintiffs,who are minority general partners in ten general partnerships controlled by defendant robert congel,against congel,the pyramid company,and associated defendants,which collectively operate over twenty large regional shopping centers in the northeast.in their third amended complaint,the plaintiffs alleged civil rico violations,fraud,conversion,conspiracy,aiding and abetting,breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,and constructive trust.much of the case has already survived a motion to dismiss.
during the same period in which the lawsuit has proceeded,the defendants have been involved in lobbying the new york state senate and the governor office to obtain various tax credits and other sources of public funding to construct a highly publicized in syracuse,new york called destiny usa.although nothing about this particular construction project is at issue in the lawsuit,the plaintiffs complaint generally raises questions about the business practices of the entities and individuals lobbying the state.
on may,the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment,attaching at least sealed documents or sets of documents,for a total volume of approximately pages.on july,the plaintiffs filed their opposition to this motion,attaching at least fifteen volumes of sealed appendices,as well as a sealed memorandum of law and a sealed response to the defendants statement of material facts.
on june,the newspapers filed a motion to intervene for the limited purpose of obtaining immediate public access to the sealed motion papers under the common law and the first amendment.the newspapers motion papers were accompanied by a proposed order to show cause that the newspapers requested be made returnable no later than june,the district court did not act within this requested time frame.instead,almost a month later,in a letter dated july,the district court informed counsel that he was referring the motion to intervene and the proposed order to show cause to a magistrate judge.the district court also commented on the newspapers request for leave to attend oral argument on defendants summary judgment motion 
as matters now stand,the court does not intend to hear oral argument on the summary judgment motion,but rather intends to take the motion on submission.therefore,this issue is moot.in the event that the court ultimately decides to hear oral argument,all parties and the newspapers will be notified.
on august,the magistrate judge signed an order to show cause,find ing that such an intervention may have merit.the magistrate judge cautioned,however,that w hile the court acknowledges the important constitutional issues at stake herein,in light of the pace of this litigation and the fact that the pending summary judgment motion has not been fully briefed,the court does not share the proposed intervenors sense of urgency in terms of expediting the within matter.accordingly,the magistrate judge set august,as the deadline for the newspapers to serve the court order and the motion papers on the parties thirty days after august as the deadline for any responses to the motion and fifteen days after that for any reply papers.the magistrate judge then stated that u pon receipt and consideration of all papers submitted,as set forth above,the court will then set a date for oral argument.
in accordance with these deadlines,the motion to intervene was fully briefed as of september,three months after the motion had been filed.however,the magistrate judge apparently never conducted oral argument.
in a letter agreement between the newspapers and the defendants dated november,the defendants agreed to withdraw their objections to public disclosure except for the portions of the parties summary judgment materials for which defendants claimed privilege for their part,the newspapers agreed not to object to certain redactions of personal information.the letter agreement also provided that in the event the district court decided to hold oral argument on the pending summary judgment motion,the newspapers reporters would be authorized to be present in the courtroom during the argument.a copy of this letter agreement was sent to the magistrate judge on november.
months passed without any decision on the intervention motion.by letter dated march,in advance of a march,settlement conference among the parties,the newspapers requested from the magistrate judge a prompt determination of their motion,noting that it had been fully submitted for over five months and pointing out that the sole remaining issue in contention was the extent to which the defendants claims of privilege could overcome the public presumptive first amendment and common law right of access to the allegedly privileged documents.
another month passed.by letter dated april,the newspapers again requested that the magistrate judge issue a prompt decision on the motion to intervene,noting that the court had not acknowledged or responded to their march letter.the newspapers stated that unless the court rendered a decision by april,the newspapers would seek immediate relief in the form of a mandamus petition filed with this court.
on april,the magistrate judge finally issued an order on the intervention motion.lugosch,et.congel,et,wl.instead of resolving the motion on the merits,however,the magistrate judge ordered that the motion be held in abeyance pending the district court determination of the defendants summary judgment motion.id.at.regardless of whether the newspapers were relying on a right of access under the common law or under the first amendment,wrote the magistrate judge,such a right only attaches to judicial documents.id.at.quoting this court statements in united states amodeo,cir amodeo i that the mere filing of a paper or document with the court is insufficient to render that paper a judicial document and instead that the item filed must be relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process in order for it to be designated a judicial document,the magistrate judge concluded that it was premature to decide whether the documents at issue were judicial documents until the district court had ruled on the motion for summary judgment and it could be determined which documents were relevant and useful to that decision.id.at.the magistrate judge also noted that oral arguments in the summary judgment motion were scheduled for may.id.at.
the newspapers filed with the district court objections to the magistrate judge order pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.as part of their responses to the newspapers objections,the defendants called into question,inter alia,the value of the contested documents to the district court in ruling on the summary judgment motion.in turn,the plaintiffs,while taking no position on the rule objections,wrote to the district court in part to contest this assertion by the defendants,noting that they indeed intended to rely on some of the contested documents at oral argument and seeking guidance from the court on the use of those documents at oral argument.on may,the district court rescheduled the oral argument to may,and on may,the district court rescheduled the oral argument to june.while the first adjournment was at the request of counsel,the record does not explain the reason for the second adjournment.
on june,while the rule objections were still sub judice,the newspapers wrote to the district court in anticipation of the june oral argument on the summary judgment motion,objecting in advance to any motion of the defendants to seal the courtroom unless the district court made,particularized findings of fact that nondisclosure of the contested documents was essential to preserve a compelling interest.
on june,the district court issued a memorandum decision and order rejecting the rule objections and approving the magistrate judge april,order holding in abeyance the newspapers motion to intervene until after the district court ruled on the defendants motion for summary judgment.lugosch,et.congel,et,wl june.while in many cases it may be reasonable to assume that all papers filed in connection with a summary judgment motion have relevance and utility to the judicial function and are thus judicial documents under amodeo i,the district court noted,such an assumption does not necessarily apply in the unusual circumstances of this case,where the parties have conducted forty depositions and exchanged over two million pages of documents,where privileged documents were disclosed in reliance on a confidentiality order,and where it is plaintiffs,rather than defendants,who submitted defendants privileged information in their opposition to the summary judgment motion and did so wholesale as part of a appendix.id.at.agreeing with the magistrate judge that it was doubtful that the entirety of this massive motion record would be relevant and useful to the judicial function,the district court held that the magistrate judge it was premature to determine whether the contested documents were judicial certainly not clearly erroneous or contrary to law.id.
moreover,the district court concluded,even assuming that the documents sought are judicial documents,it could not assess the weight given to the presumption of access to judicial documents,because it was not yet aware of which documents would play a substantial role in determining litigants substantive rights.id.at.the district court explained 
here,if the court decides the pending summary judgment motions on a preliminary procedural ground without reaching the merits,it is likely that the bulk of the record will pertain to issues which the court never considers at all.or,if the court denies summary judgment after finding questions of fact on a single significant issue,it might not reach any other issue on the motions.likewise,it is always possible that the motions may be withdrawn or the case settled before the court issues its decision,as a result of which there will have been no judicial action with respect to which the documents may be relevant or useful on the other hand,the court may grant either partial or complete summary judgment,which might well give rise to a strong presumption of public access to not the record.obviously,then,the strength of the presumption of public access to the sealed documents can not be measured at this time.
id.the district court further stated that it was similarly unable to balance the presumption of access against countervailing factors such as the defendants privacy interests and their interests in unwarranted reputational injury until it decided the summary judgment motion.id.at.
finally,the district court observed that to the extent that there is a first amendment right to access to judicial documents filed in civil cases,such a right would require the court to determine whether the documents sought were judicial documents,and,if so,whether a compelling interest militates against access,concluding without further analysis that an attempt to determine these questions at this point would be premature.id.the district court thus affirmed the magistrate judge order holding the motion for intervention in abeyance pending the determination of the underlying summary judgment motion.
on june,the day before oral argument on the summary judgment motion was scheduled to be heard,the newspapers wrote to the district court as the consequence of the court june,order to object one more time to the defendants anticipated motion to close at least part of the proceeding.the newspapers indicated that counsel and representatives of the newspaper would be present in court the next day to object to any attempt to close the summary judgment arguments and to address any concerns the court may have in this regard.shortly after that day,the district court cancelled the argument,saying only that the motion would be decided on submission without providing any explanation for the change in plans.
this expedited appeal followed at the time of oral argument before this months after the intervention motion was filed and approximately months after the summary judgment motion was decision on the summary judgment motion had yet been rendered.
appellate jurisdiction 
before turning to the merits of the appeal,we must first consider whether we have jurisdiction to do so.although the decision here appealed,the district court order holding the newspapers intervention motion in not a final judgment,the newspapers assert that this court nonetheless has jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine of cohen beneficial industrial loan,a narrow exception to the general rule that interlocutory orders are not appealable as a matter of right.schwartz city of new york,cir.to fit within the collateral order exception,the interlocutory order must i conclusively determine the disputed question,ii resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,and iii be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.united states graham,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted alteration in original.
we have previously allowed media intervenors to appeal from apparently interlocutory orders under the collateral order doctrine on the grounds that orders denying access are final as to the intervenors and that the intervention motion could have been treated as a separate civil case in which the ruling would have been final.see,abc,stewart,cir in re new york times,cir.the instant matter stands in a slightly different posture from those cases,however,as the district court held in abeyance the intervention motion rather than outright denying it.the defendants argue that because of this distinction,there was no conclusive determination of the disputed question and the appeal should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.see,sierra rutile katz,cir we fail to see how the district court decision to decide at a later time the question of jurisdiction conclusively determines the issue rather,the district court simply postponed a determination of the remand motion.moran towing transp.united states,cir larsen wright cobb lighterage,cir.
however,in none of the cases dealing with motions held in abeyance was the relief sought dependent on timing.here,in contrast,the newspapers seek immediate right of access to the contested documents,bringing the instant matter more within the ambit of our other cases dealing with media intervenors.for example,in re new york times company presented a situation in which various news bureaus moved to make public certain motion papers filed under seal in a criminal case and the district court denied those motions to protect the criminal defendants fair trial rights and the privacy interests of third parties.see in re new york times,at.we concluded that the orders there challenged were appealable under the collateral order doctrine because deferral of a ruling on appellants claims until a final judgment in the underlying criminal prosecution is entered would effectively deny appellants much of the relief they seek,namely,prompt public disclosure of the motion papers.id.at italics added.similarly,in graham,we compared the media intervention motion at stake in that case to the one in in re application of national broadcasting,cir,noting that the collateral order doctrine applied in both cases because the interlocutory order involves alleged rights of the networks as third parties to the criminal litigation and since the deferral of a ruling on their claim until appeal from the judgments of conviction would further deny them the relief they,contemporaneous televising of the tapes.graham,at italics added internal quotation marks omitted.because in both of these cases,as here,the crucial issue was the media request for immediate release of contested material,in response to which the district courts took an action that did not result in such immediate release,these cases are more on point than the cases relied on by defendants,which simply discuss the general effect of a motion being held in abeyance.nebraska press ass stuart,d blackmun,in chambers holding that where state supreme court has not taken timely action to address prior restraint on media raising first amendment issues delay itself is a final decision.indeed,it is clear that the district court decision here did conclusively resolve a disputed the newspapers had a right of immediate access to the contested accordingly,the first prong of the collateral order doctrine is satisfied.
the defendants argue that the second prong of the collateral order doctrine is not met because the issue of immediate release of the contested documents is intertwined with the underlying summary judgment motion.in so arguing,they rely on the district court statement that an analysis of which documents are judicial documents could only be completed after a ruling on the summary judgment motion,because only at that time will the district court know which documents were relevant and useful to the judicial function under the amodeo i test.but,as is clear from our analysis in the next section,we do not need to say anything about the merits of the plaintiffs underlying racketeering and fraud allegations in order to rule on the propriety of the district court order as to the newspapers.the question of public access to the contested documents is thus completely separate from the merits of the underlying action,satisfying the second prong.see sec,cir holding that the second prong of the collateral order doctrine was met because the issue of disclosure of the confidential testimony was wholly separate from the underlying merits of the action,which involved alleged violations of the securities law.
as to the third prong,it is patently clear that the denial of prompt public disclosure the newspapers seek will be unreviewable,not to mention any damage irreparable,on appeal from a final judgment.see in re new york times,at.accordingly,we find that the district court order falls within the collateral order doctrine,and we thus have jurisdiction to review it.
discussion 
the common law right of public access to judicial documents is firmly rooted in our nation history.see amodeo i,at.we have explained the rationale for this right as follows 
the presumption of access is based on the need for federal courts,although,particularly because they are have a measure of accountability and for the public to have confidence in the administration of justice.federal courts exercise powers under article iii that impact upon virtually all citizens,but judges,once nominated and confirmed,serve for life unless impeached through a process that is politically and practically inconvenient to invoke.although courts have a number of internal checks,such as appellate review by tribunals,professional and public monitoring is an essential feature of democratic control.monitoring both provides judges with critical views of their work and deters arbitrary judicial behavior.without monitoring,moreover,the public could have no confidence in the conscientiousness,reasonableness,or honesty of judicial proceedings.such monitoring is not possible without access to testimony and documents that are used in the performance of article iii functions.
united states amodeo,cir amodeo ii.
before any such common law right can attach,however,a court must first conclude that the documents at issue are indeed judicial documents.in amodeo i,we held that the mere filing of a paper or document with the court is insufficient to render that paper a judicial document subject to the right of public access.at.in order to be designated a judicial document,the item filed must be relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process.id.
once the court has determined that the documents are judicial documents and that therefore a common law presumption of access attaches,it must determine the weight of that presumption.t he weight to be given the presumption of access must be governed by the role of the material at issue in the exercise of article iii judicial power and the resultant value of such information to those monitoring the federal courts.generally,the information will fall somewhere on a continuum from matters that directly affect an adjudication to matters that come within a court purview solely to insure their irrelevance.amodeo ii,at.
finally,after determining the weight of the presumption of access,the court must balance competing considerations against it.id.at.such countervailing factors include but are not limited to the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency and the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.id.
in addition to the common law right of access,it is well established that the public and the press have a qualified first amendment right to attend judicial proceedings and to access certain judicial documents.hartford courant pellegrino,cir.we have articulated two different approaches for determining whether the public and the press should receive first amendment protection in their attempts to access certain judicial documents.id.at.the experience and logic approach requires the court to consider both whether the documents have historically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant positive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.id.quoting superior court,d.the courts that have undertaken this type of inquiry have generally invoked the common law right of access to judicial documents in support of finding a history of openness.id.the second approach considers the extent to which the judicial documents are derived from or are a necessary corollary of the capacity to attend the relevant proceedings.id.at 
a court conclusion that a qualified first amendment right of access to certain judicial documents exists does not end the inquiry.d ocuments may be sealed if specific,on the record findings are made demonstrating that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.in re new york times,at internal quotation marks omitted.broad and general findings by the trial court,however,are not sufficient to justify closure.id.
while the district court stated these legal frameworks correctly,we think it was nonetheless error for the district court to conclude that it could not make any determinations under the frameworks until it had ruled on the underlying summary judgment motion.our precedents indicate that documents submitted to a court for its consideration in a summary judgment motion a matter of documents to which a strong presumption of access attaches,under both the common law and the first amendment.
in joy north,cir,decided over a decade before we set forth in amodeo i and amodeo ii the standard for determining when a document is a judicial document and what the weight of the presumption of access should be,we stated definitively that documents used by parties moving for,or opposing,summary judgment should not remain under seal absent the most compelling reasons.at.nothing in either amodeo case changes this conclusion,which effectively states that there is a presumption of access to documents submitted on a summary judgment motion.the justification offered in joy north for this conclusion is that summary judgment is an adjudication,and a n adjudication is a formal act of government,the basis of which should,absent exceptional circumstances,be subject to public scrutiny.id.while the defendants are correct that the underlying summary judgment motion in joy north had already been decided when the motion for access to the documents was made,nothing about that timing was relevant to our conclusion in that case.
in arguing that the district court can not rightly decide whether the documents are judicial documents until after it rules on the summary judgment motion,defendants primarily rely on dicta in amodeo ii where we suggested that the weight of the presumption of access may vary according to the outcome of the motion under consideration by the court.more precisely,in discussing the continuum along which the strength of the presumption will be measured,we explained that where documents are used to determine litigants substantive legal rights,a strong presumption of access attaches.amodeo ii,at.moving down the continuum,away from matters that directly affect an adjudication and towards matters that come within a court purview solely to insure their irrelevance,we explained that the weight of the presumption declines.id.considering briefly what might fall into the middle of the continuum,we noted that o ne judge has pointed out,for example,that where a district court denied the summary judgment motion,essentially postponing a final determination of substantive legal rights,the public interest in access is not as pressing.id.quoting in re reporters comm.for freedom of the press,wright,concurring in part and dissenting in part.at the low end of the continuum,w here testimony or documents play only a negligible role in the performance of article iii duties,the weight of the presumption is low and amounts to little more than a prediction of public access absent a countervailing reason.id.at.
defendants read the above reference as standing for the proposition that until a district court knows the disposition of the underlying motion,any attempt at calling something a judicial document is premature.this reading can not stand.first,this central to our holding nor a point of thorough simply a quotation from a partial concurrence and partial dissent in the circuit,not even the position of the circuit itself the conclusion that the defendants press here is thus not the considered decision of either this court or the circuit.it is true that we further referred to this idea in graham,at,but this additional reference does not make defendants overall argument any stronger,since the reference was merely in summary of amodeo ii,and no question of the timing of the summary judgment decision was presented in graham.moreover,the reference relates only to the weight of the presumption of access,not to whether something is a judicial document to begin with.finally,we find this argument unconvincing on the merits.as the third circuit has sensibly said,
when defendant filed its motion for summary judgment,it did so in the hope that it would be a dispositive motion,and with the belief that it was entitled to such relief.requires no less.we assume that defendant followed the requirement of rule and supported its motion only on the basis of such facts as would be admissible in evidence.e.thus,if,as defendant concedes,there would have been a right of public access had the motion been granted,we fail to see why such a right did not attach merely because the motion was denied.
republic of the philippines westinghouse,cir.that it is the plaintiffs,rather than the defendants,who have put the contested documents in their motion papers in the case before us is irrelevant to our analysis under joy north,which explicitly did not distinguish between the moving and opposing party in concluding that there is a presumption of access to documents submitted to the court at summary judgment.at.indeed,the logic of the third circuit applies equally to the plaintiffs responsive submissions on summary judgment,as they may similarly be assumed to have supported their papers with admissible evidence and arguments.
the weight of authority in other circuits supports this conclusion.the first circuit has clearly held that relevant documents which are submitted to,and accepted by,a court of competent jurisdiction in the course of adjudicatory proceedings,become documents to which the presumption of public access applies,a framing that has nothing to do with how a court ultimately comes out on a motion.ftc standard fin.mgmt,cir.the fourth circuit has commented that b ecause summary judgment adjudicates substantive rights and serves as a substitute for a trial,we fail to see the difference between a trial and the situation before us now where documents were submitted to the court on a summary judgment motion,concluding that a presumption of access attaches to documents filed in connection with a summary judgment motion in a civil case.rushford new yorker magazine,cir.the ninth circuit has explained that the unbroken string of authorities leaves little doubt that the federal common law right of public access extends to materials submitted in connection with motions for summary judgment in civil cases prior to judgment.san jose mercury news,district court,cir see also in re continental illinois sec,cir where motion to terminate was designed to and did result in the dismissal of claims against several defendants and district court was required to make complex factual and legal determinations in a proceeding which has been characterized as a hybrid summary judgment motion,the presumption of access applies to the hearings held and evidence introduced in connection with the party motion to terminate in re agent orange product liability,clearly,then,documents attached to and referred to in the parties papers on the summary judgment motions are part of the court record and are entitled to the presumption of public access.as a matter of law,then,we hold that the contested virtue of having been submitted to the court as supporting material in connection with a motion for summary unquestionably judicial documents under the common law.
as to the weight of the presumption given to such documents,joy north has already clarified that the presumption is of the highest documents used by parties moving for,or opposing,summary judgment should not remain under seal absent the most compelling reasons.at italics added.nor was the district court correct to suggest that different types of documents might receive different weights of presumption based on the extent to which they were relied upon in resolving the motion.if the rationale behind access is to allow the public an opportunity to assess the correctness of the judge decision documents that the judge should have considered or relied upon,but did not,are just as deserving of disclosure as those that actually entered into the judge decision.in re coordinated pretrial proceedings in petroleum products antitrust,italics in original.moreover,o nce those submissions come to the attention of the district judge,they can fairly be assumed to play a role in the court deliberations.standard fin.mgmt,a
