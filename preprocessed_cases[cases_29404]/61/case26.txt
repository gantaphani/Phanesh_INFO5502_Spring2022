rare is there an opportunity to interrupt today news cycle,fueled by cable television incessant need for content and the explosion of internet websites that promptly apprise us of events across the world.this appeal offers such a moment as we pause to review leon levesque claim that fox news network,llc fox,steve doocy,and brian kilmeade defamed him during a show on the fox news channel fnc.the district court,after considering levesque claims,granted the defendants motion for summary judgment,and upon careful review,we affirm.
because t his action is an appeal from a grant of summary judgment,we recite the facts in the light most favorable to levesque as.fiacco sigma alpha epsilon fraternity,cir citing franceschi dep t of veterans affairs,cir.the parties dispute arises from a fnc morning program coverage of an incident in lewiston,maine,where levesque is the superintendent of the lewiston public schools.
on april,a student at lewiston middle school placed a bag containing leftover ham on the cafeteria table where somali muslim students were sitting for lunch.the somali students reported the incident to bill brochu,a lewiston police officer stationed at the school.after an investigation of the incident,the middle school assistant principal suspended the offending student for ten school days,a decision in which the principal concurred.the assistant principal classified the incident as hate in the school computer system,and brochu filed a police report under the direction of his superior officer,characterizing the incident as crime bias.levesque was informed of the suspension and endorsed the decision.
the following week,while the lewiston schools were closed for april vacation,bonnie washuk,a reporter for the lewiston sun journal,contacted superintendent levesque to discuss an article she intended to write about the incident.published on april,the washuk article included quotations from both levesque and stephen wessler,the executive director of the center for the prevention of hate violence the center which was working with the lewiston middle school to develop an appropriate response to the incident.washuk quoted levesque as describing the offending student conduct as a hate incident and acknowledging,we got some work to do to turn this around and bring the school community back together all our students should feel welcome and safe in our schools.wessler described the incident as extraordinarily hurtful and degrading and warned that without a response,more degrading acts will follow,until at some point we end up having violence.somali students reflected that the event reminded them of an incident earlier that year when the head of a pig was rolled into a lewiston mosque during a prayer session that many somalis attended.
on april,four days after the sun journal ran washuk article,nicholas plagman uploaded a piece he had written about the april incident to associated content,a website platform that permits registered users to publish content on topics of their choosing.while the plagman article purported to describe the incident as a news story,it mischaracterized some facts,such as reporting that the students left a ham sandwich,rather than ham steak,on the cafeteria table.similarly,where washuk reported that the center was working with the school to create a response plan,plagman described it as an response plan.plagman also included fictitious quotations which generally built upon those accurately used in washuk article.for example,according to plagman,levesque stated,we got work to do to turn this around and bring the school community back together again.these children have got to learn that ham is not a toy.plagman also quoted wessler as stating,it extraordinarily hurtful and degrading.they probably felt like they were back in mogadishu starving and being shot at.finally,plagman falsely listed the associated press ap as a source.because plagman indicated that his story should be housed under associated content humor and news categories,the article was retrievable through google news,a website that aggregates headlines from news sources worldwide.
around on april,a line producer for fnc morning news talk show fox friends discovered the plagman article.fox friends runs each weekday from until,its hosts discussing current events,interviewing guests,and reporting the weather.producers for the show search for compelling stories for the hosts to discuss.the line producer sent the plagman article to the fox news research department for additional research.an information specialist was able to confirm some of the facts presented in the article including the identities and professional positions of levesque and wessler and the existence of the center,lewiston middle school,and the lewiston police department.he also discovered the washuk article,confirmed that the lewiston sun journal was a legitimate newspaper,and found two articles related to the incident at the lewiston mosque.
by,the plagman article and research materials were delivered to three of the show four,including doocy and kilmeade.doocy used google news to conduct additional research and also found the plagman article,the washuk article,and a brief article on the boston globe website which both corroborated the general story of the incident and confirmed that the center was working with the school on a response plan.the defendants agreed to include the story in that morning show.
during the cablecast,the defendants repeatedly raised and discussed the april incident,frequently ridiculing levesque,ascribing the handling of the incident largely to him.they reported as true several of the fabricated quotations that plagman attributed to levesque including the ham is not a toy statement and also cited levesque for the phony statement comparing the incident to mogadishu,a comment that had been falsely attributed to wessler in the plagman article.throughout the cablecast,the hosts repeated these two falsified quotations and used the incident as the basis for the question of the day,inviting viewers to call or email the show to share their thoughts.doocy and kilmeade at times made statements that arguably called into question the veracity of the story.for example,doocy on a number of occasions stated,i am not making this up,once asserting that i looked it up on a couple of different websites up there from local papers,and at various times,kilmeade stated i hope we not being duped,i thought this was a joke,and i thought this was almost from the onion i did think that was actually true.the show producers attempted to contact levesque for comment,leaving a message at his office around,two hours into the cablecast.levesque did not return the calls.
some time after the cablecast,levesque contacted fnc to complain about the show inaccuracies on may,fox friends issued a retraction and apology,agreeing that various statements attributed to levesque were fictitious and noting that had the show realized the plagman article was not legitimate,it would not have repeated the fabricated statements.
the following month,levesque filed a complaint asserting libel,libel per se,false light invasion of privacy,and punitive damages,claiming that five statements made by the defendants during the cablecast were defamatory first,he took issue with the defendants claim that he classified the incident as a hate crime.he next objected to the defendants references to an response plan.third,levesque asserted that the repeated mentions of a ham sandwich were defamatory.fourth,he challenged the statement leon says,these children have got to learn that ham is not a toy.finally,levesque disputed the defendants assertion that the superintendent says it akin to making these kids feel like they being shot at back in mogadishu and being starved to death.
the defendants moved for summary judgment,contending that the statements were not defamatory and alternatively,that levesque,who stipulated that he was a public official,could not show that the defendants acted with actual malice in making them.the district court held that the statements were protected on multiple grounds.levesque doocy,d.it found the reference to a hate crime substantially true and the response plan quip protected rhetorical hyperbole.the court determined that the references to a ham sandwich,the ham is not a toy comment,and the mogadishu statement were materially false,reasonably susceptible of a defamatory meaning,and highly offensive for purposes of the false light claim.nevertheless,the court granted the defendants motion,concluding that levesque failed to produce evidence that the defendants acted with constitutional malice when making the statements.
summary judgment is proper where the record shows no genuine issue as to any material fact such that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c see hahn sargent,cir.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,fiacco,at,and thus conduct an independent review of the entire record,bose consumers union of,d discussing new york times sullivan,d.

under maine common law,a plaintiff alleging defamation must show a false and defamatory statement published without privilege to a third party resulting in harm to the plaintiff.lester powers,me.meanwhile,discussions of public officials like levesque deserve breathing space in a democratic society and thus are subject to a conditional privilege that is overcome only by clear and convincing evidence that the defamatory statement was made with actual malice,in other words with knowledge that the statement was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.new york times,at.
this actual malice standard can have profound consequences on the outcome of a defamation case,mandel boston phoenix,cir,with many deserving plaintiffs,including some intentionally subjected to injury,unable to surmount the barrier of the new york times test,gertz robert welch,d.moreover,the substantive evidentiary standard of proof for actual malice applies at the motion for summary judgment stage.anderson,at.thus,levesque must provide evidence of actual malice with convincing clarity,new york times,at,to survive the defendants motion for summary judgment.
squarely within this legal framework,we first examine the challenged statements to determine whether the district court erred in holding some and others potentially defamatory.because with one caveat we ultimately agree with the district court findings,we next consider whether the defendants acted with actual malice when making the defamatory statements 
defamatory in nature 
the district court held that a jury could find defamatory the defendants attribution to levesque of two false and absurd quotations ham is not a toy and it akin to making these kids feel like they being shot at back in mogadishu and being starved to death along with repeated references to a ham sandwich which included a recreation of the incident.the court found that the defendants statements that levesque and the lewiston middle school considered the incident to be a potential hate crime and the use of the term response plan were not defamatory,concluding that the former was substantially true and the latter was rhetorical hyperbole.
a communication is defamatory if it is provable as false,milkovich lorain journal,d,and tends so to harm the reputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from associating or dealing with him,bakal weare,me quoting restatement second of torts.whether a statement is susceptible to a defamatory meaning is a question of law.amrak,morton,cir.to appropriately construe the statement in the light of what might reasonably have been understood therefrom by the persons who heard it,veilleux broad,cir quoting marston newavom,me,a court should consider the context in which the challenged statement is made,viewing it within the communication as a whole,amrak,at hearst,at phantom touring.affiliated,cir bakal,at.
we dispense first with those comments which the district court found.a substantially true statement does not provide adequate basis for a defamation claim under maine law.veilleux,at mccullough visiting nurse,me.lewiston middle school classified the offending student conduct as hate in its computer system,both the washuk and plagman articles accurately quoted levesque describing the conduct as a hate incident,and the washuk article opened with more disciplinary action could follow a possible hate crime at lewiston middle school,superintendent leon levesque said.we therefore agree with the district court that t he defendants statement t he superintendent and the school board are looking into perhaps other charges against the kid because it a hate crime is not actionable because it is substantially true.levesque,d at,citing masson new yorker magazine,d.
we also agree that the defendants references to an response plan were not defamatory.statements that contain imaginative expression or rhetorical hyperbole are protected.veilleux,at citing milkovich,at.levinsky,stores,cir.here,the defendants augmented washuk accurate reporting the center is working with the school to create a response plan with plagman creative flourish the center is working with the school to create an response plan.this loosely rhyming phrase provided the defendants with a succinct,perhaps distasteful,jingle through which to express their derision,but such a device does not qualify as a provably false statement,capable of a defamatory nature.further,it can not reasonably be interpreted as stating actual facts about levesque,milkovich,at.internal quotations and citation omitted 
we turn next to those statements which the trial court found defamatory in nature,the defendants repeated references to a ham sandwich and two fabricated statements attributed to levesque.while the district court found that the defendants mischaracterization of the ham placed on the somali students table presented a jury question as to whether the remarks were defamatory in nature,we think it is a close question whether the references to a ham sandwich would have a different effect on the mind of a listener than an accurate report about a leftover ham steak.see masson,at.however,because our ultimate resolution of this case makes such a determination unnecessary,we do not disturb the district court findings.
we concur with the district court that a jury reasonably could conclude that the two fabricated statements attributed to levesque were defamatory.the supreme court has observed
