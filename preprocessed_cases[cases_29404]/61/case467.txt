the right to an open public trial is a shared right of the accused and the public,the common concern being the assurance of fairness.superior court.ii.underlying the first amendment right of access to criminal trials is the common understanding that a major purpose of that amendment was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs,and to ensure that this constitutionally protected discussion of governmental affairs is an informed one.globe newspaper superior court,d.in california,this right of access is protected by code of civil procedure section,which provides that the sittings of every court shall be public.see nbc subsidiary,superior court cal th,d,first amend.cases inform our interpretation of code civ.
on the other hand,it has been consistently recognized that the proper functioning of our grand jury system depends upon the secrecy of grand jury proceedings.douglas oil petrol stops northwest,d see also mcclatchy newspapers superior court cal d,the importance of secrecy is well established in the context of the grand jury criminal indictment function.
the instant petition for writ of mandate,filed by the los angeles times and the los angeles daily journal,raises an issue of first impression whether the general california rule of grand jury secrecy applies to ancillary proceedings such as the motions to quash grand jury subpoenas being litigated here.
after careful research and consideration,we conclude the motion to quash hearings,and the documents filed in connection therewith,should be closed and sealed to the extent necessary to prevent disclosure of matters occurring before the grand jury.accordingly,we will grant the writ petition in part and deny it in part,and remand this matter to the superior court for further proceedings.
background 
the underlying grand jury proceeding.
the writ petition arises out of a grand jury investigation into allegations that certain roman catholic priests,employed by the archdiocese of los angeles,committed acts of child molestation.as we noted in our previous opinion in this matter,on june,the los angeles county district attorney served grand jury subpoenas on the archdiocese custodian of records,seeking all documents in the archdiocese possession or confidential personnel files that relate in any way to allegations of child molestation or sexual abuse by any of the petitioners three roman catholic priests.the archdiocese produced the requested documents,which the trial court sealed because the priests immediately moved to quash the subpoenas.superior court th,d,fn.omitted.
when the superior court ruled the subpoenas were not facially defective for failing to meet the affidavit requirements set forth in code of civil procedure section,subdivision b affidavit shall be served with subpoena duces tecum showing good cause and materiality and service of subpoena duces tecum is invalid without affidavit,several of the priests filed a petition for writ of mandate in this court.that writ petition argued the subpoenas should be quashed because the grand jury had no authority to issue subpoenas duces tecum and,even if it did,the subpoenas were facially defective.the substantive evidentiary privilege claims being asserted against the subpoena demands were held in abeyance pending our resolution of the writ petition.
on december,in response to that writ petition,this court issued superior court,in which we held that california criminal grand juries have the power to issue subpoenas duces tecum,and such subpoenas do not require good cause affidavits.superior court,supra,th at,d.
appointment of discovery referee.
after our opinion was filed,the people,the individual priests and the archdiocese stipulated to the appointment of judge retired thomas nuss the referee to resolve the substantive issues raised by the motions to quash.according to the referee,he had been appointed to hear and determine any and all of the issues with regard to the subpoenas duces tecum,whether of fact or of law,and to report a statement of decision in writing to the superior court.
on april,the referee held a hearing on the motions to quash,during which counsel argued the general legal principles they felt applied to the various evidentiary privileges being asserted against the demands made in the subpoenas duces tecum.almost the entire hearing was conducted in open court out of a transcript,only pages were filed under seal.however,the referee subsequently decided it had been a mistake to hold a public hearing.on august,he issued an order denying public access to pleadings and decision related to grand jury subpoenas which directed that all future pleadings,orders and hearings involved in litigating the motions to quash would be closed and sealed.on september,the los angeles times and the los angeles daily journal filed the instant writ petition,seeking to overturn the referee closure order.
issues raised 
petitioners,asserting there is enormous public interest in this case,ask us to vacate the referee august sealing order on the ground it violates their presumptive right of public access to judicial proceedings.
petitioners also contend there is no legal justification for keeping under seal the superior court order appointing judge nuss to act as the discovery referee.
real party in interest district attorney of los angeles contends there is no presumptive right of public access to grand jury proceedings.however,the district attorney also contends,the privilege litigation concerning the motion to quash the grand jury subpoenas in this case is merely ancillary to the grand jury proceeding itself.since there is intense public interest in the subject of the grand jury proceedings and the litigation of the motions to quash the subpoenas does not require disclosure of grand jury materials,there is no countervailing reason to maintain secrecy for these proceedings.italics added.
real parties in interest the priests and the archdiocese contend the writ petition must be dismissed as procedurally defective on the ground petitioners never made a formal motion in the superior court seeking to reverse the referee sealing order.
as to the substantive issues,these real parties in interest agree with the district attorney that there is no presumptive right of public access to grand jury proceedings.but,contrary to the district attorney position,they contend the general rule of grand jury secrecy justifies the referee blanket order sealing these ancillary grand jury proceedings.
discussion 
the writ petition is not procedurally barred.
real parties in interest the archdiocese and the priests ask us to dismiss the writ petition as premature because petitioners allegedly did not first exhaust all available remedies in the superior court.see phelan superior court cal d,although code civ,does not expressly forbid the issuance of the writ if another adequate remedy exists,it has long been established as a general rule that the writ will not be issued if another such remedy was available to the petitioner.the archdiocese acknowledges petitioners did request access to the proceedings by informal letter,but the archdiocese contends the writ petition must be dismissed because petitioners never filed a formal motion in the superior court asking to have the referee sealing order reversed.this claim is meritless.
one of petitioners informal letters was quite extensive,citing and discussing the same california and united states supreme court cases petitioners rely on in the writ petition itself.moreover,the referee treated petitioners informal requests as actual motions,saying although a formal motion has not been filed,the referee is aware that the media have sought access to the pleadings and orders related to these proceedings,and the referee is aware that the media have sought access to the pleadings and orders related to these proceedings.the court treats those efforts as a request to hold public hearings and to permit public inspection of the pleadings and the referee decision.in ruling on that motion,the court denies the requests for the reasons set forth herein.
given the referee treatment of petitioners letters,we can not see how forcing petitioners to make a more formal request for public access would amount to anything but a waste of time and effort.the request to dismiss the writ petition as premature is denied.
referee appointment order will be made public.
petitioners ask us to make public the superior court january,stipulation and order for reference appointing judge nuss to be the discovery referee.no party objects to this,and we agree there is no reason to keep this aspect of the proceedings secret.
petitioners have no presumptive right of access to grand jury proceedings.
petitioners contend the referee sealing order must be reversed because it violates their presumptive first amendment right of access to judicial proceedings.this claim is meritless.
general rule of grand jury secrecy indicates no presumptive right.
petitioners contend that closing the hearings and sealing the pleadings involved in litigating the motions to quash will violate their right of access as established by nbc subsidiary,superior court,supra,cal th,d,nbc subsidiary petitioners assert a presumptive right of access to the materials they seek,and argue,the only questions are whether some exception to the public presumptive access rights applies to the proceedings and records at issue,or if no exception applies,whether there is some compelling justification for the blanket closure and sealing order issued by respondent.neither requirement is present here.
the claim that nbc subsidiary gives petitioners a presumptive right of access to grand jury proceedings is incorrect.in construing code of civil procedure section mandate that the sittings of every court shall be public,nbc subsidiary said i t is clear today that substantive courtroom proceedings in ordinary civil and criminal cases are presumptively open and that section must be interpreted to preclude closure of proceedings that satisfy the high court historical considerations nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d.but nbc subsidiary also pointed out this presumptive right of access did not apply to grand jury proceedings,saying in ii,the high court distinguished presumptively open preliminary hearings from other proceedings as to which there is no first amendment right of access.it observed although many governmental processes operate best under public scrutiny,it takes little imagination to recognize that there are some kinds of government operations that would be totally frustrated if conducted openly.a classic example is that the proper functioning of our grand jury system depends upon the secrecy of grand jury proceedings.citation.nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,fn,d,italics added.
petitioners denigrate this language as mere dicta in a footnote in nbc subsidiary,which in turn quotes dicta from ii.nevertheless,it is language that correctly states an essential principle about which petitioners are mistaken.
ii described a test for access claims.in cases dealing with the claim of a first amendment right of access to criminal proceedings,our decisions have emphasized two complementary considerations.first,because a tradition of accessibility implies the favorable judgment of experiences,citation,we have considered whether the place and process have historically been open to the press and general public.second,the court has traditionally considered whether public access plays a significant positive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.ii,supra,at.
grand jury proceedings fail both steps in this test and,as a result,the usual presumption of access is reversed.see,douglas oil petrol stops northwest,supra,d when deciding if the traditional secrecy of the grand jury may be broken,i t is clear that disclosure is appropriate only in those cases where the need for it outweighs the public interest in secrecy,and that the burden of demonstrating this balance rests upon the private party seeking disclosure united states smith cir,douglas oil implicitly makes clear that grand jury proceedings are not subject to a first amendment right of access under the test of experience and logic.historically,such proceedings have been closed to the public.moreover,public access to grand jury proceedings would hinder,rather than further,the efficient functioning of the proceedings.not only are grand jury proceedings not subject to any first amendment right of access,but third parties can gain access to grand jury matters only under limited circumstances.in re subpoena to testify before grand jury directed to custodian of records cir,in order to justify lifting the secrecy that normally surrounds the grand jury proceedings,courts must find a particularized need for the disclosure that outweighs the benefits of maintaining the secrecy.citation.even when the person requesting such disclosure has shown a particularized need for the materials,access is limited and covers only those materials actually needed.
california case law likewise demonstrates no presumptive right.
petitioners have no presumptive right of access to grand jury proceedings or materials under california law.a trilogy of seminal california supreme court cases demonstrates that nbc subsidiary footnote correctly states the general rule regarding grand jury secrecy.these cases demonstrate the power to disclose grand jury material is far more restricted than the power to prevent disclosure,and that a superior court exercising supervisory authority over a grand jury has inherent power to prevent unauthorized disclosures of grand jury material.
people superior court grand jury cal d,held that if a proposed grand jury report exceeds established legal limits,the superior court which convenes the grand jury and which is responsible for its supervision may properly refuse to file the report.although no california statute explicitly authorizes such judicial action,this limited review is implicit in the statutory scheme confining the grand jury investigatory authority to specifically enumerated subjects id.at,italics added.
mcclatchy newspapers superior court,supra,cal d,held a superior court had properly prevented a grand jury from disclosing raw evidentiary materials gathered during a secret watchdog investigation,including transcripts of testimony,summaries and analyses of testimony,and documentary exhibits.id.at.mcclatchy reasoned the use of secrecy to protect grand jurors from the abuses of the crown dates from the century for the most part,grand jury proceedings since that time have been closed to the public and records of such proceedings have been kept from the public eye.citation.most importantly,the right and duty of the grand jurors to conduct their investigations,deliberations and voting in secret,which were won and established in england,are substantially the same for the modern california grand jurors.citation.that the legislature intended to incorporate this heritage of secrecy into the present grand jury system is plainly and amply shown in the governing provisions of the penal code.id.at,italics added.g rand jury secrecy is the rule and openness the exception,permitted only when specifically authorized by statute.id.at.
daily journal corporation superior court cal th,d,held a superior court could not disclose materials gathered during a grand jury investigation into the notorious orange county bankruptcy case,after the grand jury terminated without indicting anyone.the question before us is whether the superior court in this matter had authority to disclose grand jury materials to the public when none of the grand jury statutes was applicable.the court of appeal determined that the answer is yes,based on the superior court inherent powers,including its power to supervise grand jury proceedings the court of appeal purported to find no statutes or cases that would prohibit the disclosure of criminal grand jury materials in this matter.concluding that the legislature seems not to have addressed the question,it ruled that,in effect,whatever exercise of authority to disclose grand jury materials has not been expressly prohibited by the legislature is permitted.we disagree.id.at,d.rather,the legislature has addressed the question of grand jury secrecy and disclosure of grand jury materials extensively and comprehensively in the penal code.viewing that statutory scheme as a whole,it appears that the legislature intended disclosure of grand jury materials to be strictly limited.as we explained more than a century ago in this state the whole matter of disclosing grand jury proceedings is regulated by statute.citation.by enacting the statutes governing the exceptional cases citation in which a court may order disclosure of grand jury materials,the legislature has,in effect,occupied the field absent express legislative authorization,a court may not require disclosure.id.at,d,fn.omitted.
this line of cases establishes that nondisclosure is the preeminent rule for california grand jury proceedings,that public access is regulated by express statutory authorization,and that even the inherent powers of a superior court supervising a grand jury are severely restricted when the court seeks to disclose grand jury materials.clearly there is no presumptive right of public access to grand jury proceedings in california.
status of ancillary grand jury proceedings in the superior court.
all the parties agree that whether the california rules governing grand jury secrecy apply to ancillary proceedings,such as the motions to quash grand jury subpoenas being litigated herein,is a question of first impression.
petitioners argue all of the case law we have discussed so far is irrelevant because the penal code provisions governing grand jury secrecy only apply to the disclosure of testimony and materials placed before the grand jury,and have no application to the pleadings,orders,or hearings in the matter pending before judge nuss.petitioners assert,respondent august order is based solely on the rationale that secrecy is necessary to protect the confidentiality of grand jury proceedings.citation.but petitioners are not seeking access to documents subpoenaed by the grand jury,to any witnesses testimony before the grand jury,or to grand jury deliberations.
no california case has dealt with the problem of ancillary grand jury proceedings,proceedings that relate to a grand jury investigation but do not occur in front of the grand jurors themselves,such as the discovery matters being litigated in front of judge nuss.fortunately,however,we do not write on a completely blank slate.we have found it useful to examine how the federal rules and other states have approached this problem.
consideration of former rule,federal rules of criminal procedure.
before,federal grand juries were governed by a general rule of secrecy which,like california grand jury statutory scheme,did not expressly address ancillary proceedings.federal rules of criminal procedure,former rule e,provided only that a grand juror,an interpreter,a stenographer shall not disclose matters occurring before the grand jury,except as otherwise provided for in these rules.italics added.see securities exchange com dresser indus.
however,federal cases interpreting the version of rule e,as well as courts in states having general grand jury secrecy laws similar to california,conclude that ancillary proceedings should be kept secret to the extent necessary to safeguard the grand jury process,to the extent ancillary proceedings might tend to reveal what has transpired,or is likely to transpire in the future,before the grand jury.
prior to the amendment adding a provision for sealing grand jury subpoenas,citation,federal courts were faced with the question of whether a motion for disclosure of grand jury subpoenas under rule e would fall under the general rule of nondisclosure of matters occurring before the grand jury.generally,the federal courts have held that disclosure of grand jury subpoenas would reveal the names of witnesses,which are matters occurring before the grand jury.citations.the secrecy requirement of rule e applies not only to information drawn from transcripts of grand jury proceedings,but also to anything which may tend to reveal what transpired before the grand jury.citation.pigman evansville press.although the bare language of the federal rule and the indiana statute each suggests that confidentiality is limited to what took place behind the closed door of the grand jury room,the courts have not so limited the scope of rule e,in order to implement the policy of secrecy so fundamental to the functioning of the grand jury system.id.at,italics added.
our own research has confirmed pigman analysis.see,in re grand jury investigation cir,former rule e applies not only to information drawn from transcripts of grand jury proceedings,but also to anything which may tend to reveal what transpired before the grand jury.application of state of california,although not matters occurring before the grand jury,it seems obvious that the names of witnesses subpoenaed to testify,as well as documents subpoenaed and used by them in their deliberations,are matters occurring before the grand jury.state ex rel.beacon journal waters ohio,subpoenas and witness book were covered by state general grand jury secrecy rule,relying on federal cases construing former rule e in re proc.of multicounty grand jury,we will not interpret such omissions from the oklahoma statutes as a conscious decision to exclude from secrecy protections court hearings on matters affecting a grand jury proceeding,including witness immunity hearings palm beach newspapers,doe so d,we hold that a hearing ancillary or related to a grand jury session constitutes a proceeding which comes within the protections of florida law providing that grand jury proceedings are secret.
this case law from foreign jurisdictions offers valuable guidance because these cases were interpreting statutes that,like our own penal code grand jury secrecy provisions contained no express provision for handling ancillary proceedings.
current federal grand jury rules also provide guidance.
in,the federal rules were amended to include specific provisions for handling ancillary grand jury proceedings.federal rule of criminal procedure,rule e,now provides subject to any right to an open hearing in a contempt proceeding,the court must close any hearing to the extent necessary to prevent disclosure of a matter occurring before a grand jury.federal rule of criminal procedure,rule e,now provides records,orders,and subpoenas relating to proceedings must be kept under seal to the extent and as long as necessary to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of a matter occurring before a grand jury.
in formulating a california approach to the problem of ancillary grand jury proceedings,we can be guided by the amended federal rule.we agree with the view of one federal court,which explained as a matter of judicial administration,initially closing all ancillary proceedings makes good sense.if a hearing is about something affecting a grand jury investigation,there will nearly always be a danger of revealing grand jury matters.consider a challenge to a witness claim of a testimonial privilege.the prosecutor appears before the chief judge seeking an order to compel testimony.the witness identity,the fact that he was subpoenaed to testify,the fact that he invoked the privilege in response to questions,the nature of the questions these would be,according to our precedent,citation,matters occurring before the grand jury.to suppose that the first amendment compels the court to conduct such hearings by placing the witness behind a screen and by emptying the courtroom each time a grand jury matter reaches the tip of an attorney or the judge tongue is to suppose the ridiculous c ourts can not conduct their business that way,nor should they be compelled to do so.in re motions of dow jones,fn.omitted,italics added.a proceeding in the district court to quash a subpoena,or to compel testimony,or to immunize a witness would,it seems to us,almost invariably reveal matters occurring before the grand jury,and thus may properly be closed to the public.in ancillary proceedings dealing with other subjects,however,it may be difficult to determine at the outset whether grand jury matters might wind up being discussed.id.at,italics added.
we find the current federal rule addressing ancillary grand jury procee
