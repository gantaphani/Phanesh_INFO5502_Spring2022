this appeal is the second occasion we have had recently to decide issues stemming from a defamation action brought by neal horsley in response to criticisms of him in the wake of the murder of doctor barnett slepian,an abortion provider.the first occasion was in a case where horsley claimed that geraldo rivera had defamed him during a television program by accusing him of a felony when he said that horsley had aided and abetted murder and was an accomplice to murder.horsley rivera,cir.this court held the statements in that case were protected as rhetorical hyperbole under the first amendment and georgia law,and for that reason the district court should have granted the defendant judgment on the pleadings.id.at.
although the defamation case giving rise to this appeal also had its origins in criticisms of horsley because of the murder of slepian,it involves different statements and defendants.here horsley suit is against the planned parenthood federation of america planned parenthood its president,gloria feldt the national organization for women now and its executive vice president,kim gandy and the lawsuit arises out of statements allegedly made by feldt and gandy shortly after slepian murder.
although applying the same principles of law as we did in the related case,rivera,we reach a somewhat different conclusion in this case.while we affirm most of the district court judgment on the pleadings for the defendants,we reverse the part of the judgment that involves one of the statements allegedly made by feldt.
background and procedural history 
horsley,an activist and founder of the creator rights party,created and operated an internet website known as the nuremberg files,which listed the names of abortion providers.slepian was murdered on october.his name did not appear on the nuremberg files website prior to his murder,but on october,the day after the murder,horsley added slepian name to the list.also on october,horsley altered the nuremberg files website to graphically reflect which abortion providers had been wounded or killed he did so by the wounded and the dead.slepian name was shown with a line struck through it.
a.the feldt statements 
on october,defendant gloria feldt,in her capacity as president of planned parenthood,held a press conference about slepian murder.the associated press ran an article reporting on feldt statements at the press conference.the complaint alleged the article stated that feldt told a news conference in midtown manhattan that the name of the physician,barnett slepian,had appeared on a list of abortion doctors marked for death that was circulated on the internet,and that feldt said she did know how long the internet target list that included slepian name has existed,or whether either he or the police were aware of it.
although horsley did not include a copy of the ap article with his complaint,feldt and planned parenthood attached a copy of it to their answer.the attached article contained the statements quoted by horsley in the complaint,which we have quoted in the preceding paragraph,and it also reported that slepian name was crossed off after he was gunned down in his suburban amherst home late friday.the article further characterized feldt as charg ing that police in buffalo,failed to protect a slain abortion doctor because of a fundamental philosophy within the department,and it included several paragraphs about feldt remarks on police bias.
portions of feldt press conference were broadcast nationwide by cnn live news on october.as alleged by horsley,the cnn broadcast showed feldt stating that slepian name had been on a can look it up on the web,list of doctors who are subject to surveillance and murder.his name was already crossed out.horsley did not include the cnn transcript with his complaint,but feldt and planned parenthood included with their amended answer two cnn transcripts.those transcripts did not include the statements that horsley alleged feldt made,which we have quoted in this paragraph,and feldt and planned parenthood stated that they had been unable to locate any cnn transcripts containing those statements.horsley claimed that he had a transcript of the cnn broadcast reflecting the statements he alleged feldt made,but he did not provide a copy of that transcript.
b.the gandy statements 
on october,horsley voluntarily participated in a televised debate on cnn today with defendant kim gandy,the executive vice president of now.horsley complaint alleged that the following exchange occurred during the debate 
jeanne meserve,cnn anchor horsley,let me start with you.do you advocate the murder of doctors who perform abortions what was the purpose of your web site 
neal horsley,founder,creator rights party absolutely not.we want to make one thing clear,that we do want to see anybody die.but the fact is,babies are going to die today,and that fact has been ignored for the last years.and the thing the nuremberg site is doing is reminding people that doctors who kill babies,even if it is authorized by the supreme court,might find themselves on trial someday in the same way that the nazis found themselves on trial at nuremberg.
meserve so why,exactly,do you have their names on the web site 
horsley because we are making a record,a database,of the people who are actually involved in slaughtering babies and who make a living slaughtering babies,because we want to accumulate evidence in hopes that someday trials might actually be held where that evidence would be used to prosecute those people.
kim gandy,national organization for women and for that,of course 
meserve kim gandy,your response.
gandy you need to have the names of their children,the ages of their children,where their children need to go to school obviously,you need that kind of information.you not any better than the folks who sign the justifiable homicide petition and one of those,paul hill,went on himself to murder a doctor in pensacola,florida.
you have the blood of these doctors on your hands,because you have incited and you have inspired and conspired with others to result in what exactly has happened,that these doctors have been murdered.and until the united states government starts treating these,instead of treating them as isolated incidents,starts treating them as the conspiracy that they are and starts putting the same resources into these murderers that went into the olympic bombings,that went into the world trade center bombings,we are going to see this continue to happen.doctors and clinical workers will die.
c.the district court proceedings 
horsley filed a complaint against feldt,planned parenthood,gandy,and now,claiming they had defamed him by accusing him of conspiring in slepian murder,and claiming that they had conspired together to defame him.the defendants filed answers and some motions,including motions for judgment on the pleadings,contending that feldt and gandy statements were protected expressions of opinion and rhetorical hyperbole.horsley moved for production of documents,but the district court suspended discovery pending a ruling on the defendants motions for judgment on the pleadings.thereafter,the district court granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of the defendants.horsley filed a timely appeal 
ii.discussion 
horsley contends the district court erred in determining based on the pleadings that feldt and gandy statements were not actionable we review de novo a district court entry of judgment on the pleadings,accepting the facts in the complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see ortega christian,cir.judgment on the pleadings is appropriate only when the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.moore liberty life ins,cir internal marks omitted,cert.denied,d.we begin with the gandy statements,because it is easier to sort out the alleged facts relating to them.
a.the gandy statements 
horsley contends gandy defamed him during their televised debate on cnn.the supreme court has long recognized a profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited,robust,and.new york times sullivan,d.acknowledging that debate may well include vehement,caustic,and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks,the court nevertheless has decided that such attacks are constitutionally protected and those who make them are exempt from liability for defamation if the attacks are simply rhetorical hyperbole.see,milkovich lorain journal,d old dominion branch,ass of letter carriers austin,d letter carriers greenbelt coop.publ g ass bresler,d.the constitutional protection provided rhetorical hyperbole reflects the reality that exaggeration and commentary have become an integral part of social discourse.rivera,at quoting levinsky,stores,cir.gandy and now contend that her statements were merely rhetorical hyperbole for which they can not be held liable.
in determining whether an expression is protected rhetorical hyperbole,we must consider the circumstances in which the statement was expressed.rivera,at.in rivera,although geraldo rivera had stated that horsley was an accomplice to homicide and that he had aid ed and abet ted a homicide,the context of those remarks led us to conclude that they were rhetorical hyperbole.id.at.rivera comments were made during an emotional debate concerning issues of significant public concern both rivera and horsley had used,figurative language in expressing their views horsley statements showed that he understood rivera to be speaking in a figurative rather than literal sense and statements by both of them instill ed upon a reasonable viewer the impression that the parties were exchanging dialogue at a level.id.for those reasons,we held that a reasonable viewer would have understood rivera comments merely as expressing his belief that horsley shared in the moral culpability for slepian death,not as a literal assertion that horsley had,by his actions,committed a felony.see also bresler,at.at,holding that statements characterizing plaintiff negotiating position as blackmail were not defamatory but instead were vigorous epithet s used by those who considered the plaintiff negotiating position extremely unreasonable,because statements were made during a tumultuous public meeting where t he debates themselves were heated,as debates about controversial issues usually are.
the same is true here.the context of gandy statements and their flavor convince us that they are rhetorical hyperbole.gandy and horsley were engaged in heated debate on the highly controversial topic of abortion and the subject of the nuremberg files and the murder of abortion providers.see,rivera,at see also stenberg carhart,d,concurring the issue of abortion is one of the most contentious and controversial in contemporary american society.their debate occurred only three days after slepian was killed.gandy made the statements in question after horsley had said that the nuremberg files is reminding people that doctors who kill babies,even if it is authorized by the supreme court,might find themselves on trial someday in the same way that the nazis found themselves on trial at nuremberg,and that we are making a record,a database,of the people who are actually involved in slaughtering babies and who make a living slaughtering babies,because we want to accumulate evidence in hopes that someday trials might actually be held where that evidence would be used to prosecute those people.gandy responded to horsley 
you not any better than the folks who sign the justifiable homicide petition and one of those,paul hill,went on himself to murder a doctor in pensacola,florida.
you have the blood of these doctors on your hands,because you have incited and you have inspired and conspired with others to result in what exactly has happened,that these doctors have been murdered.and until the united states government starts treating these,instead of treating them as isolated incidents,starts treating them as the conspiracy that they are and starts putting the same resources into these murderers that went into the olympic bombings,that went into the world trade center bombings,we are going to see this continue to happen.doctors and clinical workers will die.
emphasis added.
taken in context,gandy statements consisted of the sort of loose,figurative language that no reasonable person would believe presented facts.rivera,at see also milkovich,at.at.her comments were lusty and imaginative expression s of the contempt felt by her towards horsley,letter carriers,at.at,but they did not actually accuse horsley of criminal action.although gandy compared horsley with the justifiable homicide petition signers,she then distinguished him from paul hill by stating that hill went on himself to murder a doctor.
gandy statement that horsley had conspired with others to result in what exactly has happened,that these doctors have been murdered,was part of her expression of contempt for horsley message and his way of getting that message out,and a way of voicing her opinion that his message had contributed to the atmosphere of violence that had led to the deaths of abortion providers.in view of the undisputed facts,it was fair comment or,more to the point,constitutionally protected comment.given the context and the surrounding comments of both horsley and gandy,a reasonable listener would not have taken the statement as a literal assertion that horsley had actually conspired in the technical legal sense with those who actually murdered slepian to bring about his death,thereby committing a felony.see rivera,at.importantly,gandy did not imply that she had access to any facts,beyond those that were undisputed,which cast horsley in a bad light.in their context,the inflammatory words gandy used hyperbolically accused horsley only of that actual conduct to which he freely to the world a list of abortion providers and then striking through the names as they were killed.the point of her words was that specific conduct made horsley morally culpable of same,in her view,as if he had actually conspired with those who committed it.the district court did not err in granting judgment on the pleadings 
b.the feldt statements 
horsley also challenges the district court grant of judgment on the pleadings to feldt and planned parenthood on his defamation claim involving feldt alleged statements at the press conference as reported in the ap article and broadcast on cnn.the theory of that claim,as with the one involving the gandy statements,is that feldt statements implicitly accused horsley of conspiring in slepian murder.before applying the law,we have to determine what the alleged facts are,and that requires a decision about the scope of the materials that define the facts,because feldt and planned parenthood attached to their amended answer materials that were not included in the complaint.they ask us to consider those materials,and horsley objects to our doing so.we will dispose of that preliminary issue before turning to the merits of the judgment on the pleadings.
whether attachments to the answer may be considered in deciding a motion for judgment on the pleadings 
in his complaint,horsley quoted feldt alleged statements from an ap article and a cnn broadcast,but he did not attach either the article itself or a transcript of the broadcast.feldt and planned parenthood included as exhibits to their amended answer both an ap article and t he actual available transcripts of the two cnn broadcasts that contain excerpts from the press conference in granting judgment on the pleadings in favor of feldt and planned parenthood,the district court considered the ap article attached to the amended answer 
federal rule of civil procedure c contains a conversion provision which states that i f,on a motion for judgment on the pleadings,matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court,the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in rule,and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by rule.rule a defines pleadings to include both the complaint and the answer,and rule c provides that a copy of any written instrument which is an exhibit to a pleading is a part thereof for all purpose
