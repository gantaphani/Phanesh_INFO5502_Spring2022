in this latest round of litigation concerning california adoption of an initiative constitutional amendment to prohibit marriage,we must decide whether the district court abused its discretion by ordering the unsealing of the video recording of the trial,which had purportedly been prepared by the trial judge for his use only and was later placed in the record and sealed by him.the order,issued by his successor following his retirement,would permit the broadcast of the recording for all to view.
it is important to explain at the outset what our resolution of this case is not about.first,we do not resolve any of the policy questions with which courts are now struggling about how to reconcile the traditional concept of openness in judicial proceedings with the development of technology that has given the term a new meaning.the judicial conference of the united states and circuit judicial councils have been considering this issue for some time,and we have neither the need nor the desire to offer an additional opinion here.while we agree with justice holmes that the trial of causes should take place under the public eye,because it is of the highest moment that those who administer justice should always act under the sense of public responsibility,and that every citizen should be able to satisfy himself with his own eyes as to the mode in which a public duty is performed,cowley pulsifer,the trial in this case was held under the public eye in the traditional sense of the phrase.whether or how courts should meet the spirit as well as the letter of justice holmes admonition,for example by authorizing the broadcast of trials in particular circumstances or as a general matter,will be determined ultimately by the judiciary as an institution or by mandate from congress.the narrower consideration that controls our decision here is whether,given the unique circumstances surrounding the creation and sealing of the recording of the trial in this case,the public is entitled to view that recording some two years after the trial.
second,our ruling has nothing to do with the freedom of the press to publish,describe,or comment on any information to which it obtains access.rather,the question here is whether courts are required or even free to give to the media information that is not ordinarily available and specifically whether a recording purportedly made for the sole purpose of aiding the trial judge in the preparation of his opinion,and then placed in the record and sealed,may shortly thereafter be made public by the court.
we resolve the narrow question before us on a narrow basis when we conclude that the district court abused its discretion by ordering the unsealing of the recording of the trial notwithstanding the trial judge commitment to the parties that the recording would not be publicly broadcast.the trial judge on several occasions unequivocally promised that the recording of the trial would be used only in chambers and not publicly broadcast.he made these commitments because the supreme court had intervened in this very case in a manner that required him to do so,hollingsworth perry,d per curiam.thus,his commitments were not merely broad assurances about the privacy of judicial records in the case they could not have been more explicitly directed toward the particular recording at issue.in finding that the trial judge had not made a commitment to deny the public access to the recording,the district court abused its discretion its finding was without support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record.united states hinkson,cir en banc.the district court further abused its discretion by holding that the determinations made by the trial judge regarding the placement of the recording under seal did not bind a different judge presented with a motion to unseal a conclusion that we regard as an implausible and illogical application of the law.id.
each of these abuses of discretion manifests the same basic error the district court failed to appreciate the nature of the statements that the trial judge had made to the litigants,the specific factual and legal context in which he made them,and the consequences of his having done so.the integrity of our judicial system depends in no small part on the ability of litigants and members of the public to rely on a judge word.the record compels the finding that the trial judge representations to the parties were solemn commitments.upon this record,there is only one plausible application of the standard for sealing a record that is,arguendo,subject to the right of public access the interest in preserving the sanctity of the judicial process is a compelling reason to override the presumption in favor of the recording release.we therefore reverse the order of the district court as an abuse of its discretion and remand with instructions to maintain the recording under seal.
in the weeks prior to the january trial in this case,the trial judge,former chief judge vaughn walker of the district court for the northern district of california,expressed a desire to satisfy the public interest in the case by broadcasting a video feed of the proceedings to various federal courthouses and online.that may well have been a reasonable desire,but the decision was not entirely his to make.the ninth circuit judicial council had established a pilot program in to allow the broadcast of certain proceedings in district courts within the circuit,and the chief judge of the circuit had approved this case inclusion in that pilot program.several days later,the northern district of california amended its local rule governing cameras in the courtroom to allow for participation in the program of cases brought in that district.then,on the morning of the first day of trial,the supreme court at the request of appellants,the official proponents of proposition proponents issued a temporary stay of the broadcast.hollingsworth perry,d mem.two days later,the court entered a further stay pending the filing of a petition for mandamus or certiorari,holding that the courts below did not follow the appropriate procedures set forth in federal law before changing their rules to allow such broadcasting.hollingsworth perry,d per curiam.the effect of the court intervention was that for the duration of the trial in this matter,the effective version of the district court local rule prohibited the recording of the trial for future broadcast 
the district court recorded the first two days of the trial on the basis that the supreme court might decide to lift the temporary stay,but after the supreme court stay became permanent,proponents asked that the recording be stopped.it was in this context that chief judge walker responded as follows 
the local rule permits the recording for purposes of use in chambers and i think it would be quite helpful to me in preparing the findings of fact to have that recording.so that the purpose for which the recording is going to be made going forward.but it not going to be for purposes of public broadcasting or televising.
proponents dropped their objection at that point 
in may,shortly before closing arguments,chief judge walker offered to make copies of the video recording available to any parties to the proceeding who wished to use excerpts during their arguments,with the proviso that the copies would be maintained under a strict protective order plaintiffs and the city and county of san francisco obtained copies.after closing arguments,proponents moved to require the return of the copies.
chief judge walker opinion,issued on august,resolved any remaining question regarding the status of the recordings 
the trial proceedings were recorded and used by the court in preparing the findings of fact and conclusions of law the clerk is now directed to file the trial recording under seal as part of the record.the parties may retain their copies of the trial recording pursuant to the terms of the protective order herein.proponents motion to order the copies return is accordingly denied.
perry schwarzenegger,d,document citations omitted.in their appeal from the judgment,proponents challenged neither the denial of their motion to compel the return of the copies nor the district court entry of the recording in the record.
in the same opinion,chief judge walker cited the elimination of the potential for public broadcast of the trial as a negative factor in weighing the evidence offered by proponents.observing that proponents elected not to call the majority of their designated witnesses to testify at trial,chief judge walker quoted proponents counsel explanation that the witnesses had been extremely concerned about their personal safety,and did not want to appear with any recording of any sort,whatsoever.id.at.he then rejected this explanation,on the basis that proponents failed to make any effort to call their witnesses after the potential for public broadcast in the case had been eliminated.id.emphasis added.
less than a year after issuing his opinion,chief judge walker retired from the bench.both before and after his retirement,he displayed excerpts from the trial recording during public appearances.as a result,proponents asked us to order the return of all copies of the trial recording.plaintiffs filed a to unseal the recording.we transferred these motions and the supporting papers to the district court.after chief judge ware,who replaced chief judge walker as the presiding judge,ordered all parties in possession of copies of the recording to show cause why those copies should not be returned,former chief judge walker lodged his copy with the court,and chief judge ware discharged the order as to him.
on june,chief judge ware denied proponents motion for the return of the trial recording,finding that no violation of the protective order had occurred he also indicated that he would return the recording to former chief judge walker.in response to chief judge ware invitation,proponents filed a brief asking that the recording not be returned to former chief judge walker or that it be held by him under the terms of the protective order.
on september,chief judge ware granted plaintiffs to unseal the recording.perry schwarzenegger,no.c jw,wl.he concluded that the right of public access applied to the recording,that neither the supreme court decision in hollingsworth nor the local rule governing audiovisual recordings barred its release,and that proponents had made no showing sufficient to justify its sealing in the face of the right.id.at.he also directed that a copy of the recording be returned to former chief judge walker.id.at.
this appeal followed.we granted proponents motion for a stay pending appeal and allowed the media coalition to intervene.
two questions are presented first,whether the trial recording is subject to the presumption of public access and second,whether there is a sufficiently compelling reason to override any such presumption here.in reversing the district court decision to unseal the recording,we assume,for purposes of this case only,that the answer to the first question is yes and decide only the second question.
we review for abuse of discretion a decision to unseal the judicial record.kamakana city county of honolulu,cir.under the standard,if the trial court identified the correct legal rule to apply to the relief requested,we must determine whether the trial court application of the correct legal standard was illogical,implausible,or without support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record.hinkson,at.if it was,then we are able to have a definite and firm conviction that the district court reached a conclusion that was a mistake or was not among its permissible options,and thus that it abused its discretion.id.in addition,an error of law constitutes an abuse of discretion.id.at.thus,we also reverse if,in applying the proper legal standard,the trial court overlooks or misconstrues any binding precedent.see yokoyama midland nat.life ins,cir.
historically,courts have recognized a general right to inspect and copy public records and documents,including judicial records and documents.kamakana,at quoting nixon warner communications,d.proponents present two arguments that this right of public access does not apply to the recording at issue here.the first is that the video recording of a trial is not one of the types of records to which the right attaches.the second is that northern district of california local rule,under the terms of which the trial was recorded in the first place,abrogates the common law.as noted above,we need not and do not decide whether proponents arguments are in any respect meritorious we simply assume,without deciding,for purposes of this case only,that the presumption of public access applies to the recording at issue here and that it is not abrogated by the local rule in question.
the common law right of access is not absolute and can be overridden given sufficiently compelling reasons for doing so.foltz state farm mut.auto.ins,cir.we conclude that there is a compelling reason in this case for overriding the right and that,in failing to identify that reason on the basis of the record before it,the district court abused its discretion.the reason is that proponents reasonably relied on chief judge walker specific assurances compelled by the supreme court opinion that the recording would not be broadcast to the public,at least in the foreseeable future while chief judge ware found that no such assurances had been given and concluded that,in any event,he was not bound by promises made by his predecessor,wl,at,his finding was without support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record,and his conclusion which contravenes the very notion of judicial integrity was an implausible and illogical application of the compelling reason standard to the facts at issue here.hinkson,at.chief judge ware thus abused his discretion.id.
interpreted in their full context,at least two of chief judge walker statements amount to unequivocal assurances that the video recording at issue would not be accessible to the public.no other inference can plausibly be drawn from the record.first,following the supreme court issuance of a stay against the public broadcast of the trial,chief judge walker stated in open court that he was going to continue taking the recording for purposes of use in chambers,but that the recording was not going to be for purposes of public broadcasting or televising.it would be unreasonable to expect proponents,upon reading the supreme court opinion and hearing chief judge walker statement in response,to foresee that a recording made for such limited purposes might nonetheless be released for viewing by the public,either during or after the trial.had chief judge walker not made the statement he did,proponents would very likely have sought an order directing him to stop recording forthwith,which,given the prior temporary and further stay they had just obtained from the supreme court,they might well have secured.
second,chief judge walker stated in his opinion citing the supreme court temporary and permanent stays that the potential for public broadcast in the case had been eliminated.perry,d at emphasis added.he made that statement in the context of criticizing proponents for not having presented additional witnesses witnesses who had,according to proponents,been reluctant to appear with any recording of any sort.id.without that unequivocal statement,proponents again might well have taken action to ensure that the recording would not be made available for public viewing.
chief judge ware found that these statements did not constitute a promise by chief judge walker that the recording would not be released to the public.the record compels the opposite inference.chief judge ware based his finding on the fact that chief judge walker had,without objection,made copies of the digital recording available to the parties for use during closing arguments.wl,at.allowing this limited and unchallenged use of the recording,however,was not contrary to chief judge walker prior declarations the closing arguments were not broadcast to the public,and the display of footage during closing arguments served the same purpose as the recording use helping the judge to reach his decision and to prepare his opinion.w
