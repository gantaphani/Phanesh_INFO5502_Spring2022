general motors corporation gm appeals an order of the district court granting the intervenor,the los angeles times,access to confidential settlement information produced by gm under a protective order during discovery in the underlying action.in ordering the documents released to the public,the district court determined the protective order to prevent disclosure of this information was not appropriate,and the los angeles times had a federal common law right of access to these materials.gm appeals,arguing the district court applied incorrect legal standards in deciding whether disclosure was appropriate.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.see beckman indus.international ins,cir.we vacate and remand for further proceedings.
background 
on november,the underlying plaintiffs in this case,darrell and angela byrd and their two minor sons,timothy and samuel,filed a complaint for damages against gm allegedly caused by a defect in the gas tank of a gm pickup truck.before discovery,both sides stipulated to a share protective order that allowed the parties to share all information covered under the order with other litigants in similar cases,but not the public.the order covered executive committee documents,production,sales and profit forecasts,procedures for evaluating defects or with federal safety standards and meetings minutes of the truck and bus fuel system coordination groups.
one of gm experts testified by deposition that information about the amount gm paid in previous settlements involving pickup fires could be important to his analysis of punitive damages.accordingly,the plaintiffs filed a motion to compel gm to produce this settlement information either in the form of individual or aggregate settlement numbers.gm had previously settled cases involving pickup trucks pursuant to agreements which provided that both parties would keep the terms confidential and,thus,vigorously contested the motion.on august,the magistrate judge partially granted the plaintiffs motion and directed gm to produce the total number and aggregate dollar amount of all settlements involving pickup truck fires.at gm request,the magistrate judge ordered this discovery pursuant to the share protective order in place subject to further review and determination by judge molloy as to whether the information produced should be subject to his order.prior to this appeal,gm did not file any objection to this ruling.
pursuant to the magistrate court order,on or about august,gm produced under seal the total number and aggregate dollar amount of its previous settlements for pickups fuel tank claims.in addition,gm included a computed arithmetic average settlement award.on august,plaintiffs filed a motion against gm and attached to their motion as exhibit under seal a copy of the settlement information produced by gm pursuant to the august,order.the plaintiffs contended that gm had violated the magistrate judge order by additionally including the calculation of the average settlement award,which had not been requested.the case settled in october before the court had an opportunity to rule on the motion.the court dismissed the action on november.
after the case had been dismissed,the los angeles times moved to intervene,and requested the district court to unseal exhibit.the los angeles times provided three reasons why the lower court should release the confidential settlement information this information did not deserve a protective order the la times has a common law right of access to exhibit and the newspaper had a first amendment right to these materials.on january,the district court ordered the release of the settlement information on the grounds that it was not covered under the share protective order stipulated by the parties and it independently did not deserve a protective order.furthermore,the court found the common law right of access permitted the los angeles times to receive the information contained in exhibit.the lower court did not address the first amendment issue.the district court stayed this order pending the resolution of this appeal.
ii.discussion 
general motors raises three issues on appeal whether the magistrate judge committed legal error when it ordered gm to produce the settlement information even under a protective order whether the lower court erred by lifting the protective order and whether the lower court erred by deciding the los angeles times had a common law right of access to exhibit.
august order of the magistrate judge 
gm argues the magistrate judge committed legal error by ordering gm to produce confidential settlement information during discovery.gm,however,has waived its right to appeal this ruling to this panel.fed.civ.proc.a requires an aggrieved party to object to any magistrate order within ten days.if the party does not file any objections within ten days,it can not assign as error a defect in the magistrate judge order.a see also simpson lear,cir.
protective order 
we review a lower court decision to grant,lift,or modify a protective order for abuse of discretion.see anderson calderon,cir empire blue cross blue shield janet greeson a place for us,cir.we review de novo,however,whether the lower court used the correct legal standard in determining whether it should have granted a protective order.see kulas flores,cir legal issues are reviewed de novo.
generally,the public can gain access to litigation documents and information produced during discovery unless the party opposing disclosure shows good cause why a protective order is necessary.in san jose mercury news,united states dist,cir,the court said,i t is that the fruits of discovery are,in the absence of a court order to the contrary,presumptively public.rule c authorizes a district court to override this presumption where good cause is shown.see also in re agent orange product liability,cir i f good cause is not shown,the discovery materials in question should not receive judicial protection and therefore would be open to the public.rule c states,in relevant part 
upon motion by a party or by a person from whom discovery is sought and for good cause shown,the court in which the action is pending may make any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance,embarrassment,oppression,or undue burden or expense,including one of more of the following 
that a trade secret or other confidential research,development,or commercial information not be revealed or be revealed only in a designated way 
fed.civ.c,c.
for good cause to exist,the party seeking protection bears the burden of showing specific prejudice or harm will result if no protective order is granted.see beckman,international ins,cir holding that broad allegations of harm,unsubstantiated by specific examples or articulated reasoning,do not satisfy the rule c test see also san jose mercury news,at holding that to gain a protective order the party must make particularized showing of good cause with respect to any individual document.if a court finds particularized harm will result from disclosure of information to the public,then it balances the public and private interests to decide whether a protective order is necessary.see glenmede trust thompson,cir citing factors.
in this case,the magistrate judge never conducted a good cause analysis,but decided to put the settlement information into the existing share protective order,previously stipulated by the parties,on an interim basis subject to further review and determination by the district judge.upon review,the district judge determined that a protective order was not appropriate 
it appears,however,that the district court never engaged in a good cause analysis,but held that,based on rule c,only trade secrets or other confidential research,development,or commercial information could be protected from disclosure under rule c.in a letter to the parties,the court below stated it had reviewed the file for materials that might be trade secrets,proprietary matters,research,development or other commercial information that should be protected under rule c.appellant excerpts of record.the court reiterated this position in its january order denying the protective o
