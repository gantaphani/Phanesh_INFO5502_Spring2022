andrew carver sued the hearst corporation,which publishes the san francisco chronicle newspaper,chronicle reporters mark and ulysses torassa the corporation and the reporters are hereafter referred to collectively as the newspaper,san francisco giant barry bonds,and former san francisco roger craig for defamation and interference with prospective economic advantage based on statements in a chronicle article.plaintiff appeals from the order granting defendants motions to strike under the law strategic lawsuit against public participation code civ,hereafter appeal no,and from the order awarding attorney fees to the newspaper and bonds appeal no.we affirm the orders.
background 
the article in question was published on december,under the headings the sport of doctoring,and it proving to be big business to let the public know you treating athletes,and read as follows 
not all that long ago,medicine was a kind of profession.now,marketing is the name of the game,and there money to be made by convincing prospective patients you been enlisted by the best and the brawniest.even if it not entirely true.
danny williams left foot had been bothering him for a while,so he finally decided to have it examined by a specialist.as soon as he walked into the san francisco office of andrew carver five years ago,williams,a fervent fan,figured his pain would soon vanish.
he found himself gawking at walls covered with signed pictures of famous joe montana thanking the podiatrist for taking good care of them.there were and warriors and tennis stars such as andre agassi,millionaires whose livelihoods were tied directly to their feet.
when i came home,i said to my partner,oh my god,i ca believe who i got to see,the man who the podiatrist,williams said recently.i felt so lucky.i could believe i got to see this man,it was like i hit the jackpot.
but williams had not seen a man who at any time had been the team podiatrist.in fact,carver medical connections to the had been loose at best,limited primarily to a few weeks during the season when he fitted several players for foot supports at the team training facility.soon thereafter,the team asked him not to return.
long gone are the days when it was frowned upon for physicians even to advertise instead,in many ways,medicine has become as much about marketing as any other industry.the carver represents a cautionary tale in these days,a warning to patients of the extent some people will go to align themselves with the rich and famous.
he a man who gave some former patients and colleagues the impression he had ongoing and extensive relationships with the and many other virtually all the work he has done with sports figures has been to fit them for orthotics.
and if some patients did know carver ties to the athletes were limited,many also never learned he had amassed an inordinate string of medical malpractice suits,was the subject of more than a dozen now complaints to the state medical board and left at least two medical facilities because of problems related to maintaining malpractice insurance or incomplete reporting of his litigation history.
carver also currently is under investigation by the medical board,which,according to a state source familiar with the inquiry,is looking into a case and allegations he falsified malpractice insurance documents and lied about his record of lawsuits.
i do do anything that i do feel is best for my patients,carver said.have i had mistakes over the years absolutely.even bill clinton made mistakes.
the allure of pro athletes 
for years now,the sporting world has been a fertile ground from which to make sales pitches for just about anything.from mouthwash to cars,from underwear to viagra,the approach is simple connect yourself or your product to the athletes the buying public always dreamed of being,and you got an edge on the competition.
there no doubt,said former tight end jamie williams,if you work for the niners,if you deliver food for the niners,if you deliver mail for the niners,wash the windows at the niners facility,that a big deal.
now,doctors,hospitals and health care networks are finding ways to make those valuable sports associations,hoping they can lure weekend warriors to their offices and clinics with this basic message if barry bonds entrusts his precious and valuable body to me,you certainly can,too.
four years ago,catholic healthcare west chw figured the link was valuable enough to sign a,million deal that made it the official health care provider of the giants.
unfortunately,i think we getting to the situation to where health care is becoming just like selling beer,said giants head trainer stan conte,who acknowledged being wary of doctors essentially paying for the right to treat athletes but who also said the chw deal has worked exceptionally well for all parties.
many have argued,even some with chw,that the partnerships have reaped huge dividends for the providers making pacts with the teams.but on the individual level,there is little doubt of the potential payoff derived from treating or saying you treated a athlete.
i once knew a doctor from another state who used to buy autographs of sports figures to put upon his wall.he said to me,patients love it because they think i taking care of the stars,said glenn pfeffer,a local orthopedic surgeon who emphasized that the vast majority of doctors are upstanding and of high quality.the key is just to have people do their research.in this country,we find out more about what in a box of cereal than we do about the credentials of our doctors.
in carver case,patients and colleagues often found a charming,doctor with star power,a podiatrist who has boasted of his percent success rate and who was not afraid to tout the medical relationships he said he had with local teams and athletes.
you did know he was the podiatrist for the a surprised medical professional who worked often with carver until a few years ago asked a chronicle reporter.he treated the for a long while.
asked what gave him that impression,the person said,i either heard it or i heard him say it.
carver said he never told anyone he was the podiatrist.
i never put a picture on the wall of somebody i did treat,said carver,who said most of the signed photos on his walls specifically cited his providing insoles.when i say treat,i not saying i performed bone reconstructive surgery on those people.
wall of fame 
bonds.montana.jerry rice.ronnie lott.roger craig.chris mullin.tim hardaway.mitch richmond.latrell sprewell.and more.
this is really a small portion,carver said of a list of his sports clients he showed to the chronicle,later mentioning several other athletes,including agassi and fellow tennis players pete sampras and michael chang.
sampras and chang,through spokespersons,said they had no memory of carver.
montana and mullin,the former warriors star,declined comment.hardaway said carver fitted him for orthotics while he played for golden state.
former running back craig,who said he never had problems with his feet or ankles,had no memory of carver and said,i would remember him,trust me,if i had a relationship with him.
there are more than active podiatrists in the united states,and they receive more than million visits per year from people with foot problems,according to the american podiatric medical association.podiatrists provide nearly percent of all foot care annually,with treatments ranging from conservative care to complicated surgery.
in carver case,he was certified to perform surgery on the foot and ankle,and several former employees said surgical procedures were a significant part of his practice.so when danny williams and other patients went to see carver either in need of surgery or ultimately were advised by carver to have it,they quickly were reassured by the scene at his office.if montana or rice or mullin or agassi entrusted this man with their feet,they reasoned,then surely he was.
katherine thoresen went to see carver in the summer of after hearing him on a weekend radio show hosted by fitness personality joanie greggains.that public forum plus the walls covered with pictures of sports stars influenced my whole perception,said thoresen,of redwood city.
two surgeries and a later,thoresen filed a formal complaint with the state board of podiatric medicine bpm,an affiliate of the medical board.in it,she said carver was responsible for more grief,anxiety,pain,and discomfort than all previous experiences with my feet combined.
that complaint was investigated and referred to the attorney general office,according to jim rathlesberger,executive officer of the bpm.the ag office will decide whether to file a formal accusation with the medical board seeking disciplinary action.
others,like williams,who now lives in palm springs,took it a step further and sued carver for malpractice.carver has been sued for substandard care times over the past years,and several of those at the time or in recent conversations with the they were influenced by the doctor connections with athletes.
actually,that why i went there,said sandra skillman,of pine valley san diego county,who won a arbitration award against carver in.
i figured if he did ok with them and they trusted him,then i could do ok.
carver said very few patients asked exactly what he did for the athletes,but when they did he told them he had fitted most of them for supports.carver said there nothing on his walls currently because he sharing office space with some vascular surgeons,but he recently pulled out several photos from storage in which the signatures made references to orthotics.
if a patient came in and saw the pictures on the wall and got excited,carver said,some people like the idea that they sort of touched fame or greatness indirectly through their doctor if they assumed that i did a lot of foot implants,they should have asked.
williams said he did remember any signed pictures specifically mentioning insoles or orthotics.
doctors as stars 
forty years ago,there was little notion of sports medicine as its own discipline.today not only are the yellow pages teeming with specialists,but the walls of some doctors offices are covered with signed photos,jerseys and to the point of resembling a sports bar.
the industry that was born out of the fitness boom of the has grown into something so linked to the culture of sports that certain doctors have as much name recognition as athletes.
alabama orthopedist james andrews regularly shows up in the sports pages,frequently identified as renowned,noted or famed.some say los angeles orthopedist frank jobe revolutionized the industry in with a procedure he performed on pitcher tommy john elbow it now known simply as tommy john surgery.richard steadman started with a small practice in lake tahoe in the early and,through working with skiers and,ultimately,the ski team,became one of the most highly sought knee surgeons in the country.
i think it certainly helped to have patients,and it does,in fact,help build your practice,said steadman,who said he did believe most doctors working with athletes got into it for that reason.
andrew carver said he got into it by chance in the early,when a couple oakland raiders were referred to him.shortly thereafter,he said he had a stint as the team podiatrist for the oakland invaders of the united states football league.
carver contact with athletes became more frequent in the late,when he treated tennis player brad gilbert for an ankle injury.carver initially told the chronicle he performed surgery on gilbert and mentioned no one else working with him he amended that later to say he brought in three other doctors to assist him.but podiatrist larry oloff,now the giants and foot specialist,said carver asked him to join him and perform the procedure because,carver did do that kind of surgery at the time.
carver and gilbert became eventually led to carver working for a time as the volunteer podiatrist for an annual pro tennis tournament in the bay area.gilbert said he ended his connections with carver abruptly in when he grew tired of the doctor using their association to try to get business.
he was always wanting things,needing things,going up the food chain,dropping my name all over the place,gilbert said.
carver said the friendship ended for personal reasons.
carver also established a relationship with montana in the late.in the first of several interviews with the chronicle,carver said,i took care of bonds most recently,i done montana a lot.asked later the extent of his treatment of montana,carver said he fitted the hall of fame quarterback for orthotics and once took care of an nail.
he said montana and wide receiver jerry rice helped him in get into the santa clara training facility,where he said he spent one day a week for a few weeks fitting players for orthotics.
carver also began an association with the warriors in.he did hold the title of team podiatrist,though there are conflicting stories on how long the relationship lasted,the scope of his treatment and the nature of his departure.carver said he was with the team until,when he resigned because he got so frustrated with the medical team at the time.he said he was always the outsider but did treat several of the players,including once performing surgery on guard mario elie.
robert albo,the warriors team physician for the past years and a fixture on the east bay medical scene,said he thought carver was with the team for a much shorter time than the podiatrist indicated.albo said he recalled that carver,who was not paid a salary,was told his services were no longer needed and that the issues were mainly carver interest in exploiting his association with the warriors.
he would solicit other people by saying exactly what he said to you i worked for the warriors,albo said.
last year,while serving as an expert witness in a case against an arizona podiatrist,carver was asked about his history with the warriors.at the time,according to court transcripts,his curriculum vitae listed him still working with the team.he acknowledged that was incorrect but then added,i still do consulting to them i still get consulting calls from them i get consulting calls from these teams.
in fact,carver had received a call from the warriors since,at the latest.
asked about his testimony,carver said he was referring to calls he still receives from individual players,some retired,some active.he declined to name anyone specifically.
in the edition of the legal expert pages,a paid directory that serves as a referral service for attorneys seeking expert witnesses,carver lists himself as having been the team podiatrist.
carver said the legal expert pages made a mistake.the company said the advertisement reflected the information the podiatrist provided.
information hard to get 
there not a lot of information readily available to the public concerning a doctor litigation history interactions with the medical board.for instance,the board is obligated to disclose all medical malpractice judgments and arbitration awards reported in the past five years,but only those exceeding for the five years prior to that.and settlements of any sum are not public.
there no clearinghouse for listings of lawsuits,nothing to streamline the process.and complaints to the medical board become public,for the most part,only if referred for legal action.
so in the case of carver,a check of the medical board verification system by phone or through its web site would reveal he has one malpractice judgment against him,for in.
what you would learn is that he has had complaints filed against him dating back to,according to documents obtained by the chronicle,and that his career has been marked by a spate of lawsuits from to.
we have about licensed podiatrists in california,and i would say that most of them,or the majority of them,have never had a complaint filed against them,said rathlesberger,the executive officer of the state podiatric board.and then i would say the majority of them have probably never had a malpractice suit filed against them.
during interviews,carver attributed the number of cases brought against him to his performing a lot of experimental surgery and to a san francisco doctor who was out to get him.
i am a very doctor who sort of stands alone,said carver,who began practicing in the bay area in the late.there was a foot orthopedist that sort of came to town years after me that found out that i was very busy and i was very successful,and there were,in my opinion,things were sort of created,cases where there were what we call complication cases that ended up as malpractice suits and that percent of them were dropped or disappeared.
carver declined to name the doctor he said was behind many of the suits brought against him.
carver legal entanglements also have led to difficulties maintaining his malpractice coverage and his surgical that were detailed about a year ago when he was in the arizona case.
while carver was on the stand,transcripts show that defense attorney george mitchell presented evidence that several times between and carver provided false or misleading information while applying to hospitals to obtain or renew surgical privileges that his malpractice coverage was dropped by the podiatric insurance company of america pica at one point in and that he once used to alter a document from pica that said he was not covered for surgical procedures.
carver blamed his staff repeatedly during his testimony,saying that employees had filled out altered the documents.he said he fired two employees through the years who had provided false information.
the transcripts from that case,as well as other materials,ultimately landed in the hands of the medical board and are being examined as part of the ongoing investigation into carver,according to the state source familiar with the inquiry.
out of step with bonds 
a few months ago,carver got himself an audience with the sacramento kings.he had been introduced to one of the team owners,joe maloof,by a friend who was maloof tennis instructor.
the first time the chronicle contacted carver,in late september,he said he was being wooed by the kings.
it may or not happen because of the political group already in place,carver said.if you a sports doctor for any pro sports team,there a big,big marketing benefit.
not long after,the kings told carver they were interested.geoff petrie,the kings president of basketball operations,said the meeting was mainly held as a courtesy to maloof and the team was happy with its medical staff.still,petrie said the team did its due diligence to check comments made by carver during the interview,with trainer pete youngman making several calls.
the kings do allow youngman to speak to the media,but team doctor richard marder said,carver talked about different athletes that he had worked with,and the trainer called different teams and different individuals to substantiate those claims and found that in a large number of cases they just were true.
bonds,who apparently did have a business relationship involving electric cars with carver,was among the names the doctor mentioned.petrie said carver inferred he played a pivotal role in the giant season by providing him with orthotics.
asked how that was inferred,petrie said,i guess inferred is probably the wrong word.he pretty much said that.
said carver i can certainly tease about that.i can say that happens to be the year he hit home runs,but come on,obviously i know that i did hit any balls over the fence.but you know,he did have any foot injuries that year.
carver said he cast bonds for orthotics toward the end of the season and that harvey shields,bonds personal trainer,told him the superstar was wearing his supports during the following season.
barry said,no he did,said giants assistant trainer barney nugent,who spoke with bonds after the kings trainer called to check on carver assertions.he said he made him up a pair of orthotics the year before and did use them barry told me some things,but i rather not say what he said and you probably could print some of it.
asked by the chronicle about carver,bonds said only,i do like that man.i do like that man.he a liar.
under the heading consumer tips,the article concluded with a series of suggestions and resources to help you find and learn about your doctor.
the article appeared in the chronicle newspaper and on the chronicle web site.in december,plaintiff demanded a retraction from the chronicle of allegedly false and defamatory statements in the article,and then filed this lawsuit.the motions of the newspaper,bonds,and craig to strike under the statute were granted in july,and this appeal ensued.
ii.discussion 
issues and scope of review 
ruling on an motion is a process.first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity if the court finds such a showing has been made,it then determines whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d.motion rulings are reviewed on appeal de novo.wilbanks wolk th,d.
protected activity 
the law protects any act in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,subd.b.such acts include any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subds.e,e,e hereafter subds.e,e,and e,respectively.the statute is to be broadly construed,subd.a.
the trial court found that the statements at issue were covered by subdivisions e,e,and e.we conclude that the statements fall within subdivision e,and thus need not decide whether subdivision e or e is applicable.
stating facts and opinions about plaintiff was plainly conduct in furtherance of the exercise of defendants constitutional right s of free speech within the meaning of subdivision e.plaintiff argument to the contrary is that conduct under this subdivision refers only to actions such as picketing or demonstrations,and not to written or oral statements.he reasons that,if a contrary conclusion were drawn,subdivision e would be entirely subsumed in subdivision e and thereby rendered meaningless.however,neither this court nor others have given subdivision e the narrow interpretation plaintiff urges.we recently concluded that a statement as to why an employee was terminated was protected under subdivision e.fontani wells fargo investments th,d.other courts have likewise applied subdivision e to statements.vogel felice th,d venturing that challenges to pure speech would always involve conduct within the meaning of subdivision e see also,terry davis community church th,d wilbanks wolk,supra,th at,d.plaintiff might have a stronger argument if subdivisions e and e were enacted at the same time,but subdivision e was added later in order to broaden the statute.stats,ch,see terry davis community church,supra,th at,d wilbanks wolk,supra,th at,fn,d.accordingly,we are not persuaded that the conduct covered by subdivision e is as limited as plaintiff claims.
the article also involved a public issue or an issue of public interest under subdivision e.such an issue was found to be present in an analogous situation in wilbanks wolk,supra,th at,d,where the statements in question were directed against a broker of viatical settlements arrangements that allow dying persons with life insurance policies to sell their policies to investors for a percentage of the death benefits.the brokerage and its owner sued the defendant for defamation after the defendant reported on her web site that the broker was being investigated by the california department of insurance,warned readers to b e very careful when dealing with this broker,said that the broker had provided incompetent advice,and called the broker unethical.id.at,d.the statements did not relate to a public issue under commonly articulated criteria because plaintiffs are not in the public eye,their business practices do not affect a large number of people and their business practices are not,in and of themselves,a topic of widespread public interest.id.at,d.the statements were nevertheless of public concern because they were consumer protection information the statements made by the defendant were not simply a report of one broker business practices,of interest only to that broker and to those who had been affected by those practices.the defendant statements were a warning not to use plaintiffs services.in the context of information ostensibly provided to aid consumers choosing among brokers,the statements,therefore,were directly connected to an issue of public concern.id.at,d.the same reasoning applies equally here.the article warned readers not to rely on doctors ostensible experience treating professional athletes,and told what it described as a cautionary tale of plaintiff exaggerating that experience to market his practice.since the statements at issue served as a warning against plaintiff method of,and were provided along with other information to assist patients in choosing doctors,the statements involved a matter of public concern.ibid.
the challenged statements were therefore protected activity under the law.
probability of prevailing 
legal standards 
in order to establish a probability of success,the plaintiff must make a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence he submits is credited.wilson parker,covert chidester cal th,d.although the court does not weigh the probative strength of competing evidence ibid,the motion to strike should be granted if the defendant defeats the plaintiff showing as a matter of law,such as by establishing a defense or the absence of a necessary element.contacts,steinberg th,d.
to defeat the motions to strike in this case plaintiff had to make a prima facie showing that the challenged statements were both false and defamatory.see vogel felice,supra,th,d.a statement is not defamatory unless it can reasonably be viewed as declaring or implying a provably false factual assertion franklin dynamic details,th,d,and it is apparent from the context and tenor of the statement that the speaker seriously is maintaining an assertion of actual fact.weller american broadcasting,d.as we have said,the statements in question here were in the nature of consumer protection information,and as such involved a matter of public concern under the first amendment.city of oakland th,d.plaintiff therefore bears the burden of proving that the statements are false,even if he is not considered a public figure for purposes of this suit.id.at,d stolz ksfm fm th,d.california law permits the defense of substantial truth,and thus a defendant is not liable if the substance of the charge be proved true put another way,the statement is not considered false unless it would have a different effect on the mind of the reader from that which the truth would have produced.masson new yorker magazine,d.
claims involving bonds and craig 
plaintiff contends that bonds statements about him in the article i do like that man.i do like that man.he a liar.constituted actionable slander.in connection with those remarks,the article reported that bonds and plaintiff had a brief business relationship plaintiff said that he had cast bonds for orthotics and suggested to people that he had helped bonds achieve his home run record plaintiff said he was told by bonds personal trainer that bonds wore plaintiff orthotics during the season and bonds told a giants assistant trainer he had not worn plaintiff supports,along with some other things about plaintiff that were probably unprintable.
in his declaration in support of his motion to strike,bonds said that plaintiff approached him in about endorsing a line of electric bikes and scooters,but no deal was struck.bonds said that when he refused to pay plaintiff for scooters and bikes that plaintiff had lent him and that he had returned to plaintiff,the latter threatened to call the press and say that i came to a party of his high on marijuana,which was a lie.despite this threat,bonds said he never paid plaintiff for use of the bikes and scooters.on a different subject,bonds said that plaintiff offered in the spring of to make him a trial set of orthotics,and if he liked them,to supply him with additional orthotics for free.bonds said that,based on the test set,he ordered and received more orthotics from plaintiff around the end of the season,but never used them.bonds said he was surprised to receive a billing from plaintiff for the orthotics,and asked his accountants to tell plaintiff that he did not owe him any money.bonds said that he eventually decided,after prolonged haggling between his accountants and plaintiff,to pay the bill to get plaintiff off his back and save the cost of having his accountants deal with the matter.
bonds further declared that he made the statements at issue in the case when he was approached by defendant and another man on his way out to the field before a baseball game.he said that he meant only to convey a subjective opinion when he called plaintiff a liar,but that he believed in any event that plaintiff was in fact a liar.bonds thought that plaintiff had been less than truthful in his dealings with me,because he gave me the impression that he was giving me free orthotics and then billed me for them,and he threatened to lie to the press about me.
in response to bonds motion,plaintiff stated that he supplied bonds with pairs of orthotics,and produced a copy of the check he received for them.plaintiff declaration states with respect to bonds only that i n the past,i did provide medical treatment or consultation to defendant bonds.i took a complete podiatric history,provided a complete podiatric biomechanical exam,and complete standard treatment of casting for neutral orthotics.
calling someone a liar can convey a factual imputation of specific dishonest conduct capable of being proved false see generally milkovich lorain journal,d milkovich,and may be actionable depending on the tenor and context of the statement weller american broadcasting,supra,d at.in milkovich,for example,the plaintiff could maintain a defamation action for a newspaper opinion column branding him as a liar because the article implied that he had committed perjury in a particular case,and the alleged falsity of the charge could be determined on a core of objective evidence.id.at.however,rhetorical hyperbole,vigorous epithet s,lusty and imaginative expression s of contempt,and language used in a loose,figurative sense have all been accorded constitutional protection.ferlauto hamsher th,d.thus,calling someone a liar was not actionable in rosenaur scherer th,d,where the statement was made in a heated oral exchange during a chance encounter of opponents in a political campaign.in those circumstances,the charge was one that no reasonable person would have take n literally,and was the type of loose,figurative,or hyperbolic language that is constitutionally protected.ibid.similarly,in standing committee yagman cir,an attorney could not be disciplined for calling a judge dishonest because the word was only one in a string of colorful adjectives used in a letter that together convey ed nothing more substantive than the attorney contempt in context,the word could not reasonably be construed as suggesting that the judge had committed specific illegal acts,and was thus mere rhetorical hyperbole,incapable of being proved true or false.ibid.
both sides have room for argument under these precedents.an average reader of the article could have understood the lie or lies to which bonds alluded to be plaintiff claim that bonds had worn plaintiff orthotics during his season.see generally baker los angeles herald examiner cal d,whether statement is an actionable one of fact or a protected one of opinion is determined by its natural and probable effect upon the mind of the average reader.in that event,there was a potentially innocent explanation for what bonds took to be a lie the information plaintiff said he received from bonds personal trainer.however,the liar epithet might also have been taken to refer to something dishonorable that transpired in the business or professional dealings mentioned in the article,and where a statement is susceptible of both an innocent and libelous meaning,it is for a jury to decide how it was in fact understood.weller american broadcasting,supra,d at,fn.on the other hand,in the context of an outspoken athlete flippant remarks before a game about someone he dislikes,the word liar would seem to be merely an expression of contempt standing committee yagman,supra,at,and the sort of broad,unfocused and wholly subjective comment that is generally regarded as protected opinion copp paxton th,d.
but even if the statement were potentially defamatory under the circumstances,plaintiff must nevertheless make a prima facie showing that it was substantially false masson new yorker magazine,supra,at.wilson parker,covert chidester,supra,cal th at,d,vogel felice,supra,th at,d,and he has failed to carry that burden.bonds has declared,and plaintiff has not denied,that plaintiff threatened to lie to the press about him,and reneged on an offer to supply him with free orthotics.bonds was justified in calling plaintiff a liar in view of those undisputed facts.as underwager channel australia cir,noted,the term lying applies to a spectrum of untruths,including white lies,partial truths,misinterpretation,and deception.we likewise think the term liar is broad enough to encompass someone who commits or threatens the dishonest acts bonds described.since it appears from the evidence that there was substantial truth to bonds charge that plaintiff lied in his dealings with him,plaintiff has not established a probability of prevailing on his defamation claim against bonds.
at issue with respect to craig are the statements that he never had problems with his feet or ankles,that he did not remember plaintiff,and that he would have remembered plaintiff if he had had a relationship with him.craig declared in support of his motion to strike that he was accurately quoted in the article,that he did not know who plaintiff was,and that he would not have worn plaintiff orthotics because he does not like foot supports and his chiropractor told him not to wear them.in response,plaintiff declared that craig was referred to him in by craig friend and teammate jamie williams,and that he gave craig a physical exam and biomechanical exam and casted him for neutral orthotics.craig never made mention of any chiropractic recommendation,and he was very happy to get the orthotics when i personally delivered them to him at the training facility.plaintiff also produced a copy of a photo of craig signed,to andrew,thanks for taking care of my feet in his declaration,craig said he did not know whether he had signed a picture for plaintiff,but if i did it because when i was with the i autographed pictures all the time.
plaintiff can not prevail on the merits against craig because the statements in question did not convey provably false assertions of fact.vogel felice,supra,th at,d.insofar as it appears from plaintiff declaration,he may have seen craig only twice,both times more than a decade before craig was asked about him.thus,it was understandable that craig would not remember having a relationship with him.but whether craig remembered plaintiff,and would have remembered him if they had had a relationship,turned in any event on the strength of craig memory of distant and isolated events,and on what he considered a relationship entirely subjective matters rather than provably false factual assertions.
a republisher is deemed to have adopted statements that are defamatory.khawar globe,cal th,d.however,since plaintiff has no probability of prevailing against bonds or craig,the newspaper can not be held liable for republishing their statements.
claims solely against the newspaper 
a plaintiff allegations 
plaintiff maintains that the gist of the he exaggerated his ties with professional sports teams and athletes to market his false and defamatory.plaintiff also contests the article insofar as it stated or implied that he was the subject of complaints to the state medical board said he worked alone when he operated on brad gilbert did no work for athletes other than fitting them with foot supports had essentially no connection to players after misrepresented himself as the team podiatrist placed signed photos of famous athletes on his office walls to mislead patients and boasted of a percent success rate.
b whether the challenged statements were privileged 
the newspaper threshold argument is that the article was an accurate report of the board of podiatric medicine bpm investigation of plaintiff,and thus privileged under civil code section,subdivision d as a fair and true report in a public journal,of a public official proceeding the newspaper bears the burden of proving that the privilege applies.mann quality old time service,th,d.
the article stated that the bpm was an affiliate of the state medical board,that plaintiff was being investigated by the medical board,and that the medical board was looking into a case and allegations he falsified malpractice insurance documents and lied about his record of lawsuits.the article reported that patient thoresen had filed a complaint against plaintiff with the bpm,and that,according to bpm official jim rathlesberger,the complaint was referred to the attorney general office.the article indicated that in its ongoing investigation the medical board was examining transcripts from the arizona case in which plaintiff testified,and other materials as well.
according to the evidence presented on the newspaper motion,the attorney general filed an accusation against plaintiff with the bpm in december seeking to revoke or suspend his podiatric license on four grounds his conviction of spousal battery committed in december,subd.e his wife july report to police of violent conduct on his part,including threats to have her killed dishonesty as revealed in the arizona testimony and deceptive advertising,based on the photos of prominent athletes in his office and quotations from the chronicle article.in april,plaintiff admitted the criminal conviction alleged in the accusation and surrendered his license to the bpm,with the understanding that the other charges in the accusation could be considered if he ever applied to have the license reinstated.
rathlesberger declared in support of the newspaper motion to strike that when the article at issue was published the attorney general was in fact investigating plaintiff for various things,and my statements to the chronicle were simply reports to that newspaper of a contemplated official proceeding against carver.our office became aware during the course of our investigation of carver referred to above that carver allowed patients to assume that he had surgically treated prominent professional athletes.that issue eventually became the basis of the fourth cause for discipline in the accusation i have read the article at issue and i believe that it was a fair and true report of our investigation of carver and the formal accusation which resulted therefrom.plaintiff filed a lawsuit against rathlesberger in alleging various tort causes of action arising out of rathlesberger handling of a complaint to the bpm against plaintiff.rathlesberger demurrer to the complaint was sustained without leave to amend.plaintiff asserted in his declaration in opposition to the newspaper motion that rathlesberger had been conducting a personal vendetta against me since plaintiff had sued him.
the newspaper notes that governmental investigations of malfeasance are considered official proceedings for purposes of the civil code section,subdivision d privilege even if they yield no formal charges.braun chronicle publishing th,fn,d.however,all of the challenged statements other than the number of complaints to the medical board concern various forms of alleged false advertising on plaintiff part,and it is not apparent that the advertising aspect of plaintiff conduct was being investigated before the newspaper reported on it.rathlesberger declaration does not say that the bpm was concerned about plaintiff deceptive advertising when the article was published he simply avers that plaintiff was being investigated for various things at the time,and that the bpm became aware of the advertising issue during the course of our investigation,which continued after the article appeared.the newspaper claim that false advertising was being investigated when the article was published is belied by the article itself,which specifically describes what was being malpractice charge based on thoresen complaint,and falsification of insurance documents and lying about the record of lawsuits based on plaintiff arizona any indication that the investigation encompassed any of the false advertising on which the article reported.given the article description of the investigation,rathlesberger averment that the article was a fair and true report of the investigation does not assist the newspaper privilege argument.the newspaper observes that a false advertising count was included in the accusation eventually filed against plaintiff.however,that count referred to statements in the article,and insofar as it appears from the record the article may have prompted the investigation that led to that charge.accordingly,as to most of the challenged statements,the newspaper has not met its burden of showing that the privilege applies.
the only part of the article possibly shown to have been privileged was its report on the number of complaints that had been filed against plaintiff with the medical board.civil code section,subdivision b protects statements made in an official proceeding authorized by law,including communications intended to instigate official governmental investigation into wrongdoing.hagberg california federal bank cal th,d,see also fontani wells fargo investments,supra,th at,d.complaints to regulatory agencies such as the bpm are likewise considered to be part of an official proceeding under the statute,subd.e fontani wells fargo investments,supra,th at,d.it follows that a report of such complaints is a report of an official proceeding for purposes of civil code section,subdivision d.
civil code section,subdivision d,unlike civil code section,subdivision b and section,subdivision e,refers to public official proceedings,but the word public in this context simply means governmental,as opposed to private.crane v.the arizona republic cir.thus,the fact that the complaints were,as the article reported,confidential and not open to the public see bus,does not prevent a report of them from being privileged under civil code section,subdivision d.braun chronicle publishing,supra,th at,d.the chronicle and its web site are public journal s within the meaning of this statute.see colt freedom communications,th,d.the only question,then,is whether the article report of the complaints was fair and true.
the article said that complaints were filed against plaintiff with the medical board dating back to.defendant declared in support of the motion to strike that he obtained records showing that complaints had in fact been filed.in opposition to the newspaper motion,plaintiff filed letters from the medical board suggesting that he had been the subject of fewer complaints than the article reported in february,plaintiff was advised that six complaints had been made against him in january,the medical board reiterated that it had only six complaints on file,and stated that a nyone purporting to have additional information does not have correct information.however,the letter also indicated that a case file from had been removed and destroyed from our records several years ago pursuant to the medical board file retention policy.since the article cited complaints from,and it appears from the correspondence that the medical board may not have retained records dating back to that year when it advised as to the number of complaints on file,it is unclear from the evidence whether six or complaints were lodged during the period the article covered.
the article could,in any event,qualify as a fair and true report of the complaints against plaintiff even if it overstated their number.e rroneous statement is inevitable in free debate,and must be protected if the freedoms of expression are to have the breathing space that they need to survive.reader digest superior court cal d.thus,the fair and true requirement does not limit the privilege to statements that contain no errors.colt freedom communications,supra,th at,d.under california law,a newspaper report is fair and true if it captures the substance,the gist,the sting of the libelous charge citations.the news article need not track verbatim the underlying proceeding.only if the deviation is of such a substantial character that it produce s a different effect on the reader will the privilege be suspended.citation.news articles,in other words,need only convey the substance of the proceedings on which they report,as measured by their impact on the average reader.crane v.the arizona republic,supra,at.
the medical board complaints allegedly filed against plaintiff were initially linked in the article with the inordinate string of malpractice complaints against him,a total of lawsuits in years according to the article.plaintiff does not deny being sued that many times,and,indeed,the evidence on the newspaper motion showed that the article actually understated the number of his malpractice cases.the article later referred again jointly to the alleged medical board complaints and the spate of malpractice lawsuits against plaintiff,and then quoted rathlesberger as saying that most of the state podiatrists had never been the subject of any such complaint or suit.the sting of the references to complaints,whether administrative or judicial,was thus that plaintiff had received an unusually large number of them.that essential point would have been the same whether the number of medical board complaints had been six or the lower figure would not,in context,have had a different effect on the reader than the higher one.the article references to the medical board complaints were therefore privileged even if their number was exaggerated as plaintiff claims,subd.d crane v.the arizona republic,supra,at colt freedom communications,supra,th at,d.
c whether plaintiff was a public figure 
the newspaper next argument is that plaintiff was a limited purpose public figure with respect to the subjects covered in the article,and must therefore establish by clear and convincing evidence that the challenged statements were made with actual malice,with knowledge of their falsity or reckless disregard for their truth.see generally reader digest superior court,supra,cal d at,ampex cargle th,d.the newspaper submits that the requisite showing of malice can not be made in view of the declarations it has submitted from sources of information for the article attesting to its accuracy.
limited purpose public figures are those who invite attention and comment by thrust ing themselves to the forefront of particular public controversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved.gertz robert welch,d.for a person to be characterized as a limited purpose public figure,there must f irst be a public controversy,which means the issue was debated publicly and had foreseeable and substantial ramifications for nonparticipants.second,the plaintiff must have undertaken some voluntary act through which he or she sought to influence resolution of the public issue.in this regard it is sufficient that the plaintiff attempts to thrust him or herself into the public eye.and finally,the alleged defamation must be germane to the plaintiff participation in the controversy.ampex cargle,supra,th at,d.
plaintiff argues that he never injected himself into an existing public controversy,and that there was no public controversy regarding his means of until the chronicle created one by publishing the article.the newspaper observes that plaintiff dubbed himself a very doctor who sort of stands alone,and submits that a man can not engage in ceaseless as the guy in his field without inviting some attention as to his experience and credentials and whether prospective clients or customers really should go to him.
as previously noted,all of the nonprivileged statements at issue concerned false that plaintiff exaggerated his accomplishments,especially the extent to which he had treated professional athletes,to attract patients.whether an advertiser is a public figure for purposes of a false advertising claim was addressed in vegod american broadcasting companies,cal d,vegod.the plaintiffs there had been hired to conduct the sale of the city of paris,a respected department store.the defendants reported in a tv news broadcast that the plaintiffs had been brought in to handle the closeout,a closeout the better business bureau says has deceived the public that trusts the name city of paris and promises bargains that are not really bargains at all.id.at.the court rejected the defendants argument that the plaintiffs became public figures by selling goods to the public and by advertising the sale while availability of goods for sale and their quality are matters of public interest,this is not the test.the public interest test was expressly rejected in gertz robert welch,supra,at.and in time,firestone at,in favor of the public controversy test.see also hutchinson proxmire,d.criticism of commercial conduct does not deserve the special protection of the actual malice test.balancing one individual limited first amendment interest against another reputation interest herbert lando,d,we conclude that a person in the business world advertising his wares does not necessarily become part of an existing public controversy.it follows those assuming the role of business practice critic do not acquire the first amendment privilege to denigrate such entrepreneur.vegod american broadcasting companies,supra,cal d at.
the vegod case is squarely on point,and it precludes plaintiff from being found to be a public figure for purposes of statements accusing him of false advertising.if the holding of vegod were simply that advertising does not necessarily make one a limited purpose public figure,then the case would not necessarily be controlling here.but vegod rejected precisely the same public figure argument being advanced in this case by business practice critic s who are denigrat ing plaintiff for the content of his advertising.vegod american broadcasting companies,supra,cal d at.nothing in vegod suggests that the result would be different where the plaintiff is selling professional services rather than commercial goods in either case,the false advertising would be a matter of public interest,but not one of public controversy.moreover,vegod observation that the plaintiff must become part of an existing public controversy to be considered a limited purpose public figure,italics added confirms that the newspaper could not create a public controversy simply by publishing an article that put plaintiff behavior in the spotlight hutchinson proxmire,supra,at.alleged defamer can not create its own defense by making the claimant a public figure.
the cases on which the newspaper relies are distinguishable because none of them involved false advertising,and all of them involved an existing public controversy.ampex cargle,supra,th at,d responsibility for failure of company multimillion dollar business venture copp paxton,supra,th at,d best means of avoiding earthquake injuries in public schools nadel regents of the university of california th,d best use of public park rudnick mcmillan th,d responsibility for mismanagement of public land denney lawrence th,d culpability for homicide.accordingly,plaintiff was not a public figure for purposes of the challenged statements.
d whether plaintiff has established a prima facie case 
the newspaper further argues that plaintiff has not demonstrated a probability of prevailing because the challenged statements were protected matters of opinion rather than actionable assertions of fact,or because plaintiff has not shown that the statements were false.
gilbert surgery 
the newspaper can not,of course,be held liable for a statement it did not make or repeat.one of the allegedly false statements was that plaintiff operated alone on brad gilbert,but the article did not say that.the article said that when plaintiff discussed the surgery with the chronicle,he initially did not mention any assistance,but later admitted having been assisted by other doctors.this disposes of the claim relative to gilbert surgery.
work confined to orthotics 
plaintiff alleges that the article falsely stated that the only work he performed for athletes was to fit them with foot supports,but again,that is not what the article said.the article said that,although surgical procedures were reportedly a significant part of plaintiff practice,virtually all of the work he did for athletes was fitting them for orthotics.italics added.the article noted that plaintiff had performed surgery on mario elle as well as gilbert,and that plaintiff had treated joe montana for an ingrown toenail as well as fitted him for orthotics.the article said that plaintiff admitted telling patients,when asked what he did for athletes,that he fitted most of them for supports.the article thus indicated that nearly all,not entirely all,of his work with athletes involved orthotics.
in his declaration in opposition to the newspaper motion,plaintiff did not represent that surgery was a significant part of his work with athletes,only that he had done several surgeries on various professional athlete s.he said that during his time as team podiatrist for the golden state warriors he treated quite a few players for custom biomechanical orthotic devices and for multiple other foot problems,including injections for various tendinitis and neuromas to mechanical debridement of painful keratotic tissue to mechanical debridement of infected tissues,infected nails,he said that he performed a full podiatric medical exam when he cast a player for orthotics,and he produced records of payments for orthotics from bonds,craig,montana,jerry rice,ronnie lott,chris mullin,mitch richmond,latrell sprewell,and other athletes.
plaintiff evidence does not show that the article was materially false in reporting that virtually all of his work with athletes involved orthotics.he does not deny telling patients,as reported in the article,that he fitted most of the athletes he treated for foot supports.he states in his declaration that he also operated on athletes and treated them for things like toenail problems,but that work was mentioned in the article.the only records he produced for treatment of athletes were of payments for orthotics.
it thus appears that the article was substantially true in indicating that virtually all of his work with athletes was confined to orthotics.
ongoing relationships with players 
plaintiff evidence also failed to controvert the article allegedly false suggestion that he had essentially no connection to players after.the article stated that plaintiff connections to the were limited primarily to a few weeks in,but that he gave some former patients and colleagues the impression he had ongoing and extensive relationships with the.the article quoted plaintiff as saying that he had done montana a lot,and later explaining that he had fitted montana for orthotics and once taken care of an ingrown toenail.the article did not report plaintiff saying anything else about treating,apart from fitting them with orthotics at their training facility one day a week for a few weeks in.
plaintiff declaration is silent on the extent of his involvement with players after.he presented no evidence on the subject other than a ledger of payments for orthotics listing four payments received from in july and september of.it thus appears from the evidence that the article was correct insofar as it stated or implied that plaintiff had no ongoing and extensive relationships with after.plaintiff did not make a contrary showing and thereby failed to carry his burden on the motion to strike.
team podiatrist 
plaintiff contends that the article falsely implied that he held himself out as having been the team podiatrist.the article reported in this regard that a medical professional who worked with plaintiff either heard it that plaintiff had been the team podiatrist or heard him say it plaintiff was listed
