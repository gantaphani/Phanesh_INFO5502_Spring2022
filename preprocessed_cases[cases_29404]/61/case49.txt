this case concerns the scope of copyright protection afforded to a sound recording of a conference call convened by the swatch group swatch group,a foreign public company,to discuss the company recently released earnings report with invited investment analysts.in particular,we must determine whether defendant appellee bloomberg bloomberg,a financial news and data reporting service that obtained a copy of that sound recording without authorization and disseminated it to paying subscribers,may avoid liability for copyright infringement based on the affirmative defense of fair use.we also must determine whether we have jurisdiction to hear bloomberg on the issue of whether the sound recording of the conference call is copyrightable in the first instance.
plaintiff appellant the swatch group management services swatch,a subsidiary of swatch group,appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york hellerstein,which sua sponte granted summary judgment to bloomberg on swatch claim of copyright infringement on the ground of fair use.on appeal,swatch argues that the district court ruling was premature because swatch had not yet had the opportunity to take discovery on three issues whether bloomberg obtained and disseminated the sound recording for the purpose of news reporting or for some other business purpose bloomberg state of mind when it obtained and disseminated the recording and whether bloomberg subscribers actually listen to sound recordings of earnings calls,or instead glean information about such calls by reading written transcripts or articles.swatch also contends that the district court erroneously concluded that swatch had published the sound recording before bloomberg disseminated it.more broadly,swatch argues that the district court erred in how it evaluated and balanced the various considerations relevant to fair use.for the reasons set forth below,we agree with the district court and hold that,upon consideration of the relevant factors and resolving all factual disputes in favor of swatch,bloomberg has engaged in fair use.
in addition,bloomberg from the same judgment of the district court,urging us to hold that swatch sound recording is not protected by the copyright laws in the first place.swatch has moved to dismiss the on the grounds that bloomberg lacks appellate standing and we lack appellate jurisdiction.that motion is granted.because the judgment designated in bloomberg notice of appeal was entered in bloomberg favor,bloomberg is not aggrieved by the judicial action from which it appeals,great am.audio metacom,cir,and therefore lacks standing.similarly,although the district court later dismissed as moot bloomberg counterclaim for a declaration that swatch copyright is invalid,bloomberg never filed an additional notice of appeal identifying that subsequent order as the subject of an appeal,and thus we have no jurisdiction to review it.
accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court,and we dismiss the.
background 
factual background 
the following facts are drawn from the record before the district court and are undisputed unless otherwise noted.
on february,swatch group released its earnings report,a compilation of financial figures and textual narrative about the company financial performance during the prior year.because swatch group is incorporated in switzerland and its shares are publicly traded on the swiss stock exchange,swatch group is governed by swiss securities law and the listing rules of the swiss exchange.in accordance with those rules,swatch group filed its earnings report with the exchange before trading opened for the day,and simultaneously posted the report in four languages english,german,french,and italian on the investor relations section of its website.
after it released this information to the public,swatch group held a conference call with an invited group of financial analysts,as is its custom.swiss law permits public companies to hold this kind of earnings call with a limited group of analysts,provided that the company does not disclose,significantly facts during the call.before the call,swatch group sent invitations to all financial analysts who had registered in advance with swatch group investor relations department.in accordance with its practice,swatch group did not invite members of the press.swatch group held the call at local swiss time,several hours after it had released the earnings report,in order to allow european,american,and asian analysts to participate.in the end,approximately analysts joined the call.for swatch group part,its chief executive officer,chief financial officer,and three other senior executives participated in the call from the company offices in switzerland.
at swatch group request,an audio conferencing vendor recorded the entire earnings call as it was in progress.at the beginning of the call,an operator affiliated with the vendor welcomed the analysts to the call and told them,this call must not be recorded for publication or broadcast.swatch group executives then provided commentary about the company financial performance and answered questions posed by fifteen of the analysts.the entire call lasted minutes swatch group executives spoke for approximately of those minutes.
neither bloomberg nor any other press organization was invited to the earnings call.nevertheless,within several minutes after the call ended,bloomberg obtained a sound recording and written transcript of the call and made them both available online,without alteration or editorial commentary,to subscribers to its online financial research service known as bloomberg professional.according to bloomberg promotional materials,bloomberg professional provides a massive data stream with rich content that is unparalleled in scope and depth and is delivered to your desktop in real time,as well as access to all the news,analytics,communications,charts,liquidity,functionalities and execution services that you need to put knowledge into action.id.
on february,after swatch group learned that the recording and transcript had been made available on bloomberg terminals,swatch group sent bloomberg a letter demanding that they be removed.bloomberg refused.on february,swatch then filed its initial complaint against bloomberg in this action claiming infringement of its copyright in the sound recording of the earnings call.in an agreement signed by representatives of swatch group and swatch on february and,swatch group assigned its interest in the copyright to its subsidiary swatch.
two weeks later,on march,swatch filed an application with the copyright office to register a copyright in a sound recording of the earnings call.the copyright office and swatch then exchanged a series of emails over the scope of the claimed copyright.after swatch narrowed the copyright to cover only the statements made by swatch group executives,and not the statements made by the operator or the questions posed by the analysts,the copyright office issued a registration on april.
ii.procedural history 
as stated,swatch filed its initial complaint in this action on february.swatch then twice amended its complaint the operative pleading thus is the second amended complaint,filed on may.the second amended complaint alleges that,by recording the earnings call and making the recording available to the public,bloomberg infringed swatch exclusive rights to reproduce the copyrighted work and to distribute copies or phonorecords of the work to the public.swatch does not challenge bloomberg preparation or distribution of the written transcript of the earnings call 
on may,bloomberg moved under rule b to dismiss the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim,arguing inter alia that the earnings call was not copyrightable in the first place and that bloomberg copying and dissemination of the call was fair use.the district court denied that motion in an order entered on august.swatch grp.mgmt.servs.bloomberg swatch i,d.the district court found that the recording was copyrightable,id.at,and declined to address the questions implicated by bloomberg fair use defense on a motion to dismiss,id.at.
at an conference held two weeks later on september,however,the district court informed the parties of its belief that it could resolve the case through a motion for judgment on the pleadings,and directed swatch to file such a motion.swatch moved as directed on october,and bloomberg opposed.the district court held oral argument on december,at which it denied swatch motion and explained that,in the court view,defendant use qualifies as fair use.later that day,the district court issued a summary order stating that it had preliminarily granted judgment to defendant on the basis that if defendant alleged actions constitute infringement,they are protected as fair use.id.the order directed swatch to submit a brief regarding the existence of any triable issues of material fact with respect to defendant fair use affirmative defense.id.swatch did so,pointing out that it had taken no discovery in the action.
in an opinion and order entered on may,the district court sua sponte granted summary judgment to bloomberg,finding that bloomberg copying and dissemination of the recording qualify as fair use.swatch grp.mgmt.servs.bloomberg swatch ii,d.on may,the clerk of the district court entered judgment in favor of defendant.
on june,swatch filed a timely notice of appeal from that judgment.on june,bloomberg filed a notice of from the same judgment,and on july,swatch moved to dismiss the.on august,after the parties had filed a stipulation of dismissal without prejudice to reinstatement under local rule,the district court issued an order dismissing as moot all of bloomberg counterclaims,including a counterclaim seeking a declaration that swatch copyright is invalid.on november,upon receipt of a letter from swatch,the clerk reinstated the appeal.finally,on january,the motions panel of this court referred swatch motion to dismiss the to the merits panel.
discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,resolving all ambiguities and drawing all reasonable inferences against the moving party.see garanti finansal kiralama aqua marine trading,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only where the record shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.under federal rule of civil procedure f,district courts have discretion to grant summary judgment sua sponte a fter giving notice and a reasonable time to respond and after identifying for the parties material facts that may not be genuinely in dispute.f,f see also celotex catrett,d istrict courts are widely acknowledged to possess the power to enter summary judgments sua sponte,so long as the losing party was on notice that it had to come forward with all of its evidence.before granting summary judgment sua sponte,however,a district court must assure itself that following the procedures set out in rule a e would not alter the outcome.ramsey coughlin,cir.in other words,d iscovery must either have been completed,or it must be clear that further discovery would be of no benefit,such that the record reflect s the losing party inability to enhance the evidence supporting its position and the winning party entitlement to judgment.id

to evaluate whether a particular use qualifies as fair use,we must engage in an and inquiry.blanch koons,cir.the copyright act directs that,in determining whether a particular use is fair,the factors to be considered shall include

the nature of the copyrighted work 
the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole and

purpose and character of use 
we turn first to the purpose and character of the use.below,the district court found that this factor favored fair use because bloomberg work as a prominent gatherer and publisher of business and financial information serves an important public interest,for the public is served by the full,timely and accurate dissemination of business and financial news.swatch ii,d at.
swatch argues that this conclusion was error for several reasons.first,swatch contends that the district court improperly accepted bloomberg unsubstantiated claim that it had engaged in news reporting.swatch notes that bloomberg itself has characterized its bloomberg professional service as delivering both financial news and data,and argues that the district court erred in denying swatch the chance to develop facts in discovery to show that the sound recording at issue here is the latter and not the former.similarly,swatch argues that the district court improperly denied swatch the chance to develop facts relevant to bloomberg state of mind.swatch acknowledges that the district court credited swatch allegations that bloomberg was not authorized to access the earnings call and that bloomberg publication of the infringing work violated swatch group directive,swatch ii,d at,but argues that swatch should have been able to take discovery into whether bloomberg knew at the time that obtaining and publishing the recording violated swatch group directive.swatch also argues that it should have been permitted to take discovery into whether bloomberg professional subscribers actually choose to access information about earnings calls by listening to recordings,or instead choose to read written transcripts or articles.more broadly,swatch argues that the district court gave insufficient weight to the fact that bloomberg use was commercial and did not transform the underlying recording.
we find these arguments unpersuasive and hold that the first statutory factor favors fair use here.to begin with,whether one describes bloomberg activities as news reporting,data delivery,or any other turn of phrase,there can be no doubt that bloomberg purpose in obtaining and disseminating the recording at issue was to make important financial information about swatch group available to investors and analysts.that kind of information is of critical importance to securities markets.indeed,as bloomberg points out,the securities and exchange commission sec has mandated that when american companies disclose this kind of material nonpublic information,they must make it available to the public immediately.see regulation fd.at a minimum,such public dissemination of financial information serves this public purpose in the nature of news reporting.see harper row,at news reporting is one of the examples enumerated in to give some idea of the sort of activities the courts might regard as fair use under the circumstances.quoting,at.
seizing on bloomberg citation to regulation fd,swatch protests that in crafting that regulation,the sec expressly exempted foreign private issuer s like swatch group that are incorporated or organized under the laws of a foreign country.b.in fact,as initially proposed,regulation fd would have applied to such issuers,see selective disclosure and insider trading,but the sec ultimately determined to exempt foreign private issuers as it has in the past exempted them from certain reporting requirements such as forms q and k,selective disclosure and insider trading.swatch thus argues that giving weight to a public interest in the dissemination of important financial information in this case would in effect erase foreign issuers exemption from regulation fd and set up organizations like bloomberg as private enforcers of public disclosure rules.
this argument,however,misattributes to regulation fd a role in the law of copyright.that regulation is relevant here only insofar as it provides additional support for a proposition that would be clear in any event investors and analysts have an interest in obtaining important financial information about companies whose securities are traded in american and other markets.the fact that the sec has chosen not to require foreign issuers to follow certain disclosure rules imposed on domestic issuers in no way implies that information about foreign issuers is irrelevant.accordingly,contrary to swatch suggestion,nothing in our decision today subjects swatch group or any other foreign issuer to the requirements of regulation fd.nor do we hold that a foreign issuer failure to follow regulation fd prevents it from enforcing its copyrights in the united states.we merely hold that where a financial research service obtains and disseminates important financial information about a foreign company in order to make that information available to investors and analysts,that purpose lends support to a finding of fair use.
swatch also stresses the commercial nature of bloomberg use.section expressly directs courts to consider whether the use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes,and we have said that t he greater the private economic rewards reaped by the secondary user to the exclusion of broader public benefits,the more likely the first factor will favor the copyright holder and the less likely the use will be considered fair.am.geophysical union texaco inc,cir.it is undisputed here that bloomberg is a commercial enterprise and that bloomberg professional is a subscription service available to paying users.at the same time,we have recognized that a lmost all newspapers,books and magazines are published by commercial enterprises that seek a profit,consumers union of,signal,cir,and have discounted this consideration where the link between the defendant commercial gain and its copying is attenuated such that it would be misleading to characterize the use as commercial exploitation.am.geophysical union,at see also campbell,at holding that i t was error for the court of appeals to conclude that the commercial nature of a secondary work rendered it presumptively unfair.
here,swatch does not contest that bloomberg professional is a multifaceted research service,of which disseminating sound recordings of earnings calls is but one small part.moreover,it would strain credulity to suggest that providing access to swatch group earnings call more than trivially affected the value of that service.so while we will not ignore the commercial nature of bloomberg use,we assign it relatively little weight.
swatch also contends that bloomberg acted in bad faith and that this should count against it.regardless of what role good or bad faith plays in fair use analysis,see blanch,at,we need not tarry over it here.even assuming that bloomberg was fully aware that its use was contrary to swatch group instructions,bloomberg overriding purpose here was not to scoop swatch or supplant the copyright holder commercially valuable right of first publication,harper row,at,but rather simply to deliver newsworthy financial information to investors and analysts.that kind of activity,whose protection lies at the core of the first amendment,would be crippled if the news media and similar organizations were limited to sources of information that authorize disclosure.see generally new york times united states.
the supreme court has also instructed courts analyzing the first fair use factor to consider the transformativeness of the use that is,whether the new work merely supersedes the objects of the original creation,or instead adds something new,with a further purpose or different character,altering the first with new expression,meaning,or message.campbell,at internal citations,quotation marks,and alterations omitted.while a transformative use generally is more likely to qualify as fair use,transformative use is not absolutely necessary for a finding of fair use.see also sony of am.universal city studios,finding a use to be a fair use.
in the context of news reporting and analogous activities,moreover,the need to convey information to the public accurately may in some instances make it desirable and consonant with copyright law for a defendant to faithfully reproduce an original work without alteration.courts often find such uses transformative by emphasizing the altered purpose or context of the work,as evidenced by surrounding commentary or criticism.see,bill graham archives dorling kindersley,cir nunez caribbean int l news,cir.here,bloomberg provided no additional commentary or analysis of swatch group earnings call.but by disseminating not just a written transcript or article but an actual sound recording,bloomberg was able to convey with precision not only the raw data of the swatch group executives words,but also more subtle indications of meaning inferable from their hesitation,emphasis,tone of voice,and other such aspects of their delivery.this latter type of information may be just as valuable to investors and analysts as the former,since a speaker demeanor,tone,and cadence can often elucidate his or her true beliefs far beyond what a stale transcript or summary can show.as courts have long recognized in the context of witness testimony,a cold transcript contains only the dead body of the evidence,without its spirit,and can not reveal the speaker hesitation,his doubts,his variations of language,his confidence or precipitancy,his calmness or consideration.zhou yun zhang ins,cir quoting regina bertrand,overruled on other grounds by shi liang lin dep t of justice,cir.
furthermore,a secondary work can be transformative in function or purpose without altering or actually adding to the original work.ex rel.vanderhye iparadigms,llc,cir holding that making an exact digital copy of a student thesis for the purpose of determining whether it included plagiarism is a fair use see also perfect,cir holding that a search engine publication of,thumbnail copies of copyrighted images was highly transformative because the thumbnails were incorporate ed into a new work,namely,an electronic reference tool.here,notwithstanding that the data disseminated by bloomberg was identical to what swatch group had disseminated,the two works had different messages and purposes.to begin with,while swatch group purported to convey true answers to the analysts questions and to justify the propriety and reliability of its published earnings statement,bloomberg made no representation one way or another as to whether the answers given by swatch group executives were true or reliable.nor did bloomberg purport to support the propriety or reliability of swatch group earnings statement.bloomberg was simply revealing the newsworthy information of what swatch group executives had said.bloomberg message this is what they said is a very different message from swatch group this is what you should believe.
moreover,swatch group intended to exclude members of the press and to restrict the information supplied by its executives to a relatively small group of analysts who had identified themselves to the company in advance.bloomberg objective in rebroadcasting the call,by contrast,was to make this information public,defeating swatch group effort to restrict access.bloomberg purpose,in other words,was to publish this factual information to an audience from which swatch group purpose was to withhold it.these differences give bloomberg use at least an arguably transformative character.
in any event,regardless of how transformative the use is,we conclude that the first fair use factor,focusing on the purpose and character of the secondary use,favors fair use.we of course recognize that a news reporting purpose by no means guarantees a finding of fair use.see harper row,at.after all,t he promise of copyright would be an empty one if it could be avoided merely by dubbing the infringement a fair use news report.id.a news organization thus may not freely copy creative expression solely because the expression itself is newsworthy.nevertheless,we agree with the district court conclusion that,under the unusual circumstances of this case,the purpose and character of bloomberg unaltered dissemination of swatch group expression weighs in favor of fair use,for two reasons.
first,as noted above,by disseminating a full,unadulterated recording of the earnings call,bloomberg was able to convey valuable factual information that would have been impaired if bloomberg had undertaken to alter the speech of the swatch group executives by interjecting its own interpretations.as we explained in a fair use case involving verbatim copying of a written work,w here an evaluation or description is being made,copying the exact words may be the only valid way precisely to report the evaluation.consumers union,at see also harper row,at noting that direct copying may in some instances be necessary adequately to convey the facts.so too here,copying the exact spoken performance of swatch group executives was reasonably necessary to convey their full meaning.bloomberg faithful reproduction thus served the interest of accuracy,not piracy.consumers union,at.
second,bloomberg use did no harm to the legitimate copyright interests of the original author.importantly,swatch has admitted that it did not seek to profit from the publication of the february,earnings call in audio or written format.the aspects of the earnings call that is,the manner by which the facts were expressed thus were of no value to swatch or swatch group except insofar as they served to convey important information to the analysts in attendance.but bloomberg copying of the swatch group executives words,as needed to communicate factual information about the company earnings report,in no way diminished swatch group ability to communicate with analysts,and thus caused no harm to swatch copyright interests.in this way,the case at bar stands in stark contrast to a case like harper row,where a magazine disseminated an unpublished excerpt of president ford memoirs.see harper row,at.this kind of,which scooped the publication of the copyrighted work and,in doing so,did considerable harm to the value of the original author copyright,is not present here.
our prior decisions in nihon keizai shimbun,comline business data,cir,wainwright securities,wall street transcript,cir,and financial information,moody investors service,fii,cir,on which swatch relies,are not to the contrary.in those cases,we rejected fair use arguments pressed by defendants who purported to be serving the public by providing access to important financial information.in nihon and wainwright,we stressed that the defendants had not supplemented or otherwise transformed the plaintiffs works.instead,they had simply translated japanese business articles into english,nihon,at,or recounted the critical conclusions from research reports about major industrial and financial corporations,wainwright,at.in fii,we rejected a fair use defense by a ratings agency that had copied information about municipal bond redemptions compiled by a competing financial publisher.fii,at.criticizing the district court conclusion that the defendant use served a public function,we stated that to so hold would,it seems to us,state a rule that whenever there is a market for information,the paid delivery of goods to that market rises to a public function.id.at.we rejected such a rule,finding that it would distort proper fair use analysis.id.
in all three of those cases,however,the defendants attempted to use the banner of newsworthiness to supersede the core objects of original works whose production critically depended upon copyright protection.finding fair use in those cases would have severely impeded the ability of news and research organizations to obtain payment for their expression,imperiling the economic foundation of vital industries.but unlike the arguments we rejected in nihon,wainwright,and fii,our decision today does not rest upon the newsworthiness of the original expression alone.to the contrary,we also place great weight on the absence of harm to the original author legitimate copyright interests.swatch reliance on our prior cases is thus misplaced.
the discovery swatch seeks would not alter our analysis.with respect to the request for discovery into whether bloomberg delivered news or data to its subscribers,such a distinction raises a semantic rather than factual dispute.it is undisputed that bloomberg gave subscribers access to the full,unaltered sound recording of swatch group earnings call as part of its paid financial research service.that is sufficient for present purposes.there is likewise no need for further discovery into bloomberg good or bad faith,since resolving that issue in swatch favor would not affect the outcome of our analysis.we also see no need to resolve how many of bloomberg subscribers chose to listen to the sound recording in question rather than read a written transcript or article.as we have explained,because the sound recording conveys information that a transcript or article can not,the recording has independent value,regardless of how many bloomberg subscribers chose to avail themselves of that independent value in this instance.
this first factor accordingly favors fair use.
nature of the copyrighted work 
the second statutory fair use factor concerns the nature of the copyrighted work.this factor accounts for the fact that some works are closer to the core of intended copyright protection than others,with the consequence that fair use is more difficult to establish when the former works are copied.campbell,at.as relevant here,this factor requires us to consider the extent of swatch copyright in the recording the thickness or thinness of swatch exclusive rights as well as whether or not the recording had been published at the time of bloomberg use.see id.citing cases.the district court determined that this factor favored fair use because swatch copyright was at best thin and because the first publication of swatch group expression occurred prior to bloomberg publication of the infringing work.swatch ii,d at.
swatch argues that the district court erred in concluding that the recording had been published.swatch points out that the copyright act contemplates two methods of publishing an audio recording the distribution of phonorecords of a work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership,or by rental,lease,or lending,or offering to distribute phonorecords to a group of persons for purposes of further distribution,public performance,or public display.defining publication.phonorecords,in turn,are defined as material objects in which sounds are fixed and from which the sounds can be perceived,reproduced,or otherwise communicated.id.applying these definitions,swatch contends that the sound recording of the earnings call has never been published.simply put,swatch has never,before or after bloomberg use,distribut ed a cd or other material object embodying the spoken commentary on the earnings call to the public,nor has it ever offer ed to distribute a phonorecord of the call to any group of persons for purposes of further distribution,public performance,or public display.
swatch is unquestionably correct that the earnings call is unpublished under the definition of publication set forth in.but that technical definition does not control our analysis of this aspect of the second fair use factor.while we will consider the statutory definition,we also will not blind ourselves to the fact that swatch group invited over three hundred investment analysts from around the globe to the earnings call,out of which over a hundred actually attended.thus,even though the sound recording remains statutorily unpublished,it is clear that swatch was not deprived of the ability to control the first public appearance of its expression,including when,where,and in what form it appeared.harper row,at.
swatch insists that because the definitions in by their terms apply for all purposes under the copyright act e xcept as otherwise provided in this title,the statutory definition of publication must control.not so.while in general,s tatutory definitions control the meaning of statutory words,burgess united states,quoting lawson suwanee fruit,in this case,no variant of the word publish appears in the text of the second fair use factor in.whether or not a work was published thus enters into our analysis of this factor as a judicial gloss on the nature of the copyrighted work.that gloss,of course,is firmly grounded in fair use common law origins and the legislative history of the copyright act.see harper row,at.
to the extent the text of mentions publication,it is only in a closing proviso cautioning that t he fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.congress added this proviso to in,see,stat,to clarify,in response to certain decisions of this court,that there is no per se rule barring any fair use of unpublished works,at,discussing new era publications international,aps henry holt,cir,and salinger random house,cir.this proviso in no way limits our consideration of a work publication status to the statutory definition of publication in.to the contrary,the proviso directs that if we find a work to be unpublished,however that term is understood,our analysis of the four statutory factors,including the nature of the copyrighted work,can not end there.
limiting our consideration of a work publication status to the statutory definition,moreover,would obscure the different purposes served by the statutory definition and the judicial gloss on the nature of the copyrighted work in the context of fair use.the statutory concept of publication serves numerous purposes,such as triggering the requirement to deposit a copy with the library of congress,see,measuring the copyright term for certain categories of works,see id.c e,setting the circumstances under which works by foreign authors are protected,see id.b,and determining the legal effect of registration,see id.c.see also nimmer on copyright explaining the significance of publication.publication as a judicial gloss on the nature of the copyrighted work,by contrast,aims to take account of the author right to control the first public appearance of his expression,harper row,at,which in turn forms part of our and inquiry into whether allowing the use in question would serve the goals of copyright,blanch,at.
this is not the first time that we have found that the second statutory factor favors fair use even though the work in question was technically unpublished under the statutory definition,see diamond amlaw pub,cir,and courts in fact commonly look past the statutory definition when considering this issue,see,rotbart,civ jsm wl,at finding that an unfixed,undisseminated talk,delivered publicly,had been de facto published for purposes of fair use see also nimmer on copyright a b ii if the author does not seek confidentiality,fair use is not necessarily precluded even as to an unpublished work.we accordingly agree with the district court that although the sound recording is statutorily unpublished,because swatch group publicly disseminated the spoken performance embodied in the recording before bloomberg use,the publication status of the work favors fair use.
swatch does not challenge the district court determination that swatch copyright in the earnings call is at best thin,swatch ii,d at,nor could it.it is well established that the scope of fair use is greater with respect to factual than works.new era publ ns,at.moreover,
e ven within the field of fact works,there are gradations as to the relative proportion of fact and fancy.one may move from sparsely embellished maps and directories to elegantly written biography.the extent to which one must permit expressive language to be copied,in order to assure dissemination of the underlying facts,will thus vary from case to case.
harper row,at quoting robert gorman,fact or fancy the implications for copyright,copyright soc y.
there can be no doubt as to the manifestly factual character of the earnings call in this case.the entire copyrighted portion of the call consists of swatch group executives explaining the company financial performance and outlook to a group of investment analysts.and while we assume without deciding in this appeal that the call contained sufficient original expression in the form of the executives tone,cadence,accents,and particular choice of words to be copyrightable,the purpose of the call was not in any sense to showcase those forms of expression.rather,the call sole purpose was to convey financial information about the company to investors and analysts 
in light of the thinness of swatch copyright,as well as swatch group prior dissemination of its executives expression,we find that the second statutory factor favors fair use.
amount and substantiality of the portion used 
we turn now to the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole.this factor asks whether the quantity and value of the materials used are reasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying.campbell,at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.in general,the more of a copyrighted work that is taken,the less likely the use is to be fair.infinity broad.kirkwood,cir.it is undisputed here that bloomberg used the entire work.the district court acknowledged that this generally weighs against fair use,but found that the public interest in the information contained in the recording is better served by the dissemination of that information in its entirety,including the incidents of oral speech that do not translate onto the page but color the purely factual content.swatch ii,d at.
swatch argues that the district court improperly resolved this factor in bloomberg favor because,as it also argued with respect to the first fair use factor,there are genuine disputes of material fact regarding whether bloomberg subscribers glean information about earnings calls by listening to audio recordings or instead by reading a written transcript or article.
we are unpersuaded.as an initial matter,we do not understand the district court to have affirmatively weighed the third statutory fair use factor in bloomberg favor.such a holding would have been novel,as n either our court nor any of our sister circuits has ever ruled that the copying of an entire work favors fair use.bill graham archives,at.rather,we believe that the district court found this factor neutral,refusing to weigh it in swatch favor despite bloomberg use of the entire recording because of the public interest in the information embodied in the recording.that holding is entirely consistent with our case law.as we have recognized,a number of courts have concluded that such copying does not necessarily weigh against fair use because copying the entirety of a work is sometimes necessary to make a fair use.id.citing cases see also ex rel.vanderhye,at,finding copying of an entire work to be fair use perfect,at same.
for the reasons already explained in our discussion of the first fair use factor,we agree with the district court that bloomberg use of the entire recording was reasonable in light of its purpos
