nano maldonado has raised a number of constitutional challenges to the california outdoor advertising act.cal.bus,et.as a consequence of a legislative amendment in,the act bars offsite commercial advertising but does not restrict speech.cal.bus.although some of maldonado claims are now moot because of this amendment,he continues to challenge application of the act to his effort to display advertising on a highway billboard.this appeal is maldonado second trip to our court and requires us,once again,to reiterate our commercial speech jurisprudence involving billboards.we dismiss as moot maldonado appeal from the district court injunction and affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on his other claims.
background 
maldonado has had a dispute with the california department of transportation caltrans over the use of a billboard on his property.in the early,he purchased property in redwood city,california,that is adjacent to highway.this land is in an area of highway that has been classified as landscaped freeway.in,maldonado applied to caltrans for a permit to use his billboard for offsite advertising.because california outdoor advertising act coaa bars property owners from using billboards along a landscaped freeway to advertise for offsite businesses,caltrans denied the application.see cal.bus.maldonado efforts to skirt the offsite advertising ban have resulted in lengthy litigation at the state and federal level over the last ten years.
after maldonado continued using the billboard for offsite advertising despite numerous citations,caltrans sued him in california state court for nuisance.see people maldonado,th,d.the state court trial judge found in favor of caltrans and enjoined maldonado from continuing to violate the coaa.id.at,d.the injunction barred maldonado from posting or displaying any advertising on his billboard without first having obtained from caltrans either a permit for outdoor advertising,or an exemption from or waiver of the permit requirement posting or displaying any on premise advertising which does not direct the viewer to the billboard location for purposes of conducting business posting or displaying any on premise advertising for activities not conducted on his premises and posting or displaying any on premise advertising for products or services which are only incidental or secondary to the principal business activity conduct on his premises.id.at,d internal quotations and citations omitted.the state court of appeals upheld all but the first of these prohibitions.id.
despite the injunction,maldonado persisted in using his billboard for offsite advertising and was twice cited for contempt.he then sued in federal court,alleging the coaa violated the first amendment,both facially and as applied to him.the district court dismissed the case on procedural grounds.we reversed that dismissal.see maldonado harris maldonado ii,cir.on remand,the district court held that the coaa unconstitutionally privileged commercial speech over speech because it permitted onsite commercial speech but barred onsite speech.maldonado kempton maldonado iii,d.the district court enjoined enforcement of the coaa against speech on billboards where onsite advertising is allowed.id.at.the district court later found that the coaa,as amended by the injunction,is constitutional and granted summary judgment against maldonado on his other claims.
maldonado now challenges the district court injunction and summary judgment ruling.he argues that the district court injunction was not an appropriate remedy for the statute unconstitutional preference for commercial speech.he claims that the coaa is overbroad and vague,that it imposes unconstitutional prior restraints on speech,that it violates equal protection,and that it violates substantive due process.he also claims that the state court injunction barring him from violating the coaa imposes a separate unconstitutional restraint on his first amendment rights.
ii.analysis 
jurisdiction 
before addressing maldonado substantive claims,we first resolve three threshold issues whether the amendment to the coaa moots maldonado claims,whether he has standing to raise his claims,and whether his claims about the criminal enforcement provisions are ripe.see kescoli babbitt,cir if the appeal is moot,we lack jurisdiction.steel citizens for a better environment,d standing is a jurisdictional question that ordinarily must be resolved before addressing the merits texas united states,d courts should not reach the merits of unripe issues.
on january,after the district court injunction and after the two appeals consolidated in this case were filed,the california legislature amended the coaa.the new section,reads 
notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter,the director may not regulate noncommercial,protected speech contained within any advertising display authorized by,or exempted from,this chapter.
with this amendment,the coaa now exempts speech from regulation by caltrans.the question then is whether this statutory change moots maldonado appeal.mootness is the doctrine of standing set in a time frame.abdala,cir quoting friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl,d.a statutory change is usually enough to render a case moot,even if the legislature possesses the power to reenact the statute after the lawsuit is dismissed.native village of noatak v,blatchford,cir.
before enactment of this new provision,the district court held that the coaa impermissibly favored commercial over speech,because it provided an exception only for onsite commercial advertising and not for messages.the district court remedied this constitutional infirmity by enjoining caltrans from enforcing the coaa against speech the court will enjoin the state from enforcing coaa to prohibit speech wherever the act permits commercial speech.maldonado iii,d at.
section incorporates the same solution to the constitutional problem that the district court implemented via the injunction,specifically carving out speech from regulation.cal.bus.now that the statute has been amended to exempt speech,the injunction is moot see railway labor executives ass gibbons,d noting that the amendment of a law removing sections declared unconstitutional by a district court mooted that court injunction.
despite the changes to the coaa,maldonado argues that because caltrans stated that it will not change its enforcement policy,his claims are not moot.however,what caltrans actually said is that it never enforced the coaa against speech,even when the text of the law permitted it to do so.this statement was not a threat to flout the new law,but rather a promise to follow it.
four of maldonado claims against the coaa were predicated on the coaa as reformed by the district court the coaa is overbroad and vague the coaa is enforced via unconstitutional prior restraints the grandfathering provision violates equal protection and the coaa violates the suppression doctrine and substantive due process.these claims do not depend on the lack of statutory exception for speech and thus remain live controversies.
maldonado claim that the state court injunction bars him from exercising his first amendment rights is also unaffected by the changes to the coaa.although the purpose of that injunction was to bar maldonado from continued violation of the coaa,the language of the injunction bars him from engaging in offsite advertising on his billboard,not simply from violating the coaa.therefore,the change to the coaa itself has no effect on this aspect of the state court injunction.this claim is addressed below in our analysis of prior restraint.
we next address caltrans arguments that maldonado lacks standing to pursue his claims.caltrans posits that because a redwood city ordinance also includes billboard restrictions,some of maldonado claims are not redressable.see redwood city sign ordinance amended prohibiting offsite advertising subject to enumerated exceptions such as community activity signs,open house signs,garage sale signs,political signs and public event signs caltrans argues that even if maldonado were to prevail on his constitutional claims,the city ordinance would still prohibit m
