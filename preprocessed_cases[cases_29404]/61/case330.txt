long after the public spotlight has moved on in search of fresh intrigue,the lawyers remain.and so we find ourselves adjudicating a dispute between gennifer flowers and what she affectionately refers to as the clinton smear machine james carville,george stephanopoulos and hillary clinton.flowers charges that said machine destroyed her reputation by painting her as a fraud and a liar after she disclosed her affair with bill clinton.we decide whether flowers claims are timely and,if so,whether they survive a motion to dismiss.
background and proceedings below 
in the heat of the presidential primary campaign,the ubiquitous supermarket source for celebrity a story claiming that bill clinton had carried on an affair with an arkansas woman named gennifer flowers.clinton and flowers both denied it at first,but a few days later flowers doubtless realizing that honesty is the best policy after all sold her story to the star.clinton continued vigorously denying the allegations and appeared on minutes with his wife to say they were true.the following day,flowers responded by holding a press conference where she played recordings of intimate phone calls from clinton that she secretly taped.later news reports suggested that the tapes may have been selectively edited.
according to flowers,hillary clinton and her two henchmen,george stephanopoulos and james carville,conspired to protect bill clinton presidential candidacy from flowers damaging revelations.flowers claims that during the campaign and in later political memoirs and interviews,carville and stephanopoulos defamed her and painted her in a false light by claiming that she had lied in her story to the star and doctored the phone calls.hillary clinton,the alleged mastermind of the conspiracy,not only orchestrated the defamatory exploits,but also exposed private information about flowers and organized of her residence.flowers claims that,as a result of all this schemery,her reputation has wilted and her blossoming career as a las vegas lounge singer has been nipped in the bud.
flowers filed this diversity suit in november in the united states district court in nevada,naming james carville,george stephanopoulos and little,brown stephanopoulos publisher as defendants.in january,she added the claims against hillary clinton.the defendants moved to dismiss,while flowers twice again sought to amend her complaint to allege special damages and to claim another instance of defamation by stephanopoulos.
the district court granted all three motions to dismiss and denied flowers requests to amend her complaint.flowers carville,d.the court held that most of flowers allegations are.id.at.it rejected the surviving claims on the merits,holding that some of the statements are merely rhetorical hyperbole and others are opinions based on earlier news reports.id.at.it dismissed the false light claims as duplicative of the defamation claims,threw out the charges against clinton as and impermissibly vague and rejected the conspiracy claim because,with everything else dismissed,there was nothing left to conspire about.id.at.naturally,flowers appeals.
timeliness 
we must first determine which state statute of limitations applies.it matters because the statute of limitations for defamation in nevada is two years.c,while the statute in other potentially relevant states is only one.some of flowers claims are only timely under nevada longer limitations period for example,stephanopoulos made allegedly defamatory remarks in a larry king live interview broadcast more than one year,but less than two years,before flowers filed suit.
because this is a diversity case,forum state law determines which state statute of limitations governs.guaranty trust york.klaxon stentor.traditionally,states applied their own statutes of limitations even if the offending conduct happened elsewhere.see sun oil wortman,d.this created opportunities for forum shopping by allowing citizens of states with shorter limitations periods to sue in states with longer periods.in response to this and other concerns,many states have passed borrowing statutes that instruct their courts to apply foreign statutes of limitations in certain cases.see john ester,borrowing statutes of limitation and conflict of laws.nevada borrowing statute reads as follows 
when a cause of action has arisen in another state,or in a foreign country,and by the laws thereof an action thereon can not there be maintained against a person by reason of the lapse of time,an action thereon shall not be maintained against him in this state,except in favor of a citizen thereof who has held the cause of action from the time it accrued.
emphasis added.
the district court held that the borrowing statute applies to flowers because her claim arose elsewhere and she does qualify for the statute exemption emphasized above.flowers held her cause of action from the time it accrued,the time of defamation and she was a citizen of nevada when she sued.but she was not a citizen of nevada at the time of moved there a year before filing suit.flowers,d at.although the exemption to nevada borrowing statute has been on the books since at least,see lewis hyams,no published decision has addressed whether it applies to someone who was not a citizen when the claim accrued but became a citizen before filing suit.the district court held that it does not,but we are unable to agree.
the first problem is syntactic.the statute allows a suit to be maintained in favor of a citizen of nevada who has held the cause of action from the time it accrued.if the statute simply allowed any suit maintained in favor of a citizen of nevada,it could only reasonably mean a citizen at the time the suit is maintained,that is,when the plaintiff files suit.adding the relative pronoun clause who has held the cause of action from the time it accrued does change the timing or duration of the citizenship requirement it merely imposes an independent limitation on who can take advantage of the exemption.
even if the district court reading were plausible as a matter of syntax,it would still violate the rule.see reynolds eng g state,thompsen hancock.under the district court interpretation,from the time it accrued modifies not just has held the cause of action,but the entire phrase citizen of nevada who has held the cause of action.this is precisely the sort of telescopic interpretation that the rule disfavors words leaping across stretches of text,defying the laws of both gravity and grammar.
our interpretation is reinforced by a comparison of nevada borrowing statute with those of neighboring states.nevada statute exempts suits in favor of a citizen of nevada who has held the cause of action from the time it accrued.statutes in california,idaho and utah,in contrast,exempt suits in favor of one who has been a citizen of this state and who has held the cause of action from the time it accrued.idaho code utah code ann.emphasis added to each variation in capitalization omitted in these statutes,the citizenship requirement is set off in a separate clause introduced by has been.this makes a difference.has been connotes either a continuing status held over some period of time or one held at some point in the past,not one held merely at the moment of filing.not surprisingly,then,these statutes have been interpreted to require that the plaintiff be a citizen at the time his claim accrued.biewend biewend,cal d,miller stauffer chem,idaho,allen greyhound lines,utah.the omission of the has been from the nevada the citizenship requirement in the present a contrary construction 
we have one further reason for rejecting the district court interpretation it raises a serious constitutional question.the supreme court has held that states can apply their borrowing statutes to foreigners while exempting their own citizens.can.ry.eggen.but after saenz roe,d,it far from clear that states can apply them to newly arrived citizens while exempting ones.the privileges or immunities clause protects the right to select one state of abode discrimination based on length of citizenship infringes this right.see id.at.see also corfield coryell,cas,washington,on circuit ranking as fundamental t he right of a citizen of one state to pass through,or to reside in any other state.perhaps the state could justify the discrimination as a residency requirement.see saenz,at.rehnquist,dissenting.but the question is close enough that we should go out of our way to confront it.
the district court reached the opposite result by relying on two unpublished decisions.one was a state trial court decision,mikhael steak ale of louisiana,no.dist,washoe county.but mikhael failed to offer any reasoning to support its construction of the statute,slip op.at,and we attach no weight to unreasoned conclusions in unpublished state decisions,see spinner princeville dev,cir.
the second was a nevada federal district court decision,volz delorean manufacturing,no.volz reasoned that because california,idaho and utah require citizenship at the time of accrual,nevada does too,slip op.at.but,as noted above,the statutes in each of those other states use different language precisely where it counts.volz overlooked this difference,and the court below was too hasty in following it.
finally,we reject the argument that our interpretation conflicts with the borrowing statute purpose of avoiding forum shopping.the fact that the statute includes an exemption for nevada citizens indicates that the nevada legislature sought to balance the purpose of avoiding forum shopping against that of keeping litigation options open for its citizens.recognizing one purpose tells us nothing about how the legislature calibrated it against the other.to determine that,we must look to the statute text,as we have done.
flowers held her cause of action from the time it accrued,and she was a citizen of nevada when she filed her complaint.the exemption to nevada borrowing statute requires no more.flowers suit is not covered by the borrowing statute,so nevada statute of limitations governs all her defamation claims.
because the statute of limitations is two years rather than one,we reverse dismissal of the claims related to stephanopoulos larry king interview and remand for consideration of the merits some of flowers other claims,however,are so old that they are barred even under the statute of limitations.
flowers objects to passages in carville memoirs,all fair love,war,and running for president,but that book was published in,five years before she filed suit.her only argument for resurrecting the claim relies on the continuing tort doctrine when a tort involves continuing wrongful conduct,the statute of limitations does begin to run until that conduct ends.page united states.the doctrine applies where there is no single incident that can fairly or realistically be identified as the cause of significant harm.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.here,however,publication of the book was a single incident.a cause of action for defamation accrues immediately upon the occurrence of the tortious act and thus,is not appropriate for the continuing violation exception.lettis postal,d.the only thing continuing about this tort was flowers protracted failure to bring a lawsuit when she had the chance.
the claims against hillary clinton for allegedly disclosing private information and organizing are also untimely under the applicable statute of limitations.see turner county of washoe,interpreting.c.the complaint is not a model of clarity as to what clinton supposedly did or when.but when the district court asked whether the claims were timely,flowers did respond with a date within the limitations invoked the continuing tort doctrine instead.flowers,d at tr.of dist.hr g at.flowers has therefore waived any claim that the events actually occurred within the limitations period.moreover,because disclosing private information and organizing are discrete wrongful acts,the continuing tort doctrine does not apply,and the district court properly dismissed the claims as untimely.
defamation 
the district court reached the merits of three defamation claims.the first concerned carville appearance on larry king live.flowers accuses carville of uttering the following moderately incomprehensible remark 
one of the things is to remember,we go back to the gennifer flowers statement i think the y found that tape was doctored and cnn even found our,like or different places.
flowers,d at sic s omitted.
the second involved stephanopoulos memoirs,all too human a political education.flowers,who seems to have read them more closely than most,complains about a number of passages.the book recounts how,after learning of the original story in the star,stephanopoulos planned his response to the media i came up with a denial i not going to comment on that tabloid trash.id.at.shortly thereafter,the book describes how stephanopoulos called a news reporter at the associated press and told him not to run the story you ca put this crap on the wire,i said.id.he next recalls his dismay the following week when the star ran the second story,in which flowers conceded the affair a ny fun i was having faded fast a week later,when gennifer flowers flipped.another thursday,another star story,another garbage day.but this one was more serious.id.at.finally,he describes his reaction to her press conference tapes the conversation did sound stilted her questions were the tapes were doctored it a setup.later investigations by cnn and kcbs would show that the tapes were selectively edited,but there was no getting around the fact that by talking to her on the phone,clinton had put everything we worked for at risk.id.at.
the final claim involves a cnbc interview with tim russert in,where stephanopoulos,discussing the tapes,said,oh,it was absolutely his voice,but they were selectively edited in a way create impression.flowers,d at.
we agree with the district court that the trio of colorful waste references to the star stories as trash,crap and garbage are not defamatory under nevada law.m ere rhetorical hyperbole is not actionable.wellman fox.can call a competitor store trashy,even if the store is not,in fact,unkempt.levinsky,stores,cir no relation.and the washington times can call the protest signs in lafayette park the garbage of pitiable lunatics with impunity.thomas news world communications.even assuming that the trash,crap and garbage statements were directed at flowers rather than at the star or the situation as a whole,they are nothing more than generic invective.see levinsky,at the vaguer a term,the less likely it is to be actionable.the law provides no redress for harsh.
we reach a different conclusion as to the statements that the tapes were doctored or selectively edited.the district court held these to be nondefamatory opinion s based on news reports.of carville statement that cnn found that tape was doctored,it said 
this allegation is clearly an expression of opinion,not a factual assertion.it accurately refers to a cnn investigation and news report that taped conversations between president clinton and flowers were at least edited.he relies on such reports as the basis for his opinion and flowers does not dispute that both cnn and kcbs made such reports.carville statement is thus not capable of a defamatory meaning.
flowers,d at.the district court classified stephanopoulos similar speculation at the time that maybe the tapes were doctored and his statement that cnn and kcbs would show that the tapes were selectively edited as statements of opinion based upon news reports by cnn and kcbs that audio tapes within flowers possession had been edited.id.at.
an unadorned claim that flowers doctored the tapes would surely be defamatory.to doctor is to conceal the real state or actual quality of by deceptive alteration.webster third new international dictionary philip babcock gove et.the claim would imply that flowers fraudulently altered the tapes to make her allegations more plausible.
defendants argue that doctor can also be used in a neutral sense webster does define it alternatively as to adapt or modify for a desired end by alteration or special treatment,as in doctored the play by tightening its whole structure and abridging the last act.id.we doubt,though,that anyone would understand the statement in this as we doubt that anyone would assume flowers doctored the tapes by nursing them back to health.at the very least,it is the only reasonable construction if a statement is susceptible of different constructions,one of which is defamatory,resolution of the ambiguity is a question of fact for the jury.posadas city of reno,quoting branda sanford.
a statement that flowers selectively edited the tapes could also be defamatory.while somewhat more neutral,it still insinuates deception.a jury could find that it implies flowers altered the tapes to make them more corroborative of her claims.
we do not understand the district court to disagree with the foregoing analysis.instead,it seems to have found dispositive that carville and stephanopoulos did not say outright that the tapes were doctored,but only reported that earlier news reports had said so.this argument has some intuitive appeal.after all,the statement an expert on kcbs said that the tapes had been edited to enhance flowers credibility may be literally true,even if the kcbs expert is wrong.
unfortunately,the district court overlooked the venerable principle that a person who repeats a defamatory statement is generally as liable as the one who first utters it 
on the quaint homespun logic that t alebearers are as bad as talemakers,each repetition of a defamatory statement by a new person constitutes a new publication,rendering the repeater liable for that new publication the law deems the repeater to adopt as his own the defamatory statement.liability for repetition of a libel may not be avoided by the mere expedient of adding the truthful caveat that one heard the statement from somebody else.
smolla,law of defamation,at to ed footnotes omitted.every repetition of the defamation is a publication in itself,even though the repeater states the source,or resorts to the customary newspaper evasion it is alleged prosser and keeton on the law of torts,at ed footnotes omitted see,liberty lobby,dow jones.were this not the rule,there would be no need for the common law privilege for fair reports of official proceedings,see sahara gaming culinary workers union local,or the constitutional privilege of neutral reportage that some courts have recognized,see edwards audubon soc y,cir barry time,
the republication rule applies here.carville said that cnn found that tape was doctored,and stephanopoulos stated that kcbs and cnn reported that the tapes were selectively edited.the fact that carville and stephanopoulos may have accurately refer red to the news reports,flowers,d at,does not alone excuse them for repeating their contents.
we have held that when a speaker outlines the factual basis for his conclusion,his statement is protected.partington bugliosi,cir.this assumes,however,that the factual basis itself is true.see standing comm.yagman,cir w here a publication sets forth the facts underlying its statement of opinion and those facts are true,the constitution protects that opinion from liability for defamation.quoting lewis time,cir emphasis added.a speaker ca immunize a statement that implies false facts simply by couching it as an opinion based on those facts.see milkovich lorain journal,d.likewise,a defamatory statement is rendered nondefamatory merely because it relies on another defamatory statement.in this case,the truth of the news reports on which defendants claim to have relied is disputed.defendants accusations of are therefore capable of defamatory meaning.
this does necessarily mean that flowers can maintain her suit.as we explain below,unless defendants knew the news reports were probably false or had some obvious reason to doubt their accuracy,their reliance is protected by the first amendment.but if it turns out that defendants knew the news reports were acted with reckless indifference in the face of some clear warning they were entitled to repeat them publicly and later claim that they were merely expressing nondefamatory opinions.
the prospect of liability for defamation has the obvious potential of chilling public debate.first amendment concerns are particularly acute when the plaintiff is a public who,for example,voluntarily injects himself or is drawn into a particular public controversy.gertz robert welch,d.public figures assume special prominence in the resolution of public questions,and the first amendment demands more stringent proof of wrongdoing when they sue their detractors.
flowers is a public figure,at least with respect to the controversy here.her affair with the governor of a state made the headlines in a national tabloid.to corroborate her story,she held a press conference where she played tape recordings of his phone during a presidential nomination campaign if all this does make her a public figure,it hard to imagine what would 
a public figure plaintiff must show that the defendant acted with actual malice that is,knowledge that a statement was false or reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.new york times sullivan,d.the plaintiff can meet this burden by showing either that the defendant knew his statements were probably false,or that he disregarded obvious warning signs of falsity.masson new yorker magazine,cir.this burden must be satisfied by clear and convincing evidence.anderson liberty lobby,d.flowers alleged in her complaint that defendants knew that their statements were false or acted with reckless disregard of the truth.am.compl.if flowers can prove this claim by clear and convincing evidence,then she is entitled to recover.
one who repeats what he hears from a reputable news source,with no individualized reason external to the news report to doubt its accuracy,has not acted recklessly.see communications,connaughton,d f ailure to investigate before publishing,even when a reasonably prudent person would have done so,is not sufficient to establish reckless disregard.but if someone knows that the news story is false,he ca sanitize his republication by purporting to rely on the news source.nor can he claim immunity if he has conflicting information from another source and recklessly disregards it.see id.in a case involving the reporting of a third party allegations,recklessness may be found where there are obvious reasons to doubt the veracity of the informant or the accuracy of his reports.quoting amant thompson,d.
defendants argue that reliance on reports of reputable news organizations can not constitute actual malice as a matter of law.appellees br.at.we agree with their statement of the rule,but find it inapplicable to them at this early stage in the proceedings.defendants were not uninvolved third parties who clearly lacked access to the facts behind the published reports.if they knew that the news reports were false or had information from other sources that raised obvious doubts,then they did rely on the news stories they simply hid behind them.what defendants actually want is a rule that purported reliance on reputable news sources can not constitute actual that is not the law.
this case is before us on a motion to dismiss.we ask only whether the pleadings are sufficient,not whether the plaintiff could find evidence to support them.see,in re glenfed.sec,cir en banc p laintiffs may aver state of mind generally,just as rule b is,simply by saying that it existed.the first amendment imposes substantive requirements on the state of mind a public figure must prove in order to recover for defamation,but it does require him to prove that state of mind in the complaint.as the fifth circuit has explained 
the court in new york times required convincing clarity of the proof presented to show actual malice however,this requirement extends only to the proof required to meet the constitutional demands.as to the complaint,the federal rules of civil procedure require only that m alice,intent,knowledge,and other condition of mind of a person be averred generally.rule b.
belli orlando daily newspapers,cir citation omitted see also boyd nationwide mut.ins,cir.
the first amendment is not irrelevant at the pleading stage.we have held that where a plaintiff seeks damages for conduct which is prima facie protected by the first amendment,the danger that the mere pendency of the action will
