background 
chambers served as chief of the united states park police,a component of the national park service nps,from february,until she was removed on july.the nps acts as a of the department of the interior doi or the agency.in,the office of management and budget omb decided not to seek increases in the park police budget.dissatisfied with that decision,chambers spoke with a reporter from the washington post and also with a united states house of representatives house interior appropriations subcommittee staffer about the budget and its implications for the park police.the newspaper then published an article attributing several statements regarding the budget to chambers,prompting chambers supervisor,donald murphy,to first restrict chambers from further communication with the press and then to place her on administrative leave pending review.
on december,murphy proposed to remove chambers from service based on six charges of misconduct.chambers,in response,filed a complaint with the office of special counsel osc,claiming reprisal for a protected disclosure,and also appealed the proposed removal and her administrative leave.after the deciding official sustained all six charges of misconduct and effectuated the removal,chambers filed another appeal with the board.
on appeal,the administrative judge sustained four of the original six charges charge public remarks regarding security on the federal mall,in parks,and on the parkways in the washington,metropolitan area charge disclosing budget deliberations to a washington post reporter charge specifications of failing to carry out a supervisor instructions and charge to follow the chain of command.the administrative judge also found chambers had not made a protected disclosure,and that the agency proved it would have taken the same action in absence of the alleged whistleblowing activity.the administrative judge then rejected chambers other defenses including reprisal for filing a grievance,violation of first amendment rights,and violations of due process.finally,notwithstanding that she sustained only four of the six charges of misconduct,the administrative judge found the agency would have imposed the same penalty of removal.
over a dissent by one board member,the board affirmed the administrative judge decision first,it affirmed the sustained charges,deferring to the administrative judge credibility determinations.board decision,at.next,it addressed chambers whistleblowing defense.the board agreed with the administrative judge that chambers did not make a protected disclosure and specifically addressed four disclosures a november,conversation with the house staffer,a november,interview with the washington post reporter,a december,letter to the director of the nps,and a december,email to the house staffer.id.at.
as to the conversation chambers had with weatherly,the house staffer,the board concluded that chambers had not revealed any information to weatherly by raising objections regarding nps payment for a study requested by the house to evaluate the nps compliance with national academy of public administration napa recommendations.id.at.the board looked to its standard that a gross waste of funds requires more than debatable expenditure that is significantly out of proportion to the benefit reasonably expected to accrue to the government.van ee epa,quoting nafus dep t of the army.in light of the assessed importance of the report to the house appropriators,the board concluded that it could not constitute a gross waste of funds.board decision,at.
next,considering chambers interview with the washington post reporter,which led to an article published on december,the board concluded that chambers raised a policy disagreement over which reasonable minds might differ,and therefore did not make a protected disclosure.id.at.in so concluding,the board stated that a policy disagreement can serve as the basis for a protected disclosure only if the legitimacy of a particular policy choice is not debatable among reasonable people.id.quoting white dep t of the air force.it applied that standard to chambers interview with the reporter,which chambers alleged demonstrated her disclosure of a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety,of gross mismanagement,of an abuse of authority,or of a gross waste of funds.the board found no disclosure of a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety because evidence instead revealed disclosure of a disagreement with considered judgments reached by policymakers after extensive study and discussion.board decision,at.further,the board concluded that chambers did not disclose gross mismanagement,an abuse of authority,or a gross waste of funds,because she only challenged decisions about the park police role and sufficiency of funding.id.at.
the board then considered chambers letter to the director of the national park service,mainella.in the letter,chambers complained to mainella that chambers supervisor,murphy,had slandered her and had disclosed a letter of reprimand that he had promised to keep confidential.id.at.the board did not find an abuse of authority in either of the alleged wrongdoings.id.at.
finally,the board turned to an email chambers sent to house staffer weatherly the same day the washington post published its article about the park police.because the email contained the same statements made to the reporter,the board reached the same conclusion that the disclosure did not amount to a protected disclosure.id.at.
the board further considered chambers other arguments and concluded that she had failed to make a first amendment defense and that the administrative judge correctly concluded that the penalty of removal was reasonable.id.at.chambers timely appealed to this court.
discussion 
we have jurisdiction over petitions for review of mspb decisions under a,pursuant to the procedures in.we must set aside agency actions,findings,or conclusions we find arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law obtained without procedures required by law,rule,or regulation having been followed or unsupported by substantial evidence c.
on appeal,chambers argues that the board erred by denying her claim that,by removing her from service,the agency acted in retaliation for a protected disclosure by chambers.specifically,she alleges that a number of her actions constitute disclosure of substantial and specific dangers to public safety under the whistleblower protection act,b wpa.further,the national treasury employees union,as amicus curiae,argues that the board applied an incorrect and overly narrow standard for what constitutes a protected disclosure of a risk to public health or safety.
chambers also contests the board decision to sustain charges,and.according to her,the agency presented insufficient evidence to sustain the charges,particularly where chambers did not violate an existing policy.she further alleges procedural errors by the agency and the administrative judge,including allowing ex parte communications prior to her removal,concealment of the agency findings,and erroneous evidentiary rulings by the administrative judge.finally,chambers argues that the board and administrative judge erred in concluding that removal was a proper penalty.
to prevail on a claim under the wpa,an employee must show that she disclosed information she reasonably believed evidences i a violation of law,rule,or regulation,or ii gross mismanagement,a gross waste of funds,an abuse of authority,or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.b a see reid merit.prot,concluding that,to make a protected disclosure,a whistleblower need only disclose what he reasonably believes is an of law,rule,or regulation.
with respect to the denial of her claims under the wpa,chambers only challenges the board conclusion regarding her alleged disclosure of a danger to public safety.specifically,she and the amicus point to the disclosures to the washington post reporter and the house staffer.according to chambers,she disclosed information she reasonably believed identified substantial and specific dangers to public safety,and the agency removed her in response.she argues that the board applied an erroneous standard when reviewing the administrative judge decision,and therefore reached the wrong conclusion with respect to her disclosures.
we agree with chambers and the amicus that the board applied an incorrect standard when evaluating her wpa claim relating to disclosure of a risk to public safety.in our view,the board improperly blended the concepts of gross mismanagement and risk to public safety.
the board considered chambers disclosures under the standard from white,at.board decision,at.where the board considered whether chambers disclosures evidenced gross mismanagement,white does provide the applicable standard.as discussed in white,a lawful but problematic policy constitutes gross mismanagement when reasonable people could not debate the error in the policy.at.but white concerned only gross mismanagement,not a danger to public health or safety.id.at.
the board failed to distinguish disclosures of a danger to public health or safety from allegations of gross mismanagement.in particular,it applied the white standard to a statement that a particular policy choice raises risks to the citizenry.board decision,at.while chambers certainly expressed a disagreement with a policy decision,she also potentially disclosed a danger to public safety that may have resulted from that decision.the board classified t he personal opinions that chambers shared with the newspaper reporter and congressional staffer regarding the funding level and priorities consciously set by policymakers for her agency,as different from disclosures of a danger to public safety,id.at but chambers opinions about the consequences of the policy decisions could have disclosed a danger to public safety.the board should have considered those aspects of chambers disclosures directed to public safety and determined if she disclosed information she reasonably believed evidenced a substantial and specific danger to public safety.
the nature of chambers disclosure reveals the difficulty encountered by the board.law enforcement activities generally serve to increase public safety.the budget provided for law enforcement,however,limits the extent of protection.allocating the budget to different aspects of law enforcement necessarily balances the risks and benefits affected this balancing represents a quintessential management decision.any such policy decision related to the allocation or distribution of law enforcement funding,therefore,could potentially be said to create a risk to public safety.see id.at,sapin,dissenting.perhaps the board implicit recognition of this overlap led it to consider chambers disclosures exclusively as a dispute over policy rather than revealing a danger to public safety.id.at.
the wpa,however,addresses disclosure of dangers to public health or safety separately from gross mismanagement.that under certain circumstances those concepts might overlap in the context of law enforcement does not change the fact that the statute creates two distinct standards.in other words,congress did not intend,in our view,to categorically classify any danger arising from law enforcement solely as a policy issue,to which the standard for gross mismanagement would apply.
certain parameters help define disclosure of a danger to public health or safety.the legislative history,a senate report from the committee on governmental affairs,provides examples of which disclosures fall within the statute 
g eneral criticism by an employee of the environmental protection agency that the agency is not doing enough to protect the environment would not be protected under this subsection.however,an allegation by a nuclear regulatory commission engineer that the cooling system of a nuclear reactor is inadequate would fall within the whistle blower protections.
at,cong.the board has interpreted that statement,stating that revelation of a negligible,remote,or peril that does not involve any particular person,place,or thing,is not protected.sazinski dep t of housing urban.our court has held that the disclosure of a danger only potentially arising in the future is not a protected disclosure.herman dep t of justice.rather,the danger must be substantial and specific.id.
a variety of factors guide the application of the statutory language,helping determine when a disclosed danger is sufficiently substantial and specific to warrant protection under the wpa.one such factor is the likelihood of harm resulting from the danger.if the disclosed danger could only result in harm under speculative or improbable conditions,the disclosure should not enjoy protection.another important factor is when the alleged harm may occur.a harm likely to occur in the immediate or near future should identify a protected disclosure much more than a harm likely to manifest only in the distant future.both of these factors affect the specificity of the alleged danger,while the nature of the potential the substantiality of the danger.
as noted,while the board concluded that chambers did not disclose a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety,it did so after analyzing her claims under an incorrect test applicable to disclosures of gross mismanagement.board decision,at.because the board is best suited to analyze chambers disclosures in the first instance under the correct standard,we vacate and remand.see hydril.lp grant prideco lp,medrad,tyco healthcare group lp.
chambers also challenges the board decision affirming the administrative judge findings and conclusions,which sustained four of the agency charges of misconduct.specifically,chambers alleges that certain charges against public remarks regarding security,failing to follow the,and disclosing budget based on activity the agency did not explicitly prohibit,and therefore can not support a charge of misconduct.the agency responds that no formal rules are required,but rather that the agency must only demonstrate a nexus to efficiency of the service.
the cases chambers looks to for support,ahles department of justice,and wise united states,involved misconduct charges of intentional fraud.by contrast,the agency here charged chambers with revealing sensitive information or otherwise violating norms of conduct,charges that do not require the government to show bad intent.the government must demonstrate only that chambers violated norms of conduct for her position,such that the agency action promotes the efficiency of the service.levick dep t of the treasury,quoting fontes dep t of.
the administrative judge determined that chambers did reveal information about security and either did understand or should have understood it to be sensitive,in part because it was labeled law enforcement sensitive.further,the administrative judge found that chambers improperly disclosed budget information even though she knew the agency prohibited her from doing so.specifically,the administrative judge rejected chambers testimony,and relied on that of her supervisor and other agency officials.
the agency also charged chambers with failure to carry out her supervisor instructions for failing to detail pamela blyth,failing to require two of her deputy chiefs to take medical examinations,and failing to cooperate with the department of interior solicitor office.the administrative judge sustained all of the specifications.
the board affirmed all of the administrative judge findings and conclusions,relying on undisputed facts and the administrative judge credibility determinations.board decision,at.we find no error in the board conclusion.indeed,credibility determinations are v
