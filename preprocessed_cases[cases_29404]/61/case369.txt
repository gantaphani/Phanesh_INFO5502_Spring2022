in this appeal,we decide whether a government agency,statutorily charged to be and acting in such proprietary capacity,is permitted to assess fees on expressive activities for use of distribution facilities in a forum.the district court found that the assessment of any fee in excess of administrative costs was contrary to the first amendment of the united states constitution and precedent in this circuit under sentinel communications company watts,cir.the district court granted a permanent injunction against the city of atlanta department of aviation,prohibiting,inter alia,the city of atlanta from charging newspaper publishers any fee for the use of the hartsfield atlanta international airport newsracks in excess of the administrative costs associated with that use on appeal,we affirmed the district court permanent injunction subsequently,we vacated our decision and granted a rehearing en banc after rehearing,we overrule part of our prior decision and hold that a government agency,statutorily mandated to be and acting pursuant to that charge,is permitted to assess a reasonable fee to newspaper publishers for the use of the airport distribution facilities.accordingly,the district court grant of summary judgment with regard to the plan fees provision and consequent injunction is vacated and the case is remanded.
background 
hartsfield atlanta international airport 
hartsfield atlanta international airport the airport,located in atlanta,georgia,is owned by the city of atlanta the city.pursuant to statutory authority,the city of atlanta department of aviation the department operates the airport,city of atlanta charter c.the department is required to operate the airport in a proprietary manner and is vested with authority to charge fees for the use of airport space by any activity.atlanta city code.the city code also restricts the use of these fees to the cost of constructing,paying debt service on maintaining and operating the airport,together with the incidental navigation facilities,and maintaining the airport in a reasonably safe condition.id.the fees can not be used by the city as general revenues.
moreover,the airport receives federal funding and therefore is required,to the extent reasonable,to operate the airport in a manner.a.the federal law,with few exceptions,mandates that airport revenues be used exclusively for capital or operating costs of the airport,and prescribes provisions for accountability and enforcement of same.see b and l.the intent of congress is clear.the statutory policy statement,found in,provides that the airport fees,rates,and charges must be reasonable and 
that airports should be as as possible under the circumstances existing at each particular airport and in establishing new fees,rates,and charges,and generating revenues from all sources,airport owners and operators should not seek to create revenue surpluses that exceed the amounts to be used for airport system purposes and for other purposes for which airport revenues may be spent under section b of this title,including reasonable reserves and other funds to facilitate financing and cover contingencies.
a and.thus,on both federal and state levels,the airport is charged with the responsibility to operate its facility focused on its bottom line.
the airport is uniquely situated to profit from the patronage of the travelers frequenting its concourses.on a yearly basis,over million people pass through the airport.although located in the city,the airport is an island of commercial activity.thus,given the captive market of the harried travelers,the airport and its vendors have virtually monopolistic access to supply items of convenience,refreshment and entertainment,often at prices stretching the outside capacity of an otherwise inelastic demand curve.approximately of the airport revenue is generated by concessions and parking.this monopoly position also extends to any vendor or advertiser desiring to lease space in the airport facility because the department has sole authority to lease the premises to whomever it chooses.for example,in the airport,through an agency,charged between and per square foot per month for advertising space.
newspaper distribution methods 
in the fifteen years prior to,the airport was party to a master concessions agreement,which delegated the exclusive right and responsibility to market concessions to dobbs,pascal,midfield corporation.airport news,the newsstand concessionaire,for the exclusive right to sell newspapers in the airport.initially,only newsstands sold newspapers as part of its contract,airport news newsstands were required to carry the atlanta journal and constitution,usa today,and the new york times.in,the atlanta ajc attempted to place its own newsracks in the airport,and airport news sued ajc publisher,cox enterprises,over the unauthorized placement of newsracks in the airport.pursuant to a settlement agreement with ajc,airport news permitted that newspaper publisher to distribute newspapers in eighteen newsracks,located as approved by airport news so as not to detract from the newsstand revenues.ajc paid airport news a fee of of the gross revenue from newspapers sold through newsracks at the airport,a portion of which approximately was remitted to the city by the concessionaire.usa today paid a fee derived from gross newsrack sales under a similar arrangement.in comparison,the airport received not less than of the gross revenue from other vending machines.the master concession agreement expired in september.
in,the airport and the city were undertaking a physical and operational restructuring in preparation for the summer olympic games.the airport management took this opportunity to renovate the airport and revamp the appearance and services available to the public coming to and through the airport.a main focus of their efforts was to provide a more concession selection and to giv e a sense of place to the airport.baker dep.at.when the master concessions agreement expired,the city resumed sole control over the newsracks.during the renovation construction period,most newsracks were removed,and the newspapers stopped paying the monthly assessment on the remaining newsracks.the airport sought to establish a uniform newsrack policy and developed a plan for appropriating standard newsracks and leasing them to the newspaper publishers the plan.the plan spawned six years of litigation,culminating in this appeal.
c.the plan 
the airport,in part through the efforts of steve baker,deputy general manager of the department,developed a design criteria and concessions plan involving,inter alia,the distribution of newspapers.the underlying theme,as explained to the newspaper publishers,was to control the appearance of customer service concessions and reduce visual clutter,baker aff.at.underlying these stated goals was the general understanding that the airport was statutorily mandated to operate in a manner,and therefore the generation of profits was integral to the plan.
four components of the plan were at issue before the district court.while one part of the plan will command the main focus of our attention,a general overview of each point is helpful first,the airport determined that it would provide uniform newsracks placed strategically throughout the airport and leased to the various newspapers.individualized racks were no longer permitted in the airport.second,per a joint venture with the company,these newsracks were outfitted with advertising,in exchange,financed of the capital outlay for the newsracks.the ajc had also been approached by the department with the proposition of designing and supplying uniform newsracks,yet it chose not to participate.ultimately,designed and procured the newsracks,financing the cost as agreed.the newspapers were informed that any other advertising displays on the newsracks by the newspaper publishers were not permitted,other than a single strip,subject to department approval 
third,the newspapers were required to apply to the department for a permit to place their newspapers in the newsracks.the newspapers would remain responsible for the daily maintenance and inventory of their newsracks.either the department or the newspaper could terminate the permit on thirty days notice.requests for locations were subject to availability at the time of the request and the desire of the department of aviation to present a diversity of publications in a coherent manner,ex.e,news box term sheet.
fourth and finally,the primary issue before us is the per month rental fee charged to the newspapers for the use of each newsrack.the department submitted evidence to partially demonstrate how this figure was determined.the original newsrack cost half of that amount was financed by.the newsracks were assigned a useful life of years,over which the department sought to recoup the balance.the useful life was determined by the department to maintain the level of appearance at the airport.baker dep.at.there was no empirical evidence introduced to reflect the useful life of a newsrack.the fee included an additional return on its investment to compensate for the cost of capital,baker,ex.
d.the permanent injunction 
on july,ajc filed a complaint in the district court,claiming that the plan was unconstitutional and requesting injunctive relief and a temporary restraining order tro.on july,the district court conducted a hearing and granted the tro.usa today filed a similar action and,on november,the usa today case was consolidated.on january,the new york times filed a motion to intervene and the district court granted that motion on may 
on july,the district court granted summary judgment in part and enjoined the department from enforcing any newsrack plan.the district court denied summary judgment on the issue as to whether the department was permitted to restrict the number and placement of the newsracks,finding it could not rule as a matter of law on the reasonableness of the plan.the court granted summary judgment on the other three bases.first,the court found that the advertising portion of the plan was unconstitutional because it contained an unreasonable distinction based upon speaker identity.second,the court found the fees provision was impermissible because the department charged in excess of administrative costs,conduct contrary to our decision in sentinel communications company watts,cir.third,also relying on sentinel,the district court ruled that the department unrestrained discretion in deciding which publications were given permits for the newsracks was unconstitutional.upon these bases,the district court granted a permanent injunction prohibiting the department from 
enacting any newsrack plan at hartsfield atlanta international airport which features any of the following characteristics 
the department must not adopt a newsrack plan which forces publishers to use newsracks bearing advertisements for other products 
the department must not adopt a newsrack plan which requires publishers to pay a fee which is not tied to the department costs in administering its newsrack plan and 
the department must not adopt a newsrack plan which vests unbridled discretion in the person or persons responsible for 
a selecting publications which may place newsracks at the airport,or 
b determining whether publications which are allowed to place newsracks at the airport may continue to maintain newsracks at the airport.
ajc i,d at.
on august,the department filed an appeal.we issued our opinion,affirming the district court.however,we expressed reservation as to whether it would be appropriate for the department,acting in a proprietary capacity,to assess a fee in excess of administrative costs.ajc ii,at.on july,we vacated the panel opinion and ordered this case to be reheard en banc.
ii.discussion 
first amendment scrutiny 
the distribution of newspapers,no less than the publication of the newspapers themselves,is an activity protected by the first amendment.lovell city of griffin.accordingly,a government here,the city is subject to certain limitations on the type and content of the restrictions it may place on this activity.
generally speaking,the city is precluded from making restrictions on expression protected by the first amendment unless it advances a compelling interest and employs the least restrictive means to advance that interest.sable communications of,fcc,d.however,the city may regulate expression on grounds through reasonable time,place,and manner restrictions,see,clark community for creative,d,consistent with the notion that c ivil liberties,as guaranteed by the constitution,imply the existence of an organized society maintaining public order without which liberty itself would be lost in the excesses of unrestrained abuses.cox new hampshire.
this statement of the law controls when the city seeks to regulate speech within a public forum or a designated public forum,as those places have come to be understood in first amendment jurisprudence see int l soc.for krishna consciousness,lee iskcon,d.if the property is a public forum or a designated public forum,then any restrictions on speech within that forum are highly scrutinized the restrictions must be narrowly drawn to serve a compelling state interest.id.in a public forum,by definition,all parties have a constitutional right of access and the state must demonstrate compelling reasons for restricting access to a single class of speakers,a single viewpoint,or a single subject.perry educ.ass perry local educators ass n,d.
when the city seeks to regulate speech on property which is not a public forum or a designated public forum,the standard is modified,becoming more deferential to regulation.if the property is a nonpublic forum,then the city ha s no constitutional obligation per se to let any organization use the forum.id.at.at quoting connecticut state fed of teachers board of educ.members,cir.the state,no less than a private owner of property,has power to preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated.united states postal serv.council of greenburgh ass ns,d quotation marks and citation omitted.o n government property that has not been made a public forum,not all speech is equally situated,and the state may draw distinctions which relate to the special purpose for which the property is used.perry,at.at.
therefore,in a nonpublic forum,the city may properly restrict exercise of expression that is inconsistent with the intended use or function of that property through reasonable,regulations.see iskcon,at.at.that is,even restrictions,which in other venues would be subject to strict scrutiny,are constitutional so long as they are a reasonable,attempt to ensure that the facility serves its intended purpose.implicit in the concept of the nonpublic forum is the right to make distinctions in access on the basis of subject matter and speaker identity.these distinctions may be impermissible in a public forum but are inherent and inescapable in the process of limiting a nonpublic forum to activities compatible with the intended purpose of the property.perry,at.at.this deferential standard is a much more limited review than that applicable in a public or designated public forum.iskcon,at.at.
in this case,the forum in question is the airport,which is.commercial airports,such as hartsfield,are not public fora.id.at.at.there is no argument from the parties that the airport is a designated public forum under the circumstances of this case,and,accordingly,we will employ the more deferential standard appropriate for regulation of nonpublic forum expressive activity.
our examination of the plan is restricted to two major bases that led the district court and our panel to declare the scheme unconstitutional first,the fee for rental of the newsracks,and,second,the unrestrained discretion vested in a government official responsible for setting that fee and choosing which publications could use the newsracks.though the department has proffered numerous reasons to support its newsrack regulation,we need discuss only one,its interest as a proprietor,to resolve the first issue before us the regulations are constitutionally valid if they are reasonable and viewpoint neutral.we find no question that the regulations are viewpoint neutral,and,therefore,we focus on their reasonableness below.
reasonableness 
to sell newspapers from newsracks at the airport,a vendor must pay a fee,set entirely in the discretion of the airport authorities,for one or more of the designated newsracks placed in an approved area of the main terminal.no private newsracks may be installed,nor may any of the available newsracks be modified or moved to other areas of the terminals.the fee required by the airport for use of these terminals includes a profit component the fee is above and beyond that amount needed to recoup administrative costs surrounding the installation and maintenance of the newsracks by the airport.in simplest terms,the department,in a manner indistinguishable from private sector business,charges the publishers rent for the privilege of selling their papers through the airport newsracks.
we examine the city restrictions for reasonableness given the surrounding circumstances.restrictions must only be reasonable they need not be the most reasonable or the only reasonable limitation s.iskcon,at.at quoting united states kokinda,d plurality opinion.the contours of the allowed distribution are not dictated by the publishers preferences the first amendment does not guarantee the least expensive method of distribution,and the city is free to approve an alternative scheme that results in higher costs for the publishers,assuming that such scheme is reasonable overall.kovacs cooper.plurality opinion.thus,we apply this reasonableness standard to the two issues before us,the fee and the discretion granted to the responsible official.
the central thrust of the publishers argument concerns the ability of the department to charge a fee for use of the airport newsracks.a fee can not be justified by reference to any of the airport stated concerns about security,or aesthetics,or traffic flow.rather,to support a fee,the department must point to its interest in maintaining the airport as a business.
according to the publishers,any fee charged on an activity protected by the first amendment must be limited to the recoupment of administrative costs associated with that activity the fee can not be a method of enhancing general government revenue.in advancing this argument,the publishers point to a line of supreme court cases that makes this very point.see murdock pennsylvania.cox,at.at.
this line of cases does not control the instant case.the airport is operated as a business by the city,as mandated by statute and required by federal regulation,and the plan at issue here is an outgrowth of its role as a business proprietor rather than its ordinary role as a regulator.where the government is acting as a proprietor,managing its internal operations,rather than acting as a lawmaker with the power to regulate or license,its action will not be subjected to the heightened review to which its actions as a lawmaker may be subject.iskcon,at.at see also kokinda,at.at citing cafeteria rest.workers union mcelroy,d finding that consideration of what due process was required in that case turned in part on whether the government exercised power as a regulator or a proprietor and lehman city of shaker heights,d plurality opinion stating that,in much the same way as a newspaper or periodical,the city could enact reasonable restrictions on expression when engaged in commerce and when the restriction on speech was a part of the commercial venture.however,t he government,even when acting in its proprietary capacity,does not enjoy absolute freedom from first amendment constraints,as does a private business,but its action is valid in these circumstances unless it is unreasonable,or,as was said in lehman,at.at,arbitrary,capricious,or invidious.kokinda,at.at.
reasonableness of fee 
the proprietor capacity distinction suggests that reasonableness,for purposes of forum analysis,includes a commercial component.in a proprietary capacity,the city has a substantial interest in the bottom line,and,when the city acts as a proprietor,reasonable regulations may include fees for access for expressive conduct,in a manner similar to fees that would charged if the forum was owned by a private party,a fee for a auditorium for a dance recital,or a fee for displaying advertisements in a newspaper.
here,the fee is facially reasonable it does not appear that the department is applying monopolistic muscle to the publishers.it would be different if the department set a prohibitively high fee for use of the newsracks.however,the charges imposed do not strike us as outside the reasonable bounds for this alternative distribution channel granted to the publishers.in addition,the history of regulation at the airport and the availability of alternative distribution methods for the publishers bolsters the plan reasonableness.
history of regulation can be a guarantor that current regulations are constitutionally reasonable.see kokinda,at.at.the publishers of newspapers at the airport were subject to fees for use of newsracks even before the imposition of the current plan,when the exclusive right of newspaper distribution in the airport was granted to airport news,an independent concessionaire.the publishers,pursuant to negotiated contracts,paid of their revenues to the concessionaire in exchange for the right to place newsracks in the airport and distribute their wares.a portion of that fee was remitted to the department.there is no indication that these historical fees were in any way tied to,or limited by,administrative costs.these historical fees do not seem dramatically out of proportion to the flat fee imposed by the plan.
the availability of alternative distribution methods for the newspapers at the airport also weighs in favor of finding the plan constitutional.see perry,at.at.the three appellee newspapers all find themselves with guaranteed distribution channels,because the newsstand vendors are required to carry those papers in their stores as a component of their lease with the airport.newsstands are a guaranteed substitute market,and,given the landscape of distribution in the airport,the complaining newspapers in this case are in a preferred position.in sum,we think it would be odd to conclude that the department terminal regulation is unreasonable despite the department having otherwise assured access to an area universally traveled.iskcon,at.at.
special fee 
the publishers contend that the imposition of this rent for the newsracks creates a special fee imposed on the press in violation of minneapolis star tribune company minnesota commissioner of revenue,d.the first amendment provides the press no protection from government generally applicable economic regulation,but does prevent government from treating the press in a special manner.id.at.at.
in minneapolis star,the state of minnesota enacted a use tax on the materials necessary for newspaper publication,including paper and ink.id.at.at.in comparison to the general taxation scheme of the state,this particular use tax possessed several unique qualities first,it did not complement the sales tax,as most use taxes do,but rather applied even to those products bought and subject to sales tax and,second,it was the only use tax imposed on goods that would eventually be made into retail products,that is,the only use tax on an intermediate transaction.id.at.at.
because of these unique characteristics,the court found that the use tax was without parallel in the state tax scheme,and single s out the press for special treatment.id.at.at.it was this targeted,unique tax that presented and particularized the constitutional problem.id.at.at differential treatment,unless justified by some special characteristic of the press,suggests that the goal of the regulation is not unrelated to suppression of expression,and such a goal is presumptively unconstitutional.id.at.at.in order for the tax to pass constitutional scrutiny,the government must proffer an interest of compelling importance,and an interest that can not be satisfied in a less suspicious way,to counterbalance these dangers of differential treatment.id.
the fees imposed by the department on the publishers are not a special tax on the press,and the minneapolis star line of cases has no application here.instead,these fees are part of the general scheme of the airport to tax those vendors who are granted space in the facility.every vendor,no matter the type of goods sold,must remit to the airport compensation for the granted right of access to the airport customers.calling the newsrack fee a special tax is unduly formalistic.true,the contracts made by the department with the publishers involve a different method of computing the fee due than the contracts with other airport vendors.moreover,the amount of the fee is not linked by some mathematical scale to the fees imposed on other vendors in the airport.however,this is not a fee,like that involved in minneapolis star,that has no analogue in the general scheme of regulation.all vendors remit to the airport a fee for the space they lease or a portion of profits from the goods they sell,or a combination of the two.none of these fees imposed on other vendors is limited to recovery of the airport administrative costs.the newsrack plan is not an aberration within this scheme of vendor regulation.
unrestrained discretion 
a grant of unrestrained discretion to an official responsible for monitoring and regulating first amendment activities is facially unconstitutional.see city of lakewood plain dealer publ g,d stating that the supreme court ha s long held that when a licensing statute allegedly vests unbridled discretion in a government official over whether to permit or deny expressive activity,one who is subject to the law may challenge it facially without the necessity of first applying for,and being denied,a license footnote and citations omitted.here,we believe that the district court and our panel correctly identified the boundless discretion granted to the department official responsible for administering the newsrack plan as exceeding the bounds of constitutionality.none of the department proffered reasons for regulation,including its interest as a proprietor,can justify this grant of discretion.
while market forces,ceteris paribus,might constrain the fees charged the publishers to reasonable levels,the city,even acting as a proprietor,retains its power to censor.such power must be cabined by some standard of first amendment reasonableness over and above the invisible hand of the marketplace.structural and procedural safeguards can reduce the possibility that an official will use her power to corrupt the protections of the first amendment.the official charged with administering the plan should have clear standards by which to accept or reject a publisher request to use the newsracks at the airport.perhaps a,system,a lottery system,or a system in which each publisher is limited to a percentage of available newsracks would be appropriate vehicles for limiting the official discretion.we leave the intricacies of the safeguards to the department,whose knowledge of the practicalities,including consumer demand,can be applied the official in charge must be constrained in some form in her exercise of discretion.
therefore,though we find that the department could impose a fee on publishers who wished to distribute newspapers through newsracks,we also find that the manner in which the department is able to exercise this prerogative runs afoul of the constitution concern over unbridled official discretion in the first amendment arena.thus,we reinstate and the following portion of the panel opinion 
t he department plan contains no explicit limits on airport personnel power to cancel news rack licenses.on its face,the plan permits the department to cancel a publisher license for any reason whatsoever,including unconstitutional reasons such as viewpoint discrimination.such unbridled discretion vests broad censorial power in government and this the constitution does not permit.
fees on first amendment expression 
in sentinel communications watts,cir,we held that florida was prohibited from charging publishers five cents per paper sold at newsracks placed at highway rest stops.according to the sentinel court,the problem with this fee arose from its character 
i t is well established that a licensing fee is permissible,but a state or municipality may charge no more than the amount needed to cover administrative costs.the government may not profit by imposing licensing or permit fees on the exercise of first amendment rights,and is prohibited from raising revenue in the guise of defraying its administrative costs.
id.at citations omitted.
while a government acting facially or impliedly in its capacity as regulator or licensor can not profit from the exercise of first amendment rights,it is not the law that a government,universally,is prohibited from imposing or fees on first amendment expression.we hold that when a government acts in a proprietary capacity,that is,in a role functionally indistinguishable from a private business,then commercially reasonable,contracts may be negotiated for distribution space in a forum for first amendment activities,subject to structural protections that reduce or eliminate the possibility of viewpoint discrimination 
iii.conclusion 
based on the foregoing discussion,we find that the department can impose a fee on the use of newsracks in the airport,but that the discretion surrounding such fee must be restrained through procedures or instructions designed to reduce or eliminate the possibility of viewpoint discrimination.therefore,we vacate the injunction entered by the district court to the extent that such injunction prohibited the imposition of a fee for the use of newsracks at the airport,and we retain that portion of the injunction that prohibited the administration of any plan that did not explicitly constrain official discretion.we remand this case to the district court with instructions to afford the department an opportunity to formulate ascertainable standards for the exercise of discretion by the appropriate department official.upon remand,the district court should not be precluded from considering the city claim,if any,for lost revenues from enjoined fees that we have determined were constitutionally permissible,and,upon approval of the airport new newsrack plan,this case should be finally resolved.
i concur fully in judge birch opinion for the court.i also concur in judge carnes view that,on remand,in accordance with long standing supreme court precedent,the city should be made whole for the fees it was enjoined from collecting.
believing as i do that the opinion for the court with respect to unbridled discretion applies not only to accepting or rejecting a potential publisher request to rent a news rack and the cancellation thereof,but also to the determination of the amount of the rent charged,i concur in and join the opinion.
i also note that in determining the amount of the rent,a rental charge based on the same formula applied to the rental of space for other purposes in the airport would constitute a generally applicable rent,and virtually foreclose a first amendment challenge based upon the amount of the rent.see minneapolis star tribune minnesota commissioner of revenue,d.my understanding of the challenged rental charge in this case is that it is substantially similar in amount as that charged for rental space for other purposes.although the opinion for the court notes that the instant rent is not calculated on the basis of the same mathematical formula,it nevertheless is substantially similar,and is not an aberration within this scheme of vendor regulation.opinion of the court at.moreover,the opinion for the court examines extensively the reasonableness of the amount of the instant rent and concludes that it is in fact reasonable,and does not appear to be applying monopolistic muscle to the publishers.opinion at.
i acknowledge some reluctance with respect to placing undue reliance upon the distinction between a proprietorship capacity and a governmental function.in different contexts,the supreme court has rejected the proprietary versus governmental function distinction.see garcia san antonio metropolitan transit authority,d in the context of the immunity of a state from federal regulation pursuant to the interstate commerce clause new york united states.in the context of state immunity from federal taxation.however,the supreme court itself in murdock commonwealth of pennsylvania,relied upon the distinction as to whether a particular activity is religious or purely commercial id.at.at.of course,the murdock line of cases is the source of the concept that a state may not impose a charge for the enjoyment of a right granted by the federal constitution where the fee is not calculated to defray the expense of administering the regulatory scheme.because murdock itself suggests that the rule might be otherwise in the context of licensing a commercial activity,i believe that the distinction is appropriate here.moreover,common sense suggests that the department should be able to charge a reasonable rent for the exclusive use of limited space in the airport,a rent substantially similar to that charged for the rental of other space.finally,the possibility of suppression or censorship which concerned the court in murdock is significantly diluted here because the instant rental charge is considerably more indirect with respect to its impact upon speech,as compared to the fees charged in murdock for the privilege of canvassing.
i concur in all that the court has said in this case,including the understatement in the last sentence of its opinion that on remand the district court should not be precluded from considering the city claim,if any,for lost revenues from enjoined fees that we have determined were constitutionally permissible.that is an understatement because the city lost substantial revenue during the six years it was wrongfully prevented from collecting constitutionally permissible fees from these publisher plaintiffs,and it has a legally and equitably compelling claim for recovery of those fees from the plaintiffs.
at the urging of these plaintiffs and on their behalf,the district court enjoined the city from adopting an airport newsrack plan that required publishers to pay a fee exceeding the city cost of administering the plan.eleven of eleven judges on this court who participated in this case have now determined that part of the injunction should never have been entered.as a result of that part of the injunction,for years the city has not been permitted to collect a fee that this court has unanimously determined is reasonable and constitutionally permissible.we have concluded that the city should never have been prevented from collecting that fee from these plaintiffs.
the question on remand will be what to do about the revenue the city should have been permitted to collect from these plaintiffs over the years of this litigation,and would have collected but for the erroneous part of the injunction the plaintiffs procured.the answer is clear.the supreme court has recognized and made a part of federal law the principle,long established and of general application,that a party against whom an erroneous judgment or decree has been carried into effect is entitled,in the event of a reversal,to be restored by his adversary to that which he has lost thereby.arkadelphia milling louis ry.accord fuel brock.the same doctrine is sustained in the several state courts of the country,all recognizing the power of a court,whose judgment is set aside on its own motion or reversed by order of an appellate tribunal,to direct restitution,so far as practicable,of all property and rights which have been lost by the erroneous judgment.texaco,dep t of consumer affairs,cir referring to the rule quoted from arkadelphia as a hoary adage.dep t of human res.united states dep t of,cir recognizing and applying the rule on behalf of the government.
the principle that a party ought to be required to pay back to another that which it wrongly obtained or wrongly failed to pay through the device of an erroneous court judgment is not a radical notion.instead,as the supreme court has observed,i t is a typical case for the application of the principle of restitution.arkadelphia,at.at.typical or not,the application of the principle in this case is one with which judge barkett disagrees.her position is mistaken because it conflates separate parts of the injunction and disregards the different effects of our judgment on them.
in her concurring opinion,judge barkett says that the city can have no entitlement to fees it might have collected during the pendency of this litigation because it has never formulated a licensing scheme that would suitably constrain airport officials discretion.an essential premise of that syllogism is demonstrably wrong.the premise is that without a licensing scheme which constrains official discretion,the city could not charge any fee for use of its property at the airport.of course it could.the fee is charged for commercial use of space at the for suitable constraints on official discretion.
look at it this way.there is nothing in the constitution to prevent the city from throwing open its airport for the use of any publishers who wish to put newsracks there and charging them a reasonable fee for as much of the airport property as they choose to use.likewise,once the district court enjoined the city,in effect,to open its property to these publishers,nothing in the constitution prevented the city from charging a fee that we have determined is reasonable and constitutionally permissible.indeed,that is the bottom line of our decision 
we have left intact the part of the injunction preventing the city from exercising unbridled discretion in deciding which publishers can lease space for newsracks at the airport,but we have vacated that part of the injunction prohibiting the city from collecting the reasonable fee for use of that space,which it would have been collecting all along had the plaintiffs not convinced the district court erroneously to exempt them from it.our decision is that excluding publishers from the commercial use of airport space based upon the exercise of unbridled discretion is not permitted collecting a reasonable fee from whoever uses airport property,regardless of whether there is a valid scheme in place for limiting the use of that property,is permitted.
these plaintiff publishers have for years used space at the airport for commercial purposes without paying the constitutionally permissible fee that the city attempted to collect from them.everyone else who has used space at the airport commercially has paid for it.so should they,the court has concluded today,because the constitutional right to publish does not include a privilege to occupy the property of another at no cost.that is what these publishers have been something for nothing.they have had their hand in the city pocket for six years,and now they owe restitution.
on remand,the district court has no choice about this aspect of the case.it can not reinstate the part of the injunction we vacated.it can not prevent the city from collecting the fees that we have determined are reasonable and constitutionally permissible.it can not pretend that the city was not entitled to collect those fees from the plaintiffs during the entire period this case has been in litigation.it can not fail to recognize the city right to restitution from the plaintiffs for the loss caused by the part of the injunction that is now vacated.
this is not a complicated matter.for six years these publisher plaintiffs and the dollar corporate conglomerates of which they are a part have been getting a free ride on the public back.it is time for them to pay up.they owe the city an amount equal to the total of all the fees that the city would have collected over the years but for the wrongful part of the injunction they persuaded the district court to enter.plus interest.see baltimore united states.arkadelphia,at.at.in the days of the arkadelphia decision,it was too much to expect that in similar circumstances the barons of big business who ran the railroads would pay what they owed without a court order.one would hope that these particular plaintiffs,powerful publishers whose papers preach principles of public duty and civic virtue,might recognize their own legal,equitable,and civic duty in this instance.if statements of usa today attorney at oral argument indicate distri
