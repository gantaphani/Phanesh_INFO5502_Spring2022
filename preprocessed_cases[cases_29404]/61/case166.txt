on march,the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia,after finding that h r block eastern tax services,and h r block tax services,hereinafter h r block willfully and maliciously engaged in a false and misleading advertising campaign aimed at preventing jth tax,liberty tax service and thirteen of its franchisees hereinafter liberty from competing for customers,entered a permanent nationwide injunction against h r block requiring,among other things,that its advertisements clearly and prominently disclose whether an advertised product is actually a loan.on october,and january,liberty filed two separate civil contempt motions alleging that h r block was in violation of the district court injunction because its instant money advertisements used much smaller type and less apparent color print for the term loan than for terms such as refund,check today and instant money.liberty further alleged that h r block advertisements failed to clearly and prominently disclose whether an advertised product was a loan because the loan disclosures contained therein were placed in areas that increased the likelihood that they would go unnoticed and consequently unread.liberty argued that the injunction clearly and prominently language required that h r block loan disclosures be presented in a manner that made them immediately noticeable to consumers.
the district court rejected liberty argument,holding that its injunction only required that h r block loan disclosures be presented in a manner that would allow a reasonable person to notice and easily read them.in so holding,the court defined prominent according to the definition of conspicuous set forth in the code of virginia the code,which provides that a term or clause is conspicuous when it is so written that a reasonable person against whom it is to operate ought to have noticed it.code ann.applying this definition of prominent,the district court found h r block to be in substantial compliance with its injunction because some of its advertisements used the same size type and color print for the term loan,and,more importantly,in ads using different type and color print,the term loan was presented in a manner that allowed it to be easily read by a reasonable person.
on appeal,liberty argues that the district court incorrectly defined prominent by determining that h r block instant money advertisements clearly and prominently disclose whether an advertised product was actually a loan.liberty also argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying its discovery request made during the initial contempt hearing seeking the opportunity to collect evidence of the harm it suffered because of h r block alleged noncompliance.
because we review a district court denial of a civil contempt motion for abuse of discretion and because district courts are entitled to inherent deference when construing their own orders,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying both of liberty contempt motions.accordingly,we decline to reach liberty discovery challenge because its discovery request exclusively went to the issue of damages,an issue which is reached only after a violation is shown.
