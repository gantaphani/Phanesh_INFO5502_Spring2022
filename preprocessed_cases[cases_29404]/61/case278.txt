plaintiff appellant laura leigh,a photojournalist,contends that viewing restrictions at a bureau of land management blm horse roundup violated her first amendment right to observe government activities.leigh moved for a preliminary injunction to require the blm to provide her with unrestricted access to horse roundups.the district court denied leigh motion,concluding that most of the relief sought was moot because the roundup ended in october.alternatively,the district court concluded that leigh was unlikely to succeed on the merits because the restrictions did not violate the first amendment.
we have jurisdiction under a,and we reverse.because the preliminary injunction motion seeks unrestricted access to future horse roundups,and not just the one that took place in,this case is not moot.as to the merits of leigh first amendment claim,the district court erred by failing to apply the qualified right of access balancing test set forth in press enterprise superior court press enterprise ii,d.courts have an unyielding duty to thoroughly analyze whether the government has violated this fundamental constitutional right,which serves to ensure that the individual citizen can effectively participate in and contribute to our republican system of selfgovernment,globe newspaper superior court,d.accordingly,we remand this case for the district court to consider in the first instance whether the public has a first amendment right of access to horse gathers,and,if so,whether the viewing restrictions are narrowly tailored to serve the government overriding interests.
factual and procedural background 
the wild free roaming horses and burros act,grants the blm jurisdiction over all wild horses on federal lands.if the blm determines that an exists on a given area of the public lands and that action is necessary to remove excess animals,the blm must immediately remove excess animals from the range so as to achieve appropriate management levels.b.
the blm controls overpopulation by conducting horse gathers,also known as roundups,in which it uses helicopters to herd the horses toward a temporary gather corral.once the horses are secured in the corral,the weaker horses are separated from the stronger ones.the horses are then moved by or to a temporary holding corral,where some are prepared to be shipped for adoption.the blm allows the public to observe horse gathers,but it restricts the viewing locations to protect the public from wild horses,helicopters,and vehicles.the blm conducted a horse gather from september,through october,at the silver king herd management area silver king in lincoln county,nevada,after determining that an overpopulation of horses was depleting natural resources and posing a danger to drivers on the nearby highway.approximately wild horses were captured.the blm allowed daily public viewing,and also scheduled two public observation days,during which it led groups of up to ten observers,and provided blm employees to answer questions about the gather.
leigh,a photojournalist for horseback magazine,reports about the blm horse gathers,and asserts that there is no true oversight or accountability over the gathers.leigh participated in the september,observation day at silver king,and she also observed the gather on days.the blm staff and law enforcement officers imposed restrictions to ensure that the public does not get in the way of gather operations and follows necessary safety precautions.the restrictions included designated viewing areas and requirements that observers sit down or remain quiet during parts of the gather.
on september,leigh filed a complaint in which she alleged that the blm restrictions violated her first amendment rights.leigh also filed motions for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction.on september,the district court denied the motion for a temporary restraining order.leigh then filed the present amended motion for a temporary restraining order and amended motion for a preliminary injunction,in which she asks the court to require the blm to provide her with unrestricted access to the roundup of all horses captured from silver king.she also seeks various forms of affirmative relief,which could be summarized broadly as requiring the blm to create a system to track the horses locations after capture requiring the blm to provide the public with access to such information without having to file a freedom of information act foia request and requiring the blm to allow the public to view the horses at holding facilities and after the gather.
on november,after the silver king gather was complete,the district court held an evidentiary hearing on the preliminary injunction motion.leigh testified that she was escorted by the blm staff during the first day of the gather,and that the blm staff,including armed guards,brusquely instructed the observation group where to stand.she observed the horses being moved into a netting area,but hills obstructed her view of the horses being captured in the metal panels.she also claims that she could not view the contractors sorting the horses into various pens,nor was she able to view whether the horses were injured.leigh alleges that the blm contractors prohibited her from accessing certain areas even though other members of the public were permitted in those areas.two other witnesses,elizabeth slagsvol and debbie coffey,also testified that the blm made it difficult to observe the gather.
chris hanefeld,the blm public affairs specialist who oversaw public observation of the horse gather at silver king,testified that leigh was not denied access that others received.hanefeld testified that the restrictions were intended to avoid spooking the horses as they entered the trap.he acknowledged that the blm instructed observers to remain seated and not to move,even when they were far away from the horses.
on april,the district court denied the motions for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction.the district court concluded that the bulk of leigh requests for injunctive relief are moot because the gather has been completed,there is no conduct to enjoin.even if leigh request was not moot,the district court ruled,she has failed to demonstrate likelihood of success on the merits as to her request to be allowed unrestricted access to the gather 
leigh has made no showing that she was denied access to the silver king gather,or that other members of the media were treated more favorably.leigh has not proven that she was denied access to gather activities or that other members of the media received special treatment.rather,the evidence before the court established that leigh was provided comparable access to,and observation of,the silver king gather as other members of the public and media.
the district court also denied leigh other requests for affirmative injunctive relief regarding other horse gathers and information about wild horses,summarily concluding that leigh has made no showing that she is likely to succeed on the merits of her first amendment claim as it relates to access to facilities,agency information,or the creation of a tracking system.leigh timely appealed the denial of the preliminary injunction.

discussion 
a court may grant a preliminary injunction only if the plaintiff establishes four elements likelihood of success on the merits likelihood of suffering irreparable harm absent a preliminary injunction the balance of equities tips in the plaintiff favor and injunctive relief is in the public interest.winter nrdc,d.the district court based its holding on the first element,concluding that leigh was unlikely to succeed on the merits because most of her claim was moot and she did not state a valid first amendment claim.we disagree with both conclusions.
the mootness doctrine requires that an actual,ongoing controversy exist at all stages of federal court proceedings.pitts terrible herbst,cir.i f events subsequent to the filing of the case resolve the parties dispute,we must dismiss the case as moot.id.
the district court held that because the gather that took place in silver king in is complete,leigh requests for unrestricted access are moot.
if leigh preliminary injunction motion were limited to the gather in silver king,we might agree with the district court.however,leigh preliminary injunction motion concerns all horses captured from silver king,and is in no way limited to the gather.therefore,the motion applies to all future horse gathers at silver king.although the government asserts that there are no current plans for future roundups at silver king,it can not rule out the possibility because the wild free roaming horses and burros act requires the blm to immediately remove excess horses from overpopulated federal lands.b.indeed,there is an estimated horse population annual growth rate of to percent in the silver king herd management area.furthermore,the blm only gathered wild horses during the roundup,even though it had determined that there were excess wild horses that should be removed.thus,there is a real possibility of another horse gather in silver king.although the preliminary injunction does not apply to horse gathers conducted in other locations,it is not moot as applied to future gathers in silver king.
the government contends that in defense of animals united states department of interior,cir,supports the district court mootness decision.in that case,an animal rights group filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order on august,to stop the initial phase of a roundup of horses scheduled to begin on august,and to last to days.id.at.the district court denied the motion,and the roundup occurred.id.on appeal,we found that the interlocutory appeal from the denial of a preliminary injunction is moot because the roundup sought to be enjoined has taken place.id.at.in defense of animals is inapposite because the preliminary injunction motion in that case sought only to enjoin the initial stages of a single roundup that had already been completed.in contrast,leigh preliminary injunction motion is not limited to one roundup.
moreover,the district court mootness ruling applied only to leigh request for unrestricted access to horse gathers at silver king.the district court did not find that leigh requests for three general forms of affirmative relief were moot.leigh has waived requests for two forms of relief requiring the blm to create a horse tracking system,and requiring blm to provide the public with access to information about horses without filing a foia request because she failed to raise them in her opening brief.see brownfield city of yakima,cir we review only issues which are argued specifically and distinctly in a party opening brief.quoting greenwood fed.aviation,cir.however,leigh opening appellate brief reiterates her request for the third form of relief access to horses after they are gathered.the government contends that this request also is moot.in her opening brief,leigh identifies only one holding facility to which she was denied access the indian lakes short term holding facility in fallon,nevada.leigh participated in a public tour of this facility on june,and the blm plans to offer periodic tours of the facility in the future.however,this limited access does not render leigh entire request moot because it does not provide her with the unrestricted access to the holding facility that she seeks in her preliminary injunction motion.
in sum,the completion of the gather does not render the preliminary injunction moot because it still could apply to future horse gathers at silver king,and to leigh request for unrestricted access to horses in holding facilities after they are gathered.
ii.first amendment 
the gravamen of leigh complaint is that the blm viewing restrictions violated her first amendment right to observe governmental activities 
open government has been a hallmark of our democracy since our nation founding.as james madison wrote in,a popular government,without popular information,or the means of acquiring it,is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy or,perhaps both.writings of james madison hunt ed.indeed,this transparency has made possible the vital work of ida tarbell,rachel carson,stone,and the countless other investigative journalists who have strengthened our government by exposing its flaws.
the first amendment prohibits any law abridging the freedom of speech,or of the press.const.amend.although the first amendment does not enumerate special rights for observing government activities,t he supreme court has recognized that newsgathering is an activity protected by the first amendment.united states sherman,cir see branzburg hayes,d w ithout some protection for seeking out the news,freedom of the press could be eviscerated.
to provide this first amendment protection,the supreme court has long recognized a qualified right of access for the press and public to observe government activities.the right originated in a series of cases in which the media sought to observe criminal judicial proceedings.in richmond newspapers,virginia,d,newspaper reporters challenged an order that excluded the public from a murder trial.id.at.the supreme court reversed the closure order,and held that the first amendment provides the public with a right to attend the trial.in the opinion announcing the judgment,chief justice burger wrote that f ree speech carries with it some freedom to listen,and that the first amendment guarantees of speech and press,standing alone,prohibit government from summarily closing courtroom doors which had long been open to the public at the time that amendment was adopted.id.at.two years later,in globe newspaper,the supreme court struck down a state law that excluded the public from the trial testimony of children who were victims of sex crimes.the court recognized the common understanding that a major purpose of the first amendment was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs.at internal citation and quotation marks omitted 
in press enterprise ii,the supreme court articulated a test for right of access claims.first,the court must determine whether a right of access attaches to the government proceeding or activity by considering whether the place and process have historically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant positive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.at.second,if the court determines that a qualified right applies,the government may overcome that right only by demonstrating an overriding interest based on findings that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.id.at internal citation omitted 
the government argues that the press enterprise ii framework is limited to attempts to access criminal trials.we disagree.although press enterprise ii and the other early right of access cases involved criminal judicial proceedings,we have applied this analytical framework in other settings.in cal almond,united states department of agriculture,cir,we applied the press enterprise ii analysis to the plaintiff attempt to force the department of agriculture to provide it with a list of california almond growers eligible to vote in an agricultural marketing order referendum.id.at.we concluded that there is a substantial question whether the interests asserted by the government would override the right of access asserted by the plaintiff,but we ultimately chose to avoid ruling on the constitutional question because the statute that governs agricultural marketing orders could instead be interpreted as requiring public access.id.at.similarly,in california first amendment coalition woodford,cir,we reviewed a district court ruling that prohibited a state prison from preventing uninterrupted viewing of executions from the moment the condemned enters the execution chamber through,to and including,the time the condemned is declared dead.id.at.applying a modified press enterprise ii test,we affirmed the district court conc
