in,congress passed of the telecommunications act of,stat.the telecommunications act,which amended the communications act of,et the act.section,as enacted in,added a new subpart g to of the act,providing in relevant part 
if a broadcasting station fails to transmit broadcast signals for any consecutive period,then the station license granted for the operation of that broadcast station expires at the end of that period,notwithstanding any provision,term,or condition of the license to the contrary.
g.in,after the occurrence of the events giving rise to this case,congress added the following language to the provision 
except that the commission may extend or reinstate such station license if the holder of the station license prevails in an administrative or judicial appeal,the applicable law changes,or for any other reason to promote equity and fairness.
at issue in this case is a decision by the federal communications commission fcc or commission declaring that the broadcast license of eagle broadcasting group,eagle had expired pursuant to g.eagle was licensed to operate radio station kvez fm from a site known as black peak the black peak site but ceased broadcasting in june due to interference and land use issues.the fcc granted eagle a temporary license to operate from its studio,but the station again went silent on december.subsequently,eagle applied to the commission for a construction permit to broadcast from a new site in the buckskin mountains the buckskin site,but it failed to obtain the necessary clearance from the federal aviation administration faa and the fcc.eagle then failed for consecutive months to resume broadcasting from its licensed site at black peak.
when the fcc determined that eagle had not resumed broadcasting as of december,it declared that eagle license had expired pursuant to g.eagle protested,arguing that its license had not expired because it had transmitted broadcast signals from the buckskin site in november.eagle contended that it did not matter that its broadcast transmissions from the buckskin site were unauthorized.the fcc rejected eagle petitions for reconsideration.pointing to of the act,the commission noted that the act clearly prohibits any person from transmitting broadcast signals except with a license granted by the commission.the fcc therefore held that eagle unauthorized broadcasts from the buckskin site were insufficient to avoid the strictures of g.see eagle broadcasting group,hereinafter,order.
eagle principal argument on appeal is that the station did transmit broadcast signals within the meaning of g before the deadline.eagle argues that congress would have inserted the word authorized in the statute had it intended for the provision to be interpreted as the fcc has interpreted it in this case.according to eagle,the plain language of the statute allows a station to transmit any signals from any location to avoid the automatic expiration of a license under g.we disagree.the fcc acted well within its statutory authority and pursuant to reasoned decisionmaking in rejecting eagle claim that unauthorized broadcasts by unlicensed stations are adequate to avoid license termination under g.and,contrary to eagle claims,the fcc action was neither arbitrary and capricious nor an abuse of discretion.
background 
statutory and regulatory background 
section of the act bans any person from transmitting signals by radio except under and in accordance with this chapter and with a license granted under the provisions of this chapter.the act defines broadcasting as the dissemination of radio communications intended to be received by the public.id.at.
prior to the enactment of the telecommunications act,the commission addressed silent stations radio stations which were authorized to broadcast but were one of two ways.the fcc would either grant the station temporary authority to remain off the air if it found such a grant to be in the public interest,or it would initiate a revocation proceeding,which often included lengthy procedural requirements such as an evidentiary hearing.see implementation of section l of the telecommunications act of silent station authorizations,hereinafter,silent station authorizations.
in,the telecommunications act added a new subsection to the act,providing for the automatic expiration of a station license when it failed to broadcast for months.the new provision stated 
if a broadcasting station fails to transmit broadcast signals for any consecutive period,then the station license granted for the operation of that broadcast station expires at the end of that period,notwithstanding any provision,term,or condition of the license to the contrary.
g.after the occurrence of the events giving rise to this case,congress amended g by adding language giving the commission discretion to extend or reinstate a license in order to,inter alia,promote equity and fairness.see g amended by consolidated appropriations act,stat.
because broadcast towers may interfere with air traffic safety,q of the act directs the commission to mandate broadcast tower safety features,such as painting illuminination,when there is a reasonable possibility that a tower may constitute a menace to air navigation.q.the commission rules provide that an applicant who proposes to construct a broadcast antenna with certain specifications must notify the faa of the proposed construction.see generally construction,marking,and lighting of antenna structures,et.the rules make it clear that 
a effective july,the owner of any proposed or existing antenna structure that requires notice of proposed construction to the federal aviation administration must register the structure with the commission 
b e ach owner of a proposed structure must submit a valid faa determination of no hazard.
d if a final faa determination of no hazard is not submitted along with fcc form,processing of the registration may be delayed or disapproved.
through its owner,maurice coburn,eagle acquired control of radio station kvez fm in.kvez fm was licensed to operate from a site known as black peak in the community of parker,arizona,but ceased broadcasting from the site on june,due to interference and land use issues.see order,at letter from maurice coburn to secretary of fcc june,reprinted in joint appendix.on february,eagle filed an application with the fcc for a construction permit to move to the buckskin site.see order,at application for construction permit.
on april,the commission staff the staff notified eagle of a deficiency in the buckskin site application.order,at.eagle had failed to respond to a question that asked for a commission tower registration number an applicant receives after a faa determination that the proposed broadcasting facility poses no hazards to air navigation.because the buckskin site is within the glide scope of air traffic using the avi suquilla airport in parker,arizona,the fcc stated that faa approval of the proposed tower was necessary.id.at fcc br.at.the staff informed eagle that public safety factors required both faa approval and commission registration of the tower proposed in the buckskin application.order,at.
on june,instead of supplying the requested information,eagle requested special temporary authority sta to broadcast the signal of kvez fm from the station studio in parker,arizona.letter from maurice coburn to secretary of fcc june.the request explained that the black peak broadcast site was no longer available due to interference and land use restrictions.although a new site had been identified,approval would take more time than eagle could afford under g silence deadline thus,eagle requested authority to temporarily broadcast from its studio location.id.the commission granted the sta on june,but reminded eagle that,because the station had been silent since june,the license would expire as a matter of law if it did not resume broadcasting on or before june.letter from edward de la hunt,associate chief of fcc audio division,to maurice coburn june.
on july,eagle notified the fcc that the station had recommenced its regular broadcast under the sta granted by the fcc and noted that a s fcc files will indicate,kvez is awaiting approval of an alternate site,so that relocation construction can begin.letter from maurice coburn to edward de la hunt june.
however,the sta expired on december,and on december,kvez fm again went silent.in a letter written that day,eagle notified the fcc that the station was silent as of noon.the letter reported 
our reason for going temporarily dark is that we are in the process of moving to our new transmitter site as previously approved by the 
while we regret this brief period of darkness,it seems unavoidable under the circumstances.as your files will indicate,we were asked,after the had already cleared us to move,to obtain a clearance from the faa we had been under the impression that such a clearance would not be needed.while we filed our request promptly,it took the faa several months to finally give its ok.
we are proceeding with all deliberate speed to make the required upgrade to full power status,at the approved location,but we are requesting permission to remain dark for to days while all necessary construction and installations are completed.
letter from maurice coburn to edward de la hunt.
on january,the commission again requested that eagle supplement the incomplete application for the buckskin site.letter from rodolfo bonacci,supervisory engineer of fcc audio division,to eagle.specifically,the letter requested that eagle register the proposed antenna structure with the commission,and reminded eagle that faa approval was necessary in order to obtain fcc antenna structure registration.id.the fcc advised that action on the application would be withheld until eagle responded.finally,it warned that eagle failure to respond would result in the dismissal of the application pursuant to a commission rule which allows an application to be dismissed for failure to respond to an official request for additional information.id.at see a.
eagle still failed to respond with documentation of faa approval.instead,eagle sent a series of letters to the fcc implying that faa approval had either been obtained or was unnecessary.for example,on february,eagle wrote another letter reporting on the progress in moving kvez to its new approved site.letter from maurice coburn to edward de la hunt.the letter noted as you will no doubt recall,after your office approved of our new site,it took several months to get clearance from the faa and then lapaz county.we are working with all due diligence to complete the move and installation.id.
additionally,on november,eagle notified the fcc that the station had completed its installation of a new transmitter and antenna at the previously approved site n orth of the city of license,parker,arizona.letter from maurice coburn to edward de la hunt.the letter stated 
we are pleased to inform the commission that hours on november,marked the resumption of regular broadcasting activities of in parker,arizona.
the patience and assistance of your staff throughout our many relocation problems is most appreciated.
and finally,on november,eagle wrote to the commission and stated that the faa had informed eagle that since the station antenna site was not within the flight path of the parker area airport,and not of significant height to either be lighted or painted with the pattern,that no special authorization was required.email from jerry hale,consultant to eagle,to rodolfo bonacci,supervisory engineer of fcc audio division.
by reply sent on december,the commission requested eagle to submit a copy of the faa letter to prove what you said below is correct,that no faa authorization was necessary.email from khoa tran,fcc to jerry hale.the letter also notified eagle that,because the station had been silent since december,the license is going to expire on.id.eagle consultant responded the next day that he would send a copy of the faa information this week and stated that coburn has notified the fcc in writing and by phone,as well as which i sent that kvez fm parker,arizona had returned to the air as of november.email from jerry hale to khoa tran.the email requested that the fcc verify that the commission has received the appropriate notice so that the license will not expire on december.if we need to do any additional filings,please advise.id.
eagle never submitted any faa letter or any documentation indicating that it had received clearance from the faa with respect to the buckskin site application.the staff contacted the faa on its own in june and was informed that the faa had no record of receiving any application or issuing any determination for the site specified in the buckskin application.order,at.rather,the faa had only provided an august,determination of no hazard to eagle for a tower approximately miles away from the buckskin site.id.at.
in early january,the staff received a complaint that station kvez fm was operating from a site the fcc had not approved.id.at.on january,the staff contacted the station for clarification.email from glenn greisman,industry analyst for fcc media division,to maurice coburn.eagle was instructed to provide the commission with a file number to identify any previously approved site.id.maurice coburn and eagle consultant each telephoned the staff to report that the station was operating at the site proposed in the buckskin application.order,at.
the fcc concluded that eagle had not transmitted from its place of black peak over one year.although eagle represented that it was once again broadcasting,it was indisputably operating from an unauthorized and unlicensed facility.the buckskin site application remained pending and eagle had no authority to transmit broadcast signals away from the black peak site.and eagle had not received faa approval for operation of a broadcast tower at the buckskin site.on february,the staff informed eagle that the pending buckskin site application had been dismissed as moot and the call letters the identifying code letters for the station assigned by the fcc had been deleted because the underlying license for the black peak site had expired as a matter of law on december,pursuant to g.letter from peter doyle,fcc audio division chief,to eagle,hereinafter,staff decision.the staff decision explained a broadcaster can not avoid the statutory deadline set forth in g by resuming operations,as here,without an authorization,permanent or temporary,from the commission.id.at.
eagle petitioned for reconsideration on march.petition for reconsideration reconsideration petition.eagle subsequently filed a supplement to the reconsideration petition in light of congress amendment to g,noting that t he statute,as amended,now directs the commission to extend or reinstate broadcast licenses as appropriate to promote equity and fairness.supplement to petition for reconsideration supplement.the reconsideration petition,the supplement,and two other petitions filed by eagle requesting license renewal were referred to the commission for review.order,at.
order on appeal 
the commission denied all four petitions.order,at.first,the commission disagreed with eagle contention that unauthorized transmissions are sufficient to avoid the consequences of g.id.at.the commission explained 
section provides that no person shall transmit radio signals except in accordance with authority granted by the commission.it further provides that no license shall be construed to create any right beyond the terms,conditions,and authority of the license.the sanctions set forth in section enforce these provisions.section g,which establishes the specific sanction for extended failure to broadcast,can not be read to create an exception to section licensing requirements.indeed,if read to permit unauthorized operation to avoid license expiration,section g would encourage violation of section and defeat its own purpose of ensuring timely construction and operation of authorized facilities that serve the public.
id.thus,the commission rejected eagle claim that its unauthorized transmissions from the buckskin site were sufficient to avoid license termination.
the commission also rejected eagle assertion that it reasonably believed the transmissions from the buckskin site were authorized.id.at.eagle claimed that it believed the staff had erroneously determined that faa approval was required to construct the proposed tower at the buckskin site,and that this mistake had been resolved.the commission found that eagle claim of an innocent mistake was inconsistent with the facts.noting the number of shifting theories eagle had presented regarding the issuance of a faa air hazard determination,the order concluded that eagle claim that it held an authorization to operate at buckskin is frivolous.id.at.
commission construction permits are written documents.the commission never issued,and therefore eagle never received,a construction permit or any other document establishing that the buckskin application had been granted.to the contrary,as noted above,the staff advised eagle in writing that the application could not be granted until eagle supplied tower information.eagle alleged belief that the application had been granted by the fall of is also inconsistent with its consultant contacts with the staff in november and december to address the deficiency that continued to prevent staff action.eagle pro se status at that time did not exempt it from complying with commission rules or statutory provisions.
the order also rejected eagle claim that,under fcc case precedent,eagle should have been assessed a monetary forfeiture,in lieu of license expiration,for unauthorized operations.the fcc distinguished the forfeiture cases cited by eagle,saying that eagle fails to comprehend the critical differences between rule violations and section g.id.at.the commission noted that it had discretion to shape penalties for rule violations,and distinguished the forfeiture cases as inapplicable because t hey do not address section g,focusing only on other rule violations.id.
finally,the commission rejected eagle alternative request for discretionary license reinstatement under the amended g.id.at.the commission first noted that eagle license expired on december,before the legislation was enacted.the commission then concluded that,in any event,eagle had failed to qualify under the statute for license reinstatement.eagle had not obtained permission to construct a tower or operate from the buckskin site,and eagle claim that it was confused about the status of its permit was not credible.the commission also noted that the staff had warned eagle about the risk of license expiration under g.the order characterized eagle claim that it had resumed operations at an authorized site as misleading and false.id.at.
eagle raises three central arguments on appeal.first,eagle asserts that g,by its plain terms,only prescribes license expiration in cases of utter silence.because it transmitted from the buckskin site,eagle claims that it can not be said that it fail ed to transmit broadcast signals for a consecutive period.second,eagle argues that the fcc action was arbitrary and capricious because the commission imposed a monetary forfeiture,rather than license expiration,against other similarly situated licensees who operated unauthorized facilities for more than a consecutive period.finally,eagle argues that the fcc should have reinstated its license under the amendment to g,which vests the commission with discretion to reinstate a license that has expired if doing so would promote equity and fairness.g.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
in order to determine whether the commission permissibly terminated eagle license pursuant to g,the court applies the familiar test of chevron usa natural resources defense council,d.chevron instructs us to accord agency interpretations of statutes they administer varying degrees of deference.ass of clean air agencies epa.under chevron step one,the court examines the statute de novo in order to determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,at.if so,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.however,if congress has not directly spoken to the precise question at issue,the court moves on to chevron step two.id.at.under step two,i f congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill,there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation.such legislative regulations are given controlling weight unless they are manifestly contrary to the statute.id.at.where,on the other hand,the legislative delegation to the agency is implicit rather than explicit,we will uphold any reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of the agency.id.at.
even when an agency construction of its statute passes muster under chevron,a party may claim that the disputed agency action is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.
section a of the apa provides that a reviewing court shall hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.this is the apa provision governing the scope and standards of review,and the courts rarely draw any meaningful distinctions between acts that are arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion.block pitney bowes.a rbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion review under a is now routinely applied by the courts as one standard under the heading of arbitrary and capricious review.and it encompasses both review of the factual basis of an agency action,see citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d,and review of an agency reasoning as distinguished from its factfinding,see bowman,freight,d.moreover,the arbitrary and capricious standard governs review of all proceedings that are subject to challenge under the apa.see consumers union of,ftc.thus,if an action is subject to review under the apa,it does not matter whether it is a formal or informal adjudication or a formal or informal rulemaking are subject to arbitrary and capricious review under a.
harry edwards linda elliott,federal standards of of district court decisions and agency actions.normally,an agency action would be arbitrary and capricious if the agency has relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.motor vehicle mfrs.ass of the united states,state farm mut.auto.ins,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.additionally,an agency may not treat like cases differently.freeman eng g,fcc,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.and an agency unexplained departure from precedent must be overturned as arbitrary and capricious.comcast fcc.
as noted above,eagle contends that the fcc wrongly interpreted g to require authorized transmissions in order to avoid expiration of a licence.eagle br.at.eagle also argues that the fcc action was arbitrary and capricious because the agency treated eagle differently than other similarly situated licensees,id.at,and an abuse of discretion because eagle license should have been reinstated pursuant to the amendment to g,id.at.we find no merit in these claims.
chevron step one 
eagle argues that the fcc decision to cancel eagle license pursuant to g should be invalidated under chevron step one,because it is at odds with the plain meaning of the statute.under chevron step one,the court applies the traditional tools of statutory construction in order to discern whether congress has spoken directly to the question at issue.chevron,at.if this search for the plain meaning of the statute yields a clear result,then congress has expressed its intention as to the question,and deference is not appropriate.bell atlantic.fcc.
eagle argues that g only allows for license expiration in the case of utter silence.eagle was required to resume broadcasting within one year of december,date that it went order to avoid expiration under g.the station purported to resume broadcasting on november.focusing on the statutory language fails to transmit b
