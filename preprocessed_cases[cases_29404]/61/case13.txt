this is a hard case hard not in the sense that the legal issues defy resolution,but hard in the sense that the law requires that we,like the court below,deny relief to plaintiffs whose circumstances evoke outrage.the result we must reach is rooted in positive law.congress addressed the right to publish the speech of others in the information age when it enacted the communications decency act of cda.see.congress later addressed the need to guard against the evils of sex trafficking when it enacted the trafficking victims protection reauthorization act of tvpra,codified as relevant here at.these laudable legislative efforts do not fit together seamlessly,and this case reflects the tension between them.striking the balance in a way that we believe is consistent with both congressional intent and the teachings of precedent,we affirm the district court order of dismissal.the tale follows.
background 
in reviewing the grant or denial of a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,we draw upon the facts as they appear in the operative pleading here,the second amended complaint.see sec tambone,cir en banc.
provides online classified advertising,allowing users to post advertisements in a range of categories based on the product or service being sold among the categories provided is one for adult entertainment,which includes a subcategory labeled escorts.the site is differentiated by geographic area,enabling users to target their advertisements and permitting potential customers to see local postings.
this suit involves advertisements posted in the escorts section for three young women all minors at the relevant times who claim to have been victims of sex trafficking.suing pseudonymously,the women allege that backpage,with an eye to maximizing its profits,engaged in a course of conduct designed to facilitate sex traffickers efforts to advertise their victims on the website.this strategy,the appellants say,led to their victimization.
past is prologue.in,a competing website craigslist shuttered its adult advertising section due to concerns about sex trafficking.spying an opportunity,backpage expanded its marketing footprint in the adult advertising arena.according to the appellants,the expansion had two aspects.first,backpage engaged in a campaign to distract attention from its role in sex trafficking by,for example,meeting on various occasions with hierarchs of the national center for missing and exploited children ncmec and making false and misleading representations to the ncmec and law enforcement regarding its efforts to combat sex trafficking.but this campaign,the appellants suggest,was merely a ruse.
the second aspect of backpage expansion strategy involved the deliberate structuring of its website to facilitate sex trafficking.the appellants aver that backpage selectively removed certain postings made in the escorts section such as postings made by victim support organizations and law enforcement sting advertisements and tailored its posting requirements to make sex trafficking easier 
in addition,the appellants allege that backpage rules and processes governing the content of advertisements are designed to encourage sex trafficking.for example,backpage does not require phone number verification and permits the posting of phone numbers in alternative formats.there is likewise no verification,and backpage provides users with the option to hide their addresses in postings,because backpage provides message forwarding services and on behalf of the advertiser.photographs uploaded for use in advertisements are shorn of their metadata,thus removing from scrutiny information such as the date,time,and location the photograph was taken.while backpage automated filtering system screens out advertisements containing certain prohibited terms,such as barely legal and high school,a failed attempt to enter one of these terms does not prevent the poster from substituting workarounds,such as brly legal or high schl.
the appellants suggest that backpage profits from having its thumb on the scale in two ways.first,advertisements in the adult entertainment section are the only ones for which backpage charges a posting fee.second,users may pay an additional fee for sponsored ads,which appear on the side of every page of the escorts section.a sponsored ad includes a smaller version of the image from the posted advertisement and information about the location and availability of the advertised individual.
beginning at age,each of the appellants was trafficked through advertisements posted on backpage.jane doe was advertised on backpage during two periods in and.she estimates that,as a result,she was raped over times.jane doe was advertised on backpage between and.she estimates that,as a result,she was raped over times.jane doe was advertised on backpage from december of until some unspecified future date.as a result,she was raped on numerous occasions all of the rapes occurred either in massachusetts or rhode island.sometimes the sex traffickers posted the advertisements directly and sometimes they forced the victims to post the advertisements.
typically,each posted advertisement included images of the particular appellant,usually taken by the traffickers but advertisements for doe included some pictures that she herself had taken.many of the advertisements embodied challenged practices such as anonymous payment for postings,coded terminology meant to refer to underage girls,and altered telephone numbers.
the appellants filed suit against backpage in october of.the operative pleading is the appellants second amended complaint,which limns three sets of claims.the first set consists of claims that backpage engaged in sex trafficking of minors as defined by the tvpra and its massachusetts counterpart,the massachusetts anti human trafficking and victim protection act of mata.laws ch,a.the second set consists of claims under a massachusetts consumer protection statute,which forbids unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.laws ch,a.the last set consists of claims alleging abridgements of intellectual property rights.
in due season,backpage moved to dismiss the second amended complaint for failure to state claims upon which relief could be granted.see.b.although the appellants vigorously opposed the motion,the district court dismissed the action in its entirety.see doe ex rel.roe,llc,d.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.analysis 
the appellants,ably represented,have constructed a series of arguments.those arguments are buttressed by a legion of amici whose helpful briefs we appreciate.we review the district court dismissal of the appellants complaint for failure to state any actionable claim de novo,taking as true the facts and drawing all reasonable inferences in the appellants favor.see tambone,at.in undertaking this canvass,we are not bound by the district court ratiocination but may affirm the dismissal on any ground apparent from the record.see santiago puerto rico,cir.it is through this prism that we evaluate the appellants asseverational array.
trafficking claims.
the appellants challenge the district court conclusion that section of the cda shields backpage from liability for a course of conduct that allegedly amounts to participation in sex trafficking.we begin our consideration of this challenge with the text of section c,which provides 
c protection for good samaritan blocking and screening of offensive material 
treatment of publisher or speaker 
no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.
civil liability 
no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of 
a any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene,lewd,lascivious,filthy,excessively violent,harassing,or otherwise objectionable,whether or not such material is constitutionally protected or 
b any action taken to enable or make available to information content providers or others the technical means to restrict access to material described in subparagraph a.
c.congress enacted this statute partially in response to court cases that held internet publishers liable for defamatory statements posted by third parties on message boards maintained by the publishers.see,stratton oakmont,prodigy servs,wl,at.may,explaining that prodigy was liable because,unlike some other website operators,it had taken steps to screen or edit content posted on its message board.section c limits this sort of liability in two ways.principally,it shields website operators from being treated as the publisher or speaker of material posted by users of the site,c,which means that lawsuits seeking to hold a service provider liable for its exercise of a publisher traditional editorial functions such as deciding whether to publish,withdraw,postpone or alter content are barred,zeran am.online,cir.relatedly,it allows website operators to engage in blocking and screening of content,free from liability for such efforts.see c a.
there has been agreement that section should not be construed grudgingly.see,doe myspace,cir universal commc,lycos,cir almeida,cir carafano,cir.this preference for broad construction recognizes that websites that display content may have an infinite number of users generating an enormous amount of potentially harmful content,and holding website operators liable for that content would have an obvious chilling effect in light of the difficulty of screening posts for potential issues.zeran,at.the obverse of this proposition is equally salient congress sought to encourage websites to make efforts to screen content without fear of liability.see b zeran,at see also lycos,at.such a approach is fully consistent with congress avowed desire to permit the continued development of the internet with minimal regulatory interference.see a,b.
in holding backpage harmless here,the district court found section c controlling.see,d at.section c can be broken down into three component parts.it shields conduct if the defendant is a provider or user of an interactive computer service the claim is based on information provided by another information content provider and the claim would treat the defendant as the publisher or speaker of that information.lycos,at quoting c.the appellants do not allege that backpage fails to satisfy either of the first two elements instead,they confine themselves to the argument that their asserted causes of action do not treat backpage as the publisher or speaker of the contents of the advertisements through which they were trafficked.it is to this argument that we now turn.
the broad construction accorded to section as a whole has resulted in a capacious conception of what it means to treat a website operator as the publisher or speaker of information provided by a third party.courts have recognized that many causes of action might be premised on the publication or speaking of what one might call information content.barnes,cir.the ultimate question,though,does not depend on the form of the asserted cause of action rather,it depends on whether the cause of action necessarily requires that the defendant be treated as the publisher or speaker of content provided by another.see id.at.thus,courts have invoked the prophylaxis of section c in connection with a wide variety of causes of action,including housing discrimination,see chi.lawyers comm.for civil rights under law,craigslist,cir,negligence,see doe,at green am.online aol,cir,and securities fraud and cyberstalking,see lycos,at.
the appellants have an uphill climb the tvpra claims that they assert appear to treat backpage as the publisher or speaker of the content of the challenged advertisements.after all,the appellants acknowledge in their complaint that the contents of all of the relevant advertisements were provided either by their traffickers or by the appellants themselves under orders from their traffickers.since the appellants were trafficked by means of these advertisements,there would be no harm to them but for the content of the postings.
the appellants nonetheless insist that their allegations do not treat backpage as a publisher or speaker of content.they rest this hypothesis largely on the text of the tvpra civil remedy provision,which provides that victims may bring a civil suit against a perpetrator or whoever knowingly benefits,financially or by receiving anything of value from participation in a venture which that person knew or should have known has engaged in an act of sex trafficking.a see id.characterizing their allegations as describing an affirmative course of conduct by backpage distinct from the exercise of the traditional publishing or editorial functions protected under the cda,the appellants contend that this course of conduct amounts to participation in sex trafficking and,thus,can ground liability without treating backpage as the publisher or speaker of any of the underlying content.this contention comprises more cry than wool.
we begin with the appellants assertion that backpage activities do not involve traditional publishing or editorial functions,and are therefore outside the protective carapace of section c.in support,the complaint describes choices that backpage has made about the posting standards for advertisements for example,rules about which terms are permitted or not permitted in a posting,the lack of controls on the display of phone numbers,the option to anonymize addresses,the stripping of metadata from photographs uploaded to the website,the website reaction after a forbidden term is entered into an advertisement,and backpage acceptance of anonymous payments.the appellants submit that these choices are distinguishable from publisher functions.we disagree.
as an initial matter,some of the challenged practices most obviously,the choice of what words or phrases can be displayed on the site are traditional publisher functions under any coherent definition of the term.see zeran,at describing decisions about whether to publish,withdraw,postpone or alter content as traditional editorial functions.and after careful consideration,we are convinced that the publisher or speaker language of section c extends to the formulation of precisely the sort of website policies and practices that the appellants assail.
precedent cinches the matter.in lycos,we considered the argument that the prophylaxis of section c did not encompass decisions regarding the construct and operation of a defendant websites.at.there,the plaintiffs alleged that lycos permitted users to register under multiple screen names and provided links to objective financial information from a message board,thus enabling individuals to spread misinformation more credibly.id.at.we noted that,at bottom,the plaintiffs were ultimately alleging that the construct and operation of lycos web sites contributed to the proliferation of misinformation and held that as long as the cause of action is one that would treat the service provider as the publisher of a particular posting,immunity applies not only for the service provider decisions with respect to that posting,but also for its inherent decisions about how to treat postings generally.id.at.in short,lycos decision not to reduce misinformation by changing its web site policies was as much an editorial decision with respect to that misinformation as a decision not to delete a particular posting.id.
the case at hand fits comfortably within this construct.without exception,the appellants claims address the structure and operation of the backpage website,that is,backpage decisions about how to treat postings.those claims challenge features that are part and parcel of the overall design and operation of the website such as the lack of phone number verification,the rules about whether a person may post after attempting to enter a forbidden term,and the procedure for uploading photographs.features such as these,which reflect choices about what content can appear on the website and in what form,are editorial choices that fall within the purview of traditional publisher functions 
at oral argument in this court,the appellants placed particular emphasis on backpage provision of anonymization,forwarding,and storage services to posters.in the last analysis,however,the decision to provide such services and the parallel decision not to impose the same conditions on messaging services as are applied to escorts section postings are no less publisher choices,entitled to the protections of section c.
we add,moreover,that applying section c to shield backpage from liability here is congruent with the case law elsewhere.relying on that provision,courts have rejected claims that attempt to hold website operators liable for failing to provide sufficient protections to users from harmful content created by others.for instance,where a minor claimed to have been sexually assaulted by someone she met through the defendant website and her suit alleged that the website operator fail ed to implement basic safety measures to protect minors,the fifth circuit rejected the suit on the basis that the claims were merely another way of claiming that the website operator was liable for publishing the communications and they speak to the website operator role as a publisher of online content.doe,f d at.although the appellants try to distinguish doe by claiming backpage decisions about what measures to implement deliberately attempt to make sex trafficking easier,this is a distinction without a difference.whatever backpage motivations,those motivations do not alter the fact that the complaint premises liability on the decisions that backpage is making as a publisher with respect to content.
nor does the text of the tvpra civil remedy provision change this result.though a website conceivably might display a degree of involvement sufficient to render its operator both a publisher and a participant in a sex trafficking venture say,that the website operator helped to procure the underaged youths who were being trafficked,the facts pleaded in the second amended complaint do not appear to achieve this duality.but even if we assume,for argument sake,that backpage conduct amounts to participation in a sex trafficking venture a phrase that no published opinion has yet interpreted the tvpra claims as pleaded premise that participation on backpage actions as a publisher or speaker of content.the strictures of section c foreclose such suits 
contrary to the appellants importunings,the decision in barnes does not demand a different outcome.there,the ninth circuit concluded that a promissory estoppel claim based on a yahoo executive statements that the company would remove explicit photographs that had been posted online without the consent of the person depicted was not barred by section c.see barnes,at.withal,this promissory estoppel claim did not attempt to treat yahoo as the publisher or speaker of the photograph content but,instead,the claim sought to hold yahoo liable for its manifest intention to be legally obligated to do something that is,to delete the photographs.id.at.no comparable promise has been alleged here.
that ends this aspect of the matter.we hold that claims that a website facilitates illegal conduct through its posting rules necessarily treat the website as a publisher or speaker of content provided by third parties and,thus,are precluded by section c.this holding is consistent with,and reaffirms,the principle that a website operator decisions in structuring its website and posting requirements are publisher functions entitled to section c protection.
in this case,content is like banquo ghost it appears as an essential component of each and all of the appellants tvpra claims.because the appellants claims under the tvpra necessarily treat backpage as the publisher or speaker of content supplied by third parties,the district court did not err in dismissing those claims 
in an effort to shift the trajectory of the debate,the appellants try a pair of end runs.first,the appellants call our attention to section c,which provides that decisions made by website operators to block or remove content are protected from liability as long as they are made in good faith.building on this foundation,the appellants assert that the district court relied on backpage descriptions of its efforts to block and screen the postings in the escorts section of its website,and that those descriptions amount to an implicit invocation of section c.so,the appellants say,the district court should have allowed discovery into backpage good faith or lack of it in blocking and screening content.the district court refusal to allow them to pursue this course,they charge,eviscerates section c and renders it superfluous.
the appellants start from a faulty premise we do not read the district court opinion as relying on backpage assertions about its behavior.that backpage sought to respond to allegations of misconduct by among other things touting its efforts to combat sex trafficking does not,without more,invoke section c as a defense.
the appellants suggestion of superfluity is likewise misplaced.courts routinely have recognized that section c provides a set of independent protections for websites,see,barnes,at chi.lawyers,at batzel smith,cir,and nothing about the district court analysis is at odds with that conclusion.
next,the appellants suggest that their tvpra claims are saved by the operation of section e.that provision declares that section should not be construed to impair the enforcement of any federal criminal statute.the appellants posit that the tvpra civil suit provision is part of the enforcement of a federal criminal statute under the plain meaning of that term and,thus,outside the protections afforded by section c.this argument,though creative,does not withstand scrutiny.
we start with the uncontroversial premise that,where feasible,a statute should be construed in a way that conforms to the plain meaning of its text.in re jarvis,cir.the reading of section e reference to the enforcement of any federal criminal statute dictates a meaning opposite to that ascribed by the appellants such a reading excludes civil suits.see backpage.com,d at pointing out that the common definition of the term criminal,as well as its use in the context of section e,specifically excludes and is distinguished from civil claims quoting doe bates,cv df cmc,wl,at.other traditional tools of statutory construction reinforce this conclusion.although titles or captions may not be used to contradict a statute text,they can be useful to resolve textual ambiguities.see of trainmen balt.ohio,berniger meadow green wildcat,cir.here,the subsection title,n o effect on criminal law,quite clearly indicates that the provision is limited to criminal prosecutions.
it is equally telling that where congress wanted to include both civil and criminal remedies in cda provisions,it did so through broader language.for instance,section e states that the protections of section should not be construed to limit the application of the electronic communications privacy act of,a statute that contains both criminal penalties and civil remedies.see.preserving the application of this act contrasts with congress significantly narrower word choice in safeguarding the enforcement of federal criminal statutes.the normal presumption is that the employment of different words within the same statutory scheme is deliberate,so the terms ordinarily should be given differing meanings.see sosa alvarez machain.
this holding is entirely in keeping with the policies animating section e.congress made pellucid that it sought to ensure vigorous enforcement of federal criminal laws to deter and punish illicit activities online,b and this policy coexists comfortably with congress choice not to deter harmful online speech through the route of imposing tort liability on companies that serve as intermediaries for other parties potentially injurious messages,lycos,at omission in original quoting zeran,at.seen in this light,the distinctions between civil and criminal actions including the disparities in the standard of proof and the availability of prosecutorial discretion reflect a legislative judgment that it is best to avoid the potential chilling effects that private civil actions might have on internet free speech.
to say more about these attempted end runs would be pointless.they are futile,and do not cast the slightest doubt on our conclusion that the district court appropriately dismissed the appellants sex trafficking claims as barred by section c.
chapter claims.
we turn next to the appellants unfair trade practices claims.a massachusetts statute,familiarly known as chapter,creates a private right of action in favor of any individual who has been injured by another person use or employment of unfair or deceptive business practices.see.laws ch.the appellants chapter claims as framed on appeal target misrepresentations allegedly made by backpage to law enforcement and the ncmec regarding backpage efforts at.the district court jettisoned these claims,concluding that the causal chain alleged by the appellants was too speculative to fall as a matter of law within the penumbra of reasonabl e foreseeability,d at.
as this ruling hinges on the plausibility of the appellants allegations of causation,we first rehearse the plausibility standard.it is,of course,apodictic that a plaintiff must supply a short and plain statement of the claim showing that she is entitled to relief.a.although this requirement does not call for the pleading of exquisite factual detail,the complaint must allege enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.bell atl.twombly.
evaluating the plausibility of a complaint is a process.first,the court must separate the complaint factual allegations which must be accepted as true from its conclusory legal allegations which need not be credited.morales cruz of,cir.second,the court must determine whether the remaining facts allow it to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.id.quoting ashcroft iqbal,u.in carrying out this evaluation,the court must view the claim as a whole,instead of demanding a relationship between any single allegation and a necessary element of the cause of action.rodríguez reyes molina rodríguez,cir.
with this standard in mind,we proceed to the appellants assignment of error.to prevail on a chapter claim of this sort,the plaintiff must prove causation that is,the plaintiff is required to prove that the defendant unfair or deceptive act caused an adverse consequence or loss.rhodes aig domestic claims.this requirement entails showing both a causal connection between the deception and the loss and that the loss was foreseeable as a result of the deception.smith jenkins,cir quoting casavant norwegian cruise line.in other words,the plaintiff must lay the groundwork for findings of both actual and proximate causation.if an examination of the claim leads to the conclusion that it fails plausibly to allege a causal chain sufficient to ground an entitlement to relief,that claim is susceptible to dismissal under rule b.see ex rel.maddox elsevier,cir.
here,the second amended complaint attempts to forge the causal chain as follows backpage made a series of disingenuous representations to law enforcement officers and the ncmec regarding its supposed commitment to combating sex trafficking,including representations about technical changes to its website and its efforts to screen and monitor postings backpage neither kept these commitments nor made the technical changes that had been discussed instead,backpage engaged in a series of pretextual actions to generate the appearance of combating sex trafficking though it knew that these actions would not actually eliminate sex trafficking from the website this amalgam of misrepresentations and deceptive practices minimized and delayed any real scrutiny of what backpage was actually doing,thus allowing backpage to gain a dominant market share in the online advertising of sex trafficking and this sequence of events harmed the appellants by increasing their risk of being trafficked.
this causal chain is shot through with conjecture it pyramids speculative inference upon speculative inference.this rampant guesswork extends to the effect of the alleged misrepresentations on an indeterminate number of third parties,the real impact of backpage behavior on the overall marketplace for sex trafficking,and the odds that the appellants would not have been victimized had backpage been more forthright.
when all is said and done,it is apparent that the attenuated causal chain proposed by the appellants is forged entirely out of surmise.put another way,the causation element is backed only by the type of conclusory statement s that need not be credited at the rule b stage.maddox,at.charges hinting at machiavellian manipulation such as the charge that backpage communications with ncmec were simply an effort to create a diversion solidified its market position or the charge that backpage posting review program appears to be merely superficial can not serve as surrogates for facts.
to be sure,the complaint does plead a few hard facts.for example,it indicates that some meetings occurred involving backpage and the ncmec.it also indicates that backpage made some efforts albeit not the ones that the ncmec recommended to address sex trafficking.but beyond these scanty assertions,the complaint does not offer factual support for its attenuated causal analysis.
in an effort to plug this gaping hole,the appellants argue that in a chapter case the plausibility of causation should be tested at the pleading stage not by looking at facts but,rather,by employing common economic sense.bos.cab dispatch,uber,wl,at,accord katin real estate info,wl,at.yet,facts are the linchpin of plausibility and the cases that the appellants cite are inapposite.those cases involve competitors suing each other pursuant to section of chapter.this distinction is significant because although causation in section cases between competitors turns on the decisions of third parties customers,the causal chain between the unfair act and the harm to the plaintiff is much shorter and more direct than the chain that the appellants so laboriously attempt to construct.
the short of it is that the pertinent allegations in the second amended complaint are insufficient to remove the possibility of relief from the realm of mere conjecture.tambone,at.it follows inexorably that the district court did not err in dismissing the appellants chapter claims 
intellectual property claims.
this brings us to the appellants intellectual property claims.section provides that n othing in this section shall be construed to limit or expand any law pertaining to intellectual property.e.we assume,without deciding,that the appellants remaining claims come within the compass of this exception 
unauthorized use of pictures of a person.all of the appellants brought claims under state laws massachusetts rhode island guarding against the unauthorized use of a person picture.see.laws ch,laws.these nearly identical statutes,reprinted in relevant part in the margin confer private rights of action upon individuals whose images are used for commercial purposes without their consent.the appellants insist that backpage,by garnering advertising revenues from their traffickers,profited from the unauthorized use of their photographs.this fusillade is wide of the mark the statutes in question impose liability only upon persons or entities who deliberately use another image for commercial gain.as we explain below,backpage on the facts alleged here is not such an entity.
neither the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc nor the rhode island supreme court has confronted the exact scenario that is presented here.our task,then,is to make an informed determination of how each court would rule if it faced the question,taking into account analogous state decisions,cases from other jurisdictions,learned treatises,and relevant policy rationales.see andrew robinson int l,hartford fire ins,cir.here,the tea leaves are easy to read.
the sjc has articulated the key point in the following way the crucial distinction must be between situations in which the defendant makes an incidental use of the plaintiff name,portrait or picture and those in which the defendant uses the plaintiff name,portrait or picture deliberately to exploit its value for advertising or trade purposes.tropeano atl.monthly.exploitation for advertising or trade purposes requires that the use of the image be for the purpose of appropriating to the defendant benefit the commercial or other values associated with the name or likeness.id.quoting nelson me.times,me.so,too,the nearly identical rhode island statute requires a showing that by using the image the defendant commercially exploited the plaintiff without his permission.leddy narragansett television,accord mendonsa time.
the appellants argue that the use of their images can not be written off as incidental because their pictures were the centerpieces of commercial advertisements.but this argument misapprehends both the case law and the rationale that animates the underlying right.tropeano exemplifies the point.that case involved the publication of the plaintiff image to illustrate a magazine article in which she was not even mentioned.see n.at.the sjc concluded that this was an incidental use of the image,notwithstanding that the article and accompanying picture could be said to benefit the publisher.see id.at.the fact that the publisher was a business did not by itself transform the incidental publication of the plaintiff picture into an appropriation for advertising or trade purposes.id.
in our view,tropeano establishes that even a use leading to some profit for the publisher is not a use for advertising or trade purposes unless the use is designed to appropriat e to the defendant benefit the commercial or other values associated with the name or likeness.id.at quoting nelson,at.that is the rule in massachusetts,and we are confident that essentially the same rule prevails in rhode island.
here,there is no basis for an inference that backpage appropriated the commercial value of the appellants images.although backpage does profit from the sale of advertisements,it is not the entity that benefits from the misappropriation.a publisher like backpage is merely the conduit through which the advertising and publicity matter of customers is conveyed,cabaniss hipsley,and the party who actually benefits from the misappropriation is the advertiser.matters might be different if backpage had used the pictures to advertise its own services,see,but the appellants proffer no such claim.
basic policy considerations reinforce this result.there would be obviously deleterious consequences to a rule placing advertising media,such as newspapers,television stations,or websites,at risk of liability every time they sell an advertisement to a party who engages in misappropriation of another person likeness.given this verity,it is hardly surprising that the appellants have identified no case in which a publisher of an advertisement furnished by a third party has been held liable for a misappropriation present within it.the proper target of any suit for damages in such a situation must be the advertiser who increases his own business through the misappropriation in this case,the traffickers 
we need not tarry.on this understanding,we uphold the district court dismissal of the appellants claims under the aforementioned state statutes.
copyright.the last leg of our journey takes us to a singular claim of copyright infringement.shortly after the institution of suit,doe registered a copyright in one of the photographs used by her traffickers.in the second amended complaint,she included a claim for copyright infringement.the court below dismissed this claim,reasoning that it identified no redressable injury.see,d at.doe challenges this ruling.
assuming without deciding that backpage could be held liable for copyright infringement,the scope of doe potential recovery is limited by the fact that she did not register her copyright until december of after the instant action had been filed.by then,backpage was no longer displaying the copyrighted image.given the timing of these events,doe can not recover either statutory damages or attorneys fees under the copyright act.see johnson gordon,cir.any recovery would be restricted to compensatory damages under b,which permits a successful suitor to recover the actual damages suffered by her as a result of the infringement,and any profits of the infringer that are attributable to the infringement and are not taken into account in computing the actual damages.
the prospect of such a recovery,however,is purely theoretical nothing in the complaint raises a plausible inference that doe can recover any damages,or that discovery would reveal such an entitlement.see twombly,at stating that factual allegations must at least raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence to suffice as plausible.a showing of actual damages requires a plaintiff to prove that the infringement was the cause of her loss of revenue.data grumman.support,cir.such a loss is typically measured by assessing the diminution in a copyrighted work market value say,by calculating lost licensing fees.see bruce weekly world news,cir data,at.no facts set forth in the second amended complaint suggest that the market value of doe image has been affected in any way by the alleged infringement,and doe points to nothing that might plausibly support such an inference.
by the same token,nothing in the complaint plausibly suggests a basis for a finding that doe would be entitled to profits attributable to the infringement.the closest that the complaint comes is an optimistic assertion that because photographs enhance the effectiveness of advertisements,backpage necessarily reaps a financial benefit from these images including,presumably,doe photograph.but a generalized assertion that a profits from providing customers with the option to display photographs in advertisements,standing alone,can not plausibly be said to link the display of a particular image to some discrete portion of the profits.mackie rieser,cir concluding,at summary judgment,that the effect of including a photograph in an advertising brochure was too speculative to make out a triable issue on advertiser profits attributable to infringement.in short,the link that doe attempts to fashion between the copyrighted photograph and backpage revenues is wholly speculative and,thus,does not cross the plausibility threshold.after all,f actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.twombly,at.
in a last ditch effort to bell the cat,doe contends that the district court erred in failing to determine whether she was entitled to injunctive relief under a,which permits such relief to prevent or restrain infringement of a copyright.she says,in effect,that backpage may still possess the copyrighted photograph and that,therefore,she remains at risk of future infringement.we reject this contention.
to begin,the mere fact of past infringement does not entitle a plaintiff to permanent injunctive relief the plaintiff must also show a substantial likelihood of infringement in the future.harolds stores,dillard dep t stores,cir see melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright b a.nothing in the complaint suggests that there is any substantial likelihood of future infringement by backpage with respect to the copyrighted photograph.the known facts strongly suggest that no such risk exists the photograph was posted by a third party who no longer has any sway over doe,and backpage is not alleged to post material or create advertisements entirely of its own accord.thus,any fears of future infringement would appear to be unfounded.
viewing the complaint as a whole,see twombly,at,we conclude that the distinctive facts alleged here simply do not suffice to ground a finding that doe is plausibly entitled to any relief on her copyright claim.consequently,we discern no error in the district court dismissal of this claim.
iii.conclusion 
as a final matter,we add a coda.the appellants core argument is that backpage has tailored its website to make sex trafficking easier.aided by the amici,the appellants have made a persuasive case for that proposition.but congress did not sound an uncertain trumpet when it enacted the cda,and it chose to grant broad protections to internet publishers.showing that a website o
