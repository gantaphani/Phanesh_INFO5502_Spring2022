held section a registration requirement is a precondition to filing a copyright infringement claim.a copyright holder failure to comply with that requirement does not restrict a federal court jurisdiction over infringement claims involving unregistered works.
a jurisdiction refers to a court adjudicatory authority,kontrick ryan.thus,jurisdictional properly applies only to prescriptions delineating the classes of cases jurisdiction and the persons personal jurisdiction implicating that authority.ibid.because the distinction between jurisdictional conditions and rules can be confusing in practice,federal courts and litigants should use the term jurisdictional only when it is apposite.ibid.a statutory requirement is considered jurisdictional if congress clearly states that it count s as jurisdictional a condition not rank ed as such should be treated as nonjurisdictional in character.arbaugh y h.in arbaugh,the court held that the coverage requirement of title vii of the civil rights act of was not a jurisdictional requirement because the provision did not clearly stat e that the numerosity rule counted as jurisdictional,this court prior title vii cases did not compel the conclusion that the rule nonetheless was jurisdictional,and the requirement location in a provision separate from title vii section indicated that congress had not ranked the rule as jurisdictional.
b like the title vii numerosity requirement in arbaugh,a does not clearly stat e that its registration requirement is jurisdictional.at.although a last sentence contains the word jurisdiction,that sentence speaks to a court adjudicatory authority to determine a copyright claim registrability and says nothing about whether a federal court has jurisdiction to adjudicate claims for infringement of unregistered works.moreover,a registration requirement,like title vii requirement,is located in a provision separate from those granting federal courts jurisdiction over those respective claims,and no other factor suggests that a registration requirement can be read to speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts,ibid.this conclusion is not affected by the fact that the requirement in arbaugh was considered an element of a title vii claim rather than a prerequisite to initiating a lawsuit.see zipes trans world airlines.
c a contrary result is not required by bowles russell.there,in finding that congress had ranked as jurisdictional requirement that parties in a civil action file a notice of appeal within days of the judgment,this court analyzed specific language and the historical treatment accorded to that type of limitation.that analysis is consistent with the arbaugh framework because context is relevant to whether a statute rank s a requirement as jurisdictional.
d the court declines to apply judicial estoppel to affirm the second circuit judgment vacating the settlement.while some of petitioners arguments below are in tension with those made in this court,accepting their arguments here does not create the type of inconsistent court determinations in their favor that estoppel is meant to address.see new hampshire maine.
e because a does not restrict a federal court jurisdiction,this court need not address the question whether the district court had authority to approve the settlement under the second circuit erroneous reading of.the court also declines to decide whether a registration requirement is a mandatory precondition to suit that district courts may or should enforce sua sponte by dismissing copyright infringement claims involving unregistered works.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 
justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court.
subject to certain exceptions,the copyright act act requires copyright holders to register their works before suing for copyright infringement.a supp.in this case,the court of appeals for the second circuit held that a copyright holder failure to comply with a registration requirement deprives a federal court of jurisdiction to adjudicate his copyright infringement claim.we disagree.section a registration requirement is a precondition to filing a claim that does not restrict a federal court jurisdiction.
the constitution grants congress the power t o promote the progress of science and useful arts,by securing for limited times to authors the exclusive right to their writings.art.i,cl.exercising this power,congress has crafted a comprehensive statutory scheme governing the existence and scope of c opyright protection for original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression.a.this scheme gives copyright owners the exclusive rights with specified statutory exceptions to distribute,reproduce,or publicly perform their works.anyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner as provided in the act is an infringer of the copyright.a.when such infringement occurs,a copyright owner is entitled,subject to the requirements of section,to institute an action for copyright infringement.b emphasis added.
this case concerns the requirements of section to which b refers.section a provides,inter alia and with certain exceptions,that no civil action for infringement of the copyright in any united states work shall be instituted until preregistration or registration of the copyright claim has been made in accordance with this title.this provision is part of the act remedial scheme.it establishes a condition copyright registration that plaintiffs ordinarily must satisfy before filing an infringement claim and invoking the act remedial provisions.we address whether a also deprives federal courts of jurisdiction to adjudicate infringement claims involving unregistered works.
the relevant proceedings in this case began after we issued our opinion in new york times tasini.in tasini,we agreed with the court of appeals for the second circuit that several owners of online databases and print publishers had infringed the copyrights of six freelance authors by reproducing the authors works electronically without first securing their permission.see,at.in so holding,we affirmed the principal theory of liability underlying copyright infringement suits that other freelance authors had filed after the court of appeals had issued its opinion in tasini.these other suits,which were stayed pending our decision in tasini,resumed after we issued our opinion and were consolidated in the united states district court for the southern district of new york by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation.
the consolidated complaint alleged that the named plaintiffs each own at least one copyright,typically in a freelance article written for a newspaper or a magazine,that they had registered in accordance with a.the class,however,included both authors who had registered their copyrighted works and authors who had not.see app.
because of the growing size and complexity of the lawsuit,the district court referred the parties to mediation.for more than three years,the freelance authors,the publishers and their insurers,and the electronic databases and their insurers negotiated.finally,in march,they reached a settlement agreement that the parties intended to achieve a global peace in the publishing industry.in re literary works in electronic databases copyright litigation.
the parties moved the district court to certify a class for settlement and to approve the settlement agreement.ten freelance authors,including irvin muchnick hereinafter muchnick respondents,objected.the district court overruled the objections certified a settlement class of freelance authors under federal rules of civil procedure a and b approved the settlement as fair,reasonable,and adequate under rule e and entered final judgment.at no time did the muchnick respondents or any other party urge the district court to dismiss the case,or to refuse to certify the class or approve the settlement,for lack of jurisdiction.
the muchnick respondents appealed,renewing their objections to the settlement on procedural and substantive grounds.shortly before oral argument,the court of appeals sua sponte ordered briefing on the question whether a deprives federal courts of jurisdiction over infringement claims involving unregistered copyrights.all parties filed briefs asserting that the district court had jurisdiction to approve the settlement agreement even though it included unregistered works.
relying on two circuit precedents holding that a registration requirement was jurisdictional,see,at citing toy goffa int l,morris business concepts,the court of appeals concluded that the district court lacked jurisdiction to certify a class of claims arising from the infringement of unregistered works,and also lacked jurisdiction to approve a settlement with respect to those claims,at citing widespread agreement among the circuits that section a is jurisdictional 
judge walker dissented.he concluded that a is more like the nonjurisdictional requirement in arbaugh y h,than the jurisdictional statutory time limit in bowles russell,at.accordingly,he reasoned that a registration requirement does not limit federal jurisdiction over infringement suits involving unregistered works.ibid.
we granted the owners and publishers petition for a writ of certiorari,and formulated the question presented to ask whether a restricts the jurisdiction of the federal courts over copyright infringement actions.because no party supports the court of appeals jurisdictional holding,we appointed an amicus curiae to defend the court of appeals judgment.we now reverse.
jurisdiction refers to a court adjudicatory authority.kontrick ryan.accordingly,the term jurisdictional properly applies only to prescriptions delineating the classes of cases jurisdiction and the persons personal jurisdiction implicating that authority.see also steel citizens for better environment,jurisdiction refers to the courts statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate the case emphasis in original landgraf usi film products,j urisdictional statutes speak to the power of the court rather than to the rights or obligations of the parties quoting republic nat.bank of miami united states,thomas,concurring.
while perhaps clear in theory,the distinction between jurisdictional conditions and rules can be confusing in practice.courts including this court have sometimes mischaracterized rules or elements of a cause of action as jurisdictional limitations,particularly when that characterization was not central to the case,and thus did not require close analysis.see arbaugh,supra,at citing examples steel,at same.our recent cases evince a marked desire to curtail such jurisdictional rulings,which too easily can miss the critical difference s between true jurisdictional conditions and nonjurisdictional limitations on causes of action,kontrick,supra,at see also arbaugh,at.
in light of the important distinctions between jurisdictional prescriptions and rules,see,at,we have encouraged federal courts and litigants to facilitat e clarity by using the term jurisdictional only when it is apposite,kontrick,supra,at.in arbaugh,we described the general approach to distinguish jurisdictional conditions from requirements or elements of a claim 
if the legislature clearly states that a threshold limitation on a statute scope shall count as jurisdictional,then courts and litigants will be duly instructed and will not be left to wrestle with the issue.but when congress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional,courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character.at citation and footnote omitted.
the plaintiff in arbaugh brought a claim under title vii of the civil rights act of,which makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate,inter alia,on the basis of sex.a.but employees can bring title vii claims only against employers that have fifteen or more employees.b.arbaugh addressed whether that employee numerosity requirement affects jurisdiction or,instead,delineates a substantive ingredient of a title vii claim for relief.at.we held that it does the latter.
our holding turned principally on our examination of the text of b,the section in which title vii numerosity requirement appears.section b does not clearly stat e that the employee numerosity threshold on title vii scope count s as jurisdictional.at,and.and nothing in our prior title vii cases compelled the conclusion that even though the numerosity requirement lacks a clear jurisdictional label,it nonetheless imposed a jurisdictional limit.see,at.similarly,b text and structure did not demonstrate that congress rank ed that requirement as jurisdictional.see,at.as we observed,the employee numerosity requirement is located in a provision separate from f,title vii section,distinguishing it from the threshold ingredient of jurisdiction in under.arbaugh,at.accordingly,the numerosity requirement could not fairly be read to speak in jurisdictional terms or in any way refer to the jurisdiction of the district courts.at quoting zipes trans world airlines.we thus refrain ed from construing the numerosity requirement to constric t or title vii jurisdictional provision.arbaugh,supra,at internal quotation marks omitted.
we now apply this same approach to a.
section a provides 
except for an action brought for a violation of the rights of the author under section a,and subject to the provisions of subsection b,no civil action for infringement of the copyright in any united states work shall be instituted until preregistration or registration of the copyright claim has been made in accordance with this title.in any case,however,where the deposit,application,and fee required for registration have been delivered to the copyright office in proper form and registration has been refused,the applicant is entitled to institute a civil action for infringement if notice thereof,with a copy of the complaint,is served on the register of copyrights.the register may,at his or her option,become a party to the action with respect to the issue of registrability of the copyright claim by entering an appearance within sixty days after such service,but the register failure to become a party shall not deprive the court of jurisdiction to determine that issue.
we must consider whether a clearly states that its registration requirement is jurisdictional.arbaugh,supra,at.it does not.amicus disagrees,pointing to the presence of the word jurisdiction in the last sentence of a and contending that the use of the term there indicates the jurisdictional cast of a first sentence as well.brief for amicus curiae in support of judgment below hereinafter amicus brief.but this reference to jurisdiction can not bear the weight that amicus places upon it.the sentence upon which amicus relies states 
the register of copyrights may,at his or her option,become a party to the copyright infringement action with respect to the issue of registrability of the copyright claim by entering an appearance within sixty days after such service,but the register failure to become a party shall not deprive the court of jurisdiction to determine that issue.a emphasis added.
congress added this sentence to the act in,stat,to clarify that a federal court can determine the issue of registrability of the copyright claim even if the register does not appear in the infringement suit.that clarification was necessary because courts had interpreted a precursor provision which imposed a similar registration requirement,as prohibiting copyright owners who had been refused registration by the register of copyrights from suing for infringement until the owners first sought mandamus against the register.see vacheron coultre watches,benrus watch,construing a precursor.the amendment made it clear that a federal court plainly has adjudicatory authority to determine that issue,a emphasis added,the issue of registrability regardless of whether the register is a party to the infringement suit.the word jurisdiction,as used here,thus says nothing about whether a federal court has jurisdiction to adjudicate claims for infringement of unregistered works.
moreover,a registration requirement,like title vii numerosity requirement,is located in a provision separate from those granting federal courts jurisdiction over those respective claims.see arbaugh,supra,at.federal district courts have jurisdiction over copyright infringement actions based on and.but neither,which confers jurisdiction over questions of federal law,nor a,which is specific to copyright claims,conditions its jurisdictional grant on whether copyright holders have registered their works before suing for infringement.arbaugh,supra,at title vii jurisdictional provision does not specif y any threshold ingredient akin to monetary floor 
nor does any other factor suggest that a registration requirement can be read to speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts.arbaugh,at quoting zipes,at.first,and most significantly,a expressly allows courts to adjudicate infringement claims involving unregistered works in three circumstances where the work is not a work,where the infringement claim concerns rights of attribution and integrity under,or where the holder attempted to register the work and registration was refused.separately,c permits courts to adjudicate infringement actions over certain kinds of unregistered works where the author declare s an intention to secure copyright in the work and makes registration for the work,if required by subsection a,within three months after the work first transmission.c.it would be at least unusual to ascribe jurisdictional significance to a condition subject to these sorts of exceptions 
that the numerosity requirement in arbaugh could be considered an element of a title vii claim,rather than a prerequisite to initiating a lawsuit,does not change this conclusion,as our decision in zipes demonstrates.zipes upon which arbaugh relied held that title vii requirement that claimants timely file a discrimination charge with the eeoc before filing a civil action in federal court was nonjurisdictional.see,at f establishing specific time periods within which a discrimination claimant must file a lawsuit after filing a charge with the eeoc.a statutory condition that requires a party to take some action before filing a lawsuit is not automatically a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit.zipes,at emphasis added.rather,the jurisdictional analysis must focus on the legal character of the requirement,at,which we discerned by looking to the condition text,context,and relevant historical treatment,at see also national railroad passenger corporation morgan.we similarly have treated as nonjurisdictional other types of threshold requirements that claimants must complete,or exhaust,before filing a lawsuit 
the registration requirement in a fits in this mold.section a imposes a precondition to filing a claim that is not clearly labeled jurisdictional,is not located in a provision,and admits of congressionally authorized exceptions.see a c.section a thus imposes a type of precondition to suit that supports nonjurisdictional treatment under our precedents.
amicus insists that our decision in bowles,compels a conclusion contrary to the one we reach today.amicus cites bowles for the proposition that where congress did not explicitly label a statutory condition as jurisdictional,a court nevertheless should treat it as such if that is how the condition consistently has been interpreted and if congress has not disturbed that interpretation.amicus brief.specifically,amicus relies on a footnote in bowles to argue that here,as in bowles,it would be improper to characterize the statutory condition as nonjurisdictional because doing so would override a century worth of precedent treating a registration requirement as jurisdictional.amicus brief quoting bowles,supra,at.this argument focuses on the result in bowles,rather than on the analysis we employed.
bowles did not hold that any statutory condition devoid of an express jurisdictional label should be treated as jurisdictional simply because courts have long treated it as such.nor did it hold that all statutory conditions imposing a time limit should be considered jurisdictional rather,bowles stands for the proposition that context,including this court interpretation of similar provisions in many years past,is relevant to whether a statute ranks a requirement as jurisdictional.
in bowles,we considered,which requires parties in a civil action to file a notice of appeal within days of the judgment being appealed,and rule of the federal rules of appellate procedure,which carries into practice.at.after analyzing specific language and this court historical treatment of the type of limitation imposes,statutory deadlines for filing appeals,we concluded that congress had ranked the statutory condition as jurisdictional.our focus in bowles on the historical treatment of statutory conditions for taking an appeal is thus consistent with the arbaugh framework.indeed,bowles emphasized that this court had long treated such conditions as jurisdictional,including in statutes other than,and specifically in statutes that predated the creation of the courts of appeals.see,at,and.
bowles therefore demonstrates that the relevant question here is not as amicus puts it whether a itself has long been labeled jurisdictional,but whether the type of limitation that a imposes is one that is properly ranked as jurisdictional absent an express designation.the statutory limitation in bowles was of a type that we had long held did speak in jurisdictional terms even absent a jurisdictional label,and nothing about text or context,or the historical treatment of that type of limitation,justified a departure from this view.that was not the case,however,for the types of conditions in zipes and arbaugh.
here,that same analysis leads us to conclude that a does not implicate the jurisdiction of federal courts.although a historical treatment as jurisdictional is a factor in the analysis,it is not dispositive.the other factors discussed above demonstrate that a registration requirement is more analogous to the nonjurisdictional conditions we considered in zipes and arbaugh than to the statutory time limit at issue in bowles we thus conclude that a registration requirement is nonjurisdictional,notwithstanding its prior jurisdictional treatment 
amicus argues that even if a is nonjurisdictional,we should nonetheless affirm on estoppel grounds the court of appeals judgment vacating the district court order approving the settlement and dismissing the case.according to amicus,petitioners asserted previously in these proceedings that copyright registration was jurisdictional,and this assertion should estop them from now asserting a right to waive objections to the authors failure to register.amicus urges us to prevent the parties from playing fast and loose with the courts by deliberately changing positions according to the exigencies of the moment.amicus brief quoting new hampshire maine.
we agree that some statements in the parties submissions to the district court and the court of appeals are in tension with their a
