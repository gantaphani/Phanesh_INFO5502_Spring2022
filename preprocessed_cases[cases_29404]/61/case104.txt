congress has delegated exclusive authority over broadcasting licensure matters to the federal communications commission fcc or commission.that authority includes wide discretion in granting,revoking,conditioning,and extending licenses in furtherance of the public interest.this case arises in part because of the fcc inordinate delay in exercising that authority.tribune television company tribune currently owns a daily newspaper and two television stations in the hartford,connecticut area.without an fcc waiver,tribune is in violation of the fcc rule.tribune previously received several temporary waivers and had applied for a permanent waiver,but,after the last temporary waiver had expired and while tribune application for the permanent waiver was pending,plaintiff neil ellis ellis,a resident,brought suit under b.ellis contends that,although the fcc granted tribune a temporary waiver,the fcc nonetheless mandated tribune eventual compliance with the rule.
although we are sympathetic to ellis frustration in the face of agency inaction,we believe that the district assuming that it had the authority to enforce the fcc previous orders under b acted prematurely in not allowing the fcc to decide tribune pending waiver request.the district court decision involved a substantial danger of establishing inconsistent rulings a danger that later became a reality on an issue squarely within the agency expertise and discretion.consequently,we conclude that the district court erred in failing to dismiss or stay this action and to refer the matter to the fcc under the primary jurisdiction doctrine.we therefore vacate the district court judgment and remand the case with directions to dismiss.
background 
tribune licensing troubles result from its simultaneous ownership of one daily newspaper and two television stations in the same designated market area dma.tribune owned one television,channel fox in hartford,connecticut,while managing another television,channel upn in waterbury,connecticut.tribune managed wtxx pursuant to a management services agreement with counterpoint communications counterpoint.on november,tribune submitted an application to the fcc seeking to permit the transfer of tiberius broadcasting,tiberius,the licensee of wtxx,to tribune.the transfer would result in tribune simultaneously owning two televisions stations in the same dma and would therefore bring tribune in conflict with b the television duopoly rule.the television duopoly rule permits the simultaneous ownership of two television stations in a dma only under certain conditions specified by regulation tribune november application sought a waiver of the television duopoly rule 
while tribune application was pending,tribune acquired the times mirror company times mirror on june.times mirror owned the hartford courant,and consequently,tribune acquisition of times mirror put tribune in violation of a second fcc regulation,d the rule or rule.the rule,which the fcc originally promulgated in,see in the matter of amendment of sections,and of the commission rules relating to multiple ownership of standard,fm,and television broad.stations,wl amendment,recon.granted in part,wl,prohibits among other things the simultaneous ownership of a daily newspaper and a television station in the same dma under most circumstances in this case,tribune simultaneous ownership of the hartford courant and wtxx violated the rule because wtxx station signal encompass es the entire community in which the newspaper is published.id.d.
tribune common ownership of wtxx and the hartford its common ownership of wtic and the hartford tribune to comply immediately with the fcc rule or to seek a waiver of that rule.an existing television station licensee that acquires a daily newspaper in the same market may retain both the station and the newspaper until the end of the station license terms.see amendment,at.thus,tribune is able to retain the hartford courant and wtic at least until april,the renewal date of wtic license.however,because tribune did not own wtxx at the time it acquired the hartford courant,fcc regulations required tribune to comply immediately with the rule as it applied to wtxx.as a result,on june,tribune filed an amendment to its earlier,november fcc application and requested a waiver to comply with the rule.
in an order dated august,the fcc granted tribune request to transfer control of tiberius to tribune,granted tribune a permanent waiver from the television duopoly rule,and granted tribune a rather than a waiver to comply with the rule.see in re application of counterpoint commc ns,transferor tribune television transferee,wl order.the commission,noting that tribune application was unopposed,id.at,concluded that granting tribune a temporary period to come into compliance with the rule is appropriate,id.at.the fcc believed that t he temporary loss of diversity in the hartford market during this period due to tribune common ownership of wtic and wtxx and the hartford courant will be outweighed by the benefits of permitting an orderly sale of media properties to a qualified buyer that will preserve these stations as media voices in the market.id.at.the fcc announced that it nevertheless expect ed tribune to exercise its best efforts to sell the necessary assets to come into compliance with the rule.id.
the fcc granted tribune another extension in an order dated february.see in re application of counterpoint commc ns,transferor tribune televison transferee,wl order.the fcc noted that tribune had received no proposals for the purchase of wtxx within the previous six months,that tribune had continued its investment in wtxx physical plant and equipment,and that tribune continued its efforts to sell the station.id.at.thus,the fcc concluded that tribune had demonstrated that it had exercised its best efforts to achieve compliance with the multiple ownership rules.id.at.in according tribune an additional waiver,the commission emphasized that it expected tribune to continue to exercise its best efforts and to expand its current efforts if needed to sell the necessary assets to come into compliance.id.accordingly,the fcc mandated that tribune report the progress of those efforts to the commission every requirement with which tribune has consistently complied.id.
with the second waiver period due to expire on august,tribune submitted a timely request,in which tribune sought a permanent waiver or,in the alternative,another temporary waiver for a reasonable period of time.see application of counterpoint commc ns tribune television,file no,facility id,request for waiver filed,permanent waiver request.tribune indicated that it had been unable to sell wtxx despite its best efforts,that the financial condition of wtxx had not improved significantly,and that,if the fcc were to order tribune to divest wtxx,the station could face the possibility of going dark.tribune further asserted that special circumstances warranted a permanent waiver of the rule namely,tribune selling wtxx to an independent owner was infeasible,tribune continuing to own wtxx would not hinder competition or diversity,and tribune investing in wtxx would continue to improve the station programming,facilities,and operations.
the august,deadline came and went without a commission response to tribune permanent waiver request.approximately nine months later,on may,resident neil ellis filed a complaint pursuant to b in the united states district court for the district of connecticut ellis claimed that,since august,tribune had been in violation of the fcc order.he asked the district court to enter an enforcement order declaring tribune to be in violation of the order,enjoining tribune from further disobedience of that order,and requiring tribune to divest wtxx immediately in order to comply with the rule.ellis contended that he,as well as the general public,had been injured by the lack of diversity and competition within the haven dma and that this injury was a direct result of tribune disobedience of the order.on may,ellis moved for summary judgment.
while ellis summary judgment motion was pending,the commission eliminated the rule and promulgated a new rule under this revised rule,tribune simultaneous ownership of the hartford courant,wtxx,and wtic would have been permissible even without a waiver.on july,tribune moved to dismiss ellis complaint.tribune argued that the declaratory and injunctive relief sought by ellis was rendered moot by the fcc issuance of the revised rule that the factual and legal issues involved in this case were not ripe because the fcc had not yet acted upon tribune permanent waiver request and that the primary jurisdiction doctrine required dismissal in light of the administrative proceedings pending before the fcc 
while the commission promulgation of the revised rule might have been determinative,that rule never took effect.in prometheus radio project fcc,cir,cert.denied,d,the third circuit stayed the fcc from implementing the revised rule and remanded the case to the fcc to justify or modify its approach.the third circuit concluded 
though we affirm much of the commission order,we have identified several provisions in which the commission falls short of its obligation to justify its decisions to retain,repeal,or modify its media ownership regulations with reasoned analysis.the commission derivation of new limits,and its modification of the numerical limits on both television and radio station ownership in local markets,all have the same essential flaw an unjustified assumption that media outlets of the same type make an equal contribution to diversity and competition in local markets.we thus remand for the commission to justify or modify its approach to setting numerical limits the stay currently in effect will continue pending our review of the commission action on remand,over which this panel retains jurisdiction 
id.at footnote omitted.on july,tribune filed a motion with the third circuit requesting that the court reverse its decision to stay implementation of the revised rule.the third circuit denied that motion.
on march,the united states district court for the district of connecticut droney,denied tribune motion to dismiss and granted ellis motion for summary judgment.see ellis tribune tv,d.in rejecting tribune motion to dismiss,the district court found that the fcc repeal of the rule,d,did not render ellis action moot,see ellis,d at that ellis action was ripe for adjudication,see id.at and that dismissal of ellis action under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction was not warranted,see id.at.
in analyzing tribune primary jurisdiction argument,the district court applied this court test,which examines i the area of the agency expertise,ii the scope of the agency discretion,iii the danger of inconsistent rulings,and iv the existence of prior applications to the agency.see id.at citations omitted.the district court found that the fcc has never indicated that there was any ambiguity to its order,that further is necessary or that there are any technical questions remaining in regards to tribune ownership of the various media outlets in connecticut.id.at.the court then found that the agency discretion would be minimal because the question presented in this case is straightforward whether tribune is in compliance with the order and the fcc consistently has indicated that tribune is in violation of its rules.id.the district court also asserted that there is no substantial danger of inconsistent rulings because this action is focused on the particular situation faced by tribune in connecticut and the fcc order is limited to tribune situation.id.finally,the court noted that tribune clearly has made prior applications to the fcc.id.
having rejected tribune motion to dismiss,the district court granted summary judgment for ellis.the court concluded that ellis had established every element necessary for enforcing an order under b.the court found that the order constitutes a valid order for purposes of b because that order makes clear that tribune acquisition of wtxx violated the rule,and that the fcc was requiring tribune to come into compliance with that rule.ellis,d at.the court determined that the order was regularly made and duly served within the meaning of b because tribune participated in the proceedings leading up to that order,and tribune undertook various measures to relieve itself from the burdens imposed by that order.id.at.the district court also found that tribune was in violation of the order because the fcc two extensions were only temporary waivers and that tribune was comply with the order and rule.id.finally,the district court concluded that ellis is an injured person under b because the fcc already ha d found that tribune ownership of wtxx,wtic and the hartford courant would negatively affect diversity and competition within the hartford media exact injury alleged by ellis.id.at.the district court thus declared that tribune was in violation of the and orders and had been in violation of the fcc rule,d,since august.the court ordered tribune to forthwith come into compliance with the rule as required by the and orders.ellis,d at.tribune moved for a stay of the district court judgment on april.
on april,while tribune motion was still pending,the a delay of over two and issued an order in response to tribune permanent waiver request.see in the matter of counterpoint commc ns,transferor tribune televison transferee,wl order.the fcc order rejected tribune request for a permanent waiver.see id.at.however,the order extended tribune previously granted waiver until the date of the next renewal of the wtxx and wtic licenses,thereby allowing tribune to continue to own wtxx,wtic,and the hartford courant until early see id.at.the fcc found that the public interest benefits that will result from tribune continued common ownership of wtxx through the station current license term outweigh any potential harm to the underlying goals of the rule.id.at.the commission concluded that,in light of the evidence concerning tribune efforts to sell wtxx,tribune clear record of enhancing and expanding the station service to the public,and the significant risk that requiring immediate divestiture would severely curtail that service or eliminate it altogether,granting a temporary extension to allow tribune to continue its efforts to comply with the rule was warranted id.at.
on april,the district court held a hearing to examine the effect of the fcc order on tribune april,motion for a stay pending appeal.on april,the district court granted tribune motion.on the previous day,tribune had moved for relief from judgment under rule b.see.b.that rule b motion remains pending before the district court.on april,tribune filed a notice of appeal with this court.
tribune,ellis,and the fcc as amicus curiae raise a number of issues on appeal.the parties dispute whether b provides a statutory basis for the district court order whether tribune has in fact violated the fcc order whether ellis has standing under b and article iii whether the district court should have referred this matter to the fcc under the primary jurisdiction doctrine whether this action was ripe for review and whether the fcc order rendered this action moot.for the reasons discussed below,we hold that the district court erred in failing to refer this case in the first instance to the fcc under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction we therefore vacate the district court judgment and remand this matter to the district court with directions to dismiss.
discussion 
jurisdictional prerequisites 
article iii of the constitution requires us to address the issues of standing,ripeness,and mootness.see poe ullman,d.we believe that the district court correctly concluded that ellis suit satisfied each of these constitutional prerequisites.first,ellis established article iii standing because he is a resident who suffered an less diverse and less competitive media was directly traceable to tribune common ownership of wtxx and the hartford courant.second,ellis claim was ripe because,although tribune had submitted a timely waiver extension request,the waiver period had ended on august,and the fcc failed to take any action or give any official indication,until the order,that it would take action to either enforce or supercede its and orders.third,tribune did not establish that ellis action was moot based on the fcc revised rule an argument that tribune no longer presses on appeal because,as noted above,the third circuit stayed the implementation of the revised rule.
on appeal,the tribune assert an alternative mootness argument based on the fcc order.tribune has not waived this alternative theory even though it has not been decided below because t he condition of mootness is not a defense that could be waived.lamar adver.of penn,llc town of orchard park,cir quoting fox bd.of trustees,cir.however,we decline to address tribune alternative mootness theory,not only or even primarily because tribune rule b motion for relief from judgment is based on this argument and remains pending before the district court,but also because tribune mootness argument is intertwined with the merits of the primary jurisdiction issue.
specifically,if the doctrine of primary jurisdiction required the district court to refer this matter to the fcc,then the fcc certainly would have had the authority to issue its order or a similar order at an earlier date.on the other hand,if the doctrine of primary jurisdiction did not require an fcc referral,then it is unclear and the parties vigorously dispute whether the fcc would have had the authority to issue the order.town of deerfield fcc,cir holding that the fcc policy of declining to become involved in a preemption controversy until after article iii court proceedings was unconstitutional because,in effect,such a policy would convert article iii decisions into mere advisory opinions.here,because mootness and primary jurisdiction are intertwined under the unique circumstances of this case,and because the district court primary jurisdiction determination occurred in while the fcc order could have only potentially rendered this matter moot in,we deem it necessary to address first the issue of primary jurisdiction 
ii.primary jurisdiction 
the doctrine of primary jurisdiction is concerned with promoting proper relationships between the courts and administrative agencies charged with particular regulatory duties.united states pac,d.the doctrine central aim is to allocate initial decisionmaking responsibility between courts and agencies and to ensure that they do not work at.fulton cogeneration assocs.niagara mohawk power,cir.whether there should be judicial forbearance hinges therefore on the authority congress delegated to the agency in the legislative scheme.golden hill paugussett tribe of indians weicker,cir citing ricci chicago mercantile,d see also mv nedlloyd,cir noting that the doctrine applies when congress has entrusted the regulation of certain subject matter under a statute to an administrative agency.recourse to the doctrine of primary jurisdiction is thus appropriate whenever enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues which,under a regulatory scheme,have been placed within the special competence of an administrative body.pac,at.
the rationale behind the doctrine includes a concern for maintaining uniformity in the regulation of an area entrusted to a federal agency,see texas pac.ry.abilene cotton oil,as well as a desire for utilizing administrative expertise,see great ry.merchants elevator.as the supreme court has stated 
uniformity and consistency in the regulation of business entrusted to a particular agency are secured,and the limited functions of review by the judiciary are more rationally exercised,by preliminary resort for ascertaining and interpreting the circumstances underlying legal issues to agencies that are better equipped than courts by specialization,by insight gained through experience,and by more flexible procedure.
far conference united states.overall,the doctrine seeks to produce better informed and uniform legal rulings by allowing courts to take advantage of an agency specialized knowledge,expertise,and central position within the regulatory regime.pharm.research mfrs.of am.walsh,d breyer,concurring citing pac,at.the relevant inquiry is 
whether a case raises issues of fact not within the conventional experience of judges,but within the purview of an agency responsibilities whether the limited functions of review by the judiciary are more rationally exercised,by preliminary resort to an agency better equipped than courts to resolve an issue in the first instance or,in a word,whether preliminary reference of issues to the agency will promote that proper working relationship between court and agency that the primary jurisdiction doctrine seeks to facilitate.
id.quoting far conference,at.the question in determining whether application of the doctrine is appropriate in every case,therefore,is whether the reasons for the existence of the doctrine are present and whether the purposes it serves will be aided by its application in the particular litigation.pac,at.
no fixed formula exists for applying the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.pac,at.louis jaffe,primary jurisdiction,harv,noting that the doctrine of primary jurisdiction can not be stated in the form of a rule in terms either of its analytic structure or of its incidence.while a nalysis is on a basis,at,our inquiry has generally focused on four factors 
whether the question at issue is within the conventional experience of judges or whether it involves technical or policy considerations within the agency particular field of expertise 
whether the question at issue is particularly within the agency discretion 
whether there exists a substantial danger of inconsistent rulings and 
whether a prior application to the agency has been made.
see commc ns ass n,v.at t,cir.we have noted as well that t he court must also balance the advantages of applying the doctrine against the potential costs resulting from complications and delay in the administrative proceedings.id.at citing ricci,at.
tribune contends that the doctrine of primary jurisdiction required the district court to stay or dismiss ellis suit because determinations surrounding whether a license should be divested and the conditions attached to licenses unquestionably are committed to the fcc.tribune notes that the risk of inconsistent rulings was all but certain and became an accomplished fact.likewise,the fcc argues that n ot only was this a subject particularly within the special expertise and discretion of the fcc,but,contrary to the d istrict c ourt conclusion,there was a substantial danger of inconsistent rulings because this was an open proceeding before the agency in light of tribune pending request for further extension of the waiver.in response,ellis argues that the district court properly applied this circuit test.ellis also asserts that c onstant deference to administrative agencies would contravene congress intent in enacting this statute as well as impinge on the role of the judiciary.after reviewing the nature of the questions at issue,the scope of the agency discretion,the risk of inconsistent rulings,and the existence of prior applications,we conclude that the four factors weigh heavily in favor of recognizing the fcc primary jurisdiction and that,as a result,the district court erred in not referring this matter to the commission 
a.the nature of the agency expertise 
the district court decision addresses several issues that are not within the conventional experience of judges but actually involve technical or policy considerations within the agency field of expertise.commc ns ass n,at.determining whether tribune met the requirements of the fcc and orders by using its best efforts to sell wtxx involves a highly factual inquiry.weighing whether the benefits of allowing tribune to continue to own both wtxx and the hartford courant against any potential costs of such common ownership is a technical policy decision.indeed,as the fcc later pointed out in its order,the pending matter involved questions of public policy that were difficult and unique,order,including questions surrounding the market conditions in the hartford market and wtxx relative competitive position,tribune efforts to sell the station,public interest factors supporting an extension of the waiver,and whether tribune ownership of wtxx has preserved and improved service to viewers.finally,electing the appropriate remedy,the implications of immediate,as opposed to delayed,divestiture if tribune was not in compliance and was not entitled to a waiver is ultimately a policy determination.all of these decisions involve considerations clearly within the fcc particular field of expertise and are thus best addressed in the first instance by that agency.
the fcc consideration of a request for waiver of the rule usually implicates these technical and policy considerations.the fcc may exercise its discretion to waive a rule where particular facts would make strict compliance inconsistent with the public interest.new york pub.serv.comm of new york fcc,cir quoting ne.cellular.fcc.indeed,both the and orders demonstrate the public interest balancing that the fcc must undertake in contemplating a waiver request.in the order,the commission concluded that t he temporary loss of diversity in the hartford market would be outweighed by the benefits of permitting an orderly sale of media properties to a qualified buyer that will preserve these stations as media voices in the market.order,at.similarly,in the order,the commission extended tribune temporary waiver because the underlying rationale supporting the waiver continues to be supported by the public interest.order,at.
the commission weighing of the public interest in considering a waiver request is thus similar to the type of public interest or reasonableness determinations that the supreme court has emphasized require than under the primary jurisdiction doctrine.because the public interest is not a simple fact,easily determined by courts,atchison,topeka sante fe ry.wichita bd.of trade,d,congress has placed these types of determinations squarely in the hands of the commission.consol.rail ass of recycling,d per curiam citing arrow transp.ry,d.the responsibilities for assessing the wisdom of such policy choices and resolving the struggle between competing views of the public interest are not judicial ones our constitution vests such responsibilities in the political branches.chevron,natural res.def.council,d quoting tva hill,d.
the district court erroneously believed that the question presented was straightforward whether tribune is in compliance with the order because the fcc had never indicated that there was any ambiguity to its order,that further is necessary or that there are any technical questions remaining.ellis,d at.if the only issue as the district court suggests was whether tribune violated the fcc order,then further agency review might have been unnecessary.but here the district court decision implicated at least two other determinations that did not involve straightforward issues.first,the district court prevented or at least attempted to prevent further fcc consideration of whether to extend tribune waiver.the regulation of licenses,including waiver extensions,is a function of the commission,especially where,as here,two temporary waivers had already been issued as consonant with the public interest.second,the district court also chose a remedy and ordered tribune to transfer wtxx license forthwith.because the election of a remedy is a matter for the fcc not the district court to determine,the district court order interfered with the fcc authority,not only to determine whether a waiver is warranted,but also to decide the appropriate consequence of the waiver expiration.it is clear that the district court addressed difficult issues of fact and policy that were inextricably intertwined with the public interest 
b.the scope of the agency discretion 
the question at issue in both tribune permanent waiver request and the,whether tribune should receive an extension of the waiver of the particularly within the agency discretion.the fcc exercise of its licensing authority is a task that congress has delegated to the commission in the first instance with deferential judicial review reserved to the courts of appeals.in re nextwave pers.commc ns,cir per curiam in re nextwave quoting fcc wncn listeners guild,d.the fcc is expected to serve as the single government agency with unified jurisdiction and regulatory power over all forms of electrical communication,whether by telephone,telegraph,cable,or radio.united states southwestern cable,d internal quotation marks and footnote omitted see also in re long distance telecomms,cir affirming district court decision that granted fcc primary jurisdiction and that considered the pervasive nature of the fcc regulatory authority over the communications industry.
indeed,i n the communications act of,stat,as amended,congress assigned to the commission exclusive authority to grant licenses,based on public convenience,interest,or necessity,to persons wishing to construct and operate radio and television broadcast stations in the united states.metro,fcc,d emphasis added,overruled on other grounds by adarand constructors,pena,d.
t he commission shall determine,in the case of each application filed with it,whether the public interest,convenience,and necessity will be served by the granting of such application,and,if the commission,upon examination of such application and upon consideration of such other matters as the commission may officially notice,shall find that public interest,convenience,and necessity would be served by the granting thereof,it shall grant such application.
a.moreover,as we have held,the fcc exclusive jurisdiction extends not only to the granting of licenses,but also to the conditions that may be placed on their use.in re nextwave,at.
in re nextwave is instructive in understanding the scope of the fcc discretion as well as the limited role of the courts in licensing matters.in in re nextwave,the district court affirmed a bankruptcy court decision that permitted nextwave to avoid billion of its billion obligation to the fcc and to allow nextwave to keep radio licenses while it reorganized in bankruptcy.see in re nextwave pers.commc ns,fcc.on appeal,we held that the district court and bankruptcy court exceeded their jurisdiction by,in effect,intervening in the allocation of radio spectrum licenses,a matter within the fcc exclusive regulatory jurisdiction.in re nextwave,at.we noted that i t is beyond the jurisdiction of a court in a collateral proceeding to mandate that a licensee be allowed to keep its license despite its failure to meet the conditions to which the license is subject.id.at.we concluded that,i n order for congress prescribed regulatory system to function properly in a dynamic environment,the fcc allocative decisions must not be interfered with by other instrumentalities of the federal government acting beyond their statutory authority.id.at.we emphasized that w hen the fcc decides which entities are entitled to spectrum licenses under rules and conditions it has promulgated,it therefore exercises the full extent of its regulatory capacity.id.at emphasis added.
logically,the commission retains exclusive authority to grant waiver requests from its licensing requirements.in enacting the regulations prohibiting,the commission noted its expectation that there could be meritorious waiver requests.in the matter of waiver policy,waiver policy citing amendment,at.accordingly,the commission set forth four bases that it would consider in reviewing such requests see amendment,at.the supreme court,in upholding the rule,specifically noted the availability of waivers of the rule,particularly where the station and newspaper could not survive under separate ownership,as underscoring the reasonableness of the rule.id.citing fcc citizens comm.for,d.indeed,the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia recently held that a commission waiver decision was inextricably tied to its licensing decision.am.catholic educ.programming,fcc.overall,therefore,it is well established that the fcc ability to grant waivers is a fundamental component of its licensing discretion.
c.the risk of inconsistent rulings 
because tribune application for an extended waiver was still pending before the commission at the time of the district court decision,there existed a substantial danger of inconsistent rulings.commc ns ass n,at.as the district court must have been aware,tribune timely application for a waiver extension although not addressed in a timely manner by the fcc obviously raised the possibility that the fcc might take further administrative action and grant a permanent or temporary waiver extending tribune compliance period.inconsistent rulings did occur in this case in part because the district court failed to defer to the fcc exclusive authority to address this matter in the first instance.see atchison,topeka santa fe,at.emphasizing that the issuance of an injunction pending further administrative action is precisely what the doctrine of primary jurisdiction is designed to avoid metrophones,global crossing,cir noting that there should be little danger of inconsistent administration of federal policy because any policy issues that do arise can be referred to the commission under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.
courts should be especially solicitous in deferring to agencies that are simultaneously contemplating the same issues.because an agency is currently conducting an investigation into the lawfulness of the practice under attack,to permit the court below initially to determine the issue would invite the very disruption that the doctrine is meant to discourage.danna air france,cir.indeed,in the context of the interstate commerce commission icc,the supreme court has made clear that district courts should not issue injunctive relief while a decision over which the commission has exclusive authority is pending.see,united states students challenging regulatory agency procedures,d relying on arrow transportation,d,to conclude that the district court lacked jurisdiction to enter injunction atchison,topeka sante fe,at.the fact that issuing an injunction may undercut the policies served by the doctrine of primary jurisdiction is therefore an important element to be considered when a federal court contemplates such action.in the same manner,district courts should refrain from addressing the necessity or lack thereof of extending a waiver request or from formulating a remedy such as divestiture,where,as here,the issues were currently pending before the fcc.see,mical commc ns,sprint telemedia,cir noting that,because the precise issue is pending before the fcc now,there exists a real possibility that a decision by this court prior to the fcc response would result in conflicting decisions.
the district court,noting that this action is focused on the particular situation faced by tribune in connecticut and that the fcc order would be limited to tribune situation,erroneously concluded that there is no substantial danger of inconsistent rulings.ellis,d at.the district court seemed to assume that the danger of inconsistent judgments is only problematic in a potential conflict between different cases.in fact,while conflicting results in separate cases are a common concern,conflicts arising within the same case are especially problematic.conflicts of doctrine and policy,particularly between unrelated cases,are bearable up to a point and would in many cases be finally reconcilable by the supreme court.more troublesome is a situation where the same parties are the subject of conflicting decisions.jaffe,supra,at.indeed,in this case,the substantial danger of inconsistent rulings became a reality upon the fcc issuance of its order.while the district court ordered an immediate sale of wtxx license,the fcc declared in its order that tribune continued ownership of wtxx at least until early was within the public interest.such a conflict within the law of the case is precisely the type of problem that the primary jurisdiction doctrine is meant to avoid 
we emphasize,however,that our analysis in no way undermines the finality of administrative proceedings.when an agency is barred by regulation or statute from ruling on a matter for whatever reason,we must respect the limitation on the agency authority and will not apply the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.when an agency is barred from further review,there is no prospective danger of inconsistent rulings within the law of the case.
prior application to the agency 
the district court erred in concluding that the final application to the against primary jurisdiction.the district court entire analysis as to this factor consisted of noting that tribune clearly has made prior applications to the fcc.ellis d at.both the district court and ellis seem to misinterpret the point of this inquiry,which requires us to consider whether prior application to the agency has been made.if prior application to the agency is present,this factor provides support for the conclusion that the doctrine of primary jurisdiction is appropriate.see oasis petroleum dep t of energy.on the other hand,if prior application to the agency is absent,this factor may weigh against referral of the matter to the agency on the basis of primary jurisdiction.see commc ns ass n,at noting the district court determination that,because no prior application had been made to the fcc,this factor did not favor referral to the fcc ex rel.taylor gabelli,d,holding that the prior application factor disfavors referral because no prior application to the fcc has been made.here,tribune made prior applications to the fcc in the form of its waiver requests in june of temporary waiver subsequently granted in order and february of temporary waiver subsequently granted in order,as well as its permanent waiver request in august of temporary waiver subsequently granted in order.the fact that all three of these prior applications to the agency had already been made in this matter provides further support for our conclusion that the doctrine of primary jurisdiction should have been invoked by the district court.oasis petroleum,at.
ellis argues that it would have been unrealistic for him to apply to the fcc because the agency was hostile to him and to the public interest.this court has recognized that where resort to the agency would plainly be unavailing in light of its manifest opposition or because it has already evinced its special competence in a manner hostile to petitioner,courts need not bow to the primary jurisdiction of the administrative body.bd.of educ.of the city of new york harris,cir.as an initial matter,however,we note once again that the party seeking agency review,tribune,had already made three prior applications to the agency.in any event,ellis never afforded the commission an opportunity to address his claims at any time throughout these proceedings.as tribune points out,ellis could have,but did not i seek the fcc interpretation or enforcement of the orders ii oppose tribune petition for a permanent or further temporary waiver,or iii request a stay,reconsideration or review of the order.instead,ellis brought this action directly in the district court under b.on this record,ellis is unable to show that the fcc was hostile to him within any agency proceeding or with regard to the merits of tribune permanent waiver request,and the fcc opposition to ellis attempt to file an enforcement action in federal district court does not demonstrate that a direct appeal to the fcc would have been futile.
finally,in analyzing the potential advantages of applying the doctrine against the potential costs,we recognize that,because primary jurisdiction is a mechanism for streamlining judicial review,courts including this court have sometimes refused to recognize a primary jurisdiction claim where agency referral would result in undue delay.see,commc ns.ass n,at holding that,s ince the district court can conclude this matter far more expeditiously,a potential delay of even two years more than outweighs any benefit that might be achieved by having the fcc resolve this relatively simple factual dispute.however,more recently,we have noted that such considerations of judicial economy should not be considered because the supreme court has consistently held that there are only two purposes to consider in determining whether to apply the primary jurisdiction and expertise and the supreme court has never identified judicial economy as a relevant factor.tassy brunswick hosp,cir.but see tassy,at walker,dissenting pointing out that this court has relied on the judicial economy factor in johnson nyack,cir,and that,in any event,considerations of judicial economy overlap to a certain extent with those of agency expertise reiter cooper,d noting that referral of the issue to the icc could produce substantial delay.here,even assuming that judicial economy could be considered as an aspect of agency expertise or otherwise,we do not believe that the possibility of additional agency delay would have counseled against primary jurisdiction because this case,unlike national communications association,involves highly complicated factual and policy disputes that the fcc is uniquely to address 
the district court suggested,and ellis continues to argue,that the statutory grant of enforcement power under b would be eviscerated if district courts always had to defer to the jurisdiction of administrative agencies.ellis,d at.we agree that deference in all circumstances would eviscerate the district court jurisdiction under b,but,contrary to the district court,we do not believe that tribune or the commission has suggested such an absolute rule.indeed,in goya foods,tropicana products,cir,we suggested that the scope of the primary jurisdiction least in certain contexts such as federal trademark relatively narrow and that the doctrine applies only when the issue involves technical questions of fact uniquely within the expertise and experience of an agency.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.district courts should continue to apply this court test,see commc ns ass n,at,because each case turns on whether the reasons for the existence of the doctrine are present and whether the purposes it serves will be aided by its application in the particular litigation.western pac,at.in holding here that the district court should have referred this matter to the fcc under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction,we by no means suggest that primary jurisdiction is mandatory whenever the jurisdictions of a court and agency overlap 
while the primary jurisdiction doctrine guards against the hazard of forbidden judicial intrusion into the administrative domain,arrow transp,at,the doctrine also relies on the timely and efforts of regulatory agencies in addressing issues within their domain.golden hill paugussett tribe of indians,at admonishing agency not to address issue in a leisurely manner when,under the circumstances,it should be on a instead.as the fcc stated in its order we also do not intend to continue the practice of allowing waivers to remain in force through inaction for long periods of time.rather,we expect to address compliance with the terms of waivers as their expiration dates approach.fcc order.we sincerely hope that in the future the fcc will complete its work in a timely manner so as to avoid the type of situation that arose in this case.
overall,however,the district court should have invoked the primary jurisdiction doctrine and allowed the fcc to address this licensing matter in the first instance.such an approach would have avoided the subsequent inconsistent rulings and allowed the fcc to exercise its expertise and discretion in deciding tribune waiver request.see united states morgan.a federal agency and a district court are not like two trains,wholly unrelated to one another,racing down parallel tracks towards the same end i t is desirable that the agency and the court go down the same at different attain the statute ends by their coordinate action.golden hill paugussett tribe of indians,at.
conclusion 
the district court erred in failing to recognize the fcc primary jurisdiction in this matter.where a district court fails to recognize an agency primary jurisdiction,we may instruct the district court to hold further proceedings in abeyance pending referral to the agency rather than to dismiss an action.see,southwestern sugar molasses,river terminals,d.however,while the district court retaining jurisdiction may have been a conceivable option prior to the fcc order,we agree with the fcc that there is no longer any useful purpose that would be served by remanding the case to the district court with directions to refer the case to the fcc.see far conference,at.the fcc order extending tribune waiver until early has addressed and resolved the issues that the district court should have referred to the fcc under the primary jurisdiction doctrine.accordingly,we vacate the district court judgment and remand the case to the district court with directions to dismiss.
