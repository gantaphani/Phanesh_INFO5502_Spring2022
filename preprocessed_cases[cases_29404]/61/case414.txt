in the communications decency act of,congress declared no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.c.no cause of action may be brought and no liability may be imposed under any state or local law that is inconsistent with this section.e.
these provisions have been widely and consistently interpreted to confer broad immunity against defamation liability for those who use the internet to publish information that originated from another source.the immunity has been applied regardless of the traditional distinction between publishers and distributors.under the common law,distributors like newspaper vendors and booksellers are liable only if they had notice of a defamatory statement in their merchandise.the publisher of the newspaper or book where the statement originally appeared,however,may be held liable even without notice.
in this case,the court of appeal diverged from the prevailing interpretation of section.it decided that common law distributor liability survived the congressional grant of immunity,so that internet service providers and users are exposed to liability if they republish a statement with notice of its defamatory character.
we granted review to decide whether section confers immunity on distributors.because this case involves the liability of an individual rather than a service provider,we asked the parties to address the definition of the statutory term user.we also requested briefing on whether the immunity analysis is affected if a user engages in active rather than passive conduct.we conclude that section prohibits distributor liability for internet publications.we further hold that section c immunizes individual users of interactive computer services,and that no practical or principled distinction can be drawn between active and passive use.accordingly,we reverse the court of appeal judgment.
we acknowledge that recognizing broad immunity for defamatory republications on the internet has some troubling consequences.until congress chooses to revise the settled law in this area,however,plaintiffs who contend they were defamed in an internet posting may only seek recovery from the original source of the statement.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiffs,stephen barrett and terry polevoy,operated web sites devoted to exposing health frauds.defendant ilena rosenthal directed the humantics foundation for women and operated an internet discussion group.plaintiffs alleged that rosenthal and others committed libel by maliciously distributing defamatory statements in and internet postings,impugning plaintiffs character and competence and disparaging their efforts to combat fraud they alleged that rosenthal republished various messages even after barrett warned her they contained false and defamatory information.
rosenthal moved to strike the complaint under the statute.code civ,slapp is an acronym for strategic lawsuit against public participation.she claimed her statements were protected speech,and argued that plaintiffs could not establish a probability of prevailing because she was immune under section.see code civ,subd.b equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d.she also contended her statements were not actionable.
the court granted the motion,finding that rosenthal statements concerned an issue of public interest within the scope of the statute,and were,for the most part,not actionable because they contained no provably false assertions of fact.plaintiffs do not challenge that ruling.the court determined that the only actionable statement appeared in an article rosenthal received via from her codefendant tim bolen.this article,subtitled opinion by tim bolen,accused polevoy of stalking a canadian radio producer.rosenthal posted a copy of this article on the web sites of two newsgroups devoted to alternative health issues and the politics of medicine,not on the site of her own discussion group.according to rosenthal,these newsgroups were part of the wild west of the internet,with no administrators and no one to enforce rules of conduct.the trial court ruled that this republication was immunized by section c.
the court of appeal vacated the order granting the motion to strike insofar as it applied to polevoy.it held that section did not protect rosenthal from liability as a distributor under the common law of defamation.we granted rosenthal petition for review 
ii.discussion 
the leading case on section immunity rejected the distributor liability theory adopted by the court of appeal here.zeran america online,cir,zeran.we first discuss the zeran holding and rationale,then the court of appeal contrary analysis recognizing distributor liability would have a dramatic impact on internet service providers.we agree with the zeran court that congress did not intend to create such an exception to section immunity 
rosenthal,however,is not a service provider,at least with respect to the newsgroups where she posted the bolen article.this appears to be the first published case in which section immunity has been invoked by an individual who had no supervisory role in the operation of the internet site where allegedly defamatory material appeared,and who thus was clearly not a provider of an interactive computer service under the broad definition provided in the cda.f see fn,ante.accordingly,we asked the parties to brief the meaning of the term user in section,and whether any distinction might be drawn between active and passive use under the statute.in part c of our discussion,we conclude that congress employed the term user to refer simply to anyone using an interactive computer service,without distinguishing between active and passive use.
kenneth zeran was bombarded with angry and derogatory telephone calls,including death threats,after an unidentified person posted a message on an america online,aol bulletin board.the message advertised with offensive slogans referring to the oklahoma city bombing of the alfred murrah federal building,and instructed prospective purchasers to call zeran home telephone number.zeran notified aol of the problem,and the posting was eventually removed.however,similar postings appeared,and an oklahoma radio announcer aired the contents of the first message.zeran was again inundated with threatening phone calls.he sued aol for unreasonable delay in removing the defamatory messages,refusing to post retractions,and failing to screen for similar postings.zeran,supra,at.
aol successfully moved for judgment on the pleadings,relying on section.zeran,supra,at.the fourth circuit court of appeals affirmed,holding that the plain language of section creates a federal immunity to any cause of action that would make service providers liable for information originating with a user of the service.specifically,precludes courts from entertaining claims that would place a computer service provider in a publisher role.thus,lawsuits seeking to hold a service provider liable for its exercise of a publisher traditional editorial as deciding whether to publish,withdraw,postpone or alter barred.zeran,at.
referring to the congressional finding that the internet has flourished with a minimum of government regulation a,and the policy statement favoring a free market for interactive computer services unfettered by federal or state regulation b,the zeran court reasoned that congress viewed t he imposition of tort liability on service providers for the communications of others as simply another form of intrusive government regulation of speech.zeran,supra,at.while original posters of defamatory speech do not escape accountability,congress made a policy choice not to deter harmful online speech by imposing tort liability on companies that serve as intermediaries for other parties potentially injurious messages.id.at.this policy reflects a concern that if service providers faced tort liability for republished messages on the internet,they might choose to severely restrict the number and type of messages posted.id.at.
the court noted that another important purpose of section was to encourage service providers to the dissemination of offensive material over their services.zeran,supra,at.the legislative history indicates that section was enacted in response to an unreported new york trial court case.stratton oakmont,prodigy services.may,wl,media.stratton oakmont.there,a service provider was held liable for defamatory comments posted on one of its bulletin boards,based on a finding that the provider had adopted the role of publisher by actively screening and editing postings.fearing that the specter of liability would deter service providers from blocking and screening offensive material,congress enacted broad immunity,which forbids the imposition of publisher liability on a service provider for the exercise of its editorial and functions.zeran,supra,at.
zeran made the same argument adopted by the court of appeal here that congress intended to distinguish between publishers and distributors,immunizing publishers but leaving distributors exposed to liability.at common law,primary publishers,such as book,newspaper,or magazine publishers,are liable for defamation on the same basis as authors.booksellers,news vendors,or other distributors,however,may only be held liable if they knew or had reason to know of a publication defamatory content.zeran,supra,at prosser keeton,the law of torts ed,rest d torts,subd,coms.c,d,e,see also osmond ewap,d.zeran contended that because congress mentioned only the term publisher in section,it intended to leave distributors unprotected.he claimed that once he gave aol notice that it was posting defamatory statements on its bulletin board,aol became liable as a distributor.zeran,supra,at.
the zeran court held that the distinction makes no difference for purposes of section immunity.publication is a necessary element of all defamation claims,and includes every repetition and distribution of a defamatory statement.zeran,supra,at,citing prosser keeton,the law of torts,supra,and rest d torts,subd.b.although distributors become liable only upon notice,they are nevertheless included in the larger publisher category.zeran,supra,at.zeran simply attaches too much importance to the presence of the distinct notice element in distributor liability o nce a computer service provider receives notice of a potentially defamatory posting,it is thrust into the role of a traditional publisher.the computer service provider must decide whether to publish,edit,or withdraw the posting.in this respect,zeran seeks to impose liability on aol for assuming the role for which specifically proscribes publisher role.id.at.
subjecting service providers to notice liability would defeat the dual purposes of section,by encouraging providers to restrict speech and abstain from.zeran,supra,at.a provider would be at risk for liability each time it received notice of a potentially defamatory statement in any internet message,requiring an investigation of the circumstances,a legal judgment about the defamatory character of the information,and an editorial decision on whether to continue the publication.although this might be feasible for the traditional print publisher,the sheer number of postings on interactive computer services would create an impossible burden in the internet context.ibid.
similarly,liability would deter service providers from regulating the dissemination of offensive material over their own services.any efforts by a service provider to investigate and screen material posted on its service would only lead to notice of potentially defamatory material more frequently and thereby create a stronger basis for liability.instead of subjecting themselves to further possible lawsuits,service providers would likely eschew any attempts at.
more generally,liability for interactive computer service providers would provide third parties with a means to create the basis for future lawsuits.whenever one was displeased with the speech of another party conducted over an interactive computer service,the offended party could simply notify the relevant service provider,claiming the information to be legally defamatory because the probable effects of distributor liability on the vigor of internet speech and on service provider are directly contrary to statutory purposes,we will not assume that congress intended to leave liability upon notice intact.zeran,supra,at.
in support of his argument for liability,zeran invoked the rule against abrogation of common law principles unless congress speaks directly to the question.zeran,supra,at united states texas,d.however,the court reasoned that congress had spoken directly by employing the term publisher,and that preserving distributor liability would defeat the primary purposes of section.the policy of strictly construing statutes in derogation of the common law does not require a literal interpretation conflicting with the obvious legislative purpose.zeran,supra,at,citing isbrandtsen johnson.
the zeran court views have been broadly accepted,in both federal and state courts before the court of appeal issued its opinion below,two other california courts of appeal had followed zeran.in kathleen city of livermore th,d,a taxpayer sued after her son obtained sexually explicit photographs through an internet connection at a public library.she sought injunctive relief on various theories of liability.id.at,d.the kathleen court held that the state law causes of action were barred by section.kathleen,at,d.it cited zeran for the rule that section c immunizes both publisher s and distributor s.kathleen,at,fn,d.it also agreed with the zeran court analysis of congressional intent.id.at,d.
in gentry ebay,th,d,the plaintiffs used ebay marketing services to purchase sports memorabilia.claiming the items bore forged autographs,they sued ebay for negligence,unfair trade practices,and violation of civil code section,which regulates the sale of such collectibles.gentry,at,d.the gentry court ruled that section immunized ebay from liability on all the plaintiffs claims.it noted the broad scope given to section immunity by the zeran court and others,and reasoned that the plaintiffs were trying to hold ebay responsible for disseminating information provided by the individual sellers who used its service.gentry,at,d.regarding the allegation that ebay knew or should have known about the sellers illegal conduct but failed to prevent it by withdrawing or altering the fraudulent content,the gentry court stated this is the classic kind of claim that zeran found to be preempted by section,one that seeks to hold ebay liable for its exercise of a publisher traditional editorial functions.id.at,d.
b.the court of appeal analysis 
swimming against the jurisprudential tide,the court of appeal in this case disputed the ruling in zeran,contending it confers a more expansive immunity than is necessary to preserve freedom of online speech,and would actually defeat the goal of encouraging.the court of appeal focussed on three factors the zeran court interpretation of the statutory term publisher the legislative history of section and the practical implications of notice liability in the internet environment.we reject the court of appeal analysis on each of these points.
the meaning of publisher 
the court of appeal acknowledged that publication is an element of defamation,and that distributors are sometimes referred to as secondary publishers.see,dworkin hustler magazine,hart bennet,fn.prosser keeton,the law of torts,supra,at smolla,the law of defamation ed.however,the court pronounced it reasonable to assume that congress had in mind the different standards of common law liability imposed on primary publishers,who have control over content,and distributors,who do not.thus,the omission of any reference to distributors in section c was arguably intentional.
the court of appeal noted that the goal of discouraging excessive by immunizing publishers is at odds with the rights of individuals to recover for defamatory falsehood.it deemed the term publisher ambiguous,because it might refer to primary publishers only or to both primary publishers and distributors.according to the court of appeal,such a legally uncertain word could not support the broad immunity the zeran court derived from the statute.it found nothing in the statutory findings and declarations to indicate that congress considered online speech in need of blanket protection.indeed,it detected a contrary intent in the terms of section c,which immunizes providers and users against liability for any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be objectionable,whether or not such material is constitutionally protected or to provide others with the technical means to restrict access to such material.the court of appeal reasoned that section c would be superfluous if all publishers enjoyed absolute immunity under section c.
the court of appeal sought further support for limiting the scope of the term publisher to primary publishers by comparing the immunity provisions of the cda with those of the digital millenium copyright act,enacted in dmca the dmca immunizes internet service providers from liability for copyright infringement if the provider is unaware of the infringement and acts expeditiously to remove the copyrighted material upon notice.it includes detailed notice requirements,and procedures for replacement of the disputed material upon sufficient.c g.because congress did not include such specific regulation of notice liability in the cda,the court of appeal decided it had failed to speak directly to the issue,thus preserving common law distributor liability.see united states texas,supra,at.
we conclude the zeran court construction of the term publisher is sound.the terms of section c are broad and direct no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.given that distributors are also known as secondary publishers,there is little reason to believe congress felt it necessary to address them separately.there is even less reason to suppose that congress intended to immunize publishers but leave distributors open to liability,when the responsibility of publishers for offensive content is greater than that of mere distributors.the court of appeal failed to respond to the zeran court point that once online distributors are notified of defamatory content,they are placed in a position traditionally occupied by publishers,and must make an editorial decision on how to treat the posted material.zeran,supra,at.this is a persuasive justification for giving the term publisher an inclusive interpretation.see,gentry ebay,supra,th at,d green america online,supra,at donato moldow,supra,at schneider,supra,at.
we are not convinced by the court of appeal reasoning that a broad reading of section c would make section c unnecessary.these provisions address different concerns.section c is concerned with liability arising from information provided online.section c is directed at actions taken by internet service providers or users to restrict access to online information liability for censoring content is not ordinarily associated with the defendant status as publisher or speaker.those terms,employed in section c,are drawn from the law of defamation.see,prosser keeton,the law of torts,supra,at rest d torts.section c provides immunity from claims by those offended by an online publication,while section c protects against claims by those who might object to the restriction of access to an online publication.
the court of appeal reference to the dmca does not support its conclusion that congress use of the term publisher was insufficient to abrogate distributor liability.to the contrary,the dmca shows that congress has crafted a limited immunity in a closely related context,with specific provision for notice liability.c.the fact that it did not do so in the cda,and has not amended section to add a similar provision in the years since it was enacted,or in the eight years since the example of the dmca has been in existence,strongly supports the conclusion that congress did not intend to permit notice liability under the cda 
we note that it is far from clear how the distinction between traditional print publishers and distributors would apply in the internet environment,with its many and various forms of discourse.see reno american civil liberties union,supra,d.as the high court noted,a ny person or organization with a computer connected to the internet can publish information.id.at.whenever such information is copied from another source,its publication might also be described as a distribution.the distinction proposed by the court of appeal,based on rules developed in the,world,would foster disputes over which category the defendant should occupy.the common law of defamation would provide little guidance.
in this case,for example,rosenthal could claim that her active role in selecting and posting material disparaging plaintiffs qualified her as a primary publisher.her participation in the dissemination of the bolen article,particularly considered in light of her other alleged verbal attacks on plaintiffs,arguably went beyond mere distribution.see prosser keeton,the law of torts,supra,at smolla,the law of defamation,supra,rest d torts.the court of appeal provided no analysis justifying its conclusion that rosenthal could be held liable as a distributor,noting only that she alleged no facts preventing her from being so characterized.we need not decide the question,but certainly the argument could be made that plaintiffs allegations cast rosenthal in the role of a publisher.
the legislative history 
the court of appeal noted that section was enacted along with other cda provisions that prohibited the knowing transmission of obscene or indecent or patently offensive messages to persons under the age of it reasoned that immunizing internet service providers and users from primary publisher liability advanced a similar purpose by protecting those providers and users who try but fail to identify and remove offensive material.however,according to the court of appeal,immunization from distributor liability would be inconsistent with this goal because it would protect providers and users who make no effort to screen for offensive material,along with those who refuse to take action once on notice.
the court of appeal claimed support for this view in the legislative history of section,though it conceded that the history is meager.see sheridan,zeran aol and the effect of section of the communications decency act upon liability for defamation on the internet alb,hereafter sheridan.the court recognized that section was enacted to remove the disincentives to created by the stratton oakmont case,in which a service provider was held liable as a primary publisher because it actively screened and edited messages posted on its bulletin boards.stratton oakmont,supra,wl,media.see zeran,supra,at fn,ante.however,the court of appeal considered an earlier internet defamation case to be equally important in ascertaining the purpose of section.
in cubby,compuserve,a journalist claimed he was defamed by a competitor remarks posted on an internet forum provided by compuserve.id.at.the court applied the common law distributor standard of liability,concluding the forum was essentially an electronic library over which compuserve exercised little or no editorial control.id.at.because there was no evidence compuserve knew or had reason to know of the statements,the court granted it summary judgment.id.at.
the court of appeal noted that cubby was distinguished in stratton oakmont,and also in comments by the sponsors of section.as related in a law review article relied on by the court,representative cox,one of two sponsors of the immunity provision,characterized the imposition of distributor liability in cubby as holding that compuserve was not the publisher or editor of the material.he clearly used the term publisher to exclude parties held to the distributor liability standard applied to compuserve in that case.cong.rec.daily ed,statement of cox.the provision sponsors summarized both the cubby and stratton oakmont decisions,and then repeatedly discussed the need to overrule stratton oakmont,without again mentioning cubby.see.daily ed,statements of cox and wyden see also.daily ed.june,statements of coats distinguishing between publisher and distributor liability and noting that the cda was not intended to hold intermediaries to publisher liability.freiwald,comparative institutional analysis in cyberspace the case of intermediary liability for defamation harv.tech,fn.hereafter freiwald.
from these sources,the court of appeal discerned a congressional intent to preserve distributor liability.it cited several academic commentators for the view that immunizing internet service providers from distributor liability would actually frustrate the objective of,because no liability would flow from failing to screen for defamatory content.mcmanus,rethinking defamation liability for internet service providers suffolk,hereafter mcmanus patel,immunizing internet service providers from third party internet defamation claims how far should courts go vand,see also sheridan,supra,alb.at.
the court of appeal and the commentators on which it relied read too much into the legislative record.we note that the comments of senator coats,summarized by professor freiwald as quoted above,pertained not to section but to a separate provision of the cda,codified at united states code section f,daily ed.june.the comments of representative cox,a sponsor of section,are pertinent but do not indicate that distributors were meant to be excluded from statutory protection 
representative cox said section was intended to encourage people like compuserve by protect ing them from taking on liability such as occurred in the stratton oakmont case in new york that they should not face for helping us solve this problem.cong.rec.daily ed.thus,he meant that distributors like compuserve would be protected from rather than threatened with liability,to encourage responsible screening of the content provided on their services.under the court of appeal interpretation of section,a distributor could be sued if it deleted material after receiving notice of offensive content,but did not act quickly or thoroughly enough to suit the offended party.primary publishers who decide not to remove offensive postings would be immunized,while distributors making the same decision would be unprotected.it is unlikely that congress intended such incongruous results.
both the terms of section c and the comments of representative cox reflect the intent to promote active screening by service providers of online content provided by others.congress implemented its intent not by maintaining the common law distinction between publishers and distributors,but by broadly shielding all providers from liability for publishing information received from third parties congress contemplated,rather than regulation compelled at the sword point of tort liability.it chose to protect even the most active internet publishers,those who take an aggressive role in republishing third party content.it would be anomalous to hold less active distributors liable upon notice.thus,the immunity conferred by section applies even when is unsuccessful,or completely unattempted.blumenthal drudge,supra.at schneider,supra,at donato moldow,supra,at.
as rosenthal and amici curiae point out,subsequent legislative history contains explicit support for the zeran court interpretation.in,congress enacted the dot kids implementation and efficiency act a house committee report notes that the purpose of this legislation was to facilitate the creation of a new,internet domain within the united states country code domain that will be a haven for material that promotes positive experiences for children and families using the internet,cong,the legislation includes a provision that the new registry it created,and related entities,are deemed to be interactive computer services for purposes of section c of the communications act of c.e.the committee report explains that this provision was intended to shield the.registry,registrars,and parties who contract with the registry,from liability based on efforts to intercept and take down material that is not suitable for minors or is harmful to minors.the committee notes that isps internet service providers have successfully defended many lawsuits using section c.the courts have correctly interpreted section c,which was aimed at protecting against liability for such claims as negligence.see,doe america online,so d and defamation ben ezra,weinstein,and america online,zeran america online.the committee intends these interpretations of section c to be equally applicable to those entities covered by,cong,
practical implications of notice liability 
the zeran court identified three deleterious effects that would flow from reading section to permit liability upon notice.first,service providers who received notification of a defamatory message would be subject to liability only for maintaining the message,not for removing it.this fact,together with the burdens involved in evaluating the defamatory character of a great number of protested messages,would provide a natural incentive to simply remove messages upon notification,chilling the freedom of internet speech.second,liability would deter service providers from actively screening the content of material posted on its service,because discovering potentially defamatory material would only increase the provider liability.finally,liability would give third parties a means of manufacturing claims,imposing on providers ceaseless choices of suppressing controversial speech or sustaining prohibitive liability.zeran,supra,at.
the court of appeal expressed doubt that a statute encouraging service providers to restrict access to offensive material was intended to promote free speech over the internet.it also questioned the speculative conclusion that liability would significantly chill online speech,though it refrained from taking a definitive position on this point.noting the absence of any evidence in the record regarding the burdens such liability would create,the court of appeal referred to the views of commentators critical of zeran as a way to explore the contours of the debate without attempting its resolution.see intel hamidi cal th,d.
some critics have suggested that market forces would restrain service providers from removing postings without investigation,because any provider engaging in that practice would acquire a bad reputation in the internet community.sheridan,supra,alb.at freiwald,supra,harv.tech.at butler,plotting the return of an ancient tort to cyberspace towards a new federal standard of responsibility for defamation for internet service providers.telecomm.it has also been argued that the difficulty of prevailing on a defamation claim would attenuate the burden of liability on providers.moreover,because distributor liability would only arise upon notice,and would not require service providers to review postings in advance,defamation damages would be limited to those accruing after the provider became aware of the defamatory character of a message.sheridan,supra,alb.at.
citing mcmanus,supra,suffolk.at page,the court of appeal asserted that zeran has been criticized for failing to account for the many different ways defamation may be transmitted over the internet,and the different levels of control an internet intermediary may exercise over the content of messages.most fundamentally,however,the court of appeal noted that critics have condemned zeran for giving insufficient consideration to the interests of defamation victims.american courts have striven to develop rules that balance the legitimate protections of defamation liability with the constitutional right to free speech.the court of appeal resisted the notion that a blanket immunity derived from section c should disturb that balance.it concluded that preserving distributor liability was consistent with the immunity provisions of section.
the court of appeal gave insufficient consideration to the burden its rule would impose on internet speech.it is inaccurate to suggest that congress was indifferent to free speech protection when it enacted section.the statute includes findings welcoming the extraordinary advance in the availability of educational and informational resources on the internet,and applauding the internet as a forum for a true diversity of political discourse that offers myriad avenues for intellectual activity and provides a variety of political,educational,cultural,and entertainment services.a.congress sought to promote the continued development of the internet and other interactive computer services.b.the provisions of section c,conferring broad immunity on internet intermediaries,are themselves a strong demonstration of legislative commitment to the value of maintaining a free market for online expression.
the fact that congress also meant to restrict access to certain internet content does not compel a contrary conclusion.as the court aptly observed in batzel smith,supra,t here is an apparent tension between congress goals of promoting free speech while at the same time giving parents the tools to limit the material their children can access over the internet.as a result of this apparent tension,some commentators have suggested that the fourth circuit in zeran imposed first amendment goals on legislation that was actually adopted for the purpose of controlling the dissemination of content over the internet.citation.these critics fail to recognize that laws often have more than one goal in mind,and that it is not uncommon for these purposes to look in opposite directions.the need to balance competing values is a primary impetus for enacting legislation.tension within statutes is often not a defect but an indication that the legislature was doing its job.id.at see also carafano,supra,at.
we agree with the zeran court,and others considering the question,that subjecting internet service providers and users to defamation liability would tend to chill online speech.see carafano,supra,at batzel smith,supra,at noah aol time warner,d,blumenthal drudge,supra.at donato moldow,supra,at.certainly,that conclusion is no more speculative than the surmise that market forces might deter providers from removing postings without investigating their defamatory character.
we reject the argument that the difficulty of prevailing on a defamation claim mitigates the deterrent effect of potential liability.defamation law is complex,requiring consideration of multiple factors.these include whether the statement at issue is true or false,factual or figurative,privileged or unprivileged,whether the matter is of public or private concern,and whether the plaintiff is a public or private figure.see witkin,summary of cal.law ed.torts,et,et any investigation of a potentially defamatory internet posting is thus a daunting and expensive challenge.for that reason,we have observed that even when a defamation claim is clearly nonmeritorious,the threat of liability ultimately chills the free exercise of expression.baker los angeles herald examiner cal d,see also time,hill,d.
nor are we convinced by the observation that a distributor faces no liability without notice.distributors are liable not merely upon receiving notice from a third party,but also if they independently knew or had reason to know of the defamatory statement.osmond ewap,supra,d.prosser keeton,the law of torts,supra,rest d torts,subd.thus,as the zeran court pointed out,this aspect of distributor liability would discourage active monitoring of internet postings.zeran,supra,at.it could also motivate providers to insulate themselves from receiving complaints.such responses would frustrate the goal of.
the third practical implication noted in zeran is no less compelling,and went unaddressed by the court of appeal.liability for service providers would allow complaining parties to impose substantial burdens on the freedom of internet speech by lodging complaints whenever they were displeased by an online posting.zeran,supra,at.the volume and range of internet communications make the heckler veto a real threat under the court of appeal holding.the united states supreme court has cautioned against reading the cda to confer such a broad power of censorship on those offended by internet speech.reno american civil liberties union,supra,at.
the great variety of internet publications,and the different levels of content control that may be exercised by service providers and users,do not undermine the conclusion that congress intended to create a blanket immunity from tort liability for online republication of third party content.requiring providers,users,and courts to account for the nuances of common law defamation,and all the various ways they might play out in the internet environment,is a herculean assignment that we are reluctant to impose.we conclude the zeran court accurately diagnosed the problems that would attend liability for service providers.
finally,we can not ignore another practical implication raised by rosenthal and amicus curiae ebay.adopting a rule of liability under section that diverges from the rule announced in zeran and followed in all other jurisdictions would be an open invitation to forum shopping by defamation plaintiffs.webb superior court d.this consideration provides strong justification for following the approach we endorsed in etcheverry service,cal th,d,while we are not bound by decisions of the lower federal courts,even on federal questions,they are persuasive and entitled to great weight.citation.where lower federal precedents are divided or lacking,state courts must necessarily make an independent determination of federal law citation,but where the decisions of the lower federal courts on a federal question are both numerous and consistent,we should hesitate to reject their authority citation.
user liability 
the distributor liability theory endorsed by the court of appeal recognizes no distinction between internet service providers and individuals.individual internet users like rosenthal,however,are situated differently from institutional service providers with regard to some of the principal policy considerations discussed by the zeran court and reflected in the congressional record.in particular,individuals do not face the massive volume of postings that providers encounter.is a far less challenging enterprise for them.furthermore,service providers,no matter how active or passive a role they take in screening the content posted by users of their services,typically bear less responsibility for that content than do the users.users are more likely than service providers to actively engage in malicious propagation of defamatory or other offensive material.these considerations bring into question the scope of the term user in section,and whether it matters if a user is engaged in active or passive conduct for purposes of the statutory immunity.
user is not defined in the statute,and the limited legislative record does not indicate why congress included users as well as service providers under the umbrella of immunity granted by section c.the standard rules of statutory construction,however,yield an unambiguous result.we must begin with the language employed by congress and the assumption that its ordinary meaning expresses the legislative purpose.engine mfrs.ass south coast air quality management dist,d see also hassan mercy american river hospital cal th,d.user plainly refers to someone who uses something,and the statutory context makes it clear that congress simply meant someone who uses an interactive computer service.
section c refers directly to the user of an interactive computer service.section f defines interactive computer service as any information service,system,or access software provider that provides or enables computer access by multiple users to a computer server,including specifically a service or system that provides access to the internet section a notes that such services offer users a great degree of control over the information that they receive,and section b expresses congress intent to encourage the development of technologies which maximize user control over what information is received by individuals,families,and schools who use the internet and other interactive computer services.thus,congress consistently referred to users of interactive computer services,specifically including individuals in section b.
there is no reason to suppose that congress attached a different meaning to the term user in section c.see gustafson alloyd,d hassan mercy american river hospital,supra,cal th at,d.rosenthal used the internet to gain access to newsgroups where she posted bolen article about polevoy.she was therefore a user under the cda,as the parties conceded below.nor is there any basis for concluding that congress intended to treat service providers and users differently when it declared that n o provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as a publisher or speaker c.we can not construe the statute so as to render the term user inoperative.duncan walker,d hassan mercy american river hospital,supra,cal th at,d.we note that in cases where an individual role as operator of a web site raised a question as to whether he was a service provider or a user,the courts found it unnecessary to resolve the issue because the statute confers immunity on both.batzel smith,supra,at donato moldow,supra,at see also barrett fonorow,supra,at.
polevoy urges us to distinguish between active and passive internet use,and to restrict the statutory term user to those who engage in passive use.he notes that subdivisions a and b of section refer to information received by users.he also observes that the caption of subdivision c is protection for good samaritan blocking and screening of offensive material.from these premises,polevoy reasons that the term user must be construed to refer only to those who receive offensive information,and those who screen and remove such information from an internet site.he argues that those who actively post or republish information on the internet are information content providers unprotected by the statutory immunity.information content provider is defined as any person or entity that is responsible,in whole or in part,for the creation or development of information provided through the internet or any other interactive computer service f.
polevoy view fails to account for the statutory provision at the center of our inquiry the prohibition in section c against treating any user as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.a user who merely receives information on a computer without making it available to anyone else would be neither a publisher nor a speaker.congress obviously had a broader meaning in mind.nor is it clear how a user who removes a posting may be deemed passive while one who merely allows a posting to remain online is active.furthermore,congress plainly did not intend to deprive all information content providers of immunity,because the reference to another such provider in section c presumes that the immunized publisher or speaker is also an information content provider.see carafano,supra,at donato moldow,supra,at.
the distinction between active and passive use was explored in batzel smith,supra.smith sent an to the operator of a web site devoted to museum security and stolen art,accusing batzel of possessing paintings that may have been stolen by the nazis during world war ii.the operator posted the message on the web site,with some changes,and distributed it to the subscribers of his newsletter.batzel sued smith and the operator for defamation.the trial court denied the operator motion to strike the complaint under the california statute code civ.batzel,at.
the court of appeals vacated the order denying the motion,remanded,and directed the trial court to determine whether the operator should reasonably have known smith intended his to be published on the internet.if not,the court reasoned the message was not provided by another information content provider under section,and the operator would not be immune from liability batzel smith,supra,at.the relevant discussion for our purposes arose from the dissent expressed in a concurring and dissenting opinion.
the batzel dissent criticized the majority for adopting a rule that provides internet intermediaries with immunity to spread information intended for republication,licens ing professional and to spread false and hurtful information with impunity.batzel smith,supra,at conc.dis.opn.of gould.the dissent proposed a rule based on the defendant actions instead of the author intent.it would hold that the cda immunizes a defendant only when the defendant took no active role in selecting the questionable information for publication.if the defendant took an active role in selecting information for publication,the information is no longer information provided by another within the meaning of.ibid.
the dissent reasoned that information actively selected for republication has been transformed bolstered,and strengthened to do more harm if it is wrongful.batzel smith,supra,at conc.dis.opn.of gould.it acknowledged that service providers can not be expected to screen the millions of messages sent over their networks for offensive content.however,it argued that a person who does actively screen communications to select some for republication is able to detect defamatory content and should not be immunized.the dissent would grant immunity to bulletin board moderators and the like if they did not actively select among messages for publication,but would expose them to liability if they made a conscious decision to disseminate a particular defamatory communication.congress goal of encouraging would be furthered,according to the dissent,because those who remove all or part of an offensive message would be immune.the dissenting justice did not believe congress intended to immunize those who select defamatory information for distribution on the internet.id.at.
the batzel majority responded that no logical distinction can be drawn between a defendant who actively selects information for publication and one who screens submitted material,removing offensive content.the scope of the immunity can not turn on whether the publisher approaches the selection process as one of inclusion or removal,as the difference is one of method or degree,not substance.batzel smith,supra,at.we agree with this reasoning.furthermore,we reject the dissent view that actively selected and republished information is no longer information provided by another information content provider under section c.all republications involve a transformation in some sense.a user who actively selects and posts material based on its content fits well within the traditional role of publisher.congress has exempted that role from liability.
as rosenthal points out,the congressional purpose of fostering free speech on the internet supports the extension of section immunity to active individual users.it is they who provide much of the diversity of political discourse,the pursuit of opportunities for cultural development,and the exploration of myriad avenues for intellectual activity that the statute was meant to protect.a.the approach taken by the batzel dissent would tend to chill the free exercise of internet expression,and could frustrate the goal of providing an incentive for.a user who removed some offensive content might face liability for actively selecting the remaining material.users in this position,no less than the service providers discussed by the zeran court,would be motivated to delete marginally offensive material,restricting the scope of online discussion.some users,at least those like rosenthal who engage in internet posting,might be discouraged from screening third party content.although individual users may face the threat of liability less frequently than institutional service providers,their lack of comparable financial and legal resources makes that threat no less intimidating.
we conclude there is no basis for deriving a special meaning for the term user in section c,or any operative distinction between active and passive internet use.by declaring that no user may be treated as a publisher of third party content,congress has comprehensively immunized republication by individual internet users.
conclusion 
we share the concerns of those who have expressed reservations about the zeran court broad interpretation of section immunity.the prospect of blanket immunity for those who intentionally redistribute defamatory statements on the internet has disturbing implications.nevertheless,by its terms section exempts internet intermediaries from defamation liability for republication.the statutory immunity serves to protect online freedom of expression and to encourage,as congress intended.section has been interpreted literally.it does not permit internet service providers or users to be sued as distributors,nor does it expose active users to liability.
plaintiffs are free under section to pursue the originator of a defamatory internet publication.any further expansion of liability must await congressional action.
iii.disposition 
the judgment of the court of appeal is reversed.
concurring opinion by moreno,
i concur in the majority opinion.although there may be a considerable gap between the specific wrongs congress was intending to right in enacting the immunity at issue here and the broad statutory language of that immunity,that gap is ultimately for congress,rather than the courts,to bridge.i write separately to express the view that publishers that conspire with original content providers to defame would not be covered by the immunity provided by title united states code section c and e hereafter section.i further explain why there is no prima facie showing of conspiracy in the present case.
section c states no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.section e states in part no cause of action may be brought and no liability may be imposed under any state or local law that is inconsistent with this section.the majority correctly concludes that this immunity statute does not distinguish between publishers and distributors or between active and passive users.but in my view,this immunity would not apply if the user is in a conspiracy with the information content provider providing the information.
my interpretation is based first on the language of the statute.section c applies only to information provided by another content provider.italics added.a fair reading of this language suggests that the statute was contemplating an authentic transfer of information between two independent parties.but this transfer does not really occur in a conspiracy to defame,nor are the parties themselves authentically independent.in a conspiracy t here must be a preconceived plan and unity of design and purpose,for the common design is of the essence of the conspiracy.fibreboard hartford accident indemnity th,d,italics omitted.when,for example,two parties conspire to defame someone,agreeing that one party will play the role of user and the other,judgment proof,party will play the role of original content provider,then the transfer of information that occurs between the two is a sham,a mere vehicle for the defamation.i do not believe the statutory immunity is intended to apply in such circumstances.
my conclusion is also supported by the legislative history.as the majority states,quoting the seminal case of zeran america online,cir the zeran court reasoned that congress viewed t he imposition of tort liability on service providers for the communications of others as simply another form of intrusive government regulation of speech.zeran,supra,at.while original posters of defamatory speech do not escape accountability,congress made a policy choice not to deter harmful online speech by imposing tort liability on companies that serve as intermediaries for other parties potentially injurious messages.id.at.the court noted that another important purpose of section was to encourage service providers to the dissemination of offensive material over their services.zeran,supra,at.fearing that the specter of liability would deter service providers from blocking and screening offensive material,congress enacted broad immunity,which forbids the imposition of publisher liability on a service provider for the exercise of its editorial and functions.zeran,supra,at,ante,d at,at.
unlike the internet service provider,or even the typical user of an interactive computer service,one engaged in a tortious conspiracy with the original information content provider is hardly one of the neutral intermediaries that congress intended to absolve of liability.imposing liability on such conspirators would not cause service providers to curtail the robust internet communication they facilitate nor inhibit them from engaging in of offensive material.rather,imposition of liability on those who conspire to defame on the internet supports congress intent to impose liability on original posters of defamatory speech,ante,at,at,discouraging collusive arrangements that are designed to maximize the original poster impact minimize his or her liability.
the question then is whether there is a sufficient showing of conspiracy to defame in this case.in order to defeat a motion to strike made pursuant to the strategic lawsuit against public participation statute,when it has been determined that the cause of action against the defendants arises from acts in furtherance of the exercise of free speech or other protected activity under code of civil procedure section,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.navellier sletten cal th,d.plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that ilena rosenthal,tim bolen,and other defendants conspired to defame them.because the trial court concluded that the only potentially defamatory statement was made against terry polevoy,and because it is uncontroverted that bolen was the originator of that statement,plaintiffs can only prevail if they make a prima facie showing that rosenthal and bolen conspired to defame polevoy.
i conclude that plaintiffs have failed to make that showing.the uncontroverted evidence is that rosenthal did not know of polevoy until she read bolen containing the alleged defamatory statement that polevoy stalked canadian radio producer christine mcphee.rosenthal called mcphee,who confirmed bolen statement.her republication of the defamation occurred after that call.
it is true that rosenthal and bolen knew each other before the alleged defamatory was posted and reposted and that they shared some similar views about alternative medicine.it also may well be true that rosenthal investigation of polevoy incident with mcphee fell considerably short of the type of investigation a reasonable person would undertake before republishing potentially defamatory material,inasmuch as she did not contact the appropriate law enforcement authorities to corroborate mcphee story.but these facts are not sufficient to establish a prima facie case of conspiracy to defame polevoy,a preconceived plan and unity of design and purpose on the part of rosenthal and bolen to defame 
it is a closer question whether plaintiffs could have shown a prima facie case of conspiracy by bolen and rosenthal against stephen barrett,since bolen and rosenthal appeared to have shared a history of hostility toward barrett.as the lower courts correctly concluded,however,none of the hostile comments against barrett alleged in the complaint are defamatory.
i therefore conclude the majority is correct in reversing the judgment of the court of appeal.
