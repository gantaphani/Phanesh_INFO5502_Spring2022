here we consider whether a plaintiff in a defamation action subject to the constitutional malice standard established the requisite good cause code civ,subd.g to conduct discovery,thereby delaying resolution of the defendant pending motion we conclude that where,as here,the plaintiff fails to demonstrate the allegedly defamatory statements are provably false factual the plaintiff must do to establish the necessary probability of prevailing on its defamation good cause exists to conduct discovery concerning actual malice.we therefore grant the writ petition,and direct the trial court to vacate its discovery order and enter a new order denying plaintiff discovery motion.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiff and real party in interest ampersand publishing ampersand is the corporate owner of the santa barbara.wendy mccaw,its principal,publishes the newspaper.defendant and petitioner susan paterno directs the journalism program at chapman university in orange,california,and is a senior writer for the american journalism review,a magazine published by the university of maryland.
paterno wrote an article,santa barbara smackdown,for the magazine december issue.the article offered a look at the turmoil engulfing the,including the dismissal or resignation of more than half of its newsroom,leaving others to work in a climate of fear and paranoia ripped from the pages of kafka the trial,the article described mccaw efforts to silence criticism by filing or threatening to file libel lawsuits.
in preparing for the article,paterno spoke with more than a dozen former employees,and reviewed court records and documents.ampersand refused permission to contact current employees its lawyers informed her that such efforts are by no means protected activities and were actionable.ampersand suggested instead that she submit written questions to its public relations and crisis management consultant,which would be reviewed by the appropriate agents and employees,including wendy mccaw,and answered when appropriate.paterno declined the offer.
ampersand filed a libel and trade disparagement lawsuit against paterno for falsely implying that mccaw personal agenda improperly influenced the newspaper reporting.to the contrary,the complaint alleges,ampersand management including mccaw has sought to end bias at the paper original italics.the complaint alleged that paterno article contained libelous statements 
paterno filed a timely special motion to strike under the statute.to prevail on the motion,paterno had to make a threshold showing that her conduct occurred in furtherance of the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e.the burden then would shift to ampersand to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the claim,subd.b.
ampersand conceded paterno statements arose from constitutionally protected activity,thereby meeting the first prong of the statute.but ampersand claimed its evidence demonstrated a probability it would prevail on the merits,thwarting the motion to strike.
ampersand filed a motion for expedited discovery pursuant to section,subdivision g ampersand sought to depose paterno and her editorial assistant hallie falquet to obtain any documents reflect ing,relat ing or refer ring to their preparation of the article.it also sought documents from the american journalism review relating to the article.ampersand claimed this limited discovery was necessary to show paterno subjective state of mind regarding the truth or falsity of her statements.according to the motion,there is a great deal of information with respect to this incident that paterno did not include in her libelous account,and ampersand is entitled to discovery with respect to what paterno knew about the incident,and what information she deliberately chose not to include in her story so as to paint a false picture.
ampersand attorney,stanton stein,attached a declaration to the motion authenticating ampersand proposed document requests and deposition notices.his declaration discussed neither the relevancy nor the need for the discovery,and did not describe whether ampersand made any efforts to obtain the requested information through other means.
at the hearing on the motions,the trial court concluded ampersand had not met its burden to show a probability of success on of the libelous statements because m ost appear as a matter of law to be opinion,or ampersand fails to establish prima facie falsity.the trial court,however,found that ampersand met its burden of proof on of the statements,and subsequently issued a formal order granting ampersand leave to conduct discovery on whether paterno made the following three statements with actual malice 
that orders from on high forced former editor jerry roberts to kill a story about a drunk driving sentence imposed on the editorial page editor,travis armstrong 
that the pursued a workplace restraining order against former employee michael todd,costing him approximately in attorney fees,before dropping the case in october and,
that ampersand slashed benefits and overtime pay for newsroom employees over a period.
the court continued the hearing on paterno motion to allow ampersand to depose paterno and falquet,and obtain the subpoenaed documents.
paterno filed a petition for writ of mandate with this court,contending all the statements were true,and that the third statement amounted to nonactionable opinion.we issued a temporary stay and an order to show cause.ampersand filed a verified return,and paterno filed a reply.
discussiona.the statute good cause requirement for discovery 
ampersand contends relevance is the sole criterion to determine whether a defamation plaintiff may delay a hearing on an motion to conduct discovery on actual malice.according to ampersand,the trial court ruling is consistent with the statute and the case law,which establishes that courts should exercise their discretion liberally when considering a request for discovery regarding the defendant state of mind in defamation cases.having demonstrated to the trial court satisfaction the relevance of the requested discovery on the issue of malice,ampersand argues it satisfied the statute good cause requirement for discovery,subd.g.
relevancy,however,is not the only hurdle a defamation plaintiff must overcome to establish good cause for discovery,given the purpose of legislation.to encourage continued participation in matters of public significance,subd.a,the statute protect s defendants from having to expend resources defending against frivolous slapp suits unless and until a plaintiff establishes the viability of its claim by a prima facie showing.britts superior court th,d britts see also sipple foundation for nat.progress th,d sipple we conclude that to allow appellant such extensive discovery would subvert the intent of the legislation.indeed,t he point of the statute is that you have a right not to be dragged through the courts because you exercised your constitutional rights.varian medical systems,delfino cal th,d,original italics.
the statute reinforces the protections of the first amendment.in krinsky doe th,d,the court directed a trial court to quash a subpoena to discover the identity of an anonymous internet poster.to protect first amendment expression,krinsky required the discovery proponent to make a prima facie showing the message board statement was libelous.see,libel defined as defamation effected in writing.requiring at least that much ensures that the plaintiff is not merely seeking to harass or embarrass the speaker or stifle legitimate criticism.krinsky,at,d.
the constitutional malice standard under new york times sullivan,d,protects freedom of expression by requiring public figure plaintiffs who bring defamation actions to plead and prove falsehood,and to further establish actual malice by clear and convincing evidence.see christian research institute alnor th,d christian research.to state a defamation claim that survives a first amendment challenge,thus,plaintiff must present evidence of a statement of fact that is provably false.nygard,th,d nygard see,italics added defamation requires a false and unprivileged publication that exposes any person to hatred,contempt,ridicule,or obloquy,or which causes him to be shunned or avoided,or which has a tendency to injure him in his occupation.
accordingly,plaintiffs who bring defamation actions subject to the constitutional malice standard can not show good cause for discovery on the question of actual malice without making a prima facie showing that the defendant published statements contain provably false factual assertions.trial judges should refrain from ordering unnecessary,expensive and burdensome discovery proceedings if it appears from the slapp motion there are significant issues as to falsity or which the plaintiff should be able to establish without discovery garment workers center superior court th,d garment workers no good cause for discovery under,subd.g,on issue of actual malice because trial court failed to determine whether defendant allegedly defamatory statements were false.
our supreme court explored,in mitchell superior court cal d,mitchell,the first amendment underpinnings for the rule that a plaintiff must demonstrate falsity before obtaining invasive and expensive discovery concerning the defendant allegedly malicious mental state.in mitchell,the supreme court issued a writ of prohibition to block a plaintiff efforts to engage in discovery from a couple who furnished the allegedly defamatory information to reader digest magazine.the plaintiff,synanon,wanted to review all documents available to the couple in order to prove that they selectively relied on some documentary evidence and ignored other evidence more favorable to synanon.id.at.to safeguard the freedom of expression enshrined in the first amendment,the high court concluded a plaintiff in such circumstances must make a prima facie showing that the alleged defamatory statements are false before requiring disclosure.id.at.the court reasoned,t he falsity of the charges should be drawn into question and established as a jury issue before discovery is compelled,because to routinely grant motions seeking compulsory disclosure without first inquiring into the substance of a libel allegation would utterly emasculate fundamental principles ibid.
in analogous situations involving other fundamental constitutional rights,such as the right to privacy,courts have required discovery proponents to demonstrate a compelling public interest for discovery which is directly relevant to the litigation.discovery of constitutionally protected information is on a par with discovery of privileged information and is more narrowly proscribed than traditional discovery.tylo superior court th,d trial court in a wrongful termination case abused its discretion in ordering former employee to answer questions relating to her marital relationship.because the requested material is constitutionally protected,the ordinary yardstick for discoverability,that the information sought may lead to relevant evidence,is inapplicable.juarez boy scouts of america,th,d see also planned parenthood golden gate superior court th,d appellate court reversed discovery order requiring staff members of family planning nonprofit organization to reveal home addresses and telephone numbers to litigants discovery proponents have not demonstrated a need for the discovery which would justify an invasion of the substantial privacy interests involved barrenda superior court th,d,italics added proponent in sexual molestation case failed to show good cause that discovery was both relevant and necessary to determine the cause of plaintiffs emotional distress.
ampersand misconstrues dicta in lafayette morehouse,chronicle publishing th,d lafayette morehouse,an early case,for the proposition that trial courts should liberally allow discovery in defamation cases.the court in lafayette morehouse affirmed the dismissal of a libel action against a newspaper because the statute applied to news reporting activities.the court hinted,in dicta,that trial courts should liberally exercise their discretion to authorize reasonable discovery when evidence to establish a prima facie case is reasonably shown to be held,or known,by defendant or its agents and employees.lafayette morehouse,at,d,italics added.
the lafayette morehouse decision predate s the amendment requiring a broad interpretation of section.damon ocean hills journalism club th,d.accordingly,we join the courts that have limited the reach of lafayette morehouse language.damon,at,d see also nygard,supra,th at,d holding that lafayette morehouse applied too narrow a definition of public forum in the context of newspaper and magazine articles.
here,as we explain below,ampersand has not introduced sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of falsity or unprivileged statements.consequently,the trial court erred in permitting discovery concerning paterno actual malice.absent the prerequisite of provably false facts nygard,supra,th at,d garment workers,supra,th at,d,no good cause supported the discovery order,which we therefore countermand 
paterno had no constitutional obligation to include in her article ampersand explanation concerning its decision not to run a story about travis armstrong drunk driving sentence 
the trial court permitted discovery into whether paterno harbored actual malice when her article stated that former editor jerry roberts was ordered to kill a story about the editorial page editor sentence and when reporter dawn hobbs returned from court with a report on armstrong drunk driving sentence,o rders from on high forced roberts to kill hobbs story,says then deputy managing editor murphy 
ampersand never contested the literal truth of these statements.mccaw herself wrote a letter to the society of professional journalists stating that management decided to kill the story about the drunk driving sentence imposed on travis armstrong,the newspaper editorial page editor.
ampersand nevertheless argues,and the trial court apparently agreed,that paterno article could be deemed false because she omitted material facts available to her ampersand contends paterno statements about killing a story,while true,are actionable because the gist and sting of the article was that the story was killed because the publishers were directing the news content to protect favored employees,such as armstrong.this is not true.
ampersand specifically takes paterno to task for failing to mention that the newspaper had previously published an article concerning armstrong arrest for drunk driving on may.in a declaration filed in ampersand opposition,armstrong described his complaints to senior management about the unfairness of this story given roberts open animosity to him.as part of ampersand opposition,copublisher arthur von wiesenberger declared that he directed roberts not to publish any further stories about armstrong dui sentence because it appeared unethical for roberts to use his position as editor to carry out what seemed to be a vendetta against armstrong.reduced to essentials,this defamation claim arises out of paterno failure to include ampersand side of the story.
this novel theory of liability,which paterno describes as defamation by omissions,fails.media defendants are liable for calculated falsehoods,not for their failure to achieve some undefined level of objectivity.slanted reporting,however,does not by itself constitute malice.christian research,supra,th at,d.paterno truthful statements enjoy first amendment protection and,in publishing them,she is entitled to a reasonable degree of flexibility in the choice of language reader digest superior court cal d,reader digest.
reader digest illustrates the leeway guaranteed to the press under the first amendment mandate.the case grew out of the same core facts as mitchell,but involved the reporters instead of their sources.in reader digest,the california supreme court issued a writ of mandate to compel dismissal of synanon defamation lawsuit against the reporters for their description of a battle between synanon and the publishers of a small town newspaper in marin county.we recognize a potential chilling effect from protracted litigation as well as a public interest i
