background 
this action is an appeal from a grant of summary judgment,therefore we recite the facts in the light most favorable to fiacco as.see,franceschi dep t of veterans affairs,cir.fiacco was the director of the office of community standards,rights and responsibilities office of community standards at the university of maine at orono umo.in this capacity,fiacco oversaw the student discipline process at umo he reviewed allegations of misconduct assigned case managers to handle grievances referred cases to umo administrators or the conduct committee for adjudication and occasionally adjudicated cases himself,subject to review by the conduct committee.fiacco also developed policy statements concerning the student code of conduct and his office,and he answered questions on such matters from members of the umo community.
in,fiacco office started investigating maine alpha for misconduct.in response,a group of current and former maine alpha members led by jay sexton collectively,the sexton group hired a private investigator to uncover evidence of any bias fiacco might hold against sae or fraternities in general.the investigator found several court records and newspaper articles dating back to fiacco college years.those documents revealed fiacco past involvement in two legal proceedings a conviction for driving while ability impaired dwai that resulted in his departure from the post of director of public safety at fort lewis college in colorado,and a temporary restraining order secured against him by a former girlfriend.the documents gave no indication that fiacco was biased against fraternities or,in particular,sae.
the sexton group made copies of these documents and assembled them into packages containing the following unsigned memorandum 
enclosed please find newspaper articles and court documents detailing fiacco previous legal difficulties dwi,sexual harassment,and domestic violence.is this honestly the best qualified candidate the university of maine could find for the office of judicial affairs 
the packages were addressed to the university of maine system board of trustees,umo president peter hoff,several umo deans and two local newspapers,the bangor daily news and the maine campus.they were placed in a box and mailed to a maine alpha alumnus in colorado,who then anonymously sent the packages to the intended recipients.
fiacco asserts that the disclosure of this information and the surreptitious manner in which it was disseminated caused him great distress.as a result he became depressed and withdrawn,and his concentration and work performance suffered.he also experienced bouts of insomnia,nightmares,and,and had to obtain psychological counseling.

ii.discussion 
standard of review 
summary judgment is appropriate when the record shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.we review the grant of such a motion de novo.gte wireless,cellexis int l,cir.in doing so,we are obliged to view the entire record in the light most hospitable to the party opposing summary judgment,indulging all reasonable inferences in that party favor.smith,cir.nonetheless,we ignore conclusory allegations,improbable inferences,and unsupported speculation.su√°rez pueblo int l,cir citing reynolds tobacco,cir.with specific regard to fiacco iied claim,whether a plaintiff is a public official or public figure is an issue of law that we review de novo.dixon int l of police officers,cir.
intentional infliction of emotional distress 
under maine law,fiacco iied claim survives summary judgment if the facts establish that sae intentionally or recklessly inflicted severe emotional distress or was certain or substantially certain that such distress would result from its conduct sae conduct was so extreme and outrageous as to exceed all possible bounds of decency and must be regarded as atrocious,utterly intolerable in a civilized community sae actions caused fiacco emotional distress and fiacco emotional distress was so severe that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it.curtis porter,me internal quotation omitted accord wytrwal saco sch,cir.
in order to give adequate breathing space to the freedoms protected by the first amendment,the supreme court has established an additional requisite for iied recovery where the distress is alleged to have been caused by published speech public officials and public figures may only recover if they can prove that the publication that harmed them contained a false statement of fact that was made with actual malice.hustler magazine falwell,d accord mandel boston phoenix,cir quoting new york times sullivan,d.we now revisit the district court designation of fiacco as a public official.
public official 
identifying a public official for the purpose of applying the actual malice standard is not an unequivocal process.not every public employee is a public official,hutchinson proxmire,d,but it is not clear how far down into the lower ranks of government employees the designation extends,new york times,at.only those public employees with substantial responsibility for or control over the conduct of governmental affairs,however,should be considered public officials.see rosenblatt baer,d.
this circuit has devised a test to identify public officials in the libel context.we now apply this test to fiacco iied claim as it too stems from a published statement that is alleged to have caused harm.a public official,then,is a person who holds a position of influence over issues of public importance,as defined by the position inherent attributes has special access to the media as a means of and assumed the risk of diminished privacy upon taking on the position.mandel,at.fiacco asserts that he does not qualify as a public official under any of these factors.our analysis under mandel,however,is heavily dependent on the facts averred and our thorough review of the record leads to the conclusion that fiacco does warrant this designation.
the inherent attributes of fiacco position as director of the office of community standards demonstrate that he exercises influence over issues of public importance.the inside a state university are of interest to the public because state colleges such as umo are funded with tax revenue,and it is to be expected that the public will want to know how its money is being managed and spent.see kassel gannett,cir stating that taxpayers have a general interest in the oversight of any employment.while fiacco office might address issues as mundane as the enforcement of dorm quiet hours,it is also responsible for the handling of much more sensitive situations such as allegations of date rape and hazing.these types of matters are of clear public importance and,as the office director,fiacco has a strong influence over the handling of such matters because he sets the policies and either adjudicates or picks the adjudicators who will address such grievances.the first mandel factor therefore weighs in favor of finding fiacco to be a public official.
