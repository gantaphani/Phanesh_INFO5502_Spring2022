background 
brunette,a old widow,operates a pedigreed cat breeding business on her eleven acre ranch and avocado farm in the unincorporated portion of ojai,california.brunette property is rugged and hilly,bordered by los padres national forest.fencing surrounds the entire property.entrance is possible only by traversing a frontage road and passing through a locked gate.a no trespass sign further dissuades unexpected visitors.a paved driveway snaking up a steep hill from the frontage road leads to brunette modest home.
in june,concerned citizens reported to the humane society that brunette was selling cats that looked sick,with eyes matted shut and covered in flies and feces.the humane society was created by special california statute,and it engages in a function.cal.humane society officers are invested with authority to investigate reports of animal cruelty,impound animals,place liens on property,and bring criminal charges against citizens.id.the humane society and its officers are state actors for the purposes of.
initially,the humane society visited brunette ranch and issued an administrative notice of correction,which directed brunette to seek veterinary care for some of her cats.the humane society then sought and obtained a search warrant for brunette ranch,including all rooms in the residence,and outbuildings and vehicles.the warrant authorized the humane society to seize sick,injured or dead animals,medications,and all documents evidencing the treatment of animals,as well as to photograph the premises.
just prior to executing the warrant,the humane society invited the ojai news and local television station kady channel to accompany the search of brunette ranch.the ojai news circulates in a largely agrarian community for which stories about animals hold considerable interest.not surprisingly,the ojai news agreed to send dewar to cover the search.kady,however,declined the humane society invitation to attend.
warrant in hand,the humane society proceeded to brunette ranch.dewar was supposed to arrive at the ranch separately in his own vehicle.accordingly,the humane society sought to delay commencement of the search until dewar arrived at the ranch.despite these efforts at delay,however,dewar arrived after the humane society had severed brunette gate lock and begun the search.when dewar finally arrived,officers stationed at brunette driveway invited him onto the property to observe the search and to take photographs for publication in the ojai news.dewar only role during the search was to gather information as a reporter and a photographer.he rendered no assistance to the humane society and in no way facilitated its ability to search the premises.ultimately,the humane society seized nearly forty cats,one doberman pinscher,and twelve feisty ducklings from brunette ranch.none of the animals seized was diseased,injured,or deceased.
subsequently,dewar wrote and the ojai news published numerous articles and editorials decrying brunette mistreatment of animals and impugning her character.one article even suggested a m andatory psychiatric evaluation to allow us an insight into brunette world which few of us can comprehend,appreciate,or sympathize.most of the articles contained a photograph of a sickly animal,though some of the animals pictured were not owned by brunette.
as a result of this search and investigation,the ojai sheriff charged brunette with criminal animal neglect.brunette moved to suppress all the fruits of the search of her ranch.the superior court for the county of ventura,appellate department,ruled that at the time of the search,the humane society lacked statutory authority to execute search warrants and therefore,its search of brunette ranch violated the fourth amendment.the court consequently granted brunette motion to suppress and dismissed the charges against her.
seeking further vindication,brunette filed this action against the media and the humane society,alleging a violation of her fourth amendment rights as well as a panoply of state law causes of action,including a violation of her state constitutional rights,trespass,invasion of privacy,conspiracy,conversion,and infliction of emotional distress.brunette settled her suit against the humane society.the media filed a motion to dismiss brunette complaint for failure to state a claim.the district court granted this motion to dismiss.
brunette appealed.

discussion 
brunette claims that the media violated her constitutional right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures under the fourth amendment see dennis sparks,d recognizing suit for a private party violation of another fourth amendment rights.although most rights secured by the constitution are protected only against infringements by the government,lugar edmondson oil,d,in certain circumstances,a litigant may seek damages under from a private party based on a violation of a constitutional right.section liability extends to a private party where the private party engaged in state action under color of law and thereby deprived a plaintiff of some right,privilege,or immunity protected by the constitution or the laws of the united states.haygood younger,cir en banc.
as the first step in establishing the media liability,brunette must sufficiently plead that the media engaged in state action.whether a private party engaged in state action is a highly factual question.howerton gabica,cir citing burton wilmington parking,d.crucial is the nature and extent of the relationship between the humane society and the media.see lugar,at.only by sifting facts and weighing circumstances can we hope to ferret out obvious as well as state involvement in private conduct.burton,at.several tests have emerged to evaluate whether a private actor has engaged in state action.
brunette asks us to consider three distinct tests,each of which,she claims,independently demonstrates that the media engaged in state action during the search of her ranch.first,the joint action test examines whether private actors are willful participants in joint action with the government or its agents.see dennis,at.second,and derivative of the joint action test,the symbiotic relationship test asks whether the government has so far insinuated itself into a position of interdependence with a private entity that the private entity must be recognized as a joint participant in the challenged activity.see rendell baker kohn,d.last,the public functions test inquires whether the private actor performs functions traditionally and exclusively reserved to the states.see flagg brooks,d.
joint action test 
brunette most strenuously complains that the media,in cahoots with the humane society,unconstitutionally searched her ranch and seized her property.brunette contends that because the media and the humane society acted jointly,the otherwise private media became a state actor liable under.
the house of every one is to him as his castle and fortress,as well for his defence against injury and violence,as for his repose.wilson layne,d quoting semayne case,eng.no one doubts brunette house is her castle or that her ranch is her kingdom
