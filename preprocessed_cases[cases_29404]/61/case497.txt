the,lisa lawson lawson,filed this action for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prohibit the public dissemination of information concerning the death of her husband,duane lawson lawson,by various government officials.these officials include vincent meconi meconi,secretary of the department of health and social services,richard callery callery,medical examiner of the state of delaware,judith tobin,tobin,assistant medical examiner for the state of delaware,keith banks banks,the city of rehoboth beach police department chief of police,kenneth mcmahon mcmahon,chairman of delaware state fire prevention commission,and willard preston,iii preston,fire marshal of the state of delaware specifically,lawson seeks to preclude the defendants from releasing the report of the autopsy performed on lawson,or the confidential information contained therein,to the public.in support of her position,she relies upon title,section of the delaware code title,section,et.of the delaware code and the common law right to privacy.
the court of chancery issued a memorandum opinion and order denying lawson request for a preliminary injunction on the grounds that lawson did not show a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits of her claims.the court of chancery held that the statutes relied upon by lawson do not preclude the public release of her husband autopsy report by the defendants.the court also held that delaware does not recognize a common law right of privacy for a deceased individual or the family members of the decedent.
this court accepted lawson interlocutory appeal of the memorandum opinion and order.lawson then filed a motion seeking to stay the effect of the memorandum opinion and order pending the outcome of this appeal.lawson also filed a motion for all briefs and appendices to be filed under seal.this court entered an order granting lawson motion to stay and motion to seal.
we have concluded that lawson is entitled to permanent injunctive relief.our decision is based upon the applicable delaware statutes.therefore,it is unnecessary to address the common law right of privacy basis for her claim.
on february,lawson died in a car fire in rehoboth beach,delaware.lawson death was initially investigated by both the city of rehoboth beach police department the police department and the state fire marshal the fire marshal.at approximately,lawson body was removed from the scene by an agent of the office of the chief medical examiner.
on february,assistant state medical examiner judith tobin,performed an autopsy on lawson body.neither lisa lawson,lawson widow,nor anyone else from his family consented to the autopsy.nor did the state attorney general office request it.however,the medical examiner has the discretion to perform an autopsy without such consent or request 
in the course of that autopsy procedure,tobin took samples from lawson body in order to perform toxicology tests.on february,tobin completed a pending certificate of death for lawson and filed it with the office of vital statistics.on march,the toxicology report was completed on the samples drawn from lawson body.tobin then completed the autopsy report and sent the final certificate of death to the office of vital statistics.the toxicology report,autopsy report,certificate of death,and the related examination record,contain information relating to the circumstances and cause of lawson death.those items will be referred to collectively in this opinion as the autopsy information.
after conducting the autopsy,tobin concluded that lawson death was an accident,and that no further investigation was warranted.on march,tobin faxed a copy of the examination record and autopsy report to the police department.tobin wrote on the fax cover sheet that the transmittal was confidential information.
the police department has stated that no foul play was involved in lawson death.similarly,the fire marshal has preliminarily concluded that there was no foul play involved in the car fire,and that the fire was an accident.neither of these agencies has referred the matter to the attorney general office for further investigation.
the circumstances surrounding lawson death have been widely reported in the delaware press.however,the autopsy information has not been made public.in order to clarify the situation and dispel certain rumors,chief keith banks of the police department has stated that he would like to issue a press release containing information from the autopsy and examination record relating to the cause of death.in addition,the general policy of the fire marshal office is to share its reports with insurance companies.the fire marshal intends to do so with its report of lawson death.
lawson brought this suit to enjoin the police department and the fire marshal from publicly disclosing information contained in the autopsy,certificate of death,toxicology report,and the examination record that lawson contends is protected,private information.lawson seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction precluding the defendants from disclosing this information to the public.
standard of review 
this court generally reviews the denial of a motion for a preliminary injunction under the abuse of discretion standard.however,the court of chancery legal conclusions are subject to de novo review in this appeal,lawson challenges the court of chancery legal conclusions concerning the interpretation of several delaware statutes and the scope of the common law right to privacy in delaware.accordingly,the applicable standard of appellate review is de novo.
medical examiners statute 
title,chapter of the delaware code is titled medical examiners.this statute sets forth the powers and responsibilities of the chief medical examiner and his or her assistants and deputies collectively,medical examiners,including the power to investigate deaths and conduct autopsies under title,sections e and b and c,only certain persons are entitled to receive the report of an autopsy performed by the medical examiner the next of kin and the attorney general 
title,section e of the delaware code provides that upon written request 
the next of kin of the deceased shall receive a copy of the postmortem examination report,the autopsy report and the laboratory reports,unless there shall be a criminal prosecution pending in which case no such reports shall be released until the criminal prosecution shall have been finally concluded 
accordingly,lawson was entitled to,and has received,a copy of the autopsy report issued in connection with lawson death.
under to title,sections b and c,the attorney general may also receive copies of autopsies and other records if i further investigation is deemed advisable in the judgment of the medical examiner or ii the attorney general requests any such records from the medical examiner according to tobin deposition testimony,the attorney general did not request copies of the autopsy report,nor did she send copies to the attorney general,because she concluded that lawson death was accidental.
lawson argues that under the medical examiners statute the medical examiner has the authority to provide autopsy reports or information derived therefrom only to the attorney general and the family of the decedent.the court of chancery acknowledged that that is a possible reading of this law.nevertheless,the court of chancery concluded that 
reading this statute to strictly limit the ability of the medical examiners to share information with other officials would doubtless interfere with the normal functioning of medical examiners by preventing them from sharing potentially important information with police in the course of an investigation,except through the intermediation of the attorney general.
in this case,the police department and the medical examiner both properly began an investigation that required them,in the performance of their duties,to share information about the cause of lawson death.the interpretation of the statute advocated by lawson would effectively end communication,between the medical examiner,conducting a statutorily mandated investigation into the medical cause of death and the police,unless the atto
