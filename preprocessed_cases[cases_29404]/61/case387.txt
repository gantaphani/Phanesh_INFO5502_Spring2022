in concluding that detroit news violated the act,the board purported to apply the test set forth in wright line,wl.wright line outlines the general framework for assessing whether an employee discharge that turns on employer motivation violates a and by extension a of the act.as the board explained 
t he general counsel must first persuade,by a preponderance of the evidence,that an employee protected conduct was a motivating factor in the employer decision.
if the general counsel makes such a showing,the burden of persuasion shifts to the employer to demonstrate that the same action would have taken place even in the absence of the protected conduct.
detroit news,wl,at quoting wright line,at.
detroit news argues that the board lacked the substantial evidence necessary to find that the general counsel met its burden of proof on the first prong of wright line.as we read the board decision,detroit news certainly seems to be correct.none of the board three findings that are offered to show that hydorn protected conduct was a motivating factor in the employer decision to fire him appear to be supported by substantial evidence.
in the board brief and at oral argument,however,board counsel argued that the board also relied implicitly on a fourth hydorn was treated differently than adherents who had committed the same support of its conclusion that hydorn protected conduct was a motivating factor in his discharge.this claim is not articulated in the section of the board decision discussing the first prong of wright line.it is examined,however,in the board analysis of the second prong of wright line.we do not know what to make of the board decision.in situations where we can not discern the precise basis upon which the board rested in reaching its conclusion,meaningful judicial review requires us to remand the case to the board for clarification of its position on the issue palace sports entm t,nlrb.we therefore reserve judgment on the merits of the board order and remand the case for further consideration consistent with this decision.
background 
factual background 
the events leading to this case occurred at detroit news north plant,a printing facility located in sterling heights,michigan,a suburb north of detroit.one of the north plant production functions is the placement of advertising supplements into the newspapers and comics produced by detroit news.this process is facilitated by insert machines,which are manned by multiple material handlers or mailers and one machine operator.
at various points around the insert machines,there are heads,which contain the supplements.the advertising inserts at each head drop into buckets that travel in a circuit around the machine between the various heads.at the conclusion of the circuit,the bottom of each bucket opens and drops the section onto a conveyor.this conveyor then transports the section to a stacker,a machine that readies the sections to be tied together and placed onto trucks for delivery.
material handlers work at the heads positioned around the machine.they are responsible for loading the advertising inserts into the heads,and may be assigned to more than one head at a time.the operators,who are stationed at a computer at one end of the machine,are responsible for directing the work group and running the computer that helps the machine function properly.
a common challenge faced by operators occurs when a paper drag stops the operation.this happens when one of the buckets opens up to release the insert onto the conveyor line,but closes before the paper falls completely through.the bucket then drags the trapped insert around the insert machine circuit.when this occurs,a sensor shuts down the machine until the paper drag is cleared by removing the misfed paper and,if necessary,resetting the machine.
thomas hydorn began working for detroit news in,when he took a position in the mailroom.hydorn worked his way up to status,becoming a material handler,a position he occupied for to years.for the most part,hydorn had an unblemished personnel record,earning only one disciplinary he was a employee.prior to the incident that led to his discharge in august,hydorn received no other discipline of any kind.
in,hydorn was one of many detroit news employees who participated in a strike when negotiations between the company and various unions,including local,reached an impasse.hydorn was neither a union leader nor an otherwise prominent member of the striking unit,although he did participate in picketing the company.in february,after the strike proved fruitless,the union made an unconditional offer on behalf of strikers to return to work.hydorn and the other striking workers were not permitted to return immediately,because detroit news had hired replacement workers to take their jobs during the strike.the striker replacements were retained at the end of the strike and returning strikers were placed on a preferential hiring list.see detroit typographical union nlrb.
hydorn was eventually rehired to his former position as a material handler in august,two and a half years after the strike had ended.prior to the resumption of his duties,hydorn was required to attend an orientation conducted by company director karen zemnickas,the north plant management official in charge of the work and discipline of the local members.at the orientation,zemnickas discussed the material handlers duties and distributed supplementary written materials.she told the returning employees that they should do the job as they had done it before,although they may now be called upon to work at more than one station.during this reorientation training,zemnickas overlooked one important change in the material handler job,which required the opposed to the operators,whose responsibility it had been in the clear any paper drags that occurred.in addition,the new rule required that the handler nearest the paper drag was obligated to remove it.
on the evening of august,shortly after hydorn returned to work,he was assigned to an insert machine with fellow material handler john dutka and operator william mihalik.while some of the material facts relating to what occurred on this evening are in dispute,we will assume,for the purposes of this analysis only,that the board version of the events is correct.
midway through the night shift,at about,a paper drag occurred near the stations at the insert machine where hydorn and dutka were working.mihalik signaled the two men by calling out paper drag and told them to clear it.in accordance with detroit news policy,since dutka was closer to the machine,the paper drag was his responsibility.dutka therefore left his work station and cleared it.upon witnessing dutka action,hydorn,who was under the impression that clearing paper drags was the operator duty,told dutka not to do it.hydorn then pointed at mihalik and told dutka that it was the operator job and that was why he got paid the big dollars.detroit news,wl,at.mihalik responded to this verbal assault by summoning one of the night shift supervisors,casey leach.
when leach arrived and was apprised of the situation by mihalik,he informed hydorn that it was,in fact,the material handlers job to clear paper drags.an insolent hydorn replied that he would not clear them,even if it meant that he would be suspended or fired.leach then brought over another supervisor,louis monroig,who was the acting manager.monroig asked hydorn if he understood that leach had given him a direct order,and hydorn again stated that he would not remove paper drags,because that was not his job.monroig then demanded that hydorn follow him to his office,at which point hydorn requested union representation.
shortly thereafter,monroig and leach met in the office with hydorn and harold sorenson,a union steward.sorenson confirmed to hydorn that it was,in fact,his responsibility to clear paper drags.hydorn held steadfast in his insistence that it was the operator job,however,and told both leach and monroig that he simply would not do it.as a result,monroig suspended hydorn and told him to turn in his identification card.hydorn surrendered his card to sorenson and was escorted out of the plant.
later that morning,zemnickas was informed about the hydorn incident while attending a company golf outing.while at the outing,zemnickas met with the north plant manager,mike martin,and the company senior legal counsel and labor relations director,john taylor.zemnickas then interviewed monroig and leach,and had them submit written statements.zemnickas did not speak with hydorn,mihalik,or dutka.
after receiving all of the relevant information,zemnickas again consulted with taylor,and determined that hydorn should be discharged.the company issued a discharge letter to hydorn on august,informing him that he was being terminated due to his refusal to follow the instructions and the direct order given by his supervisor.letter from mike martin,manager,detroit newspapers,to thomas hydorn,discharge letter,joint appendix.
the union responded by filing a formal grievance with the company on september.at a grievance meeting held between the parties on october,hydorn apologized for his behavior and stated that he had been guilty of having a bad attitude.br.for nlrb at.detroit news nevertheless rejected hydorn appeal on october,reiterating that hydorn refus ed to follow the instructions of his supervisor.see letter from john taylor,detroit newspapers,to alex young,detroit mailers union.
b.the board decision 
after failing to overturn hydorn discharge through an internal grievance procedure,the union filed an unfair labor practice charge against detroit news,alleging that hydorn discharge violated a and of the act.an administrative law judge alj presided over a hearing on march,and found that hydorn was discharged unlawfully because of his union and protected activities.decision june,slip op.at.detroit news appealed the alj decision to the board.
more than four years later,a panel of the board issued a decision upholding the alj finding that hydorn was discharged in violation of the act.detroit news,wl,at.through the application of the wright line formula,the board found that hydorn participation in the strike was a motivating factor in his discharge,and the company assertion that it would have fired hydorn regardless of any alleged antiunion animus was undercut by evidence of its disparate treatment of hydorn.id.at.
the board conclusion under the first prong of wright line explicitly relied on three elements of the union case.first,the board asserted that hydorn was disciplined for misconduct he did not commit.id.at.according to the board,detroit news informed hydorn that he was being fired because he refus ed to follow the instructions and the direct order given by his supervisor.id.quoting discharge letter,supra.the board concluded that this was a false reason for the termination,because hydorn never defied a direct order to remedy a pending paper drag,just a hypothetical one.see id.quotation marks omitted emphasis added.thus,according to the board,hydorn could not have refused to follow a direct order.
the board also found the backdrop against which the discharge took place to be suggestive of an unlawful company motive.id.at.the board noted that the union strike had been prolonged and bitter and spawned numerous unfair labor practice charges,and union members were forced to return to work without an agreement.id.the board contended that the strikers returned to altered working conditions,which among other things,left them without the benefit of their former seniority system.id.in addition,the board credited comments allegedly made by monroig to union steward sorenson that the strike had been a mistake,their return was an unconditional surrender,the unions were at fault,and that union employees had ruined everything.id.
finally,the board found that detroit news failed both to investigate fully the circumstances surrounding hydorn suspension,id.at,and consider whether hydorn offense warranted application of its progressive discipline policy,id.at.in terms of the company investigation,the board claimed that it neglected to follow its own guidelines for employee discipline.id.at.these guidelines were not formally promulgated procedures rather,they were the themes allegedly discussed by john taylor,detroit news senior legal counsel,at a workshop he conducted on disciplinary issues held the morning prior to the hydorn incident.in the notes prepared for the seminar,taylor outlined that an internal investigation should be thorough and should provide the subject of the investigation with an opportunity to respond.id.quoting john taylor,issues workshop,detroit newspaper agency,taylor workshop.the board found that detroit news investigation failed to meet either of these requirements,as zemnickas review of the incident canvassed only management employees,and never involved a statement from hydorn.for the board,that review was cursory,and was further evidence of antiunion animus.id.the board also found that the company subsequent choice of punishment was impulsive,as zemnickas did not take into account that this was hydorn first offense for insubordination,and that he had a good personnel record throughout his tenure with the company.id.at.
once the board determined that the general counsel met its burden of proving that hydorn protected activity served as a substantial factor in the company decision to discharge him,it then moved to wright line second prong and questioned whether detroit news could show that it would have taken the same action even in the absence of hydorn protected activity.the board concluded that the company defense fell short,because it found that detroit news engaged in disparate treatment in disciplining hydorn.id.at.specifically,the board found the record replete with evidence that the company treated hydorn more harshly than nonstrikers who engaged in similar conduct.id.
in light of these findings,the board ordered detroit news to cease and desist from discharging or otherwise discriminating against employees in order to discourage union activity.in addition,it ordered the company to offer hydorn full reinstatement and to make him whole for any loss of earnings that he may have suffered due to the company discrimination.
ii.analysis 
a.the board case under wright line first prong 
detroit news argues that the board wright line analysis should not have advanced beyond the first prong,as the board general counsel was unable to establish any concrete connection between hydorn protected participation in the strike from his eventual discharge.the company takes exception to each of the board findings supporting its justification for the conclusion that hydorn protected conduct was a motivating factor in his discharge.whether taken separately or as a whole,detroit news asserts that the record evidence clearly shows that hydorn was fired solely for his blatant insubordination.
our review of the board findings of fact is limited to whether they are supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.palace sports,at quoting e f.but while the board findings are entitled to respect,they must nonetheless be set aside when the record clearly precludes the board decision from being justified by a fair estimate of the worth of the testimony of witnesses or its informed judgment on matters within its special competence or both.universal camera nlrb.thus,a reviewing court is not barred from setting aside a board decision when it can not conscientiously find that the evidence supporting that decision is substantial,when viewed in the light that the record in its entirety furnishes,including the body of evidence opposed to the board view.epilepsy found.of ne ohio nlrb,quoting universal camera,at.
as noted above,the board offered three primary reasons for holding that the general counsel met its burden of proving that hydorn protected activity was a motivating factor in his discharge.we evaluate each of the board contentions below.
discharge for misconduct 
hydorn was informed by letter that his discharge was the result of his refusal to follow the instructions and the direct order given by his supervisor.discharge letter,supra.it is undisputed that hydorn repeatedly told his supervisors that he would never perform the required work.this defiance continued even after the supervisors position was confirmed by the union steward,whose presence hydorn requested.indeed,hydorn went so far as to say that the employer would have to fire him before he would comply.therefore,the discharge letter was accurate in stating that hydorn had refused to follow the instructions and direct orders of his supervisors.
this notwithstanding,the board found that the respondent stated reason for discharging hydorn is false.detroit news,wl,at.why because,according to the board,while hydorn may have exhibited insubordinate behavior on august,we agree with the alj that he never defied a direct order to remedy a pending paper drag.id.quoting decision,slip op.at.at oral argument,the board counsel attempted to explain the board theory who knows what would have happened if they had actually let hydorn process the papers he may have agreed to do it.recording of oral argument at.
the board claim is disingenuous.hydorn precipitated the incident leading to his discharge by stating,in unequivocal terms,that he would not perform the specific,clearly delineated duties associated with his job.an employee like hydorn can refuse to follow a direct order to perform specific work that is pending at the time the order is given,or he can refuse to perform that work when it arises in the future.in either case,the refusal to perform the duties of the job is a flagrant act of insubordination.in other words,in either instance,an employee who,like hydorn,says he will not perform work that is within the compass of his assigned duties has flatly defied the instructions of management.the orders given to hydorn were not hypothetical and neither were hydorn refusals.therefore,we find that detroit news discharge notice to hydorn was not false,as the board found,in stating that hydorn was fired for his refusal to follow the instructions and the direct order given by his supervisor.
the backdrop of the discharge 
to support its contention that the acrimonious backdrop of the discharge was evidence of discriminatory motive,the board referenced the prolonged and bitter strike and the antiunion sentiments allegedly expressed by a company supervisor.without more,however,these claims are virtually meaningless.the strike ended over two and a half years prior to hydorn return,and there is nothing in the record to indicate that there was reason for the company to single out hydorn for negative treatment.the only evidence offered was that hydorn had picketed along with many other striking union members.it was never alleged,however,that he was a union leader or that he had any exceptional with the company as part of his union activity.nothing indicates that he was singled out for bad treatment when he returned to work.and there is not one iota of evidence relied upon by the board in its wright line analysis to suggest that the employer engaged in a pattern or practice of negative treatment aimed at returning strikers.
the alleged antiunion statements made by supervisor monroig also offer little to the board case.first,it is unclear whether monroig actually uttered those statements,as the lone testimony supporting this claim came from union steward harold sorenson,who the alj found to be very lacking in credibility.see decision,slip op.at.and while the board notes that the alj credited sorenson testimony where it was not contradicted by other witnesses,see detroit news,wl,at,it failed to note that the alj did not rely on sorenson monroig testimony to support his finding of antiunion animus.second,it appears that those alleged statements were made only to sorenson.see trial tr.at.monroig alleged passing comments to sorenson hardly constructed a viable backdrop against which to assess the company discipline of hydorn.finally,monroig was not directly involved in the final decision to terminate hydorn,so any potential impact he had on that decision was necessarily circumscribed.
failure to investigate and progressive discipline 
the board final rationale supporting its decision is that detroit news both failed to thoroughly investigate the incident leading to hydorn suspension and discharge,thereby contravening its own guidelines,and neglected to adhere to its progressive discipline policy.detroit news,wl,at.these arguments are red herrings.the board does its best to paint taylor seminar as installing mandatory guidelines for disciplinary review,but that implication is specious.the board has not cited any termination procedure between the union and the company,and puts forth no cogent reason for why taylor alleged departure from his written seminar outline is evidence of antiunion animus.indeed,detroit news was not obliged to investigate hydorn case in any particular way,and further,the board offers nothing material that the employer would have uncovered had it investigated the matter differently.
in addition,there is no evidence that detroit news promulgated a progressive discipline policy that limited the action that it could take against hydorn.we made clear in epilepsy foundation of northeast ohio nlrb that 
t he board does not have authority to regulate all behavior in the workplace and it can not function as a ubiquitous personnel manager,supplanting its judgment on how to respond to unprotected,insubordinate behavior for those of an employer.it is well recognized that an employer is free to lawfully run its business as it pleases.this means that an employer may discharge an employee for a good reason,a bad reason,or no reason,so long as it is not for an unlawful reason.
in short,the three reasons relied upon by the board to justify its finding that the general counsel met its burden under the first prong of wright line are not supported by substantial evidence.without more,they fail to meet the necessary threshold to support a conclusion that antiunion animus was a motivating factor in hydorn discharge.
b.the fourth rationale under wright line first prong 
in its brief and at oral argument,counsel for the board,apparently recognizing that the board decision was fragile in its analysis of the first prong of wright line,argued that the board had implicitly relied upon a fourth reason to show that antiunion animus was a motivating factor in the company discharge of hydorn his disparate treatment in comparison to nonstrikers who had committed similar or more egregious acts of insubordination.see br.of nlrb at recording of oral argument at.it is true that the board found that 
the general counsel has produced significant evidence of disparate treatment.based on respondent personnel records,the general counsel has shown that between february,and november,respondent disciplined nonstrikers for insubordination less harshly than hydorn.in of those instances,the respondent only issued a warning to the offending employee,while in the remaining cases the employees were disciplined with suspensions.we agree with the judge that the evidence in this case shows that the respondent had a relatively lax attitude towards insubordination by,even tho
