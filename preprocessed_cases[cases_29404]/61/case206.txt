n ewsmen have no constitutional right of access to prisons or their inmates beyond that afforded to the general public.pell procunier.the supreme court applied that principle in saxbe washington post,d,when holding that the federal bureau of prisons did not violate the constitution by preventing interviews between reporters and inmates.
in the years after washington post the bureau authorized some interviews.by the late reporters could talk to prisoners throughout the federal system.see program statement news media contacts promulgated,and in force since.that changed in,however,for inmates housed in some of the bureau the special confinement unit at the prison in terre haute,indiana,which houses most federal prisoners under sentence of death,plus some others in administrative detention for disciplinary or security reasons.
program statements generally applicable to federal prisons may be modified by supplements.see program statement applying this power to media contacts in particular.the warden of terre haute proposed,and the bureau director approved,institution supplement tha a,which bans meetings between reporters and inmates of the special confinement unit,though it allows phone calls and correspondence.the current revision,tha b,contains the same rule for simplicity we refer only to tha phone calls with reporters are subject to program statement d,which provides that a representative of the news media may not obtain and use personal information from one inmate about another inmate who refuses to be interviewed.correspondence is unlimited an inmate letters to reporters are not subject to inspection or censorship.all properly identified and labeled correspondence from an inmate who is not on restricted mail status to qualifying representatives of the news media shall be sealed and forwarded without inspection,directly and promptly.program statement a july.
david paul hammer,who was sentenced to death for killing another federal prisoner,contends in this suit under bivens six unknown federal narcotics agents,d,that he is entitled to money damages from former attorney general ashcroft and other public officials who drafted or approved tha relying on pell and washington post,the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants.wl,dist.lexis.a panel of this court reversed,cir,and that decision was vacated in turn by the order granting defendants petition for rehearing en banc.
hammer attempt to obtain damages has complicated matters.the validity of federal administrative rules usually is resolved in actions under the administrative procedure act seeking prospective relief,not in suits for money against officials whose positions and roles generally entitle them to qualified if not absolute immunity.a district judge held the policy valid,after all.although the panel thought that,on an enlarged record,hammer might yet prevail,i f judges disagree on a constitutional question,it is unfair to subject public officials to money damages for picking the losing side of the controversy.wilson layne,d.accord,pearson callahan,d.indeed,a bivens action is improper when statutes specify how administrative deeds are reviewed.see wilkie robbins,d.but because we agree with the district court that tha a is valid,we sidestep the complications introduced by hammer quest for damages.hammer death sentence was set aside in,united states hammer,d,but he remains in the special confinement unit pending appeal,now under advisement in the third circuit,and so has an ongoing interest in the rule constitutionality.his other sentences exceed years imprisonment,so release is not imminent.
pell procunier and saxbe washington post establish that the bureau of prisons could enforce a rule against personal or video interviews between prisoners and reporters.hammer contends,however,that by curtailing press access to some prisoners but not others,the bureau offends the component of the due process clause in the constitution fifth amendment.yet it is hard to understand why all prisoners should be treated the same.some are in prisons and others in more secure confinement no one thinks these differences unconstitutional.the justices observed in pell and washington post that the principal reason for limiting press contacts is the maintenance of security this implies that the greater the need for security at a given prison or unit within a prison,the easier it is to justify limits on meetings between reporters and prisoners.by the time the court decided washington post,the bureau of prisons had begun to allow reporters to interview inmates of prisons.see at.the justices did not perceive any problem in this distinction.it is easier to justify limiting press contacts at the few places holding the most incorrigible prisoners usp florence and the special confinement unit at terre haute than at all medium and prisons.
hammer argument amounts to a contention that,once a prison system starts to allow access more liberally,it must go all the way any intermediate position violates principles.that understanding is inconsistent with many established doctrines.for example,thirty years ago a court held that congress had violated limits by subjecting members of the diplomatic service,but not other federal workers,to mandatory retirement.the justices held,however,that it is possible to draw such lines as long as a rational basis for them may be imagined the basis need not be supported in the record.vance bradley,d.just as it was possible to imagine a rational basis for distinguishing diplomats from postal carriers,so it is possible to imagine a rational basis for distinguishing the nation most secure institutions from others.indeed,to state the distinction is to furnish the justification security.
the security justification that carried the day in pell and washington post was that interviews with the press make celebrities of some inmates.this increases tensions within prisons those who do receive public attention may react with envy and if some inmates use the press to disparage others or their beliefs,or the organizations to which they belong,the tensions will be greater.more the interviewed prisoners get swelled heads and tend to become the source of substantial disciplinary problems that can engulf a large portion of the population at a prison.washington post,at.prisons for tax evaders and forgers may tolerate such tensions prisons for killers are more explosive,and the need to prevent lighting the fuse to the powder keg is compelling.
hammer maintains that prisons must use the available options and that the bureau experience since washington post shows that the risks associated with interviews are manageable.this line of argument marks a transition from equal protection to the first amendment,for it incorporates elements of both bodies of doctrine.but this,too,is a tired theme.it has been made in several cases dealing with press interviews and correspondence among prisoners,and the justices have rejected it.see,thornburgh abbott,d shaw murphy,d.the question is not whether prisons could find ways to accommodate one or another change.it is whether the rule that the prison chooses to implement is reasonably related to legitimate security interests.turner safley,d.and the court has held in pell and washington post that a policy is reasonably related to legitimate security interests.the justices added that an attempt to be less restrictive by making individual decisions could undermine security such a selective policy would spawn serious discipline and morale problems of its own by engendering hostility and resentment among inmates who were refused interview privileges granted to their fellows.washington post,at.
hammer maintains,however,that the bureau has engaged in content or viewpoint discrimination by silencing inmates on death row.this may well be true of a selective or less restrictive approach wardens who allow some prisoners but not others to invite the press into their cells might well take account of what they expect the inmates to say or the reporters to relate to the public.but a blanket inmate in a given prison or unit may meet with any neutral with respect to both content and viewpoint.this is one reason why the justices approved the policies at issue in pell and washington post,giving the quality of the policies as proof that the decisions were not based on content.see pell,at.
perhaps hammer point is not that the rule employs content or viewpoint as a ground of decision,but that those who adopted or approved tha a took content or viewpoint into account when deciding to change the rules for some federal prisoners but not others.this line of argument starts with the fact that reporters freely interviewed inmates of the special confinement unit,including hammer himself,for the first nine months of the unit shortly after an interview with timothy mcveigh was broadcast by cbs on minutes in march.the special confinement unit was established in july hammer and mcveigh were among its first inmates.mcveigh had been sentenced to death for killing people by bombing the murrah federal building in oklahoma city.he used the forum of national tv to justify and extol terrorism.shortly after the interview was broadcast,byron dorgan,who represents north dakota in the senate,wrote to kathleen,director of the bureau of prisons,complaining about the interview.senator dorgan stated,among other things 
the american people have a right to expect that the incarceration of a convicted killer will not only remove him physically from society,but will also prevent him from further intrusion in our lives through television interviews and from using those forums to advance his agenda of violence.
about a month after senator dorgan sent that letter,attorney general ashcroft and director announced arrangements for telecasting of mcveigh execution and took some questions.ashcroft also announced that the bureau would replace its evaluation system with a prohibition on interviews of inmates at the special confinement unit.hammer finds telling these statements 
i am aware that several media outlets have requested access to interview inmate mcveigh.as an american who cares about our culture,i want to restrict a mass murderer access to the public podium.on an issue of particular importance to me as attorney general of the united states,i do not want anyone to be able to purchase access to the podium of america with the blood of innocent victims.
i concerned about irresponsible glamorization of a culture of violence,and that concern has shaped our approach to these issues profoundly.
on april,three days after the press conference,harley lappin,the warden of terre haute,issued institution supplement tha 
hammer wants discovery during which former attorney general ashcroft,former director,and former warden lappin must explain under oath why they adopted the policy in question.if a belief that terrorists should not be able to obtain publicity by committing murder played a role in the decision,hammer contends,the motivation for the policy is infirm,and the policy itself would fall with the bad motive.
it is not clear why one bad motive would spoil a rule that is adequately supported by good reasons.see mueller allen,d.the supreme court did not search for pretext in turner it asked instead whether a rule is rationally related to a legitimate goal.that an objective inquiry.if motive matters,why examine the thoughts of those who adopted the rule to the exclusion of those who have maintained it in force attorney general gonzales,solicitor general clement who authorized the petition for rehearing en banc,attorney general mukasey who was in office when the department of justice defended the policy before the en banc court,and attorney general holder,who could revoke tha a with one sentence plus a signature but has not done so.there is no special burden to justify a change of administrative policy.see fcc fox television stations,d.
nor do we see how a demand that a cabinet officer give testimony about his thinking could be squared with united states morgan,and pbgc ltv,d.these decisions hold that courts evaluating the validity of an administrative action may not enlarge the administrative record by demanding that the people who proposed or approved the rule testify about their thinking.see also richard pierce,i administrative law treatise.
for current purposes,however,we assume that attorney general ashcroft successors share his views.there nothing unconstitutional about them,so we need not decide whether they led to the policy adoption and maintenance,how motivation could be proved consistent with morgan,or what role it plays in evaluating a policy validity.opposing a culture of violence is an ordinary,and desirable,goal for a criminal prosecutor.attorney general ashcroft statements combine the idea that criminals should not be allowed to benefit from their deeds see simon schuster,new york crime victims board,d a state may apply all of a criminal income,including royalties from books,to satisfy restitution awards,though it ca pick and choose among books with variations of propositions that can be found in pell and washington post.
one of the reasons that state and federal prison administrators gave for curtailing press access was that they did not want people to become celebrities by committing crimes.the justices thought this a good basis to curtail press access,not a constitutionally infirm one.see washington post,at.this is a reason why prisoners are separated from society most prisons are remote,and access to them tightly controlled,not simply to make escape difficult,but because solitude is a legitimate part of punishment.becoming a celebrity makes crime more if not so attractive as to outweigh the costs of prison,still anything that reduces the effective punishment for crime is of legitimate concern to attorneys general and prison officials.for murderers on death row or serving life sentences,celebrity is especially attractive,as these persons do not expect to return to the civilian world.they will receive few other rewards in life.
some criminal acts are both costly to society and potentially attractive to imitators the most notorious criminals can be.timothy mcveigh was such a person.he had a following,and one of his admirers was recently convicted of threatening to blow up a federal building in milwaukee.see united states parr,cir.other cause criminals want to recruit think of those who blow up abortion clinics and kill physicians.social interests in curtailing and punishing crime support keeping these prisoners in seclusion.no one least,no one should a person serving time for tax evasion may be prevented from using the prison print shop to run off tracts advocating the proposition that the sixteenth amendment is invalid and no one need pay a penny of taxes.see united states benson,cir affirming an injunction that prevents a convicted tax evader from selling a amendment reliance package that purports to give other tax protesters a means to avoid both payment and criminal liability.if what attorney general ashcroft said in april evinces an unconstitutional motive,much of what this court wrote in benson suffers from the same failing.
naturally,hammer insists that he is no mcveigh and would not use the press to promote murder.he wants to speak instead about prison conditions,his current professed respect for life,and what he sees as misconduct by guards and wardens.a system of rules that permitted prison administrators to conceal beatings or starvation of prisoners,violations of statutes and regulations,and other misconduct would be intolerable.the court said as much in pell and washington post.it was important to both decisions that all prisoners could correspond freely with reporters,even though interviews were impossible.see pell,at.washington post,at.hammer sees this as an opening,because he says the bureau of prisons does not allow any uncensored channel of communication to the press.
this line of argument relies on program statement d,which we quoted at the outset of this opinion.it provides a representative of the news media may not obtain and use personal information from one inmate about another inmate who refuses to be interviewed.as far as we can tell,this rule applies to interviews in person or by telephone but not to correspondence.program statement a,which sets out the rules for written exchanges,says that a ll properly identified and labeled correspondence from an inmate who is not on restricted mail status to qualifying representatives of the news media shall be sealed and forwarded without inspection,directly and promptly.that exactly the sort of uncensored outgoing correspondence that the court deemed adequate in pell and washington post.hammer does not contend that persons held in the special confinement unit are on restricted mail status or that the prison has ever any letter he sent to a reporter.the limit on information about other inmates deals only with oral interviews.and if hammer were to prevail in this suit,he would not be rid of program statement d,for it covers and televised interviews as well as phone interviews.
to the extent that hammer may be contesting the validity of program statement d as applied to phone calls with the press the only way it affects him,he has not established any constitutional problem.the restriction is a rational one,for reasons covered in pell and washington post.telling tales about fellow inmates may make them angry if the tales are defamatory or may make yet other inmates envious if the tales are flattering.in either event,disorder may follow.as the district court put it,insults or provocations,real or imagined,can result in violence and thus can have dire consequences for inmates,penitentiary staff,and the public at large.wl at,dist.lexis at.defamation is less likely if the other inmate agrees to talk to the press hammer may discuss such inmates by phone with reporters.and if,to take the worst case,another inmate is beaten and unable to talk,hammer remains free to send a letter informing a reporter about that event.pell and washington post held that free correspondence supplies the needed channel of communication hammer has that plus minutes of telephone time a day.
correspondence is not the only way to expose misconduct by guards and administrators.prisoners are free to file lawsuits,and papers sent to courts or lawyers can not be censored.see bounds smith,d procunier martinez,d.so the limit in program statement d is not going to conceal any misconduct in which the public has a legitimate interest.
institution supplement tha a is consistent with the constitution,and the judgment of the district court is 
the original panel opinion was firmly rooted in the supreme court rule that a prison regulation infringing on an inmate constitutional rights is valid only if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.turner safley,d.when a prisoner challenges a prison policy on constitutional grounds,the government must put forward a legitimate government interest to justify the restriction.id.suppressing speech because government officials find the content offensive is not a legitimate penological interest.id.at.the original panel concluded that david paul hammer presented evidence that created a question of material fact that the district court overlooked is the concern articulated by the warden legitimate,or is it simply a convenient explanation to justify a policy designed to control the speech content of a particular subset of prisoners given the fact dispute,the original panel reached the,even that a trier of fact must resolve the conflict.
today en banc opinion is almost entirely unmoored from the original panel narrow treatment of the issues presented in this appeal.with scarcely a reference to turner,today opinion holds that a ban on interviews in the prison system is justified if a judge can imagine a legitimate basis for its existence,glosses over facts regarding the application of the relevant policies,and concludes with the astonishing proposition that the government may limit a prisoner access to the media based on its distaste for the anticipated content of the prisoner speech.the en banc opinion thus authorizes the government to deny the public a chance to hear directly from prisoners who can offer a glimpse of situations that may embarrass the government,such as torture and prisoner abuse,by invoking pretextual justifications for policies that are unrelated to security.for the reasons set forth in the original panel opinion,i dissent.i write separately only to memorialize my additional disagreement with the unexpected breadth of the en banc opinion.
let me begin with the most troubling aspect of today opinion the majority willingness to push aside attorney general ashcroft statement that as an american who cares about our culture and is concerned about the irresponsible glamorization of a culture of violence,he wanted to prevent inmates,and only inmates,from engaging in interviews with the media on any subject.this rationale for censorship assumes that what inmates have to say,if broadcast outside the prison,necessarily corrodes american culture.but first amendment jurisprudence is grounded in the idea that the government may not prevent a person,including a prisoner,from speaking merely because it disapproves of the speaker or what the speaker might say.see,city of paul,d noting that restrictions are presumptively invalid turner,at.stating that prison regulations that infringe on inmates first amendment rights must operate in a neutral fashion,without regard to the content of the expression regan time,d regulations that permit the government to discriminate on the basis of the content of the message can not be tolerated under the first amendment.indeed,this court has recognized that the government may not pass speech restrictions in an effort to preserve its own notions of valued american culture 
racial bigotry,violence on television,reporters and many more influence the culture and shape our socialization.none is directly answerable by more speech,unless that speech too finds its place in the popular culture.yet all is protected as speech,however insidious.any other answer leaves the government in control of all of the institutions of culture,the great censor and director of which thoughts are good for us.
see american booksellers ass n,hudnut,cir easterbrook.yet attorney general ashcroft said publicly that preserving his version of american culture is exactly why the bureau decided to limit inmates access to the media.
in order to circumvent this problem,the majority applies its own interpretive spin to attorney general ashcroft statements and decides that the attorney general meant that criminals should not be allowed to benefit from their deeds.the majority thus concludes that attorney general ashcroft articulated a legitimate penological purpose to the interview ban because he saw restricting interviews as a form of punishment or deterrence.but that is a question for a fact finder,who might reject this rationalization and instead take attorney general ashcroft at his word and conclude that what actually shaped his mind in enacting the ban is his desire to prevent prisoners from influencing our culture.that desire is not a legitimate penological purpose.
the majority comparison of this case to united states benson,cir,is unhelpful.in benson we held that a convicted tax offender may not market materials that encourage other people to evade tax laws.benson dealt with commercial speech,which occupies its own niche in jurisprudence,see central hudson gas pub.serv.comm of new york,d,and concluded that it is permissible to enjoin a person from making false statements in connection with the sale of a product,benson,at.even accepting the majority assumption that attorney general ashcroft wanted to prevent inmates from encouraging violence,the parallel to benson is unpersuasive.deceiving the public into buying a product designed to evade payment of required taxes is illegal,see a advocating unpopular ideas is not,see brandenburg ohio,d 
the original panel was also concerned that the special confinement unit prohibition on interviews does not leave sufficient alternatives for inmates to access the media.today opinion concludes that the alternatives are sufficient because inmates have minutes of telephone time each day that they can use to speak with reporters,and because they are entitled to unlimited
