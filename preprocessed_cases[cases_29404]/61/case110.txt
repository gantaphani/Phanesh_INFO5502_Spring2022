joseph freeman freeman appeals from the judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york colleen mcmahon,judge entered on march,granting motion for summary judgment.plaintiffs freeman,rocco calderola,and james santerello collectively,the plaintiffs,former and current corrections officers for the westchester county department of corrections doc,brought suit against westchester county the county and against westchester county executive andrew spano spano and westchester county department of corrections commissioner rocco pozzi pozzi,each in his official capacity,under section for alleged violations of their fourth amendment rights stemming from their july,arrests on charges of grand larceny.the district court held that the plaintiffs constitutional rights were not violated by the county various actions,including videotaping them,choreographing their arrests to facilitate videotaping,distributing the videotape to the media,and advising the media of their impending perp walks to the courthouse for arraignment.freeman appealed.
for the reasons set forth herein,we conclude that the legitimate government purposes served by the county actions outweigh freeman privacy interests,and freeman therefore did not suffer any violation of his fourth amendment rights.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
we briefly recite the basic facts relevant to the disposition of this case freeman and several fellow corrections officers were arrested as a result of a county investigation of corrections officers suspected of receiving disability benefits on the basis of fraudulent job injury claims.doc surveillance efforts yielded incriminating evidence regarding certain corrections officers,all of whom were on paid disability leave.an employee from doc special investigations unit telephoned those corrections officers and directed them to report to doc headquarters on monday,july.
upon arrival,each summoned corrections officer was placed in a separate room.sometime thereafter,each was placed under arrest by officers from the department of public safety dps,handcuffed,and then transported to the police station.a county employee videotaped freeman and the other arrestees walking through the doc parking lot as they were escorted from the doc building,where they were arrested,to the cars in which they were transported to the police station for booking.
on the same day,the county held a press conference to publicize its investigation of and crackdown on fraudulent job injury claims by corrections officers.county executive spano announced the arrests and played the videotape made by the county employee of the arrested corrections officers as they were escorted from the doc building to waiting cars.copies of the videotape were distributed to the media.
in addition,the commissioner of public safety informed those present that after the arrests these people were transported to the westchester county police headquarters,processed,and they pending arraignment right now in the town of pleasant court.caldarola,d at.upon his arrival at the courthouse for arraignment,freeman was left to wait in the car in which he was transported for ten to fifteen minutes until the car carrying two other arrestees arrived.during this time,freeman was filmed by the media.the media also filmed the arrestees as they ascended the steps of the courthouse.
ii.discussion 
the perp walk,that is,when an accused wrongdoer is led away in handcuffs by the police to the courthouse,police station,or jail,has been featured in newspapers and newscasts for decades.the normally arrestees often pull coats over their heads,place their hands in front of their faces,or otherwise attempt to obscure their identities.a recent surge in executive perp walks has featured accused white collar criminals in designer suits and handcuffs.whether the accused wrongdoer is wearing a sweatshirt over his head or an armani suit on his back,we suspect that perp walks are broadcast by networks and reprinted in newspapers at least in part for their entertainment value.yet,perp walks also serve the more serious purpose of educating the public about law enforcement efforts.the image of the accused being led away to contend with the justice system powerfully communicates government efforts to thwart the criminal element,and it may deter others from attempting similar crimes.
at the same time,we are cognizant that the characteristics of the perp walk that serve legitimate government purposes also implicate the accused privacy interests.ruling on freeman section claims requires us to carefully balance the accused privacy interests against the government purposes underlying the perp walk.
an earlier opinion,lauro charles,marked this court first foray into the constitutional implications of the perp walk.cir.in lauro,the plaintiff brought a section suit against the new york city police department for violating his fourth amendment rights by subjecting him to a staged perp walk.approximately two hours after lauro was arrested and brought to the police station,a police detective staged a perp walk in response to media interest in the arrest.a detective handcuffed lauro,escorted him outside of the police station,drove him around the block in a police car,and then escorted him from the car back into the station.a television crew filmed the staged walk from the car back into the station.
this court found that lauro was seized within the meaning of the fourth amendment,r egardless of whether the seizure is viewed as a separate seizure that occurred when lauro was forcibly removed from the station and brought back in,or a continuation and aggravation of the seizure that occurred when he was arrested id.at.the staged perp walk implicated lauro protected privacy interest in not being displayed to the world,against his will,in handcuffs,and in a posture connoting guilt.id.at.no government purpose was served by the staged perp walk.id.at.this court noted that any legitimate state interest in accurate reporting of police activity is not well served by an inherently fictional dramatization of an event that transpired hours earlier.id.this court therefore concluded that the staged perp walk violated lauro constitutional right to be free from unreasonable seizures.although lauro expressly did not reach the constitutionality of an actual,unstaged perp walk,lauro substantially informs our analysis.
district court proceeding 
freeman premised his section claim on the fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.the district court rejected his claim,holding that the county had not engaged in any behavior constituting an unreasonable seizure.caldarola,d at.in particular,the district court held that the act of videotaping the arrestees was not a seizure of intangibles and did not interfere with any possessory interests of freeman or the other arrestees,id.at,the choreography of the arrests did not result in the unreasonable exacerbation of the arrests,id.at,the public dissemination of the videotape did not implicate any protected privacy interests,id.at,and advising the media of the arrestees impending arraignment did not implicate any constitutional rights,id.at.
on appeal,freeman asserts that the district court erred with regard to all of its legal conclusions underlying the grant of summary judgment in favor of.we review de novo the district court decision to grant summary judgment in favor of the see quinn green tree credit,cir.
b.the county acts of coordinating the arrests,videotaping the walk,and disseminating the videotape 
freeman argues that the county acts of coordinating the arrests,videotaping the walk in the doc parking lot,and disseminating the videotape each violated his fourth amendment rights.because freeman privacy interests are the same in each incident,and because the county purposes are the same with regard to each act,we analyze jointly the constitutionality of these acts.
