media general is a virginia newspaper publisher that operates a production facility in mechanicsville,virginia.on august,the international filed a petition with the board seeking to represent a group of the mechanicsville production facility maintenance and facilities employees.on august,media general and the international entered into a stipulated election agreement,which identified the employees to be included in the bargaining unit and provided that a election would be held on september,to determine whether those employees would be represented by the international 
on september,the international conducted a voluntary meeting for the employees in the proposed bargaining unit.at the meeting,an international representative circulated a petition that reflected a signing employee intention to vote yes for representation by the international in the upcoming election the vote yes petition.the vote yes petition provided,in relevant part 
we are voting yes

furthermore,we authorize the iam to use this petition through any method to urge our to vote yes.
we will not change our minds 
we will stand by our word 
we will vote yes 
during this meeting,and at a later meeting,the international solicited signatures on the vote yes petition.according to two employees in attendance,one of the international representatives stated that he wanted everyone to sign the vote yes petition,and he commented,t his is where you separate the men from the boys.
several employees who attended the meetings discussed the vote yes petition with media general officials,and one of them informed media general that the vote yes petition would be made public.in response,media general,two days before the election,circulated a memorandum to the employees in the proposed bargaining unit,advising them of their unconditional right to vote no on union representation and of their right to choose not to attend the international meetings the company memorandum.the company memorandum,from director of operations william barker director barker,characterized the vote yes petition as a straw vote and stated,in relevant part 
let me make a few things clear.that straw vote means nothing.it can not be used in any way at the election on friday.regardless of whatever you may have written down at the straw vote,on friday you still get to vote your free choice in the secret ballot election.you have the absolute right to vote no on friday regardless of whatever you did in the straw vote.
i was also told by some of you that the union has a meeting scheduled tonight.whether or not you attend that meeting is your free choice.i wanted to make clear to you that you have no obligation to attend that meeting in order to try to correct or change your vote in last week straw vote.you may decide to freely skip tonight union meeting and to go to the polls on friday,september and vote no in the secret ballot election.
on september,the day before the election,employees in the proposed bargaining unit distributed copies of the vote yes petition throughout the mechanicsville workplace.it contained twenty employee names,most of which were printed on lines in the column of the vote yes petition,with corresponding signatures on lines in a separate column to the right of the printed names.one employee,richard tingler,had printed his name in the column of the vote yes petition,but he had failed to sign his name in the column.instead,the signature of william slayton,another employee,was on the line in the column next to tingler printed name.slayton name was also printed,and signed for a second time,two lines below tingler printed name.
on september,the board conducted the scheduled election.sixteen employees in the proposed bargaining unit cast ballots in favor of representation by the international,while fifteen employees voted against such representation.
on september,media general filed objections to conduct affecting the results of the election with the board regional director among its objections,media general asserted that the international had violated established law by circulating copies of the vote yes petition on the eve of the election,and it requested that the election be set aside.media general also claimed that the vote yes petition contained a forgery because the hand that started printing richard tingler was not the same hand that concluded printing richard tingler.on november,the regional director issued a report recommending that media general objections be overruled and that a certification of representation be issued.media general,case,at,the report on objections.before the board acted,media general filed a motion for reconsideration of its objections,which was denied by the regional director on december.media general,case,the order denying reconsideration.
on january,the board adopted the findings made by the regional director in his report of november.accordingly,the board certified the international as the exclusive representative of the employees in the proposed bargaining unit.media general,case,the certification decision.
on february,the international local affiliate,richmond lodge,international association of machinists and aerospace workers lodge,directed a letter to media general requesting bargaining unit information that lodge considered essential to bargain intelligently on the issues of wages and working conditions in the forthcoming negotiations the february letter.media general responded to the february letter on march,stating,t his letter is in response to your letter dated february.please be advised,with all due respect,that the richmond declines to recognize or bargain with your union.
on april,the international filed with the regional director an unfair labor practice charge against media general the charge asserted that media general had interfered with,restrained,and coerced employees in the exercise of their rights under section a of the act,and that it had refused to bargain in good faith with the international,in violation of section a of the act in support of its contention that media general had refused to bargain,the international stated that it had requested negotiations on february,and that media general had declined our request on march.
acting on the international allegations,the regional director,on april,issued a complaint and notice of hearing against media general,asserting violations of sections a and a of the act in its answer,filed on april,media general denied that it had refused to bargain with the international and claimed that it was under no duty to bargain with iam as the certification election was tainted by iam objectionable conduct.iam objectionable conduct prevented voters from freely and fairly selecting whether or not to be represented.
on may,the board general counsel moved for summary judgment on the complaint,and on may,the board issued a notice to show cause why summary judgment should not be awarded in response to the show cause notice,media general reiterated its objection to the board certification of the international,and it further maintained that n o one on behalf of the iam has ever made a demand to bargain.although media general admitted that lodge had submitted a valid bargaining demand in the february letter,it contended that the february letter was not attributable to the international.
on march,the board issued the order underlying this dispute,granting the general counsel motion for summary judgment.in so ruling,the board determined that media general had presented no newly discovered evidence on the validity of the election results,and it declined to reexamine its certification decision.order at.the board then addressed media general contention that only lodge had demanded bargaining rights,and that the international had never made a bargaining demand.on this point,the board found that even if the february,letter was not,in itself,a sufficient demand by the international,the charge filed by the international on april,which referred to that letter,clarified any ambiguity as to which entity was requesting bargaining.id.at.accordingly,the board concluded that media general refusal to bargain with the international violated sections a and a of the act,and it ordered media general to bargain with the international.id.at.on april,media general filed a motion for a stay of the order,along with a motion for reconsideration.on may,both motions were denied.
the board thereafter applied to this court for enforcement of the order,and media general has for our review thereof.we possess jurisdiction pursuant to sections e and f of the act.see e,f.
the board conclusion that an election resulted in a fair vote for union representation is a discretionary matter,and we are obliged to accord it great deference.nlrb columbia cable tv,cir.we presume a election to be valid,and we may overturn such an election only if the board has clearly abused its discretion.nlrb maryland ambulance servs,cir case farms of north carolina,nlrb,cir.a party seeking to overturn an election bears a heavy burden and must prove by specific evidence not only that campaign improprieties occurred,but also that they prevented a fair election.elizabethtown gas nlrb,cir.the act requires that we treat as conclusive any board findings that are supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole e.
in its opposition to the board application for enforcement and in its for review,media general maintains that the board erred in ordering it to bargain with the international.in support of this contention,media general asserts that circulation of the vote yes petition intimidated,threatened,and coerced employees into voting yes for representation by the international that the vote yes petition contained a forgery that the board should have accorded media general an evidentiary hearing before making its certification decision and that,if certification was proper,the international failed to make a proper bargaining demand.we address these contentions in turn.
media general first asserts that the certification decision constituted an abuse of discretion because the international had intimidated,threatened,and coerced employees into signing the vote yes petition and into ultimately voting for representation by the international.accordingly,media general contends that it is under no duty to recognize the international as the exclusive representative of the employees in the bargaining unit.we are obliged to reject this contention.
as an initial matter,we reject media general suggestion that vote yes petitions are per se coercive.as the sixth circuit has explained,although polling by an employer is per se objectionable,a union seeking to represent employees has a different relationship to them that makes polling less coercive.maremont nlrb,cir citing kusan nlrb,cir.the proper inquiry is whether circulation of the vote yes petition,under the circumstances leading to this election,interfered with the free and fair choice of the employees.see van leer containers,nlrb,cir nu skin int l.
contrary to media general contention,the supreme court decision in nlrb savair manufacturing,d,does not mandate a finding that vote yes petitions are inherently coercive.in savair,the union had circulated recognition slips reflecting the names of the employees who had agreed to support it.id.at.as incentive for signing these slips prior to the election,the union had offered to waive the employees union initiation fees.id.at.in finding this practice objectionable,the court recognized that an employee outward manifestation of support must often serve as a useful campaign tool in the union hands to convince other employees to vote for the union id.at.as we have explained,however,the linchpin of savair is the linkage between the offer to waive the initiation fee and a commitment to support the union.it is this linkage that constitutes the union impermissible interference in the election.nlrb vsa,cir citing savair,at.here,the international made no offer to waive the union fees or dues of signing employees,and the savair decision is easily distinguishable.
turning to the facts relating to this election,media general contends that two remarks made by an international representative at a meeting with the employees in the proposed bargaining unit i want everyone to sign this and t his is where you separate the men from the boys rendered a fair election impossible.in support of this contention,media general relies on the subjective reactions of two of those employees,who stated that they felt pressure to sign the petition.the board found,however,that these employee statements failed to establish that the free choice of a reasonable employee would have been hindered,and we are unable to disagree with that finding.
first of all,the s ubjective reactions of employees are irrelevant to the question of whether there was,in fact,objectionable conduct.kmart.as one of our sister circuits has explained,the test for coercion is an objective one,and the relevant question is whether the alleged misconduct is of a type that would cause interference with the free choice of a reasonable employee.aotop,llc nlrb,affirming board finding that union agent did not engage in objectionable conduct when she advised employees that they had to vote for union.furthermore,the responsibility for assessing the relevant facts and deciding whether the union conduct interfered with a reasonable employee free and fair choice in a representation election lies with the board.id.
secondly,we have recognized that election campaigns,by their nature,are rough and tumble affairs,and they typically involve elements of pressure or inducement.see,vsa,at upholding union offer to waive union initiation fees if union won election as permissible campaign tactic,where offer applied equally to all employees.and,while c oercive conduct is never condoned during the election process the board will not set aside an election unless an atmosphere of fear and coercion rendered free choice impossible.id.quoting nlrb herbert halperin distrib,cir see also nlrb bottling,cir an election is by its nature a rough and tumble affair,and a certain amount of exaggerations,hyperbole,and appeals to emotions are to be expected.citations omitted.
in the circumstances of this dispute,the regional director found that a reasonable employee would not have felt coerced into voting for the international his finding on this point is amply supported for at least two reasons media general officials spoke to those employees who had expressed concern about signing the vote yes petition,and those officials explained that the petition meant nothing and that the employees could still vote no in the election and after learning about the vote yes petition,media general circulated the company memorandum to all employees in the proposed bargaining unit,explaining that they had the right to vote against representation in the election accordingly,the board determination that the employees in the proposed bargaining unit were not coerced into supporting the international was supported by substantial evidence.
media general next contends that the vote yes petition contained a forgery that requires the representation election at mechanicsville to be set aside.as the board found,however,this contention mus
