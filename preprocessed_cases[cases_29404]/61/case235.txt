background 
kcrg is a television station and an american broadcasting company affiliate that serves a designated marketing area dma consisting of iowa counties and four major cities in iowa.there are approximately different cable systems within kcrg dma,including mediacom.the federal communications commission fcc regulates the relationship between commercial broadcast television stations,such as kcrg,and cable companies,such as mediacom.this case concerns the determination of relationship status between kcrg and mediacom based upon the parties communications.
all commercial television stations in the united states must elect either status or retransmission consent status with cable companies in the stations dma.f commercial television stations are required to make elections between retransmission consent and status at three year intervals.if a station is a station,the cable company is required to carry the station signal.b.if the station is a retransmission consent station,the cable company has received the station permission to transmit the station signal in exchange for some compensation from the cable company.b.when retransmission consent status is in effect,the cable company can not carry the local station signal without the consent of the local station.b a.retransmission consent is typically granted through a retransmission consent contract.
each commercial television station must elect either status or retransmission consent status every three years,and the code of federal regulations sets the cycle years.b b f.stations were required to elect by october,for the period of,and.the commercial television stations had to make the next election by october.an election must be in writing and sent to the cable companies via certified united states mail.h.if a station fails to send a notice of election,the default status is status.id.f.
in addition to the election cycle,stations and cable systems may have retransmission consent contracts that cover all or part of the election period.thus,the retransmission consent contract period need not coincide with the election cycle.such contracts must be in writing and must specify the extent of the consent being granted.id.j.the parties to the contract are free to choose the duration of the retransmission consent contract,and they are free to modify their contract during the period of effectiveness.commercial television stations and cable companies are obligated,pursuant to federal regulations,to negotiate retransmission consent contracts in good faith.b c a.
if a commercial television station elects retransmission consent status with a particular cable company and then fails to enter into a retransmission consent contract with that company,the station signal may not be broadcast on the cable network.a retransmission consent contract is the exclusive means for a commercial television station to have its signal broadcast on a cable system if the station has elected retransmission consent instead of status for that particular cable company.
on may,tci cable management corporation tci entered into a retransmission consent agreement agreement with kcrg.tci drafted the agreement,which provides,in relevant part 
term.the term of this agreement shall commence on the date hereof and shall expire on december,the initial term.this agreement and the election set forth in paragraph hereof shall automatically renew for successive six year periods after the expiration of the initial term each a renewal term provided,however,that either party may terminate this agreement effective as of the end of the initial term or any renewal term upon six months prior written notice to the other party or as otherwise provided in this agreement.
in june,mediacom became the to tci.on october,mediacom informed kcrg that mediacom was assuming all of the obligations of the agreement.because kcrg elected retransmission consent status in for the election period of,and,mediacom either had to assume the obligations of the agreement or enter into negotiations for a new retransmission consent arrangement.when mediacom assumed the agreement,the agreement had already automatically renewed once because neither tci nor kcrg had given the other written notice six months prior to december.consequently,the agreement remained in place for another period,until december.
on may,jane belford,vice president of programming and legal affairs for mediacom communications corporation,sent a letter to john phelan,vice president and general manager of kcrg.belford,who also serves as counsel for mediacom and negotiates contracts with large programmers,stated in the letter to phelan that 
s ince neither you nor tci gave notice that you wanted to terminate the a greement within the time period stated in the contract,the contract automatically renewed at the end of the i nitial t erm.and since mediacom agreed to assume the terms of the a greement,we have been living under that contract ever since.the expiration date of the contract is now december.
the may,letter proposed amendments to the retransmission agreement affecting two topics changing the list of headends to reflect that mediacom owned different systems than tci had owned and increasing the number of promotional spots from per month to per month the may,letter also addressed kcrg concern about the emergency alert system eas,but belford concluded that mediacom was unable to change the eas procedure at that time.phelan accepted the amendments on behalf of kcrg.
on july,belford sent phelan another letter.that letter reiterated that the expiration date of the agreement was december.but the main point of the july,letter was to add a digital component to the agreement.on august,phelan agreed to the amendments set forth in the july,letter,and the parties added five new paragraphs to the agreement.
on september,phelan sent approximately notices of election by certified united states mail to the various companies that serve kcrg dma.kcrg elected status in the majority of the election notices.kcrg only sent five notices in which it elected retransmission consent status.the retransmission consent elections went to mediacom,cedar falls utilities,mcleod communications,direct tv,and echo star.kcrg chose to elect retransmission consent status with these five companies because the cable companies were able to give kcrg some benefits,including promotional schedules,a cnn headline news local edition insert,a guaranteed,and a cash payment.
in the days leading up to the october,consent election deadline,belford received notices of election from about commercial television stations.about of the stations elected retransmission consent for at least part of their dmas.in total,belford and her assistant received about various elections.belford personally read each election notice,and she and her assistant entered them into a database.
the major dispute in this case arises from a letter sent by phelan to mediacom just prior to the october,deadline.phelan,on kcrg behalf,elected retransmission consent.we must decide whether that letter sufficed to do anything more.specifically,we must determine whether the letter contained notice of an intent to terminate the retransmission agreement.the september,letter from phelan to mediacom letter contained the subject line retransmission consent and provided 
this letter will notify you,pursuant to b and,that television station kcrg elects retransmission consent status on your cable systems detailed on attachment a for the election cycle commencing on january,and ending on december.
as you know,your cable system currently carries kcrg pursuant to the agreement.the agreement
