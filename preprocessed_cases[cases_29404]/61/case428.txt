introduction 
defendants project cbd,martin lee,and aaron cantu jointly the project cbd defendants appeal from the trial court order denying their special motion to strike counts and,asserting causes of action for libel and false light,in the first amended complaint filed by plaintiffs medical marijuana,mmi and hempmeds px,llc hempmeds jointly the plaintiffs.
on appeal,the project cbd defendants contend that the trial court incorrectly determined that the plaintiffs demonstrated a probability of prevailing on counts and against the project cbd defendants.the project cbd defendants also claim that the trial court erred in concluding that the plaintiffs are not limited public figures,meaning that the plaintiffs would not have to demonstrate that the project cbd defendants acted with actual malice in publishing an article about the plaintiffs,that the court erred in concluding in the alternative that the plaintiffs demonstrated that the project cbd defendants acted with actual malice in publishing the article.
we conclude that the trial court ruling with respect to the project cbd defendants motion directed at counts and was correct,albeit on grounds different from those relied on by the trial court.we therefore affirm the court order and remand the matter for further proceedings.
factual and procedural backgrounda.factual background 
the parties 
plaintiff mmi holds investments in numerous industrial hemp businesses,including plaintiff hempmeds.hempmeds manufactures and sells rsho,a product containing cannabidiol cbd derived from the industrial hemp plant.mmi also holds interests in kannalife sciences.
according to the first amended complaint,jason cranford,another defendant,resigned from kannalife board of directors and then began competing with mmi and hempmeds by selling cbd products through his colorado medical marijuana dispensary,rifle mountain,llc rifle mountain,which is also named as a defendant in the case.
defendant project cbd is a california nonprofit organization that identifies itself as an organization dedicated to promoting and publicizing research regarding cbd and other components of the cannabis plant.defendant martin lee is project cbd founder and director.according to lee,project cbd does not solicit customers anywhere.it sells no products whatsoever.however,a witness declaration presented with respect to the project cbd defendants motion states that the witness observed lee promoting and selling a competing cbd product called care by design.on this basis,the plaintiffs assert that lee is in the industrial hemp business and uses the auspices of his purported,project cbd,for promoting his products in competition with mmi.
defendant aaron cantu wrote an article about mmi,hempmeds,kannaway and the rsho product.the article,originally published on the project cbd website on october,and u pdated on november,is titled hemp oil project cbd special report on medical marijuana,hempmeds kannaway the hemp oil hustlers article.also named as defendants in the case are cannlabs,cannlabs genifer murray,identified as the chief executive officer of cannlabs and stewart environmental consultants,llc stewart labs.
the factual allegations in the operative pleading giving rise to the lawsuit 
according to the operative pleading,after cranford resigned from the board of kannalife,cranford,through rifle mountain,began to sell cbd products in direct competition with rsho.on or around april,cranford posted on facebook that he intended to have rsho tested at a diagnostic lab.cranford also allegedly posted that a child had become sickened after having a bad reaction to rsho.
rather than have the rsho sample tested at the facility cranford identified in his april,facebook posting,cranford took the sample to stewart labs to be tested for volatile organic compounds voc and heavy metal concentrations.
according to the pleading,in late may,stewart labs released to cranford a preliminary report regarding the rsho sample.the plaintiffs allege that after receiving the preliminary report,cranford immediately released copies of preliminary test results on another individual facebook page,and posted on his own facebook page information regarding where the results had been posted.
the plaintiffs further allege that on may,murray posted false statements about plaintiffs and its rsho on the internet.the plaintiffs incorporated into the operative pleading a quotation of murray alleged false statements.plaintiffs allege that on may,another individual murray statements,with very minor alterations to the text.on may,another individual who followed cranford story,posted on facebook the photos of preliminary test results from stewart labs that cranford had previously posted.according to the complaint,as a result of murray and cranford facebook announcements,people throughout the world have read and followed the story and it on their facebook timelines,further publishing the false statements concerning plaintiffs.
at some point after the ing of murray statements,cranford allegedly posted to facebook a solicitation for contact from individuals who had suffered negative reactions after taking plaintiffs rsho product.
according to the operative complaint,on may,stewart labs published the final test results from its analysis of the rsho sample that had been submitted to it by cranford.the plaintiffs allege that t he final results showed significant different reporting values,especially for heavy metals such as lead,molybdenum,nickel,selenium,and silver,among other metals.despite being aware of the stewart labs final test results,on june,cranford posted a link to a statement written on facebook by sarah hadigan who asserted in her statement that her daughter is dead because of this product,rsho,among other things.
the operative pleading does not allege further conduct by any of the defendants after june,until october,the date on which the plaintiffs allege that the project cbd defendants published the hemp oil hustlers article on project cbd website.in the portion of the first amended complaint in which the plaintiffs set forth the general allegations on which they base their later enumerated claims for relief,in the general allegations of the pleading,they allege that the hemp oil hustlers article was written by cantu and published by project cbd on its website and then further published on other websites and that in the hemp oil hustlers article,the project cbd defendants claimed to have evidence that rsho was contaminated with heavy metals and solvents without verifying the accuracy of the results from stewart environmental,and alleged that multiple people became ill after using rsho due to heavy metals and other toxins based on cranford opinion.
according to the operative complaint,mmi stock price has plummeted ever since the named defendants made these announcements.plaintiffs assert that they have been harmed by the defendants actions in excess of one hundred million dollars.
procedural background 
trial court proceedings 
on january,the plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint,the operative pleading for purposes of this appeal the first amended complaint states five pleaded counts against all of the named defendants,including libel count,trade libel count,false light count,negligence count,and intentional infliction of emotional distress count.attached to the complaint are multiple exhibits.
the first amended complaint recites all of the factual allegations regarding the project cbd defendants conduct vis the plaintiffs in three paragraphs paragraphs,and,which are included under the heading facts common to all claims.these three paragraphs focus on the project cbd defendants publication of the hemp oil hustlers article.
the project cbd defendants responded to the complaint by filing an motion pursuant to california statute.in response to the motion,the trial court issued an order granting the motion in part and denying it in part.specifically,the court determined that all of the counts alleged against the project cbd defendants arose from protected activities under the statute.the court therefore proceeded to consider whether the plaintiffs had demonstrated a probability of prevailing on their claims against the project cbd defendants.the trial court determined that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated a probability of prevailing on counts,and of the first amended complaint,but had demonstrated a probability of prevailing on counts and.
in determining that the plaintiffs had demonstrated a probability of prevailing on counts and,the trial court concluded that the numerous purportedly false statements within the article,coupled with a failure to correctly cite information from sources is sufficient evidence of fault.in response to the project cbd defendants argument that the plaintiffs should be considered limited public figures and therefore,should be required to prove actual malice on the part of the project cbd defendants,the trial court concluded that the plaintiffs could not be considered public figures,and that they thus would not have to prove malice.the court also determined,however,that even if the plaintiffs would have been required to establish malice,the evidence they presented in response to the motion was sufficient to support a finding that the project cbd defendants engaged in unreasonable conduct constituting an extreme departure from the standards of investigation and reporting ordinarily adhered to by responsible publishers.such a finding,the court concluded,would be sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact with respect to the actual malice standard.
in granting the project cbd defendants motion in part and denying it in part,the trial court struck counts,and insofar as those counts were asserted against the project cbd defendants,but left counts and intact.
the project cbd defendants filed a timely notice of appeal 
relevant proceedings on appeal 
after the parties completed briefing on appeal and this court began reviewing the record,the court identified a potential issue in the case that the parties had not addressed in their briefing.this court issued a letter to counsel for the parties,seeking supplemental briefing from the parties with respect to this issue.the letter stated in relevant part 
the court requests supplemental letter briefs from the parties,as outlined below.the first amended complaint in the action alleges in paragraphs,and the following 
plaintiffs are informed and believe,and based thereon allege,that on or about october,cantu,b y and through lee and project cbd published an article titled hemp oil hustlers a project cbd special report on medical marijuana,hempmeds kannaway,hereinafter referred to as hemp oil hustlers.this article claimed to have evidence that rsho was contaminated with heavy metals and solvents without verifying the accuracy of the results from stewart environmental.project cbd also alleged that multiple people became ill after using rsho due to heavy metals and other toxins based on cranford opinion.lee wrote a forward for cantu article,asserting opinions and rumors as fact without proof or citation,and published cantu article on his project cbd website.see exhibit m.
plaintiffs are informed and believe,and based thereon allege,that the hemp oil hustlers article from october,has been republished on at least other websites.see exhibit l.
despite knowledge that the preliminary results were inaccurate,cannlabs,rifle mountain,llc,murry,cranford,project cbd,cantu,lee,does through,inclusive,each of them,jointly or separately continued to publish these results.italics added.
in the portion of the first amended complaint alleging the cause of action for libel,which the trial court did not strike in response to project cbd,aaron cantu,and martin lee the project cbd defendants motion,the sole allegation identifying the false statement or statements to support the cause of action provides 
plaintiffs are informed and believe,and based thereon allege,that between may,and june,cannlabs,rifle mountain,llc,murry,cranford,project cbd,cantu,lee,does through,inclusive,each of them,jointly or separately,published negative statements of fact about plaintiffs on facebook,which contained untrue and false statements regarding plaintiff product,rsho.italics added.
in the portion of the first amended complaint alleging the cause of action for false light,which the trial court also did not strike in response to the project cbd defendants motion,the sole allegation identifying the false statement or statements to support the cause of action provides 
plaintiffs are informed and believe,and based thereon allege,that on or about may,cannlabs,rifle mountain,llc,murry,cranford,project cbd,cantu,lee,does through,inclusive,each of them,jointly or separately,without plaintiffs consent,put plaintiffs in a false light by writing,publishing,and circulating negative statements about plaintiffs on facebook,which contained untrue statements of fact regarding plaintiffs and plaintiffs product,rsho.italics added.
these are the only false statements alleged to have been published by the project cbd defendants in these two causes of action.
based on these allegations,it appears that no specific conduct attributed to the project cbd defendants has been alleged as the basis for the causes of action for libel or false light against the project cbd defendants.in particular,the conduct from which these causes of action are alleged to arise is limited to statements made between may,and june,and statements made on facebook.the only statements identified in reference to the project cbd defendants in the first amended complaint,however,are alleged to have been published in october,and are not alleged to have been published on facebook.see exhibit l to the first amended complaint.
the court therefore requests that the parties respond to the following questions 
is the first amended complaint deficient with respect to alleging the existence of any conduct on the part of the project cbd defendants to support the causes of action for libel and false light 
assuming that the first amended complaint fails to state a legally sufficient cause of action against the project cbd defendants for libel or false light because the first amended complaint fails to identify any conduct on the part of these defendants in setting forth these causes of action,comment on the following potential dispositions of this appeal,provide an alternative proposed disposition 
a this court affirms the trial court denial of the project cbd defendants motion with respect to the libel and false light causes of action on the ground that the causes of action do not arise from the defendants alleged protected activity because no activity on the part of these defendants has been alleged as to the libel and false light causes of action see jarrow formulas,lamarche cal th,in considering an motion,the court first decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity,without prejudice to the project cbd defendants filing a demurrer or other challenge to the legal sufficiency of the claims against them on remand or 
b this court reverses the trial court denial of the project cbd defendants motion with respect to the libel and false light causes of action on the ground that the plaintiffs can not demonstrate a probability of prevailing on these causes of action against the project cbd defendants because they can not demonstrate that the complaint is legally sufficient with respect to these claims see briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,in second step of motion analysis,court must determine whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the merits by assessing whether the plaintiff has stated and substantiated a legally sufficient claim.footnote omitted.
the parties submitted timely supplemental briefs in which they took opposing positions with respect to both of the court questions.
discussion 
the project cbd defendants assert that the trial court erred in failing to strike the plaintiffs causes of action for libel and false light as pleaded in counts and of the first amended complaint.according to the project cbd defendants,the court correctly determined that the claims for libel and false light against them arose from protected conduct under the statute,but incorrectly determined that the plaintiffs had demonstrated a probability of prevailing on these claims against the project cbd defendants.the project cbd defendants also assert that the trial court erred in concluding that the plaintiffs are not limited public figures,meaning that the plaintiffs would not have to demonstrate that the project cbd defendants acted with actual malice in publishing the article,that the court erred in concluding in the alternative that the plaintiffs had demonstrated that the project cbd defendants acted with actual malice.
after reviewing the record,we conclude that the trial court properly declined to strike the plaintiffs claims for libel and false light against the project cbd defendants,but on grounds different from the grounds on which the trial court based its order.as we explain,the project cbd defendants can not meet their burden to identify any protected activity that forms the basis of the libel and false light claims against them,because the complaint does not allege any activity on the part of the project cbd defendants to support the libel and false light claims.thus,the statute protections have not been triggered with respect to the libel and false light claims ostensibly asserted against the project cbd defendants.

the trial court determined that the project cbd defendants had met their burden on the first prong of the analysis,the court concluded that they had demonstrated that the plaintiffs claims for relief against the project cbd defendants were based on allegations arising from activities engaged in by the project cbd defendants that are protected by the statute,specifically,the project cbd defendants publication of the hemp oil hustlers article.the trial court proceeded to the second step of the analysis and determined,with respect to counts and,that the plaintiffs had demonstrated a probability of prevailing on these claims.the court therefore denied the project cbd defendant motion with respect to counts and.
our independent review of the record,however,reveals that the plaintiffs asserted claims for relief against the project cbd defendants in counts and are not based on any conduct alleged to have been undertaken by the project cbd defendants.the sole allegations referring to the project cbd defendants in the first amended complaint are the factual allegations found in paragraphs,and of the general allegations.those paragraphs state the following
