the telecommunications act of,stat.the telecommunications act,added new provisions covering video programming accessibility to the communications act of,et the act.the new provisions,codified in of the communications act,specifically dealt with closed captioning and video description technologies that can be employed to enhance television video services for hearing and visually impaired individuals.closed captioning displays the audio portion of television signals as words displayed on the screen and can be activated at a viewer discretion.video descriptions provide aural descriptions of a television program key visual elements such as the movement of a person in a scene that are inserted during pauses in the program dialogue.video descriptions change program content because they require the creation of new script to convey program details,whereas closed captions present a verbatim transcription of the program spoken words.
congress treated the two technologies quite differently when it passed the telecommunications act,which added to the communications act.section a required the commission to complete a closed captioning inquiry and to report its findings to congress within days of the act passage.a.sections b and c required the commission to prescribe closed captioning regulations and established compliance deadlines.b c.sections d and e established exemptions from the closed captioning rules.d e.in contrast,subsections f and g the sole subsections dealing with video description merely defined video description and required the fcc to prepare a report to congress.f g.unlike the provisions covering closed captioning,did not authorize the commission to adopt regulations implementing video descriptions.
after releasing a report on video description,the fcc announced that it was seeking commentary on proposed rules mandating video description.implementation of video description of video programming,notice of proposed rulemaking,wl notice of proposed rulemaking.the fcc then adopted rules mandating television programming with video descriptions.implementation of video description of video programming,report and order,wl report and order.the motion picture association of america mpaa and the national federation of the blind nfb both petitioned this court for review of the agency regulations mandating video descriptions.mpaa contends that the new regulations should be struck down because they are not authorized by and they are precluded by of the act.see.nfb contends that the regulations should be rejected as arbitrary and capricious,because the fcc failed to assess whether visually impaired persons actually want or need video description,as opposed to rules requiring spoken articulation of text.
by its terms,the act does not provide the fcc with the authority to enact video description rules.contrary to the fcc arguments suggesting otherwise,does not give the fcc unlimited authority to act as it sees fit with respect to all aspects of television transmissions,without regard to the scope of the proposed regulations.we hold that where,as in this case,the fcc promulgates regulations that significantly implicate program content,is not a source of authority.because the fcc can point to no other statutory authority,the video description regulations must be vacated.accordingly,mpaa petition for review is hereby granted.nfb petition for review is dismissed as moot,because the regulations to which they object will be vacated pursuant to the court judgment in this case.
background 
the telecommunications act added to the communications act new video programming accessibility provisions involving closed captioning and video description.video description is defined in the statute to include the insertion of audio narrated descriptions of a television program key visual elements into natural pauses between the program dialogue.id.g.video descriptions are usually transmitted over a secondary audio programming channel,a subcarrier that allows video distributors to transmit additional soundtracks,such as foreign language programming.closed captioning and video description of video programming,report,wl video accessibility report.
there is a marked difference between congress treatment of closed captioning and video description in of the act.the new provision required the fcc to complete an inquiry into closed captioning,and report the results to congress within days of the act passage.a.it also affirmatively required that the fcc prescribe regulations for the implementation of closed captioning,id.b,and established compliance deadlines for that action,id.c.in contrast,only required that the fcc prepare a video description report for congress it did not mandate any implementation of visual descriptions.id.f.
the initial house bill preceding the enactment of would have required the fcc to adopt video description rules.see report and order,at powell,dissenting noting that provided that the fcc shall,within year of enactment of the video programming accessibility section,prescribe such regulations as are necessary to ensure that all video programming is fully accessible to individuals with disabilities through the provision of closed captioning service and video description emphases and bracketed language in original.however,the bill was amended in committee to provide a discretionary grant of authority rather than mandate that the fcc provide video description.the new language provided that,f ollowing the completion of such inquiry,the commission may adopt regulation sic it deems necessary to promote the accessibility of video programming to persons with visual impairments.amendment to moorhead,reprinted in joint appendix.this new version of the bill passed the house in,f,cong.sess,reprinted in.
the corresponding senate bill,however,only directed the fcc to report to congress about video description it neither mandated video description nor provided the fcc with discretionary authority to adopt such rules,cong.sess,reprinted in.the conference committee adopted the senate version,abandoning the house language providing the fcc with discretionary authority.congress passed this version of the bill and the president signed it into law.
after the enactment of,the fcc issued the report that the act mandated.the report stated that the best course is to continue to collect information and monitor the deployment of video description and the development of standards for new video technologies that are likely to affect the availability of video description.video accessibility report,at.the fcc supplemented this report with a second report,annual assessment of the status of competition in the markets for the delivery of video programming,report,wl.then,in,the fcc announced that it was seeking commentary on proposed rules that would mandate video description.notice of proposed rulemaking.the commission sought commentary,inter alia,about whether the fcc possessed statutory authority to enact such rules.id.at.
after reviewing the comments,the fcc voted to adopt rules requiring certain video programmers to supplement certain programming with video descriptions.see report and order.the fcc concluded that it possessed the statutory authority to adopt these rules pursuant to of the act.section gives the fcc authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce in communication by wire and radio so as to make available,so far as possible,to all the people of the united states a rapid,efficient,and wire and radio communication service.the fcc majority also rejected the argument that,precluded the agency from mandating video description merely because the provision only authorized the fcc to conduct an inquiry.report and order,at.finally,the fcc found that the record demonstrated the importance of video description to persons with visual disabilities.id.at.the fcc primarily based this conclusion on the american council for the blind submission,which contained more than and letters of support for the rules.id.
the fcc video description rules require commercial television broadcasters affiliated with the top four commercial networks abc,cbs,fox,and nbc to provide fifty hours of video description per quarter during either prime time or children programming.b.the rules also require multichannel video programming distributors that serve or more subscribers to provide fifty hours of video description per quarter during prime time or children programming on each channel that carries one of the top five nonbroadcast networks.id.b.
commissioners powell and dissented from the visual description order,because they did not believe that the communications act authorized the fcc to adopt video description rules.id.at,dissenting powell,dissenting.
various parties sought reconsideration of the fcc order,primarily on the ground that the rules exceeded the fcc legal authority.petition for reconsideration of the mpaa,mm docket,reprinted in petition for partial reconsideration and clarification submitted by the national association of broadcasters,mm docket,reprinted in petition for reconsideration of the national cable television association,mm docket,reprinted in.the fcc denied reconsideration,although it did refine certain implementation issues related to the new rules.implementation of video description of video programming,memorandum opinion and order on reconsideration,wl,erratum issued.mpaa and nfb then filed petitions for review.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
in deciding whether to defer to the fcc construction of the act,we adhere to the tests enunciated by the supreme court in chevron natural resources defense council,d and united states mead,d.in chevron,the court held that,i f the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.at.at.this is chevron step one review.if congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue,and the agency has acted pursuant to an express or implicit delegation of authority,the agency interpretation of the statute is entitled to deference so long as it is reasonable and not otherwise arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.id.at.at.this is chevron step two review.in either situation,the agency interpretation of the statute is not entitled to deference absent a delegation of authority from congress to regulate in the areas at issue.see ry.labor executives ass mediation,en banc chevron deference is warranted only when congress has left a gap for the agency to fill pursuant to an express or implied delegation of authority to the agency.quoting chevron,at.at.
mead reinforces chevron command that deference to an agency interpretation of a statute is due only when the agency acts pursuant to delegated authority.at.at.the court in mead also makes it clear that,even if an agency has acted within its delegated authority,no chevron deference is due unless the agency action has the force of law.id.at.at.
in this case,the principal question is whether congress delegated authority to the fcc to promulgate visual description regulations.absent such authority,we need not decide whether the regulations are otherwise reasonable.an agency may not promulgate even reasonable regulations that claim a force of law without delegated authority from congress.
b.the fcc lacks statutory authority to adopt the video description rules 
mpaa argues that precludes the adoption of rules mandating video description and that does not otherwise authorize the fcc to adopt video description rules.we largely agree,although we rest principally on the latter point.
there is no doubt that,by its terms,does not provide the fcc with the authority to enact video description rules,and the fcc does not suggest that it does.the harder question is whether the provision effectively bars the fcc from mandating video description.
statutory provisions in pari materia normally are construed together to discern their meaning.erlenbaugh united states,d noting that the rule that statutes in pari materia should be construed together is a logical extension of the principle that individual sections of a single statute should be construed together holyoke water power ferc,the three sections are in pari materia and must be read together.faic,united states,t hese two statutes are in pari materia and must be construed together.here,when subsections a,b,and f of all addressed to video programming accessibility are construed together,a strong argument can be made that congress meant not to authorize the commission to mandate video description.the dissenting opinion of fcc chairman powell powerfully demonstrates this point.see at powell,dissenting.
subsections a and f merely call for the fcc to undertake studies on closed captioning and video description,respectively.subsection f,which deals with video description,provides 
within months after the date of enactment of the telecommunications act of enacted,the commission shall commence an inquiry to examine the use of video descriptions on video programming in order to ensure the accessibility of video programming to persons with visual impairments,and report to congress on its findings.the commission report shall assess appropriate methods and schedules for phasing video descriptions into the marketplace,technical and quality standards for video descriptions,a definition of programming for which video descriptions would apply,and other technical and legal issues that the commission deems appropriate.
f.in contrast,subsection b affirmatively mandates that 
the commission shall prescribe such regulations as are necessary to implement this section.such regulations shall ensure that video programming first published or exhibited after the effective date of such regulations is fully accessible through the provision of closed captions and video programming providers or owners maximize the accessibility of video programming first published or exhibited prior to the effective date of such regulations through the provision of closed captions 
b.the difference in the language employed in these sections makes it clear that subsection f is not intended to provide a mandate for video description requirements.subsection f neither parallels the closed captioning mandate contained in subsection b nor suggests that congress provided the fcc with discretionary authority to adopt video description rules.
we need not decide whether positively forecloses agency rules mandating video description.rather,we find that does not authorize the fcc to adopt such rules.we also find that,when coupled with the absence of authority under discussed below,clearly supports the conclusion that the fcc is barred from mandating video description.we now turn to the question whether,or any other provision in the act,authorizes the commission to mandate video description.
section of the communications act of 
the fcc report and order argues that the fcc authority to mandate video description is derived from the combination of of the communications act,a of the act,a stating that t he provisions of this act shall apply to all interstate and foreign communication by wire or radio and to all persons engaged within the united states in such communication,i of the act,i stating that t he commission may perform any and all acts,make such rules and regulations,and issue such orders,not inconsistent with this act,as may be necessary in the execution of its functions,and r of the act,r stating that the commission from time to time,as public convenience,interest,or necessity requires shall m ake such rules and regulations and prescribe such restrictions and conditions,not inconsistent with law,as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this act.at oral argument,counsel for the fcc essentially conceded that if the agency can not find its authority in then the video description regulations must be vacated by the court.we agree.
the fcc majority opinion argues that authorizes the agency to mandate video description,because 
congress authorized the commission to make available to all americans a radio and wire communication service,and to promote safety and life through such service,and to make such regulations to carry out that mandate,that are consistent with the public interest and not inconsistent with ot
