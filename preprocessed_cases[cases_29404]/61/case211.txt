diane bond sued the city of chicago and several members of its police department,claiming that the officers violated her constitutional rights while performing official duties.during discovery,the city turned over voluminous material relating to citizen complaints against its police officers the information was subject to a protective order that prohibited public disclosure of these confidential records.the documents produced during discovery were never filed with the court nor used in any judicial proceeding.
bond eventually settled with the city and its officers collectively the city,and the parties submitted a stipulation and order for dismissal to the district court.just before the court entered the order,however,independent journalist jamie kalven petitioned for permission to intervene so he could challenge the protective order.kalven claimed that under rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure,there was no good cause to maintain the protective order and asked that it be modified to allow him access to some of the documents pertaining to citizen complaints against chicago police officers.kalven is joined on appeal by chicago aldermen who also want access to these police department records.the district judge dismissed the case with prejudice pursuant to the parties stipulation but said she would keep the case open for purposes of entertaining kalven intervention petition.
bond did not join kalven request to modify the protective order.the city objected to any modification,arguing that the order should be left in place given the department interest in keeping these records confidential.a few months after dismissing the case,the district judge entered an order simultaneously granting kalven request to intervene and lifting the protective order in its entirety.the city appealed,and we stayed the district court order.
we now vacate that order kalven petition should have been dismissed for lack of standing.the controversy originally supporting the court jurisdiction no longer existed at the time the court acted on kalven petition the parties had settled,the case was dismissed with prejudice,and neither bond nor the city asked the court to revisit and modify the terms of the protective order postjudgment.with no live controversy ongoing,kalven was required to demonstrate his standing to intervene and resuscitate the is,he was required to establish that he met the requirements of article iii by showing an actual or imminent invasion of a legally protected interest.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.although no one challenged his standing below or on appeal and the district court did not independently address it,we are required to satisfy ourselves that jurisdictional prerequisites are met.we conclude they are not.
kalven claims no constitutional or right to challenge the protective so,because there is no constitutional or right of public access to discovery materials exchanged by the parties but not filed with the court.unfiled discovery is private,not public.furthermore,bond has not asserted an interest in disseminating the documents she agreed to the protective order and did not ask that it be modified,so kalven can not,and does not,claim a derivative first amendment right to receive them.instead,kalven based his intervention petition on a supposed presumption of public access emanating from rule c good cause requirement.there is no such presumption for discovery that is not part of the court file and therefore no right or legally protected interest to support kalven standing to intervene.the district court lacked any alternative jurisdictional basis to revisit and revoke the protective order sua sponte.accordingly,we vacate the court order permitting intervention and lifting the protective order,and remand with instructions to dismiss kalven petition for lack of standing.
background 
this appeal arises out of a action diane bond filed in against eight chicago police officers and supervisors and the city of chicago.bond alleged that the police officers had subjected her to various forms of physical and mental abuse while performing their official duties.during pretrial discovery,the parties agreed to a protective order that prohibited public disclosure of certain confidential materials.the order covered employment,disciplinary,and investigatory information other information that is of a sensitive or nonpublic nature about chicago police officers and files generated by the investigation of complaints of misconduct by chicago police officers what the city calls complaint register files or cr files,including information that could be used to identify the officers.in response to bond discovery requests,the city produced thousands of pages of documents some of those documents were categorized as confidential under the protective order and therefore are subject to the nondisclosure requirement.none of the discovery was filed with the court.
the parties eventually settled bond claims,and in march they submitted an agreed order of dismissal to the district court.on march,the court signed and entered the order dismissing the case with prejudice.a week before,however,on march,jamie kalven,an independent journalist,filed a petition to intervene and motion to unseal public documents relating to allegations of police misconduct.this phrasing was odd.the court had never been asked to seal any documents in the court record as such,there were no sealed public documents to unseal.it was clear from the petition,however,that kalven sought modification of the protective order and access to certain categories of documents the city had produced during discovery.he later narrowed the list of documents he seeks,but all involve the police department confidential records of citizen complaints filed against its officers.a docket entry recording the entry of the dismissal order noted that the case was dismissed with prejudice but also stated that t he case remains open for the purpose of the court retaining jurisdiction over the pending petition of jamie kalven to intervene and motion to unseal public documents relating to allegations of police misconduct.
the city did not oppose kalven intervention but strongly objected to his challenge to the protective order,arguing that good cause continued to support keeping the documents confidential.see.c.bond did not join kalven request to modify the protective order and made no substantive response to his petition.on july,the district court entered an order allowing kalven to intervene and rescinding the protective order in its entirety.the court reevaluated whether good cause existed to keep the documents confidential,and in so doing applied a presumption of public access to discovery materials.the court further concluded that the public interest in information about police misconduct outweighed the interest of the city and its officers in keeping the records confidential.the district court did not affirmatively order that the documents be provided to kalven rather,the court lifted the protective order,thereby permitting either party to disclose the discovery documents the city appealed the district court order and moved for a stay pending appeal.a motions panel of this court granted that motion.
while the city appeal was pending,chicago aldermen attempted to intervene in the district court to obtain access to the police department confidential documents.the aldermen wanted the records to help them decide whether to adopt a proposal to separate the police department oversight board from the police department itself.the district court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction because of the pending appeal,see griggs provident consumer disc,d united states mchugh,cir,and the aldermen appealed the district court jurisdictional ruling.a motions panel dismissed that appeal but allowed the aldermen to intervene in this one.thus,as this case comes to us,the aldermen and kalven have identical positions they defend the district court decision to lift the protective order 
ii.discussion 
the federal rules of civil procedure broadly permit parties in litigation to obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party claim or defense.b.given the extensive intrusion into the affairs of both litigants and third parties that is both permissible and common in modern discovery,seattle times rhinehart,d,the rules provide for the use of protective orders,entered for good cause,to protect litigants and third parties from the annoyance,embarrassment,oppression,or undue burden or expense that may attend the discovery process.c.protective orders are often entered by stipulation when discovery commences.that was the procedure used here.
in addition to prohibiting the public disclosure of certain categories of confidential discovery material,the agreed protective order provided that upon request at the termination of the proceeding,the documents designated as confidential would be returned to the producing party.the protective order also provided,however,that before a party could submit documents otherwise subject to the protective order to the court under seal,the party would have to file a separate motion and obtain a court order permitting the documents to be filed under seal.this provision was consistent with the requirements explained in baxter international,abbott laboratories,cir,and citizens first national bank of princeton cincinnati insurance,cir,for submitting documents to the court under seal.
it never came to that.none of the discovery that which was covered by the protective order nor any other found its way into the court file.bond settled with the city,and the case was dismissed with prejudice nevertheless,the district court,postjudgment,entertained kalven petition to intervene.without addressing the matter of kalven standing,the district court permitted the intervention and rescinded the protective order.
that was a mistake.although we have previously held that permissive intervention is a procedurally appropriate device for bringing a challenge to a protective order,see jessup luther,cir in re associated press,cir grove fresh,everfresh juice,cir,that was in the context of requests for access to sealed records in the court file jessup,associated press and requests for intervention made during ongoing litigation grove fresh here,in contrast,the litigation was over,the case was dismissed,and kalven wanted to intervene in order to press a claimed right of access to unfiled discovery material as such,the question of his standing should have been addressed.although the parties and the district court omitted this threshold inquiry,and the city did not raise the issue on appeal,we have an independent obligation to address it,city of dallas,d federal courts are under an independent obligation to examine their own jurisdiction craig ont,cir.
a.the relationship between article iii and rule b 
the exercise of federal judicial power is legitimate only in live cases or controversies,and one of the controlling elements in the definition of a case or controversy under article iii is standing.hein freedom from religion,d quoting asarco kadish,d plurality opinion internal alteration omitted.the supreme court has described standing as perhaps the most important article iii doctrine.allen wright,d.in essence the question of standing is whether the litigant is entitled to have the court decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues.warth seldin,d.to qualify as a case fit for adjudication,arizonans for official english arizona,d,there must be an actual controversy in existence at all stages of review,not merely at the time the complaint is filed,steffel thompson,d.if a dispute is not a proper case or controversy,the courts have no business deciding it daimlerchrysler cuno,d.
the standing issue that arises here is complex because it involves the relationship between the requirements of article iii and the rules for permissive intervention under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.there is some confusion as to whether permissive intervenors must,as a general matter,independently demonstrate standing before they can be allowed to enter a lawsuit.the supreme court has said generally that rule b plainly dispenses with any requirement that the intervenor shall have a direct personal or pecuniary interest in the subject of the litigation,sec realty improvement,but has also observed that an intervenor right to continue a suit in the absence of the party on whose side intervention was permitted is contingent upon a showing by the intervenor that he fulfills the requirements of article iii,diamond charles,d emphasis added.some circuits have concluded that permissive intervenors do not need to show standing so long as another party with constitutional standing on the same side as the intervenor remains in the case.san juan county,utah united states,cir,aff,cir en banc emphasis added see also shaw hunt,cir intervenors do not need to show standing to obtain attorney fees under.
this circuit has not directly addressed the relationship between article iii and rule b although we have held that standing is necessarily a component of intervention as of right under rule a,see solid waste agency of cook county army corps of eng rs,cir,we have also noted that it is an open question in this circuit whether article iii standing is required for permissive intervention under rule b,transamerica ins.south,cir but see flying j,van hollen,cir stating without discussion that a permissive intervenor must establish article iii standing.regarding intervention in general,we have recognized that at some fundamental level the proposed intervenor must have a stake in the litigation in order to satisfy article iii.sokaogon chippewa cmty.babbitt,cir.
in the typical case,a third party wants to join a lawsuit to advocate for the same outcome as one of the existing parties.see horne flores,d group of legislators intervened to argue a contempt order should be same relief that one of the parties to the case sought.in this typical case,the permissive intervenor may not need to show standing for the same reason that not every plaintiff in a lawsuit is required to show standing as long as there is at least one individual plaintiff who has demonstrated standing to assert these rights as his own,a court need not consider whether the other plaintiffs have standing to maintain the suit.vill.of arlington heights metro.hous.dev,d.in this situation,t he case will proceed and the concrete dispute must be resolved whether the intervenor is there or not,and therefore the intervenor standing is irrelevant to the court power to decide the case.bethune plaza,lumpkin,cir accord ruiz estelle,cir.
intervention for purposes of challenging a protective order is an unusual species of permissive intervention that triggers its own unique standing issues.rule b allows intervenors to join as parties to a lawsuit when they raise a claim or a defense that shares with the main action a common question of law or fact.b b.we have held that this language is broad enough to encompass a challenge to a protective order even though it is not a neat fit the interest being asserted by such an intervenor is not really a claim or defense.see jessup,at grove fresh,at see also eeoc children,on its face,rule b would appear to be a questionable procedural basis for a challenge to a confidentiality order.
also,when a third party intervenes to challenge a protective order,it can not be said to have intervened on an existing party side unless that party also opposes the protective order.where,as in many cases and in this case,the protective order is entered by stipulation of the parties,the extra litigant is not simply along for the ride but rather shifts the progress of the lawsuit in a new direction to obtain relief that neither the plaintiff nor the defendant may want.bethune plaza,at.intervention to challenge a protective order after a case has been dismissed interferes even more fundamentally it revives a concluded case for the purpose of entertaining an outsider claim of interest in the proceeds of the parties discovery process.rule b specifically provides that in deciding whether to permit intervention,the court must consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the original parties rights.b emphasis added.this language suggests that intervention necessarily disturbs the final adjudication of the parties generally be disfavored.
for our purposes here,we may set to one side the question whether a permissive intervenor must establish standing to challenge a protective order in an ongoing case the question for us is whether an intervenor must establish standing to challenge a protective order after the case has been dismissed.the answer is yes.
this conclusion flows from the established general principle,noted above,that an actual controversy must be extant at all stages of review,not merely at the time the complaint is filed in order t o qualify as a case fit for adjudication.arizonans for official english,at.internal quotation marks omitted.the supreme court has also suggested,if not directly held,that permissive intervenors must show standing if there is otherwise no live case or controversy in existence.for example,in arizonans for official english,the court expressed grave doubts about the standing of a group of intervenors that had been permitted to enter the lawsuit as to challenge an adverse decision of the district court under the unusual procedural circumstances of the case,the original defendants had not challenged the adverse decision and were no longer considered parties to the case.id.at.in the end,however,the court did not need to resolve the question of the intervenors standing based on a change in the plaintiff circumstances,the court declared the case moot,vacated the decision,and remanded with instructions to dismiss.id.at.that the court raised the issue at all,however,suggests that had the case not been moot,the court would have required the intervenors to demonstrate their independent standing to keep the controversy alive.
more recently in horne flores,d,the court raised but again did not need to resolve an issue.horne involved a request to lift a contempt order that imposed fines on the state of arizona for every day that it failed to comply with a court order requiring it to adequately fund an educational program.the request was brought by the state superintendent of public instruction,a defendant in the underlying litigation,but two state legislators also intervened under rule b arguing for the same relief.the court said that because the intervening legislators were aligned with the superintendent and the superintendent plainly had standing,the question of the intervening legislators standing need not be addressed.at.as in arizonans for official english,however,the court reference to the intervenors standing suggests that had the superintendent not requested relief from the contempt order,the intervening legislators would have been required to establish their independent standing to do so.
our conclusion is also consistent with the approach followed by other circuits in cases involving postjudgment intervention for the purpose of challenging a protective order.for example,the fifth circuit has concluded that a third party seeking to intervene to challenge a protective order after the main controversy has been disposed of must demonstrate standing.see deus allstate ins,cir.in the fifth circuit view,while there is no article iii requirement that such intervenors have standing in a pending case,newby enron,cir,a challenge to a protective order after the plaintiff claims have been dismissed can not be maintained if the third party ha s no personal interest affording standing to intervene,deus,at see also newby,at in the absence of a live controversy in a pending case,an intervenor would need standing to intervene.pansy borough of stroudsburg,cir requiring newspaper intervenors to establish standing to challenge protective order postjudgment and concluding that they had done so public citizen liggett group,cir addressing standing in the context of postjudgment request by group for access to discovery documents covered by protective order.
accordingly,we hold that when a third party seeks intervention under rule b for the purpose of challenging a protective order in a case or controversy that is no longer when the case has been dismissed and none of the original parties has sought this relief intervenor must meet the standing requirements of article iii in addition to rule b requirements for permissive intervention.here,the litigation between bond and the city had been settled and the case was about to be dismissed with prejudice when kalven filed his petition to intervene.at that point,and certainly thereafter,when the case was in fact dismissed,a live article iii case or controversy between the parties no longer existed.as such,kalven was required to independently establish his standing before being permitted to intervene.see flying j,at in another context,noting without discussion that a permissive intervenor must have article iii standing to intervene for purposes of appealing an adverse decision that the original losing defendant did not want to appeal.
standing to challenge a protective order to access unfiled discovery 
article iii standing requires an capable of being redressed by a favorable decision of the court.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.an is a concrete and particularized invasion of a legally protected interest,sprint commc ns apcc,d quoting lujan,at,and must be actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical,lujan,at.internal quotation marks omitted.furthermore,standing exists only if it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.id.quoting simon.welfare rights,d.
although standing in no way depends on the merits of the plaintiff contention,standing does turn on the nature and source of the claim asserted.warth,at.see also mcconnell fec,d standing requires a claim of injury to a legally cognizable right.we have noted that the supreme court standing doctrine requires litigants to establish an injury to an interest that the law protects when it is wrongfully invaded,and this is quite different from requiring them to establish a meritorious legal claim.aurora loan,craddieth,cir see also,sec,cir clay fort wayne cmty,cir.however,while a litigant need not definitively establish that a right of his has been infringed,he must have a colorable claim to such a right to satisfy article iii.aurora loan,at see also,at.
many of our well as decisions from other broadly about a presumption of public access to discovery materials.citizens first bank,at see also public citizen,at in re agent orange prod.liab,cir referring to the public presumptive right of access to discovery materials.to the extent that this language suggests the existence of a general public right to access the materials that litigating parties exchange in response to discovery requests,it sweeps too broadly.as we will explain,while the public has a presumptive right to access discovery materials that are filed with the court,used in a judicial proceeding,or otherwise constitute judicial records,the same is not true of materials produced during discovery but not filed with the court.generally speaking,the public has no constitutional,statutory,or right of access to unfiled discovery.
it is beyond dispute that most documents filed in court are presumptively open to the public members of the media and the public may bring challenges to protective orders that shield court records and court proceedings from public view.see,jessup,at t hose who seek access to sealed court material have a right to be heard in a manner that gives full protection to the asserted right.quoting associated press,at citizens first bank,at regarding filing of appellate appendix under seal associated press,at regarding press access to sealed court records.this right is derived from the principle that courts are public institutions that operate principle codified at judicially imposed limitations on this right are subject to the first amendment.see,globe newspaper.for norfolk county,d nixon warner commc ns,d it is clear that the courts of this country recognize a general right to inspect and copy public records and documents,including judicial records and documents.footnote omitted see also smith dist.for dist.of,cir recognizing that although this principle originally stemmed from a need to ensure access to criminal proceedings,the right of access has subsequently been expanded to civil proceedings.
while the public right to access court records is not unlimited,see nixon,at.of,riverside county,d,and rule c allows a court to shield certain documents from the public when there is good cause to do so,citizens first bank,at public interest in observing judicial process can be overridden if the property and privacy interests of the litigants predominate in the particular case,the general right of public access to judicial records is enough to give members of the public standing to attack a protective order that seals this information from public inspection.see jessup,at grove fresh,at associated press,at.
this case is different.here,kalven is seeking access to discovery materials that have never been filed with the court and have never influenced the outcome of a judicial proceeding.the supreme court has held that the public right of access is limited to traditionally publicly available sources of information,and discovered,but not yet admitted,information is not a traditionally public source of information.seattle times rhinehart,d accord grove fresh,at u ntil admitted into the record,material uncovered during pretrial discovery is ordinarily not within the scope of press access.at common law,pretrial proceedings were closed to the public,see gannett,depasquale,d,and the federal discovery rules have not changed this tradition.as the court noted in seattle times,d iscovery rarely takes place in public,at,and the system created by rule contemplates that the exchange of information in discovery will occur with minimal judicial involvement.see.a a,requiring parties to disclose certain material automatically,regardless of whether other litigants have requested it id.c party seeking a protective order must certify that it has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with other affected parties in an effort to resolved the dispute without court action see also.providing that courts shall hereafter refuse to hear any and all motions for discovery and production of documents under rules through of the federal rules of civil procedure,unless the motion includes a statement that after consultation in person or by telephone and good faith attempts to resolve differences they are unable to reach an accord,or counsel attempts to engage in such consultation were unsuccessful due to no fault of counsel.
there are good reasons to treat the public right to access filed and unfiled discovery materials differently.for starters,pretrial discovery,unlike the trial itself,is usually conducted in private.citizens first bank,at.pretrial,interrogatories,and the production of documents are not public components of a civil trial,were not open to the public at common law,and in general,are conducted in private as a matter of modern practice.seattle times,at.that the court discovery processes and rules are used to require litigants to produce otherwise private information to an opposing party is not enough to alter the legal rights of the general public.discovery rules are a matter of legislative grace,and l iberal discovery is provided for the sole purpose of assisting in the preparation and trial,or the settlement,of litigated disputes.seattle times,at.we have said that s ecrecy is fine at the discovery stage,before the material enters the judicial record.baxter int l,abbott,cir.
the rights of the public kick in when material produced during discovery is filed with the court.see seattle times,at.recognizing that the public has a right to access anything that is a traditionally public source of information and observing that courthouse records could serve as a source of public information.at this point,the documents have been used in a court proceeding.d,and consequently the possibility exists that they could influence or underpin the judicial decision and they are therefore presumptively open to public inspection unless they meet the definition of trade secret or other categories of bona fide confidentiality.baxter int,at see also citizens first bank,at.
it is true that some cases suggest that rule c creates a substantive right of public access to discovery.see san jose mercury news,dist.court for,cir public citizen,at agent orange,at.these cases,however,were based on a prior version of rule d of the federal rules of civil procedure that generally required all discovery materials to be filed with the court unless the court ordered otherwise.see,agent orange,at citing a prior version of rule d.the drafters of a amendment to rule d considered establishing a rule that discouraged the filing of all discovery but decided not to such materials are sometimes of interest to those who may have no access to them except by a requirement of filing,such as members of a class,litigants similarly situated,or the public generally.d,advisory committee note.accordingly,some courts read the prior rule d together with rule c and concluded that these rules implied the existence of a public right to access discovery even if the discovery was not filed with the court,agent orange,at.
whatever force these decisions had was destroyed by the amendment to rule d,which reversed the longstanding rule generally requiring discovery to be filed with the court.since,information exchanged in discovery must not be filed until it is used in the proceeding or until the court orders filing.d emphasis added.in its present form,then,rule d separates discovery of whether it is subject to a rule c protective two categories that which is filed with the court because it is used in a court proceeding or is ordered to be filed and that which remains unfiled and therefore not part of the public court record.as the second circuit has recognized,this amendment eliminated any implied right of public access to unfiled discovery emanating from the procedural rules.see sec,cir observing that the amendment to rule d provides no presumption of filing of all discovery materials,let alone public access to them abrogating agent orange.accordingly,nothing in rule c either standing alone or when read in conjunction with the current version of rule d confers substantive rights upon third parties seeking access to the fruits of discovery 
the district court analysis indicates that the judge thought rule c conferred a right on third parties to challenge a protective order at any time and under any circumstances the court seized upon language from some of our caselaw that refers to a presumption in favor of public access,citizens first bank,at most cases endorse a presumption of public access to discovery materials in re cont l.sec,cir.the presumption mentioned in these cases simply refers to the general right of the public to access material contained in court files and the limited right of litigants under the first amendment to disseminate information discovered in advance of trial,seattle times,at.it is a mistake to conclude,as the district court did,that rule c creates a freestanding public right of access to unfiled discovery.kalven standing thus can not be grounded in rule c 
nor can it be grounded in the first amendment.kalven appears to concede this point he does not assert a constitutional right of access to the unfiled discovery.the only first amendment concern raised by a protective order limiting disclosure of unfiled discovery is the effect such an order may have on a litigant rights,which the supreme court has said are limited by the context through which the information is acquired.seattle times made it clear that a litigant has no first amendment right of access to information made available only for purposes of trying his suit.at.as such,judicial limitations on a party ability to disseminate information discovered in advance of trial implicate the first amendment rights of the restricted party to a far lesser extent than would restraints on dissemination of information in a different context.id.at.see also arthur miller,confidentiality,protective orders,and public access to the courts,harv,describing the interest in accessing information produced by discovery as a side effect therefore subordinate judicial system central concern of resolving disputes between litigants.where,as here,the litigants themselves agreed to the protective order and do not seek its modification,this limited interest simply is not in play.
accordingly,kalven can not claim standing based on a derivative first amendment right to receive information this doctrine requires the existence of a willing speaker.see.state bd.of pharmacy.citizens consumer council,d freedom of speech presupposes a willing speaker.but where a speaker exists,the protection afforded is to the communication,to its source and to its recipients both.footnote omitted accord kleindienst mandel,d acknowledging a first amendment right to receive information and ideas and that freedom of speech necessarily protects the right to receive.media challenges to gag orders have been allowed where the orders interfere with the right to receive information from parties and their attorneys who wish to disseminate it.see,in re dow jones,cir cbs young,cir.but a stipulated protective order involves secrecy and is therefore not the equivalent of a gag order.
we have said in another context that a first amendment claim lies only where there is a willing speaker because a precondition of the right to receive is the existence of a willing speaker.right to life,shepard,cir quoting.state bd.of pharmacy,at.every circuit to have considered the question of standing in the context of a claim has reached the same conclusion i n order to maintain a right to listen claim,a plaintiff must clearly establish the existence of a willing speaker.in the absence of a willing speaker,an article iii court must dismiss the action for lack of standing.family,black,cir internal quotation marks omitted accord stephens county of albemarle,cir competitive enter.inst.dep t of,basiardanes city of galveston,cir recipients of protected communication have standing only if there is a speaker who wishes to express himself or herself.
thus,to satisfy article iii on this type of claim,an intervenor must do more than simply assert that a protective order interferes with his inchoate,derivative right to receive discovery information.see.hosp.ass n,at.imagining the existence of a willing speaker runs contrary to the supreme court command that must be actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan,at.internal quotation marks omitted.where,as here,the litigants have voluntarily bound themselves to keep certain discovery confidential and do not themselves seek relief from the requirements of the protective order,there is no willing speaker on which to premise a first amendment claim.
in short,kalven has no injury to a legally protected interest and therefore no standing to support intervention.neither do the aldermen in all material respects,they are in the same position as kalven.
alternative basis for jurisdiction 
as an alternative basis for jurisdiction,it might be argued that the district court authority to modify or revoke the protective order postjudgment is premised upon its inherent power.a district court dismissal of a lawsuit by stipulation under rule a a ii of the federal rules of civil procedure generally limits the power of the court to issue further orders,see kokkonen guardian life ins.of,d,but the supreme court has recognized that a court can take certain postdismissal action in furtherance of its ancillary jurisdiction,a doctrine which recognizes federal courts jurisdiction over some matters otherwise beyond their competence that are incidental to other matters properly before them.id.at.a sua sponte postjudgment modification of a protective order does not fall within the court ancillary jurisdiction it is not a matter incidental to another matter that is properly before the court.
kokkonen held that after a lawsuit has been dismissed,the doctrine of ancillary has alternatively been called pendent jurisdiction,supplemental jurisdiction,or jurisdiction,charles alan wright et,federal practice procedure,at ed will empower the court to act only where necessary to enable the court to function successfully,that is,to manage its proceedings,vindicate its authority,and effectuate its decrees.kokkonen,at.more specifically,the court held in kokkonen that to support an exercise of ancillary jurisdiction postjudgment,there must be an express reservation of jurisdiction in the judgment.
kokkonen involved the question of a federal court jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement following dismissal.the court said that ancillary jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement would exist only if the parties obligation to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement had been made part of the order of by separate provision such as a provision retaining jurisdiction over the settlement agreement or by incorporating the terms of the settlement agreement in the order.id.at.in that situation,the court said,a breach of the agreement would be a violation of the order,and ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the agreement would therefore exist.id.but where the dismissal order neither incorporated the parties settlement agreement nor expressly retained jurisdiction over it,the court lacked ancillary jurisdiction to enforce it and any action for breach of the agreement belonged in state court.id.
as applied here,these principles foreclose the possibility that the district court had inherent authority to revisit and rescind the protective order.we note again that the protective order did not operate to shield the court own records from public view although a court may have inherent authority to modify a protective order sealing documents maintained in the court file,see nixon,at.e very court has supervisory power over its own records and files,that not what at issue here.and although rule of the federal rules of civil procedure might have provided a basis for a postjudgment motion for relief from the protective order by bond or the city,that obviously not at issue here,either there was no breach of the protective order nor fraud in connection with its of these might have supported an exercise of ancillary jurisdiction to enable the court to vindicate its authority.kokkonen,at.
and finally,although the docket notation recording the entry of the agreed order of dismissal said the case remained open for the purpose of the court retaining jurisdiction over kalven petition to intervene to unseal public documents,this is an insufficient basis upon which to rest ancillary jurisdiction.first of all,there were no sealed public documents in the court file that the judge might have been prevailed upon to unseal.second,neither the parties stipulation to dismiss nor the agreed dismissal order incorporated a retention of jurisdiction the docket entry alone can not supply ancillary jurisdiction.once the case was dismissed with prejudice,kalven attack on the protective order simply can not be considered ancillary or incidental to any matter properly before the court.we have found no case suggesting that a district court may sua sponte raise and rebalance the equities that led to the entry of a protective order after the dispute that created the need for it has ended.the district court order dissolving the protective order therefore can not be justified as an exercise of its inherent authority.
for the foregoing reasons,we vacate the district court order granting kalven petition to intervene and lifting the protective order and remand with instructions to dismiss the petition for lack of standing.because the aldermen also lack standing,we vacate our prior order granting their motion to intervene in this appeal that motion is now denied and they are dismissed from the appeal.
i concur in the result because i believe that the district court lacked justification to lift the protective order.as the majority correctly explains,the district court erroneously applied a presumption of public access under rule c to the unfiled discovery documents exchanged in this case.such a presumption is no longer tenable in light of the amendment to rule d,which provided that discover
