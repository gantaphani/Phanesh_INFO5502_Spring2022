we consider the district court order unsealing the transcript of a plea colloquy,a plea agreement cooperation addendum and the documents supporting a motion to seal the plea proceedings.
ismael ran a drug cartel in mexico along with javier and arturo.after authorities captured the three men,agreed to plead guilty and to cooperate with the government,but the others,initially,declined the government and signed a plea agreement containing a cooperation addendum in which pledged to help the government build its case against the cartel.the government filed the plea agreement with the district court,along with a motion to seal the plea proceedings.the government argued that publicizing plea would endanger him and others.joined the government motion to seal.
the district court granted the government motion to seal while the government took steps to reduce the danger to and others.after those steps were taken,the district court unsealed a redacted transcript of the plea colloquy and all of the plea agreement except the cooperation addendum.this got the attention of copley press,which intervened and asked that the court unseal all the other documents the government had filed in support of its motion to seal,and the transcripts of the hearings on that motion.the district court ordered everything unsealed except the names,birthdates and addresses of the endangered people,but stayed its order while the government sought review.former partners join copley press in opposing the government petition,but do not claim that sealing the documents has impeded their defense.
jurisdiction 
under the collateral order doctrine,we have jurisdiction over a narrow class of decisions that do not terminate the litigation,but must,in the interest of achieving a healthy legal system,nonetheless be treated as final.digital equip.desktop direct,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in order to satisfy this exacting standard,an order must conclusively determine the disputed question,resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,and be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.coopers lybrand livesay,d bracketed numbers added.all three coopers lybrand factors are present here.
secrecy is a street once information is published,it can not be made secret again.an order to unseal thus conclusively determine s that the information will be public.id.for the same reason,such an order is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.id.this case is distinguishable from united states hickey,cir,where we concluded that we lacked jurisdiction to hear the government appeal of an order sealing defendants financial affidavits.that order did not conclusively determine the affidavits secrecy because the government could file a renewed motion to unseal after the trial was over.id.at.
whether the documents are unsealed is an issue completely separate from the government criminal case against.coopers lybrand,at.the order to unseal wo affect defense because he already pled guilty and,in any event,joined the motion to seal.united states hitchcock,cir per curiam,involved an order that was entwined with the merits if defendants submitted the affidavits unsealed,the government could use them at trial.id.at.therefore,the district court order was completely separate from the merits and would have been reviewable on appeal from a final judgment of conviction.id.
while the government brought this case as a petition for a writ of mandamus,we conclude that we have jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine,and so will treat this case as an appeal under.the clerk is directed to alter the docket accordingly.
we must first consider whether the first amendment gives the public a right to access these documents.if we answer in the affirmative as to any of the documents in question,we must then determine whether any such right is overcome by a compelling governmental interest.finally,we consider whether the common law gives the public a right of access separate from the first amendment.
a.our case law gives the public a qualified first amendment right to access three types of documents at issue here the cooperation addendum to plea agreement,appendix to petition for a writ of mandamus app.tab e the government motion,and the memoranda filed in support of it,to seal the plea agreement,app.tab a,tab b tab h tab l,and the district court orders granting the government motion,app.tab c tab oregonian publ ng dist.court,cir.as to these documents,the only question is whether the right to access is overcome by a compelling governmental interest,a question we consider below.see infra.
b.we have not yet decided whether the public has a first amendment right to access a plea colloquy transcript.to answer that question,we consider both historical experience and logic,times mirror united states,cir,though logic alone,even without experience,may be enough to establish the right.see seattle times dist.court,cir even without an unbroken history of public access,the first amendment right exists if public scrutiny would benefit the proceedings see also phoenix newspapers,dist.court,cir even if the historic right of access were not dispositive,the logic prong of the test would be.
every circuit to consider the issue has concluded that logic favors public access to plea colloquy transcripts.see united states danovaro,cir in re washington post,cir see also washington post robinson,right of access to plea agreements and related documents united states haller,cir right of access to plea hearings.public access to plea colloquy transcripts reveals the basis on which society imposes punishment,danovaro,at,and also serves the important function of discouraging either the prosecutor or the court from engaging in arbitrary or wrongful conduct,in re washington post,at see also haller,at.moreover,the supreme court has held that the public is entitled to attend criminal trials,globe newspaper superior court,d,so it stands to reason that plea colloquies,which serve as a substitute for a trial,should also be open to the public.in re washington post,at see oregonian,at this reasoning supports the public right to access plea agreements.we agree with the other circuits to consider the matter that the public has a qualified first amendment right to access plea colloquy transcript.app.tab f from,line to end.we consider below whether this right is overcome by a compelling governmental interest.see infra.
also at issue here are the transcripts of three hearings on the government motion to seal.app.tab f from to,line tab k tab n.we have not yet decided whether the public has a first amendment right to access such transcripts,so we again apply the experience and logic test.see supra.
there no historical experience of public access to these hearings or to their transcripts because the hearings did exist until quite recently.they were invented years ago in united states brooklier,cir,as part of our circuit procedure for sealing criminal proceedings.see oregonian,at to seal a plea agreement,the district court must follow the procedure set forth in brooklier because the hearings are entirely novel,we have no historical experience of public access to them.united states.
even without historical experience,logic requires that at least part of these hearings be open to the public,because one of their purposes is to give the public an opportunity to be heard.see phoenix newspapers,at the hearings give the public and press an opportunity to object or offer alternatives to closure see also united states biagon,slip,procedure to close defendant allocution.if the public has a right to attend the hearings,it necessarily follows that it is entitled to read the transcript of those parts of the proceeding that were public.see superior court ii,d.we conclude,therefore,that the public has a qualified right to read the transcripts of those portions of the hearings on the motion to seal that were open to the public.app.tab f from to,line tab n from to,line tab n from,line to end.we consider below whether this right is overcome by a compelling governmental interest.see infra.
