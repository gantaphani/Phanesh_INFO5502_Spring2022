the january issue of playgirl magazine featured a cover photograph of actor jose solano,best known for his role as manny gutierrez on the syndicated television program baywatch from to.solano was shown shirtless and wearing his red lifeguard trunks,the uniform of his baywatch character,under a heading reading tv guys.primetime sexy young stars exposed.playgirl,ostensibly focused on a female readership,typically contains nude photographs of men in various poses emphasizing their genitalia,including some showing them engaged in simulated sex acts.the magazine also contains written editorial features.although did not pose for or give an interview to not in fact appear nude in the magazine,he sued playgirl alleging it deliberately created the false impression that he did so,making it appear he was willing to degrade himself and endorse such a magazine.
the district court granted playgirl summary judgment,finding solano had failed to establish that playgirl created a false impression about what readers would actually see of solano inside the magazine or in any event that it had acted knowingly or recklessly in doing so.we disagree and reverse for a trial.at this stage of the proceedings,viewing the evidence most favorably to solano as we must on summary judgment,we hold that he provided sufficient evidence to create triable issues of fact for the jury on the elements of each of his causes of action.
facts and procedural history 
because this case concerns the magazine cover,we describe it in some detail and append a copy of it to this opinion.addendum as indicated above,solano appeared wearing his red trunks,dominating the cover.in the upper left corner was a red circle containing the words,tv guys,followed by the headline,primetime sexy young stars exposed,which ran across the top of solano head.immediately to the left of solano picture,the magazine proclaimed,sizzling centerfolds ready to score with you.the s in centerfolds was superimposed on solano right shoulder.also placed to the left of solano,running down the left margin,the cover touted countdown to climax naughty ways to ring in the new year,toyz in the hood the best in erotic home shopping and bottoms up hot celebrity buns.in the cover lower right hand corner was the headline,baywatch best body,jose solano.
solano sole appearance inside the magazine was on page,in a,him fully dressed in a tee shirt and a brief,profile of the actor.solano profile included information about his baywatch character,facts about his life before he began acting and a quote in which he says that with two younger brothers he strives to be a positive role model and hopes to encourage others to pursue their dreams.solano photograph and profile were part of a feature entitled tv guys,consisting of photographs and short profiles of popular television actors.neither solano nor any of the other actors was shown nude.significantly,playgirl issues are displayed on newsstands packaged in plastic wrap to prevent potential customers from flipping through the pages to view the magazine contents.
this action began when solano filed suit against the magazine publisher,playgirl,in california superior court,alleging playgirl invaded his privacy by portraying him in a false light and by misappropriating his likeness in violation of california civil code and common law.he claimed he was humiliated and embarrassed when he learned of the use of his photograph on the cover of playgirl and that he suffered a decline in job offers,invitations to charity events and social contacts with others in the entertainment industry following the publication of the january issue after playgirl removed the case to federal court,the district court granted playgirl motion for summary judgment.the court found that the use of solano photograph in playgirl did not create a false impression and,in any event,as a public figure he could not show actual malice that the public affairs exception defeated his claim and that the public interest exception defeated his common law misappropriation of likeness claim.the court also awarded attorney fees and costs to playgirl.solano timely appealed.
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.weiner san diego county,cir.we must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,whether any genuine issues of material fact exist and whether the district court applied the relevant substantive law.lopez smith,cir en banc.
discussion 
i.the false light claim 
solano argues that playgirl use of his photograph along with suggestive headlines on the cover conveyed the false message that solano voluntarily posed nude for the magazine and,in doing so,implicitly endorsed the magazine and its sexually explicit content.to prevail on this false light claim,solano must show that playgirl disclosed to one or more persons information about or concerning solano that was presented as factual but that was actually false or created a false impression about him the information was understood by one or more persons to whom it was disclosed as stating or implying something highly offensive that would have a tendency to injure solano reputation by clear and convincing evidence,playgirl acted with constitutional malice and solano was damaged by the disclosure.see fellows enquirer,cal d,aisenson am.broad,d,see also restatement second of torts discussing elements of false light claim.
false impression and injury to reputation 
solano contends that when the photograph and headlines on the cover are viewed in of a magazine that features sexually suggestive nude pictures of is a triable issue of fact regarding the falsity of the message conveyed by playgirl.we agree.we addressed a publication creating an implied false message in eastwood enquirer,cir,and kaelin globe communications,cir.in eastwood the tabloid magazine national enquirer cover page headline advertised an exclusive interview with clint eastwood.the magazine contained an article with quotes allegedly attributable to eastwood,cast as if eastwood had been speaking directly to the bylined enquirer editor.see eastwood,at.eastwood in fact had never given any interview to the or otherwise.although the magazine never expressly stated that eastwood actually had given it the interview,this court nevertheless reasoned that the enquirer had signal ed,through text and graphics,that he had willingly talked to the enquirer.id.at.kaelin involved a defamation action brought by kato kaelin,the hapless houseguest of simpson,against the globe tabloid for publishing a headline announcing,cops think kato did it he fears they want him for perjury,say pals.kaelin argued the it implied the two brutal murders for which simpson was tried and acquitted the magazine claimed the word referred only to perjury,because the article inside the magazine explained that the police suspected kaelin of having committed perjury.we were unpersuaded by the globe argument even assuming that such a perjury reading is reasonably possible,it is not the only reading that is reasonably possible as a matter of law.so long as the publication is reasonably susceptible of a defamatory meaning,a factual question for the jury exists.kaelin,at 
playgirl reliance on brewer hustler magazine,cir,is misplaced.in brewer,the plaintiff brought suit when hustler magazine reproduced a portion of a previously published postcard depicting brewer shooting himself in the head.brewer himself had created the postcard and contracted to sell it commercially.we rejected brewer argument that his right to privacy was violated by publication of the photograph in a sexually explicit magazine,holding that t his argument is without merit because brewer had no right to choose the forum in which his photograph was displayed.id.at.similarly,solano can not prevail on his false light claim simply by arguing that playgirl put him on the cover of a magazine that contains explicit content.indeed,that was the basis of brewer a reproduction of a portion of his nonsexual postcard appeared inside a sexually explicit magazine.
unlike brewer,solano claim goes much deeper.solano contends that his,photograph alongside the suggestive headlines on the playgirl cover created the false impression that readers could expect to find more photographs of him inside the magazine,nude exposed in playgirl typical sexually explicit and revealing mode of depicting its sexy male subjects.moreover,the placement of the sizzling to score with you line,which appeared in large bold letters immediately to the left of and just touching solano shoulder,could reasonably be interpreted to encompass playgirl cover subject,solano.it is that a defendant is liable for what is insinuated as well as for what is stated explicitly,d,quotation omitted.it is playgirl insinuation about what readers would see of solano inside the magazine that distinguishes this case from brewer.as the seventh circuit observed in douglass hustler magazine,cir,where an actress asserted a false light claim based on hustler magazine insinuation that she was the kind of person to pose nude for hustler to be depicted as voluntarily associated with such a sheet is unquestionably degrading to a normal person id.at.
that solano profile inside the magazine was of a relatively innocent and nonsexual nature is of little significance in kaelin,we concluded that the accuracy and truth of the globe article discussing the suspicion that kaelin had perjured himself did not cure the false impression conveyed by the cover headline,which implied he was suspected of murder.at.we held that the issue was one for the jury to decide a reasonable juror could conclude that the kaelin article was too far removed pages away from the cover headline to have the salutary effect that globe claims.id.here,the solano profile appeared pages away from the plenty of graphic frontal male nudity to traverse before reaching tv guys and solano tame profile o ur inquiry is not to determine whether the publication may have an innocent meaning but rather to determine if it reasonably conveys a defamatory meaning.in making that determination we look to what is explicitly stated as well as what insinuation and implication can reasonably be drawn from the publication.selleck globe int l,d,citation omitted.given the record before when we recall that the magazine is displayed for sale in plastic wrapping,making the cover the key to what a reader can expect to find inside the jury reasonably could reach a conclusion similar to that arrived at by this court in eastwood 
w e look to the totality of the enquirer presentation of the interview and find that the editors falsely suggested to the ordinary reader of their well as those who merely glance at the headlines while waiting at the supermarket checkout eastwood had willingly chatted with someone from the enquirer.
at.there we concluded that the false impression that eastwood had actually given an interview with the enquirer could convey the message that he was washed up as a movie star if he was courting publicity in a sensationalist tabloid.id.similarly,a jury reasonably could conclude that the playgirl cover conveyed the message that solano was not the wholesome person he claimed to be,that he was willing was washed up and had himself naked to a women sex magazine.
actual malice 
although solano has established a genuine issue as to whether the cover created a false impression,to survive summary judgment he must,as a public figure,also establish by clear and convincing evidence that playgirl editors knowingly or recklessly created this false impression.the third element necessary to establish a claim for false light,therefore,is the constitutional requirement of actual malice.see communications,connaughton,d quoting bose consumers union of united states,d aisenson.at.a failure to set forth specific facts showing such malice is a proper ground for summary judgment.see dworkin hustler magazine,cir.specifically,solano must show that playgirl either deliberately cast its statements in an equivocal fashion in the hope of insinuating a false import to the reader,or that it knew or acted in reckless disregard of whether its words would be interpreted by the average reader as false statements of fact.good gov t group of seal beach,superior court,cal d.as we noted in eastwood,proving actual malice by clear and convincing evidence is a heavy burden,far in excess of the preponderance sufficient for most civil litigation.at.in,the supreme court explained the actual malice standard 
t he actual malice standard is not satisfied merely through a showing of ill will or malice in the ordinary sense of the term nor can the fact that the defendant published the defamatory material in order to increase its profits suffice to prove actual malice.actual malice,instead,requires at a minimum that the statements were made with a reckless disregard for the truth.and although the concept of reckless disregard can not be fully encompassed in one infallible definition,we have made clear that the defendant must have made the false publication with a high degree of awareness of probable falsity,or must have entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication.
at.citations and footnote omitted.similarly,the california court of appeal has emphasized 
r eckless conduct is not measured by whether a reasonably prudent man would have published,or would have investigated before publishing.there must be sufficient evidence to permit the conclusion that the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication.publishing with such doubts shows reckless disregard for truth or falsity and demonstrates actual malice.
aisenson.at citation omitted.
the subjective determination of whether the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of the statement may be proved by inference,as it would be rare for a defendant to admit such doubts.a court typically will infer actual malice from objective facts.these facts should provide evidence of negligence,motive,and intent such that an accumulation of the evidence and appropriate inferences supports the existence of actual malice.bose consumers union,cir citations omitted.
against this backdrop,we now turn to the conflicting evidence regarding the existence of actual malice on the part of playgirl editors in assembling the january issue.playgirl associate editor theresa testified in her deposition that at an october meeting to discuss the january cover,playgirl senior vice president carmine bellucci generally instructed the editorial staff to sex up the magazine to imply that there was more nudity in the magazine than actually was there she stated that bellucci wanted to bang readers over the head with something like,hey,this is sexy young stars exposed so that people are going to want to pick up the magazine more.according to,we definitely were trying to be subtle,and we knew it.she stated that there had been discussion in the cover meetings that the cover layout implied solano appeared nude in a centerfold inside the magazine.she said the primetime sexy young stars exposed headline specifically sparked debate at the meetings b ecause some of us did not feel like it was fair to do that.claire viguerie harth testified that the magazine intent with the headline was to make a line that was sexy enough that people would be intrigued and want to look inside,but not to say something that the magazine was showing something that it did have.
playgirl art director joanne chiaramonte emphasized that if the magazine had contained a nude photograph of solano,the cover explicitly would have said so.she stated that she never thought readers would expect to see solano in a centerfold photograph because the headline,baywatch best body,jose solano clearly referred to solano presence in the magazine.but see eastwood,at concluding that readers would not understand that only enquirer interview,not exclusive interview,would mean interview was given directly to enquirer.additionally,she explained that e xposed and nude are really two different things.associate art director serena spiezio disagreed she testified that she thought it would be reasonable for a reader to expect to see solano nude inside the magazine b ecause it says tv guys and they being exposed.and it playgirl magazine.what else
