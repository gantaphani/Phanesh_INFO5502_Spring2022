amended opinion 
this matter is before the court on prime media,petition for rehearing en banc.upon consideration of the relevant briefs and the record,we vacate our prior opinion,prime media,city of brentwood,cir,and replace it with this amended opinion.
prime media filed this lawsuit to challenge a sign ordinance of the city of brentwood,tennessee.in a prior appeal,this court reversed the district court entry of summary judgment on behalf of prime media,ordering the dismissal of prime media constitutional challenge as applied.on remand,the district court dismissed prime media remaining challenges to the sign ordinance on the basis of standing.prime media appeals that decision by the district court.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court decision.
the relevant facts of this case were set forth in the prior appeal as follows 
in,the city of brentwood promulgated an ordinance limiting the use of billboards within the city.the purpose of the ordinance was to maintain and enhance the environment to promote the effective use of signs as a means of communication and economic growth and to advance the safety and welfare of the community as it relates to the use of exterior signs in the city.among other restrictions,the ordinance limited the size of billboards to a face area of square feet and a height of six feet,the latter of which includes the length of any pole supporting the sign.as originally enacted,the ordinance also prohibited,signs that direct attention to a business,commodity,or service offered at a location other than the premises on which the sign is erected.
in october,prime media,an outdoor advertising company,applied for a permit from brentwood to build and place billboards near interstate.relying on the ordinance,brentwood denied the permit request on three grounds it violated the restriction because the proposed billboards would be square feet in size it violated the height restriction because the proposed billboards would rest on poles and it violated the restriction because the billboards would not be located on the premises that they were promoting.
after receiving this response,prime media filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the sign ordinance on two it violated the guarantees of the first and fourteenth amendment and the guarantees of the fourteenth amendment.while the case was pending in the district court,brentwood amended the ordinance to remove the restriction.the amended ordinance also added a purpose and findings section.the p urpose of the new ordinance is to i mprove the visual appearance of the city while providing for effective means of communication,consistent with constitutional guarantees.the f indings of the new ordinance say that 
the city zoning regulations have always included the regulation of signs in an effort to provide adequate means of expression and to promote the economic viability of the business community,while protecting the city and its citizens from a proliferation of signs of a type,size,location and character that would adversely impact upon the aesthetics of the community and threaten the health,safety and welfare of the community.the regulation of the physical characteristics of signs within the city has had a positive impact on traffic safety and the appearance of the community.
the amendment did not alter the size and height restrictions.in response to this development,prime media amended its complaint to challenge the constitutionality of the modified ordinance and sought damages arising from injuries caused by the original ordinance.
prime media,city of brentwood,cir citations omitted.in addition to the changes to the ordinance discussed in the prior panel opinion,it is particularly worth noting that the permitting requirement was removed altogether.the amended ordinance now allows officials to inspect signs and issue municipal court citations for violations of the ordinance only after they are erected.see amended ordinance a.additionally,any violations of the ordinance are to be addressed by the issuance of a citation to the municipal court,which would seem to indicate that the aggrieved party is entitled to some degree of judicial review before the ordinance will be enforced against it.id.further,a party interested in erecting a sign but seeking to avoid the citation can,if it desires,seek a letter of compliance before doing so in order to clear up any uncertainty.b.
in its initial decision,the district court granted prime media motion for summary judgment,finding that the size and height restrictions were,but were not narrowly tailored to promote brentwood interests.the district court based its decision on brentwood failure to provide a factual record demonstrating how the six foot height and square foot size limits,in particular,advanced the city interest in aesthetics and traffic safety.additionally,brentwood failed to provide studies or analyses of alternative methods to achieve the city interests.
brentwood appealed the district court decision to this court,and a three judge panel reversed the decision.id.the prior panel held that the size and height requirements imposed by brentwood were sufficiently tailored for a regulation.id.at.relying on members of city council of los angeles taxpayers for vincent,d,we stated that a s it was in taxpayers for vincent,so it is here by banning these signs,the city did no more than eliminate the exact source of the evil it sought to remedy.prime media,at.
after upholding brentwood height and size requirements for billboards,we addressed the two alternative grounds for affirmance raised by prime media its first amendment facial challenge to the entire ordinance,including its challenge to numerous provisions of the ordinance that do not affect prime media,and its equal protection challenge to the ordinance.id.
because the district court did not address either of these claims,we leave it to the district court in the first instance to consider well as prime media standing to raise in mind that a law application to protected speech must be substantial,not only in an absolute sense,but also relative to the scope of the law plainly legitimate applications,before applying the strong medicine of overbreadth invalidation.
id.at quoting virginia hicks,d.we accordingly remanded the case for consideration of the facial challenges and equal protection challenge.
upon remand of the case,the district court dismissed prime media suit for lack of standing.the district court held that prime media no longer met the traditional standing requirement of injury in fact after this court held that brentwood size and height requirements are constitutional.therefore,the district court reasoned that prime media had to rely on the overbreadth doctrine and standing to have standing in a suit against brentwood and its billboard ordinance.citing a case from the eleventh circuit,tanner advertising group,llc fayette county,georgia,cir,rev en banc,cir,the district court held that the overbreadth doctrine required that the plaintiff suffer a traditional injury in fact in order to have standing.because the district court determined that prime media had suffered no injury in fact in relation to its remaining claims prime media was deemed to lack standing,even under the overbreadth doctrine,and the case was thereby dismissed.
prime media now appeals the issue of standing to this court.

prime media argues that the district court erred by ruling that it had suffered no injury in fact and contends that it actually does have article iii standing.prime media actual injury in this case was the rejection of its six proposed billboards for failure to meet,among other requirements,the size and height requirements of brentwood sign ordinance.based on the prior panel decision,however,these requirements have been found to be sufficiently tailored to pass constitutional scrutiny.at.therefore,despite establishing standing on this specific challenge to the height and size provisions,prime media simply lost on the merits,due to the constitutionality of the requirements as they applied to prime media.the remaining question is whether prime media still has standing to litigate its remaining numerous other provisions of the ordinance are also facially invalid under the first amendment,and its equal protection and due process though none of these challenges are supported by an independent injury in fact.
in a traditional standing case,the answer would clearly be in the negative.in this case,however,prime media has claimed that brentwood ordinance is overly broad,which implicates the overbreadth doctrine.the supreme court has recognized that some broadly written statutes may have such a deterrent effect on free expression that they should be subject to challenge even by a party whose own conduct may be unprotected.taxpayers for vincent,at.citing thornhill alabama.this version of standing alters the traditional rules of standing to the first amendment area attacks on overly broad statutes with no requirement that the person making the attack demonstrate that his own conduct could not be regulated by a statute drawn with the requisite narrow specificity.broadrick oklahoma,d quoting dombrowski pfister,d.litigants,therefore,are permitted to challenge a statute not because their own rights of free expression are violated,but because of a judicial prediction or assumption that the statute very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression.id.according to prime media,because they rely on a claim of overbreadth,they need not demonstrate an injury in fact separate from that under the height and size requirements in order to establish standing to proceed.
the overbreadth doctrine compels us to take a closer look at the threshold standing requirements,which involve two related but distinct inquiries.at the outset,no plaintiff can litigate a case in federal court without establishing constitutional standing,which requires a showing that the plaintiff has suffered an injury that is fairly traceable to the defendant allegedly unlawful conduct and that is likely to be redressed by the requested relief.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.these three factors constitute the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing.id.to ignore these minimum requirements would convert the judicial process into no more than a vehicle for the vindication of the value interests of the concerned bystanders.valley forge christian coll.americans united for separation of church and state,d quoting united states scrap,d.
the second strand of the standing inquiry involves the doctrine of prudential standing.unlike constitutional standing,which involves absolute and irrevocable justiciability requirements under article iii,prudential standing is a judicially created doctrine relied on as a tool of judicial.warth seldin,d.prudential standing requirements preclude litigation in federal court when the asserted harm is a generalized grievance shared in substantially equal measure by all or a large class of citizens,or where instead of litigating his own legal rights and interests,the plaintiff instead purports to rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.id.at.additionally,prudential standing includes a requirement that the plaintiff complaint fall within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question.valley forge christian,at.although these three prudential requirements have a close relationship to the policies reflected in the art icle iii requirement of actual or threatened injury amenable to judicial remedy,the theoretical underpinnings of the two are rather distinct.id.unlike the doctrine of prudential standing,the constitutional standing requirement of a distinct and palpable injury that is likely to be redressed if the requested relief is granted states a limitation on judicial power,not merely a factor to be balanced in the weighing of prudential considerations.id.
this overview leads us to the question of how the doctrine of overbreadth affects the requirements of standing.the overbreadth doctrine allows plaintiffs to attack the constitutionality of a statute or ordinance not because their own rights of free expression are violated,but because of a judicial prediction or assumption that the statute very existence may cause others before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression.virginia am.booksellers ass n,d.as such,overbreadth only amounts to an exception to the usual prudential standing requirement that a party may assert only a violation of its own rights.id.an overbreadth claim can instead proceed with no requirement that the person making the attack demonstrate that his own conduct could not be regulated by a statute drawn with the requisite narrow specificity.broadrick,at.thus,in an appropriate first amendment overbreadth claim,a plaintiff whose conduct is regulated by a rule of law is permitted to challenge the constitutionality of that particular rule of law regardless of the fact that a more circumscribed version of that rule of law could be applied in a constitutional fashion to prohibit the plaintiff conduct.because overbreadth creates an exception only to the prudential standing inquiry,the supreme court has made clear that the injury in fact requirement still applies to overbreadth claims under the first amendment.am.booksellers ass n,at.holding that t o bring a cause of action in federal court requires that plaintiffs establish at an irreducible minimum an injury in fact that is,there must be some threatened or actual injury resulting from the putatively illegal action.see also sec y of state of maryland joseph munson,d the crucial issues for overbreadth standing are whether the plaintiff satisfies the requirement of,and whether the plaintiff can be expected satisfactorily to frame the issues in the case.even though prime media advances an overbreadth challenge,it is thus still required to show an injury in fact to challenge the provisions of the ordinance that are yet to be litigated.
prime media standing with regard to the size and height requirements does not magically carry over to allow it to litigate other independent provisions of the ordinance without a separate showing of an actual injury under those provisions.this a party who has injury in fact standing to challenge a particular provision of a law has,by virtue of that injury alone,overbreadth standing to challenge other provisions of the same statute or recently received substantial attention in the eleventh circuit.the district court cited some of this case law in its opinion and the parties have vigorously argued over its significance to this appeal.since we heard oral arguments in this case,the eleventh circuit appears to have definitively and,in our view,correctly answered the question.
in camp legal defense fund,city of atlanta,cir,the eleventh circuit observed that a plaintiff who has established constitutional injury under a provision of a statute as applied to his set of facts may also bring a facial challenge,under the overbreadth doctrine,to vindicate the rights of others not before the court under that provision.emphasis added.hence,t he overbreadth doctrine allows plaintiffs to bring a facial challenge to the provisions under which the plaintiff suffered an injury in fact.id.the court emphasized that the supreme court has reaffirmed the independent obligation of federal courts to ensure a case or controversy exists as to each challenged provision even in a case where the plaintiffs established harm under one provision of the statute.id.at citing,dallas,d,modified in part on other grounds in city of littleton gifts,d.thus,the camp court concluded that a plaintiff is required to establish injury in fact as to each provision challenged,even under the overbreadth doctrine.id.see also kh outdoor,llc city of trussville,cir following camp and holding that a plaintiff may bring an overbreadth claim to challenge only those provisions of a law that affect its activities where those provisions actually caused it injury.
we agree with the eleventh circuit approach
