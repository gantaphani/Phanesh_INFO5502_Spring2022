introduction 
cbs broadcasting,and sarah goldfinger collectively defendants or appellants appeal from the denial of their special motion to strike pursuant to code of civil procedure section,also known as the statute after independently reviewing the record,we conclude that the trial court erred in denying the motion.accordingly,we reverse and remand with instructions to grant the motion.
factual and procedural history 
in,goldfinger met scott and melinda tamkin collectively,the tamkins,plaintiffs,or respondents when she was in the process of buying a home.the tamkins,married real estate agents who lived in los angeles,represented the seller of a home on which goldfinger had made an offer.after goldfinger offer was accepted,she exercised her right to cancel the transaction because an inspection revealed the property would require extensive remediation.
goldfinger was one of the writers for the popular cbs television show,csi crime scene investigation csi,which is set in las vegas,nevada.according to defendants,each episode of csi is written collaboratively,through multiple drafts,with input from executive producers,the studio and the network.the process moves quickly,with shows typically written and filmed within weeks.the process is as follows first,executive producers assign writers to work on an episode once an outline is approved,the writers work on preliminary drafts of an initial script typically,there are very early drafts of the initial scripts which are circulated internally among the production staff the preliminary writers draft,the writers draft,and in some cases,the revised writers draft collectively,the writers drafts the next draft,for broader distribution,is the first draft.
early writers drafts are kept confidential,shared only amongst the producers and writers of each episode.citation.when necessary due to time constraints,the casting staff receives writers drafts to begin the process of casting guest roles prior to filming.an outside service prepares breakdowns,or short written synopses of the characters,for use during casting.citation.each script undergoes a legal clearance process before it is produced,generally before the first draft is distributed,to ensure that names and places used by csi do not infringe on anyone rights.citations.as part of that vetting,all character names are changed if they match individuals.
in fall of,goldfinger and corinne marrinan were assigned to write csi episode season,episode.their proposed storyline about a murder in a fast food restaurant was approved as the main a story,but the executive producer wanted a separate story involving a second b story.the executive producer and the writers hammered out the concepts of the b story.it would involve a married couple in the real estate mortgage businesses,one of whom would commit suicide by overdosing on fluoride.
goldfinger used scott and melinda tamkin as the names of the married real estate couple in the early writers drafts for episode.within six days of the completion of the preliminary writers draft,and before the first draft was broadly disseminated,the legal clearance process was completed,and the characters name in the b story were changed to scott and melinda tucker.
in the interim,however,an incomplete preliminary draft of episode was sent to breakdown services,breakdown services by cbs casting staff,and breakdown services was requested to break down the roles in the draft.one of the writers for breakdown services then created casting synopses based upon the preliminary draft,including the following two synopses 
scott tamkin mid to,this slick,attractive,extensive man who been a mortgage broker since college feels his world drop out from under him during the mortgage crisis.his clients have left him and his own house may be foreclosed on.he is a suspect in his wife melinda murder guest star.
melinda tamkin mid,scott wife,she attractive,athletic real estate agent.unlike scott,she did let the recent economic downturn freak her out.melinda death may have occurred during kinky sex in which she was handcuffed to the bed.
breakdown services sent the casting synopses to cbs casting staff for approval,and then were given the authority to release it to talent representatives in los angeles.at some time during this process,the casting synopses were leaked and posted on various internet web sites,including to some spoiler web sites discussing csi.according to defendants,t hese websites provide public forums for csi fans to discuss all aspects of the show,including plot lines for upcoming shows.
episode was broadcasted on february.according to a ratings web site,the show attracted million viewers and was the most watched show that night.in episode,the married real estate couple,who lived in las vegas,was named scott and melinda tucker.scott and melinda were portrayed by caucasians,who did not wear glasses and looked like they were in their,in good physical shape,and of normal height and weight.there was no indication that they had children.they were experiencing marital discord.scott,a mortgage broker,was initially shown as being wasted or very drunk on the couch in the living room.he used high fluoride toothpaste and was suffering from receding gums.he had recently watched bondage pornography.scott was a suspect in his wife death.melinda was initially shown dead,handcuffed to the bed in the upstairs bedroom.a glass of wine and a pair of running shoes were also shown in the room.melinda also used high fluoride toothpaste and had been a dental hygienist prior to becoming a real estate agent.the couple was facing foreclosure on their home.when it was revealed that melinda had committed suicide and had tried to frame her husband for murder,scott suggested that melinda framed him because she blamed him for the loss of their house and their friends,some of whom were clients who had taken out ninja loans through scott and had lost their homes during the housing crisis 
on may,scott and melinda tamkin filed a complaint for per se and false light invasion of privacy against defendants arising from defendants alleged intentional and reckless conduct with respect to the writing and dissemination of a screenplay.according to plaintiffs,a fter defendant goldfinger was involved in a failed real estate transaction with plaintiffs,scott and melinda tamkin,she hijacked their complete names,physical characteristics,personal characteristics,marital relationship,ages and professions to craft,without their knowledge or consent,an episode of the global blockbuster csi crime scene investigation.defendant goldfinger then proceeded to embarrass the tamkins,and potentially damage the successful business relationships they have taken years to build,by creating from whole cloth characters engaged in a reckless lifestyle of sexual bondage,pornography,drunkenness,marital discord,depression,financial straits,and possibly even murder.italics added.the tamkins acknowledged that the names of goldfinger characters were changed during the actual broadcast of episode,but alleged that the damage was clearly done because of the widespread dissemination on the internet of casting synopses containing the tamkins names.
the tamkins alleged that the casting synopses contained defamatory statements.they assert that it was defamatory to describe the scott tamkin character as a slick,extensive watching man who feels his world drop out from him during the mortgage crisis.it was also defamatory to state that his clients have left him and his own house may be foreclosed on.he is a suspect in his wife melinda murder.similarly,it was defamatory to state that the melinda tamkin character death may have occurred during kinky sex in which she was handcuffed to the bed.
defendants filed an answer,generally denying the allegations and raising the statute as an affirmative defense.on august,defendants filed an motion to strike the complaint.in their motion,they asserted that their conduct was protected activity and that plaintiffs could not establish a probability of prevailing on their claims.goldfinger filed a declaration in support of the motion,and defendants filed a request for judicial notice of various newspaper articles and other documents.
in response,plaintiffs filed an ex parte application to take limited purpose discovery.plaintiffs sought discovery on general policies which claim exist and are followed with respect to not using a real person persona and description in their script and episode and their lack of authorization and responsibility for the spoilers.plaintiffs deposed goldfinger and a representative of breakdown services,gary marsh.
goldfinger had asserted in her declaration that it was common in the industry to use real names as placeholders for the names of characters.during her deposition,she testified that she used real names as placeholders in m ore than half of the hundred scripts or more that she had participated in.because the show utilized numerous guest characters,she used this writing technique to remember the characters.goldfinger did not note what names in the script were real names because she knew that the show had standards and practices who clear all the names.
in this case,goldfinger used scott and melinda tamkin as placeholders for the married real estate characters because the tamkins were the only married couple she knew in the real estate business.there was nothing unique,unusual,or distinctive about the tamkins,such as their looks or personalities that caused her to use their names.goldfinger also testified that she did not research the tamkins on the internet or visit their web site during the writing of the episode.she did not know that melinda tamkin was a runner,and she had no knowledge of the state of the tamkins marriage.goldfinger testified that she did not provide pictures or physical descriptions of the tamkins in connection with the casting of the characters.once the episode was written,however,she did visit the tamkins web site,along with the web site of other real estate agents,to assist the art and props departments.
marsh,president of breakdown services,testified about the events related to episode.he also testified that there are security procedures in place at his company to protect the confidentiality of the breakdowns.first,breakdown services verifies that the talent representative is a legitimate and licensed talent agency or a personal manager with the required letters of recommendation.second,the talent representative is required to sign a contract containing specific confidentiality provisions.third,the talent representative receives a unique login and password to access the web site where the breakdowns are posted.fourth,breakdown services does some monitoring to ensure that persons logging into their systems are legitimate.finally,breakdown services has an aggressive policy to pursue all legal means to stop dissemination and copying of their materials.
after the depositions were completed,plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion.citing dyer childress th dyer,they contended that defendants conduct did not fall within the purview of the statute.they also asserted that they would prevail on their claims at trial.in support of the opposition,plaintiffs filed separate declarations.scott tamkin described how he discovered the allegedly defamatory statements while doing an internet search of his name.he also noted that the actors web sites indicated that they would be portraying scott and melinda tamkin,not scott and melinda tucker.similarly,a media database web site also credited the actors with portraying scott and melinda tamkin.scott noticed the following similarities between the character scott tucker and himself during the broadcasting of the episode they shared the same first name,were married to a woman named melinda,have similar physical characteristics,appeared to be the same age,both worked in the real estate scott tucker was a mortgage broker while scott tamkin is a real estate agent,and both used prescription toothpaste for periodontal disease.
melinda tamkin filed a declaration stating that the character of melinda tucker in episode shared the following similarities with her same first name,married to a man named scott,similar physical appearance and age,same occupation,and shared the hobbies of running and wine drinking.
both tamkins stated that they received foreclosure notices on their home in the fall and winter of which were due to an error in the application of mortgage payments,and that they had marital problems in the fall of.they stated that they believed that our encounter with the writer was a typical real estate transaction.they were the parents of three young children.
plaintiffs also filed evidentiary objections to the goldfinger declaration and to defendants request for judicial notice.on november,the trial court overruled plaintiffs evidentiary objections to the goldfinger declaration and to defendants request for judicial notice.the court denied defendants motion on the basis that defendants acts and conduct were not protected by the statute.the trial court did not address plaintiffs probability of prevailing on their claims at trial.
discussion 
a slapp strategic lawsuit against public to chill or punish a party exercise of constitutional rights to free speech and to petition the government for redress of grievances.citation.the legislature enacted section as the provide a procedural remedy to dispose of lawsuits that are brought to chill the valid exercise of constitutional rights.citation.rusheen cohen cal th,rusheen.
to determine whether a lawsuit or cause of action should be disposed of as a slapp suit,section establishes a test.under the first part,the party bringing the motion has the initial burden of showing that the lawsuit,or a cause of action in the lawsuit,arises from an act in furtherance of the right of free speech or,that it arises from a protected activity.zamos stroud cal th.once the defendant has met its burden,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the lawsuit or on the cause of action.ibid.only a cause of action that satisfies both parts of the,that arises from protected speech or petitioning and lacks even minimal a slapp,subject to being stricken under the statute.navellier sletten cal th.on appeal from an order denying an motion,the reviewing court independently determines whether both parts of the statute are met.rusheen,supra,cal th at thomas quintero th.
whether defendants conduct arises from protected activities 
in their motion,appellants contended the acts that form the basis for plaintiffs causes of action fall under the purview of the statute as any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e.we agree.
a cause of action arises from protected activity within the meaning of section,subdivision e if defendants acts underlying the cause of action,and on which the cause of action is based,were acts in furtherance of defendants right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue.hall time warner,th.this court independently determines what acts form the basis for plaintiffs claims.w e focus on the specific nature of the challenged protected conduct,rather than generalities that might be abstracted from it.dyer,supra,th at.here,defendants acts on which the counts alleged in the complaint are based were the acts of using the tamkins names as placeholder names for a married real estate couple in the early writers drafts,sending one of the early writers drafts to breakdown services,approving casting synopses,approving the dissemination of the casting synopses to talent representatives,and broadcasting the episode after changing the last names of the real estate couple to tucker.
next,we determine whether defendants acts are in furtherance of their exercise of the right of free speech.an act is in furtherance of the right of free speech if the act helps to advance that right or assists in the exercise of that right.see lieberman kcop television,th,furtherance means helping to advance,assisting.citation.the creation of a television show is an exercise of free speech.see winter dc comics cal th,the first amendment to the united states constitution protects the creative elements of an artistic work.here,defendants acts helped to advance or assist in the creation,casting,and broadcasting of an episode of a popular television show.
finally,the acts must be in connection with a matter of public interest.section does not define public interest,but its preamble states that its provisions shall be construed broadly to safeguard the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances,subd.a.nygrd,th,nygrd.in nygrd,this court held that an issue of public interest is any issue in which the public is interested.in other words,the issue need not be significant to be protected by the is enough that it is one in which the public takes an interest.id.at.here,the creation and broadcasting of csi episode is an issue of public interest because the public was demonstrably interested in the creation and broadcasting of that episode,as shown by the posting of the casting synopses on various web sites and the ratings for the episode.
respondents contend,however,that defendants acts are not connected to an issue of public interest.they rely in particular on dyer,supra,th.there,the writer used the plaintiff real name for a character in a film.the writer admitted the film character was based upon the plaintiff,whom she had known in graduate school.id.at.the court concluded that the assertedly false portrayal of dyer persona in the film was not conduct in furtherance of defendants exercise of their constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the court determined that there is no discernable public interest in dyer persona.id.at.
we find dyer distinguishable.the dyer court did not address whether there was any public interest in the creative process underlying the production of the film.in contrast,defendants here asserted and showed that there was a public interest in the writing,casting and broadcasting of csi episode.defendants also demonstrated a connection between the use of plaintiffs names and the creative process underlying episode full names were used as placeholders for guest characters who would appear on the show.additionally,the dyer court focused on the lack of a discernable public interest in dyer persona.dyer,supra,th at.we believe the statutory language compels us to focus on the conduct of the defendants and to inquire whether that conduct furthered such defendants exercise of their free speech rights concerning a matter of public interest.we find no requirement in the statute that the plaintiff persona be a matter of public interest.
accordingly,we conclude that defendants conduct here arose from protected activities because defendants acts were in furtherance of the exercise of their right of free speech in connection with an issue of public interest.in making this determination,we reject plaintiffs argument that the ruling would effectively negate defamation and privacy actions with respect to popular entertainment defendants.here,for example,defendants demonstrated that their challenged conduct was in furtherance of the creative process of developing and broadcasting csi.moreover,defamation and privacy claims that satisfy the second part of the showing even minimal still proceed.navellier sletten,supra,cal th at.
we also disagree that defendants acts are not entitled to the protection of the statute because it was not necessary for goldfinger to use real names as placeholders for guest characters when she could have created fictional names to use as placeholders.as stated in a different context,t he creative process must be unfettered,especially because it can often take strange turns,as many bizarre and potentially offensive ideas are suggested,tried,and,in the end,either discarded or used we must not permit juries to dissect the creative process in order to determine what was necessary to achieve the final product and what was not,and to impose liability for that portion deemed unnecessary.creativity is,by its nature,creative.it is unpredictable.much that is not obvious can be necessary to the creative process.lyle warner brothers television productions cal th,conc.opn.of chin,addressing workplace sexual harassment claim see also guglielmi productions cal d,conc.opn.of bird,fn.omitted contemporary events,symbols and people are regularly used in fictional works.fiction writers may be able to more persuasively,or more accurately,express themselves by weaving into the tale persons or events familiar to their readers.the choice is theirs.no author should be forced into creating mythological worlds or characters wholly divorced from reality.
whether there is a probability that plaintiffs would prevail on their claims 
having determined that defendants met their burden of showing that their acts arose from protected activity,we next determine whether plaintiffs have met their burden of demonstrating a probability of prevailing on their causes of action.zamos stroud,supra,cal th at.in doing so,we consider the pleadings and the supporting and opposing affidavits filed by the parties on the motion.we do not weigh credibility or determine the weight of the evidence.rather,we accept as true the evidence favorable to the plaintiff and evaluate the defendant evidence only to determine if it has defeated that submitted by the plaintiff as a matter of law.flatley mauro cal th.
here,plaintiffs alleged a defamation cause of action.defamation constitutes an injury to reputation the injury may occur by means of libel or slander.in general,a written communication that is false,that is not protected by any privilege,and that exposes a person to contempt or ridicule or certain other reputational injuries,constitutes libel,rest d torts,subd.a false and unprivileged oral communication attributing to a person specific misdeeds or certain unfavorable characteristics or qualities,or uttering certain other derogatory statements regarding a person,constitutes slander,rest d torts,subd.shively bozanich cal th,italics omitted.
in order to prevail on a defamation claim,a plaintiff must show publication.in general,each time the defamatory statement is communicated to a third person who understands its defamatory meaning as applied to the plaintiff,the statement is said to have been published,although a written dissemination,as suggested by the common meaning of that term,is not required.shively bozanich,supra,cal th at.stated differently,i n defamation actions,the first amendment requires that the statement on which the claim is based must specifically refer to,or be of and concerning,the plaintiff in some way.blatty new york times cal d.in actions based on the identification of a fictional character with the actual plaintiff,t he test is whether a reasonable person would understand that the fictional character therein pictured was,in actual fact,the plaintiff acting as described.citation.bindrim mitchell d,bindrim.whether defamatory statements can reasonably be interpreted as referring to plaintiffs is a question of law for the court.alszeh home box office th.
here,the complaint alleged that the defamatory statements about plaintiffs were made in csi episode and in the casting synopses posted on various web sites.after reviewing the record,including viewing the broadcast of episode,we conclude that plaintiffs have not met their burden of demonstrating that a reasonable person would have understood that the fictional characters portrayed in episode and in the casting synopses referred to them.
plaintiffs asserted that the highlighted terms in the casting synopses below are defamatory and therefore,by definition,are false
