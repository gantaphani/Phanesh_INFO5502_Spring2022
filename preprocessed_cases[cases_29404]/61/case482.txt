joanne colt and douglas colt sued freedom communications,and freedom newspapers,for libel,invasion of privacy,interference with contractual relations,and interference with prospective economic advantage.the purported causes of action are based on articles published in the colorado springs gazette,a newspaper owned by the defendants,and on an affiliated website.we affirm an order striking the complaint under the strategic lawsuit against public participation statute.code civ,unless otherwise indicated,all further statutory references are to this code.we so hold because plaintiffs failed to establish that there is a probability that they will prevail on the claim,subd.b.
according to allegations in a complaint filed against him by the securities and exchange commission sec,douglas colt carried out an illegal scheme to manipulate the price of four stocks during a period in by using a free subscription internet website called.com.through this scheme,centered on recommending stocks,colt drove up the price for each stock by as much as.by trading in advance of the stock recommendations,colt generated more than in total profits for himself,and others.the complaint continues that b y engaging in the transactions,acts,practices and courses of business alleged herein douglas colt violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.
the sec complaint then spells out the details of the scheme and explains the involvement of others,including plaintiff joanne colt,a member of the colorado springs city council and douglas colt mother.according to that complaint,both plaintiffs profited from the deceptions.although the lengthy complaint only names douglas colt as a defendant,as noted,it also contains allegations concerning the conduct of joanne colt.
plaintiffs responded to the sec action by stipulating to the entry of a consent decree.the decree permanently enjoined them from the conduct complained of in the complaint and direct ed them to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation and any future violation of section b of the exchange act and rule thereunder.plaintiffs also consented to an order requiring them to disgorge their illicit profits but in their complaint here they allege that b ased on her demonstrated inability to pay,the commission waived payment of disgorgement the reference to her in this statement seems to indicate that the waiver only applied to joanne colt.but douglas colt states in his declaration that the sec waived his payment of disgorgement as well.plaintiffs emphasize that they stipulated to the consent decree without admitting or denying the allegations of the sec complaint.
plaintiffs complaint alleges that articles defendants published in the colorado springs gazette and on an associated internet message board libeled them by making false statements about their trading activities,the charges filed against them by the sec,and the effect of their consenting to the entry of the decree.plaintiffs also make much of their contention that,although they entered into the consent decree,they did so only because of financial and other pressures and either that they really did not commit the acts charged against them by the sec or that these acts were not,in fact,fraudulent.the record,which contains a detailed summary of the allegedly libelous statements and defendants analysis,demonstrates that there were factual discrepancies between the sec charges and defendants reports.
defendants summary of the evidence filed in support of their motion to strike runs almost pages,and we will not attempt to repeat all of it here.it is the thrust of defendants position that the articles accurately convey the gist or sting of the sec investigation and settlement,that such articles are absolutely privileged under the fair and true report privilege in civil code section,subd.d and the first amendment,plaintiffs are public figures who must prove actual malice to recover,several of the statements complained of do not damage plaintiffs reputations,some of the statements are jokes,not reasonably susceptible to defamatory meaning,and many of the statements are substantially true.
douglas colt declaration,filed in opposition to the motion,describes in considerable detail how he conducted his internet operations and asserts that he never published false information.he denies that the sec alleged that he or his mother engaged in deceptive trading,he or his mother made false statements,his mother made any statements at all,his mother had any involvement in the creation or maintenance of the website,any misstatements were made in connection with the stock transactions,the recommended stock was worthless,he or his mother ever misrepresented themselves as investment advisors,or he ever posted promotional statements.he also denies the truth of the sec charges.
as does the complaint,the declaration states that he only consented to the entry of the decree against him because of the enormous financial and personal costs already incurred during the course of a year long investigation,and with even greater costs certain to be associated with defending against the sec complaint he also articulates statements made by defendants which arguably misstated the allegations made by the sec and denies the truth of these statements.finally he contends that because of the sec issue and the publicity generated by the numerous articles,he was unable to accept employment with the firm of gibson,dunn crutcher,defendants lawyers.
the first of several lengthy exhibits to douglas colt declaration is a submission made on his behalf to the sec,before it filed its action,generally denying misdoing in connection with his website operation.another exhibit is a copy of the sec complaint.the remaining exhibits are copies of four web pages and two apparently generated by defendants reporter.
in the first of the web pages,the reporter chronicles the scheme also described in the sec complaint,without naming either plaintiff,but stating,inter alia,that the operator of the pump and web sites,has been caught by the sec.the reporter alleges that the scheme involved using false information about the company the second web page is identical except for a handwritten interlineation on one reading never held any shares opposite the statement and then dumped his shares.the third web page contains essentially the same information as the first two and,again,the only reference to plaintiffs is t he person who operated.com.the last web page attached to the declaration describes the substance of the conduct charged in the sec complaint,and again fails to name either of the plaintiffs.
the remaining exhibits to douglas colt declaration are two.the first contains a message from one johnny billson addressed to defendants reporter and asserting that had not provided any false information about the companies they profiled,and the reporter response indicating his agreement that plaintiff had not posted such information on the internet and that,when the reporter posted his message presumably on the internet he was in a rush and somehow it came out wrong.in the second,responding to a question posed to him by one john miller,the reporter again acknowledges that did post false information and again explains his mistake as resulting from being in a rush.
joanne colt furnished the court with a declaration in opposition to the motion.she too disclaims any wrongdoing although she acknowledges settling with the sec.to her declaration she attaches copies of a large number of newspaper articles on which she bases her libel claims.we mention further details of this evidence in our discussion below.

standard of review 
section,the statute,applies to causes of action arising from any act of the defendant in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,subd.b.plaintiffs do not dispute that the publishing of newspaper articles fits this definition,nor could they in light of the first amendment rights involved.
but the statute does not provide immunity.instead,it places the burden on a plaintiff
