factual and procedural background 
summary of hunter s complaint 
on march,plaintiff kyle hunter filed an employment discrimination complaint alleging that two local cbs television stations kcal and kcbs had repeatedly shunned him for numerous broadcasting positions due to his gender and his age.the complaint alleged that,in,kcbs chose not to renew the contract of its anchor johnny mountain,which was part of a plan to turn prime time weather broadcasting over to younger attractive females.
although hunter expressed interest in filling mountain vacancy,kcbs decided to hire jackie johnson,a young attractive female who had previously served as the weather anchor on kcal prime time newscast.after learning that johnson had been hired to replace mountain at kcbs,hunter notified kcal that he would like to be considered for johnson former anchor position.kcal,however,began quietly interviewing young,attractive females to replace johnson and told hunter there was not an opening for him now.
in may of,kcal posted a sham notice regarding its weather anchor position.at the time it posted the notice,kcal had already hired an attractive younger female named evelyn taft,whose age and gender were key considerations in the hiring decision.when hunter learned about taft hiring,he contacted the station manager and was told that he had not been considered for the position because kcal catered to male viewers and that hunter would be the type men would want to look at.
hunter complaint alleged that he was far more qualified,and far more experienced to serve as a weather anchor than either johnson or taft.the complaint further alleged that hunter had been forecasting and broadcasting the weather for over years,had won several prestigious awards and was certified by the american meteorological society ams.taft,on the other hand,had only two or three years of experience,was not certified by the ams and ha d not won any broadcast awards.
the complaint asserted two causes of action against cbs for violation of the california fair employment and housing act,et.feha.the first claim alleged that kcbs and kcal had adopted a policy of filling vacant prime time on air weather broadcast positions with attractive females,and of refusing to hire males to permanently fill those positions.the second claim alleged that kcbs and kcal had adopted a policy of filling vacant prime time on air weather broadcast positions with individuals under the age of,and of refusing to hire individuals over to permanently fill those positions.the complaint asserted that cbs gender and age based polic ies,and its resulting employment decisions,violated the prohibition against gender and age discrimination contained in government code section.
cbs motion to strike the complaint pursuant to code of civil procedure section 
summary of cbs motion to strike and supporting evidence 
on may,cbs filed a motion to strike hunter complaint pursuant to code of civil procedure section cbs contended that hunter claims were based on its selection of weather reporters and that such conduct qualified as protected activity within the meaning of section,subdivision e.it further contended that hunter could not make a prima facie showing that he had not been hired to fill the kcbs or kcal weather anchor vacancies as a result of his gender or age.
in support of its motion,cbs submitted a declaration from scott diener,who was the vice president and news director of kcbs and kcal.diener declaration stated that the duopoly of kcbs and kcal collectively the duopoly the nation largest local television news operation.according to diener,the number one reason why people watch ed the local news was to obtain information about the weather.as a result,the duopoly weather anchors were local celebrities who had a significant effect on newscast ratings.
diener,whose duties included recruiting and hiring staff members,explained that selecting news personnel,and the weather anchor in particular,was one of the most critical decisions in putting together a news team.the anchor must not only be knowledgeable and reliable with respect to the weather forecasts,but also must be a personality whom people want to invite into their home on a daily basis.the weather anchor has to inspire confidence and trust while being likeable and inviting to the public.
diener stated that when making a hiring decision for an position,he normally reviewed the individual resume and demo reel.if diener believed the individual was sufficiently talented,he would then interview them and have them audition,which would include a mock weather segment.diener asserted that the three primary qualifications he considered when evaluating an weather position were meteorology background and experience on air presence and chemistry with other members of the news team.
diener explained that,shortly after he became the duopoly news director in january of,he received an email from hunter stating that he would like to be considered for any available weather anchor positions even work.diener reviewed hunter demo reel and did not believe he had the talent,skill or presence to be an on air weather broadcaster in the los angeles market.diener also felt that hunter presentation was not polished and that his persona was hokey and over the top.over the next two months,hunter continued to send diener numerous emails with requests for employment,brochures,links to his demo reels and invitations to lunch and dinner.
diener also explained why the duopoly had selected johnson and taft to serve as its two prime time weather anchors.according to diener,he had chosen johnson to fill johnny mountain vacated position at kcbs based on her six years of experience as the prime time weather anchor at kcal.after promoting johnson to kcbs,the duopoly began searching for a candidate to fill johnson vacancy at kcal.diener received dozens of submissions for the opening,which he narrowed to eight candidates consisting of five men and three women.hunter was not considered.the two finalists were evelyn taft,a female under the age of,and jim castillo,a male over the age of.taft had a degree in broadcast journalism from the university of southern california and had previously worked as a weather anchor in santa maria and salinas,california.between and,taft had served as a weather anchor in san francisco,which was then the sixth largest news market in the country.taft and castillo both auditioned for the position,but diener chose to hire taft.
shortly after he hired taft,diener internally promoted josh rubinstein to serve as the weather anchor on kcbs morning show and hired richard fields to serve as a weekend and weather anchor.following taft hire,the duopoly had five weather anchors on staff three males over the age of and two females under the age of.diener specifically denied that he had considered the gender or age of johnson,taft,hunter or any other candidate in making his hiring decisions.
summary of hunter opposition to the motion to strike and supporting evidence 
in his opposition,hunter argued that the court should deny cbs motion to strike because the gravamen of his claims was discrimination rather than free speech.hunter contended that section was only intended to dispose of lawsuits brought to chill the valid exercise of constitutional rights and that d iscrimination in employment is not a valid exercise of free speech.he further contended that cbs was essentially argu ing that it,along with every other producer of programming,enjoys complete immunity from feha liability based on the first amendment.according to hunter,however,n o california case ha d ever held that the choice of who to employ as a weather broadcaster is so sacred that it enjoys first amendment immunity from laws.
hunter also argued that even if section applied to his claims,he had demonstrated a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits at trial.in support,hunter cited evidence that the duopoly only two prime time weather anchors johnson and taft were both females who were under the age of taft and johnson were both cut from the same blond,attractive,buxom mold,evidencing cbs s intent to use gender and youth as criteria cbs did not post job opening notices about their kcbs or kcal weather anchor positions and hunter was told that cbs wanted to hire a female for the kcal prime time weather anchor position.hunter also asserted that he had provided evidence demonstrating that he and two other male candidates were as or better qualified than either johnson or taft.
in support of his opposition,hunter provided a declaration asserting that he had been involved in weather broadcasting in one form or another since.hunter declaration contained a detailed work history that included,among other things,numerous weather newscast production positions and several weather anchor positions.the declaration also described hunter education and listed various awards and certifications he had received in the past.according to hunter,he was generally by his and in his profession.
hunter declaration also discussed his efforts to obtain a prime time weather anchor position at kcbs and kcal.hunter asserted that he initially contacted cbs after learning that johnny mountain contract would not be renewed at kcbs.hunter told cbs he would like to be interviewed for the position and provided a resume and broadcast samples.when hunter learned cbs had hired johnson to replace mountain,he contacted scott diener about obtaining an interview to fill johnson former position.
hunter stated that,while taking a tour of cbs in april of,he saw his friend josh rubinstein,who was part of the duopoly weather news team.rubinstein told hunter that cbs was looking for a woman to fill the kcal weather anchor position.shortly after this conversation,hunter learned that cbs was interviewing young,female candidates for the kcal weather anchor job.hunter decided to send an email to steven maudlin,the president and general manager of regarding his interest in a position at cbs.maudlin,however,informed hunter that cbs did not currently have an opening for him.
hunter declaration also stated that he had reviewed the qualifications of several other male candidates who had applied for the kcal weather anchor position,including jim castillo,josh rubinstein and kai goldberg.hunter contended that,based on his knowledge and experience,he knew that each of the three men were qualified to be a weather broadcaster for kcbs and kcal.
trial court proceedings 
at the motion hearing,cbs argued that section applied to hunter claims because the acts or conduct at issue consisted of cbs decision s as to who to select to represent itself in an on air broadcast which is an act in furtherance of free speech.cbs also argued that the mere fact hunter had alleged it acted with a discriminatory motive in making that decision does not change what the underlying act is and it does take it outside of the protection of section.
hunter,however,argued that the act underlying his claims was cbs adoption of a hiring policy that impose d a ban on the hiring of males from the most select positions.hunter asserted that cbs had failed to identify a single case that says producers of television products are immune from feha liability or that hiring in this context is somehow protected first amendment activity.according to hunter,his discrimination action was a run of the mill employee case that precede d the creative process.to rule otherwise is to rule that there is a complete immunity to feha.
following the hearing,the trial court issued an order denying cbs motion to strike on the grounds that cbs has not shown that its hiring decisions regarding weather anchors constitute conduct in furtherance of cbs right of free speech in connection with a public issue.cbs filed a timely appeal of the court order.see,subd.i an order granting or denying a special motion to strike shall be appealable under section,subd a.

section,commonly referred to as the statute club members for an honest election sierra club cal th,sierra club is intended to provide for the early dismissal of unmeritorious claims filed to interfere with the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances.id.at.the section authorizes the filing of a special motion that requires a court to strike claims brought against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states constitution or the california constitution in connection with a public issue unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim,subd.b.

b.the trial court erred in c oncluding that hunter claims d o n ot arise from a protected activity 
under the process applicable to motions,we must first determine whether cbs made a threshold showing that hunter claims arise from a protected activity.the trial court concluded that cbs failed to make such a showing,and denied the motion on that basis.
in assessing whether a cause of action arises from protected activity,we disregard the labeling of the claim citation and instead examine the principal thrust or gravamen of a plaintiff cause of action we assess the principal thrust by identifying t he allegedly wrongful and conduct that provides the foundation for the claim.citation.if the core conduct upon which the plaintiff claim is premised does not rest on protected speech or petitioning activity,collateral or incidental allusions to protected activity will not trigger application of the statute.citation.citation.tuszynska,supra,th at.t he critical point is whether the plaintiff cause of action itself was based on an act in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech.city of cotati cashman cal th.
when evaluating whether the defendant has carried its burden under the first prong of the statute,courts must be careful to distinguish allegations of conduct on which liability is to be based from allegations of motives for such conduct.c auses of action do not arise from motives they arise from acts.citation.people ex rel.fire ins.exchange anapol th,anapol.the court reviews the parties pleadings,declarations and other supporting documents to determine what conduct is actually being challenged,not to determine whether the conduct is actionable.citation.ibid.
section,subdivision e sets forth four categories of protected activity.cbs contends that the conduct underlying hunter claims fall within section,subdivision e,which defines protected activity to include any conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.a cause of action arises from protected activity within the meaning of section,subdivision e if the plaintiff claims are predicated on conduct that is in furtherance of the right of free speech,and in connection with a public issue or issue of public interest.
hunter claims are predicated on the selection of a news anchor,which qualifies as conduct in furtherance of the exercise of free speech rights 
the allegations in hunter complaint make clear that the conduct underlying his employment discrimination claims consists of cbs decisions about whom to hire as the weather anchors for its kcbs and kcal prime time newscasts.the complaint repeatedly asserts that cbs chose to hire young attractive women to serve as weathercasters cbs shunned hunter for numerous weather broadcasting positions due to his gender and his age and these employment decisions violated feha.indeed,all of the allegations underlying hunter discrimination claims relate to the allegedly unlawful manner in which cbs selected its weather anchors.cbs contends that this conduct the selection of a weather anchor qualifies as an act in furtherance of the exercise of free speech.we agree.
an act is in furtherance of the right of free speech if the act helps to advance that right or assists in the exercise of that right.tamkin cbs broadcasting,th,tamkin.our courts have previously recognized that r eporting the news lieberman kcop television,th,kcop and creat ing.a television show both qualify as exercise s of free speech.tamkin,supra,th at kcop,supra,th at.cbs selections of its kcbs and kcal weather anchors,which were essentially casting decisions regarding who was to report the news on a local television newscast,helped advance or assist both forms of first amendment expression.the conduct therefore qualifies as a form of protected activity.see tamkin,supra,th at writer use of plaintiffs names in a draft script of a television show qualified as protected activity because it helped to advance or assist in the creation,casting,and broadcasting of an episode of a popular television show kcop,supra,th at allegedly unlawful newsgathering technique was in furtherance of first amendment speech rights because it aided in the reporting of news doe gangland productions,gangland california courts have held that or acts such as investigating,newsgathering,and conducting interviews constitute conduct that furthers the right of free speech.
hunter,however,asserts that there are several reasons why the trial court correctly concluded that section does not apply to his claims.first,he contends that the conduct underlying his causes of action is not cbs selection of its weather anchors,but rather cbs decision to utilize discriminatory criteria in making those selections.this argument,however,confuses the conduct underlying hunter claim cbs employment decisions with the purportedly unlawful motive underlying that conduct employment discrimination.the california supreme court has clarified that when assessing whether claims arise from protected activity,courts must distinguish between the acts underlying a plaintiff causes of action and the claimed illegitimacy of those acts,which is an issue the plaintiff must raise and support in the context of the discharge of the plaintiff secondary burden to provide a prima facie showing of the merits of the plaintiff case.citation.navellier sletten cal th,navellier.
tuszynska,supra,th,which also involved a gender discrimination claim,is illustrative.the defendants in tuszynska administered a prepaid legal plan that was created by an employee organization to fund and provide legal representation and assistance to the organization members in civil,criminal,and administrative matters.id.at.the defendants selected counsel for members in need of legal representation from a panel of attorneys.plaintiff,who was the only female on the panel,filed a discrimination complaint alleging that plan administrators had refused to assign her cases on the basis of her gender.the defendants filed a motion to strike the complaint arguing that plaintiff claim was predicated on their attorney selection decisions,which qualified as an act in furtherance of protected petitioning activity.in opposition,the plaintiff argued that her allegations of gender discrimination were not based on the defendants attorney selections,but were instead based on defendants purportedly distinctive conduct in failing to assign cases to her because she is a woman.ibid.the trial court agreed,reasoning that the gravamen of plaintiff claims was that because she is a woman,she is not getting cases.ibid.
the appellate court reversed,concluding that the trial court had improperly conflate d defendants alleged conduct their failure to assign new cases to plaintiff with the unlawful,discriminatory motive plaintiff was ascribing to defendants conduct that plaintiff was not receiving new assignments or continued funding because she was a woman.tuszynska,supra,th at.the court explained that section applies to claims based on or arising from statements or writings made in connection with protected speech or petitioning activities,regardless of any motive the defendant may have had in undertaking its activities,or the motive the plaintiff may be ascribing to the defendant activities.id.at.the court further explained that,in the case before it,the plaintiff was suing defendants for gender discrimination because she claims they did not assign case work to her because she is a woman.her gender discrimination claims are thus based squarely on defendants attorney selection decisions.whether defendants had a discriminatory motive in not assigning new cases to plaintiff is entirely separate and distinct from whether,under the statute,plaintiff gender discrimination claims are based on defendants selection decisions.courts must be careful not to conflate such separate and distinct questions.id.at.
this case can not be meaningfully distinguished from tuszynska.hunter employment discrimination claims assert that cbs did not hire him to serve as a weather anchor because of his age and gender.as in tuszynska,his claims are thus based squarely on cbs decisions regarding its choice of a weather anchor,which were acts in furtherance of its first amendment rights.whether cbs had a gender or discriminatory motive in not selecting hunter to serve as a weather anchor is an entirely separate inquiry from whether,under section,hunter discrimination claims are based on cbs employment decisions.
hunter,however,argues that two other decisions,department of fair employment housing alta loma road apartments th alta loma and martin inland empire utilities agency th martin,have held that claims predicated on acts of discrimination are generally not subject to the statute.in alta loma,supra,th,a landlord was attempting to remove a unit apartment building from the rental market.as required under local rent control regulations,the landlord notified the tenants they had days to vacate the premises.in response,plaintiff,a tenant in the building,informed the landlord she was disabled and therefore legally entitled to a notice period.although the plaintiff provided various forms of evidence to substantiate her condition,the landlord did not believe she had established any disability.shortly after the day notice period expired,the landlord initiated an unlawful detainer action.plaintiff,in turn,filed a discrimination complaint alleging the landlord had refused to accommodate her disability.the landlord filed a motion to strike the complaint pursuant to section asserting that plaintiff claim was predicated on the filing of an unlawful detainer action.the trial court denied the motion,concluding that the unlawful detainer action was inciden
