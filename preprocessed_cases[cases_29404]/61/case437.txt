the county of monterey in two separate proceedings sought to involuntarily commit petitioner christopher sorenson,pursuant to the lanterman petris short act welf,et seq lps act or act these lps conservatorship proceedings resulted in two jury trials,occurring in june and november,to determine whether sorenson was gravely disabled due to mental illness within the meaning of the lps act.sorenson was not involuntarily conserved.
sorenson was subsequently charged with the murder of his mother,her death occurring just eight days after the conclusion of the second lps trial.the monterey county district attorney,on behalf of the people,made an informal request to the court reporter for copies of the reporter transcripts of the two lps jury trials as an aid to the prosecution of the charged crime.additionally,a local newspaper,the salinas californian the californian,requested that the court clerk give it access to the entire files from those two lps proceedings.the presiding judge of the superior court denied both requests in separate minute orders,reasoning that the court files were confidential under the act.the people then filed a formal motion for an order granting access to copies of the reporter transcripts of the two lps jury trials.one week later,a second local newspaper,the monterey county herald the herald,filed a motion requesting that the court grant it access to the court files of eight lps proceedings involving sorenson.the herald motion was later joined by the californian after briefing and a hearing,a different superior court judge assigned by the presiding judge to hear all matters pertaining to sorenson,including the pending requests by the people and the media granted the people,the media,and sorenson access to the reporter transcripts of the two lps jury trials.sorenson challenges that order by this petition for writ of mandate.
very significant,competing interests are claimed by the parties.sorenson claims that the release of the trial transcripts would violate section,which he claims makes lps trials presumptively nonpublic,his right to confidentiality under section of the act,his constitutional right to privacy,and his confidentiality rights under the privilege.the people and the media claim a first amendment right of public access to the lps trial transcripts,because such a constitutional right exists for all ordinary civil trials and proceedings.nbc subsidiary knbc tv,superior court cal th,d,nbc subsidiary.they also claim a statutory right of access under code of civil procedure section,which provides that,absent express statutory exceptions,the sittings of every court shall be public they contend that section is not such a statutory exception.
we conclude that the court erred in granting the people and the media access to the transcripts from sorenson two lps jury trials.in so holding,we conclude that involuntary conservatorship proceedings under the lps act are not ordinary civil trials and proceedings nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d,that are presumptively public.rather,they are special proceedings.but they are not special proceedings for which there is a qualified first amendment right of public access.there is not such a tradition of openness or utility associated with having the proceedings public to support a finding of a constitutional right of access.furthermore,section makes lps jury trials presumptively nonpublic,thereby constituting a statutory exception to code of civil procedure section general requirement that such sittings be public.we hold that the superior court erred in concluding that,notwithstanding that lps jury trials are presumptively nonpublic,the parties by their conduct were deemed to have requested under section that the hearings be public.we will therefore grant the petition for writ of mandate.
factual and procedural background 
the people are prosecuting sorenson for murder in monterey superior court case number on december,a reporter from the californian made a written request by letter to the respondent superior court to view make copies of the case files in two lps proceedings involving sorenson case numbers and.the reporter indicated that the request was made because there may be information in those documents that is the public right to know.at or about the same time,the people,through the monterey county district attorney office,made an informal request to the court reporter for copies of the jury trial transcripts in those two proceedings the court presiding judge timothy roberts denied the two requests by separate orders dated january,observing that lps conservatorship hearings and their associated court files were deemed confidential.
on february,the people filed a pleading captioned request for reconsideration of order denying request for transcripts of jury trial.capitalization omitted.in that motion,the people requested that the court allow them to inspect the records of sorenson lps conservatorship trials,and to obtain the trial transcripts at their cost.one week later,the herald filed a motion labeled petition to examine the files of eight lps proceedings involving sorenson the two proceedings identified in the californian prior letter request case numbers and,along with six other identified cases.a declaration and memorandum of points and authorities were attached to the herald motion.
on march,a different superior court judge judge mark hood set a hearing on the people and the herald motions,identifying five legal issues for consideration according to judge hood subsequent order,presiding judge roberts had specially assigned these matters for review of issues pertaining to requests to access any information contained in the lps cases and for reconsideration of any of his prior rulings.further briefs were submitted on behalf of the people,the herald and sorenson.the herald indicated in its brief that it was seeking an order unsealing the transcripts of sorenson two lps jury trials,unsealing all of the records of eight enumerated mental health proceedings involving sorenson,and correcting the systematic and automatic sealing of all records relating to lps act proceedings.
after hearing argument and taking the matter under submission,the court entered an order on may,granting the people,the media,and sorenson access to copies of the reporter transcripts of the jury trials conducted in two lps proceedings involving sorenson case numbers and.in so ruling,the court held that hearings under the lps act are nonpublic unless either party requests a public hearing neither party requested a public hearing in either of the lps trials in controversy the record indicated that the trials proceeded as public hearings without objection by either party and therefore the parties by their conduct were deemed to have requested that the hearings be public under section.the court also denied the media request for access to all files and records associated with sorenson lps act proceedings,concluding that the files and information were confidential and not discoverable under section.the court issued a day temporary stay of its order.
on may,sorenson filed a petition for writ of mandate or prohibition and a request for temporary stay with this court.on the same date,we granted a temporary stay of respondent court order and invited real parties in interest to submit preliminary opposition to the petition.after receiving the people preliminary opposition and sorenson reply,we issued an order directing respondent court to show cause why a peremptory writ of mandate should not issue as requested in the petition.the people filed a return to the petition and sorenson filed a formal reply.
discussion 
request for dismissal and mootness 
on april,after briefing was concluded,sorenson filed,by letter,a request that the court dismiss his petition.the language of the letter was uninformative,and vaguely referenced exhibits attached to the people prior motion to dismiss which dismissal motion this court denied without prejudice but the apparent basis for sorenson request was that he had entered a change of plea in february and pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity,and thereafter had signed a document indicating that he conditionally waive d any privacy rights to the transcripts of the lps trials,as well as privacy rights to any reports generated by doctors who may have evaluated him in connection with the two lps trials.sorenson acknowledged in this conditional waiver that he understood that the parties who received the reports and transcripts would be subject to a court protective order preventing disclosure of the materials to others.
we denied sorenson request for dismissal because this case presents issues of continuing public interest,including the scope of the first amendment right of public access to judicial proceedings,and whether lps proceedings,including trials,are made presumptively nonpublic by statute.see lundquist reusser cal th,fn,d,court may decline dismissal of moot case where the appeal raises issues of continuing public importance morehart county of santa barbara cal th,d,court,regardless of mootness,may decide case involving matter s of continuing public interest likely to recur.additionally,while the developments alluded to in sorenson dismissal request may meet the needs of the people and sorenson insofar as the trial court order granting them access to the lps jury trial transcripts is concerned,it does not render the controversy moot.were we to permit dismissal of the petition,the herald and the californian would also be entitled to receive copies of the two lps jury trial transcripts by virtue of the challenged order,an order we will conclude to have been erroneous we have therefore exercised our discretion to deny sorenson request for dismissal and will decide the controversy raised by the petition.see castro superior court th,d court,despite parties settlement of case after briefing and argument,may elect to decide merits of controversy involving matter of continuing public interest.
ii.propriety of may,order in light of court prior orders 
during oral argument,we raised a procedural question concerning the propriety of the may,order of judge hood,given the fact that presiding judge roberts,approximately four months earlier,had issued two orders seemingly addressing the same or similar issues concerning access to the transcripts of sorenson lps trials.specifically,we asked counsel whether judge hood had the authority to grant the people,the media,and sorenson access to the transcripts in light of presiding judge roberts prior orders denying the californian and the people requests for access to two of sorenson lps files and the reporter transcripts,respectively.this court requested supplemental briefing,which it subsequently received from sorenson,the people,and the herald.upon consideration of the issue,we conclude that judge hood had the authority to issue the may,order,and we may therefore consider the merits of sorenson petition.
at the time the herald filed its formal motion in february,the court had not acted on the herald request for access to sealed lps files pertaining to sorenson the orders of presiding judge roberts pertained to the people informal request to a court reporter,and the californian letter request to the clerk.the herald formal,motion contained a declaration and a memorandum explaining in detail its legal position,including a citation to nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th,d.further,the relief sought by the herald in its motion and in supplemental memoranda was significantly broader than that requested previously by either the californian or the people the herald requested the unsealing of eight lps files involving sorenson,an unsealing of the transcripts of sorenson two lps jury trials,and an administrative order correcting the systematic and automatic sealing of all records relating to lps act proceedings.the herald motion thus stood in stark contrast to the californian prior,letter request to the clerk seeking to inspect or copy two of sorenson lps files because they might contain information that is the public right to know.because the herald motion involved a request for access to court files and an order unsealing all lps files made by an entity not involved in any prior proceedings that prompted the issuance of presiding judge roberts prior orders,those orders did not act as an impediment to judge hood subsequent action on the herald motion.
with respect to the court internal reassignment of the motions to judge hood,we are mindful of the limitations involved in one judge,by subsequent order,nullifying a prior ruling by another judge of the same superior court.see in re alberto th,d.but the rationale behind the general rule limiting the power of the former judge under those circumstances discouraging forum shopping by the parties,and preventing the judge from becoming a appellate court id.at,d do not pertain to this case.the orders denying access to the people and the californian made by presiding judge roberts were not the result of a motion process involving submission of formal requests to the court upon noticed motions supported by appropriate points and authorities and declarations.see code civ,application for an order is a motion,motion upon all grounds stated in the written notice thereof is deemed to have been made and to be pending before the court for all purposes,upon the due service and filing of the notice of motion,but this shall not deprive a party of a hearing of the motion to which he is otherwise entitled.rather,the orders were prompted by the people informal perhaps oral request to the court reporter,and the californian letter to the court clerk.since neither the people nor the californian had submitted a prior application that resulted in the initial january orders of presiding judge roberts and the herald had made no access request at all judge hood,after reassignment to him of the motions requesting access,was not precluded from ruling on those motions 
presiding judge roberts reassignment of these matters to judge hood,who was presiding over the criminal proceedings pending against sorenson,was also authorized by statute and court rule.under government code section,subdivision a,the presiding judge shall distribute the business of the court among the judges,and prescribe the order of business.assignments of the business of the court among judges of the court is wholly discretionary.anderson phillips cal d.rule of the california rules of court delineates the authority vested in the presiding judge with respect to judicial assignments,providing that the presiding judge has ultimate authority to make judicial assignments.cal.rules of court,rule c.rule b a and b authorizes the presiding judge to a ssign judges to departments,designate supervising judges for divisions,and a pportion the business of the court,including assigning and reassigning cases to departments.rule c d directs the presiding judge to r eassign cases between departments as convenience or necessity requires.rule d permits the presiding judge to delegate any of the duties listed in the rule to another judge.alvarez superior court th,d.
moreover,judge hood was empowered to decide the applications for access because they involved claimed public access rights under the first amendment.as noted by the court in in re marriage of nicholas th,d cited by both the people and the herald,since orders to seal court records implicate the public right of access under the first amendment,they inherently are subject to ongoing judicial scrutiny,including at the trial court level.in marriage of nicholas,the court rejected the appellant jurisdictional challenge to a sealing order the eighth in a succession of orders based upon its having been entered by a different judge from the one who issued the prior sealing order of which the appellant was the proponent.id.at,d.the court came to this conclusion based upon,inter alia,the principle and the fact that rule h of the california rules of court expressly authorizes the court to unseal its records upon the request of any person,whether a party to the litigation or not marriage of nicholas,at,d.
the reassignment of the motions to judge hood was a proper exercise of the presiding judge discretion.judge hood was therefore authorized to entertain the people and the herald motions for access to sorenson lps files.accordingly,we reject sorenson claim that judge hood did not possess the legal authority to issue a superceding sic order overruling judge roberts s original order.
iii.contentions of the parties 
sorenson acknowledges that under our high court decision in nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th,d,and code of civil procedure section,court records are presumptively open to the public.but he argues that,the presumption of openness notwithstanding,lps proceedings are nonpublic.he contends that lps proceedings are unique and are especially designed to help encourage mental health treatment,protect the public,safeguard the rights of mental health patients,and encourage persons with mental health problems to seek treatment on a voluntary basis.citations.he asserts that section creates a presumption that lps proceedings are nonpublic,insofar as that statute provides that any party to them may demand that a hearing be public.and he argues that the court erred when it found,based upon inadmissible hearsay,that the parties were deemed to have requested that the hearings be public under section.
the people respond that,although the trial court reasoning may have been incorrect,it reached the correct result in permitting access to the lps trial transcripts.they along with the herald argue that,pursuant to both the first amendment nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d,and statute code of civ,there is a public right of access to lps jury trials.and they assert that there is no statutory language creating a presumption that lps proceedings are nonpublic.they contend,in essence,that had the legislature wished to make lps jury trials confidential,it could have easily done so.instead,the language of section,giving a proposed conservatee the right to demand a jury,says nothing about confidentiality.and they contend that section can not be read as requiring that lps jury trials be nonpublic.therefore,they argue,the trial court correctly granted their request for copies of the trial transcripts.
iv.the lps act 
the legislature enacted the lps act in.see stats,ch.included among the goals of the act are ending the inappropriate and indefinite commitment of the mentally ill,providing prompt evaluation and treatment of persons with serious mental disorders,guaranteeing and protecting public safety,safeguarding the rights of the involuntarily committed through judicial review,and providing individualized treatment,supervision and placement services for the gravely disabled by means of a conservatorship program.the act limits involuntary commitment to successive periods of increasingly longer duration,beginning with a hour detention for evaluation and treatment,which may be extended by certification for days of intensive treatment.that initial period may be extended for an additional days if the person detained is suicidal.in those counties that have elected to do so,the day certification may be extended for an additional day period for further intensive treatment.persons found to be imminently dangerous may be involuntarily committed for up to days beyond the day period.after the initial hour detention,the day and day commitments each require a certification hearing before an appointed hearing officer to determine probable cause for confinement unless the detainee has filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus.a day commitment requires a superior court order.conservatorship of susan cal th,d.
the lps act governs the involuntary detention,evaluation,and treatment of persons who,as a result of mental disorder,are dangerous or gravely disabled.et the act authorizes the superior court to appoint a conservator of the person for one who is determined to be gravely disabled et,so that he or she may receive individualized treatment,supervision,and placement.as defined by the act,a person is gravely disabled if,as a result of a mental disorder,the person is unable to provide for his or her basic personal needs for food,clothing,or shelter,subd.h a.conservatorship of john cal th,d.under the act,a conservator of a gravely disabled person may be appointed for up to one year,subject to a petition to reestablish the conservatorship for additional periods before the expiration of each term.because an involuntary civil commitment constitutes a deprivation of liberty and places a stigma upon the conservatee reputation,due process under the california constitution requires that a finding of grave disability in an lps jury trial must be unanimous and based upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt.conservatorship of roulet cal d,see also conservatorship of ben cal th,d,b ecause of the important liberty interests at stake,correspondingly powerful safeguards protect against erroneous findings.

vi.legal analysis 
the united states supreme court has held in a number of cases that there is a first amendment right of public access to criminal proceedings.based on these cases,our high court has held that this right also applies to ordinary civil trials and proceedings.nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d.as our high court has explained,this constitutional right is a qualified one in the sense that the proceedings are presumptively open and in order for them to be ordered closed,the court must give advance notice of the potential closure and must conduct a hearing and must make express findings supporting the closure order the sealing of court records.id.at,d.
following our discussion of nbc subsidiary,we will consider whether a trial under the lps act is an ordinary civil proceeding that is presumptively open.id.at,fn,d.after concluding that it is not,we will analyze whether an lps trial is a special proceeding to which the first amendment right of access nonetheless applies.finding that there is no such constitutional right,we will then examine whether section of the lps act provides a specific exception to the general statutory requirement in code of civil procedure section that all court proceedings be open to the public we will conclude that under section,all lps proceedings are presumptively nonpublic.lastly,we will review the trial court conclusion that,notwithstanding the nonpublic nature of lps trials generally,the parties in this instance had effectively demanded that the lps jury trials at issue in this case be public,thereby warranting an order releasing the trial transcripts to the people and the media.we will find that the trial court erred in so concluding.
qualified first amendment right of access to judicial proceedings 
in nbc subsidiary,our high court addressed the propriety of a closure order in a civil jury trial involving hollywood celebrities clint eastwood and sandra locke.nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d.the trial court,on its own motion,ordered the closure of all proceedings occurring outside the presence of the jury.id.at,d.the nbc subsidiary court determined first that code of civil procedure section,a statute that had not been raised by the parties,had apparent relevance to the question.nbc subsidiary,at,d.that statute reads except as provided in section of the family code or any other provision of law,the sittings of every court shall be public.code civ.proc.the court observed that in interpreting the statute,it was required to consider not only its language and history,but also the relevant constitutional principles,relating to public access to court proceedings nbc subsidiary,at,d.in concluding that the trial court erred in closing those proceedings,the high court conducted an exhaustive review of united states supreme court decisions that culminated in five public access cases decided between and.id.at,d.
our high court observed that,beginning with richmond newspapers,virginia,d richmond newspapers,the supreme court had affirmed that a presumption of openness inheres in the very nature of a criminal trial under our system of justice.citation.nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d,quoting richmond newspapers,at.chief justice burger,in the lead opinion,observed that open trials enhance the performance and accuracy of trial proceedings,educate the public,and serve a therapeutic value to the community citation and this,considered together with historical tradition,leads to the conclusion that the right to attend criminal trials is implicit in the guarantees of the first amendment.nbc subsidiary,at,d,citing richmond newspapers,at.as our high court explained,the richmond newspapers court consequently reversed an order closing a criminal trial,where the trial court had failed to make any findings supporting it and had not considered alternatives less drastic than closure.instead,the supreme court concluded that a bsent an overriding interest articulated in findings,the trial of a criminal case must be open to the public.citation.nbc subsidiary,at,d,quoting richmond newspapers,at.
in press enterprise superior court of cal,d press enterprise i,the supreme court considered challenges to the closure of nearly six weeks of voir dire of prospective jurors,and to a subsequent order denying press access to the voir dire transcripts.as the nbc subsidiary court explained,chief justice burger majority opinion,invalidating the trial court order as violative of the first amendment,emphasized both i the historic tradition of open jury selection in england and colonial america citation,and ii the various utilitarian policies advanced by open jury selection.citation.nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d,citing press enterprise i,at.the supreme court articulated that t he presumption of openness may be overcome only by an overriding interest based on findings that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.nbc subsidiary,at,d,quoting press enterprise i,at.the supreme court invalidated the closure order because it was not accompanied by specific findings indicating the closure necessity,and the court had failed to consider any alternatives to closure of the voir dire proceedings and the transcripts sealing.nbc subsidiary,at,d,citing press enterprise i,at.
two years later,in press enterprise superior court,d press enterprise ii,the supreme court considered a constitutional challenge to a closure order involving a day preliminary hearing.under penal code section authorizing exclusion of the public for the protection of a defendant right to a fair trial,the court closed the hearing and thereafter sealed the hearing transcripts.our high court summarized the supreme court decision as follows chief justice burger opinion for the court first addressed the two complementary considerations of i history,whether there is a tradition of accessibility concerning preliminary hearings,and ii utility,whether public access plays a significant positive role in the functioning of preliminary hearings.citation.t he court found a near uniform practice of open preliminary hearings in this country from the century to the present.citation.turning to the utility question,the court found that access to preliminary hearings plays a particularly significant positive role in the actual functioning of the process citation,because the preliminary hearing is often the final and most important step in the criminal proceeding and in many cases provides the sole occasion for public observation of the criminal justice system,and because closure frustrates the community therapeutic value of openness.citation.the supreme court concluded that preliminary hearings are sufficiently like a trial so as to justify the same treatment under the first amendment.citation.nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d,citing and quoting press enterprise ii,at.
our high court conceded that the supreme court cases it reviewed had involved criminal proceedings.nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d,see also copley press,superior court cal th,d,all of the supreme court cases detailed in nbc subsidiary arose in the criminal context,and the supreme c ourt has not expressly extended its first amendment jurisprudence in those cases to any other context.but it noted the reasoning found in those cases suggest ed that the first amendment right of access extends beyond the context of criminal proceedings and encompasses civil proceedings as well.citations.nbc subsidiary,at,d.in addition,the high court noted dicta from two supreme court opinions suggesting that the right of access applied to civil cases.id.at,d,citing richmond newspapers,supra,at,fn.lead opn.of burger,historically both civil and criminal trials have been presumptively open and gannett,depasquale,fn,d t here is no principled basis upon which a public right of access to judicial proceedings can be limited to criminal cases indeed,many of the advantages of public criminal trials are equally applicable in the civil trial context thus,in some civil cases the public interest in access,and the salutary effect of publicity,may be as strong as,or stronger than,in most criminal cases.after citing four federal and two state appellate decisions supporting such an extension nbc subsidiary,at,d,and observing that there were no cases holding or even suggesting that the right did not apply,as a general matter,to ordinary civil proceedings id.at,d,the high court upheld the media constitutional challenge.we conclude,in light of supreme court case law and its progeny,that,in general,the first amendment provides a right of access to ordinary civil trials and proceedings,that constitutional standards governing closure of trial proceedings apply in the civil setting,and that code of civil procedure section must,accordingly,be interpreted in a manner compatible with those standards.id.at,d,see also fuller doe th,d.
therefore,our high court held,it is clear today that substantive courtroom proceedings in ordinary civil cases are presumptively open and that code of civil procedure section must be interpreted to preclude closure of proceedings that satisfy the high court historical considerations unless two things occur.first,a trial court must provide notice to the public of the contemplated closure second,before substantive courtroom proceedings are closed or transcripts are ordered sealed,a trial court must hold a hearing and expressly find that i there exists an overriding interest supporting closure sealing ii there is a substantial probability that the interest will be prejudiced absent closure sealing iii the proposed closure sealing is narrowly tailored to serve the overriding interest and iv there is no less restrictive means of achieving the overriding interest.nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d,fns.omitted.
in holding that the first amendment qualified right of public access applied to ordinary civil trials and proceedings nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d,the court emphasized that its decision was a limited one we address herein the right of access to ordinary civil proceedings in general,and not any right of access to particular proceedings governed by specific statutes.id.at,d,fn.
constitutional right of access to lps jury trials 
seven years after deciding nbc subsidiary,our high court reiterated that a lthough we so extended th e supreme court right of access jurisprudence in nbc subsidiary,we expressly limited the extension to ordinary civil proceedings in general,and stressed that we were not addressing any right of access to particular proceedings governed by specific statutes.citation.copley press,superior court,supra,cal th at,d,quoting nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,fn,d,original italics.therefore,our constitutional analysis begins with a determination of whether court proceedings under the lps act,including jury trials,are ordinary civil proceedings to which the first amendment right of public access applies.nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,fn,d.we will answer this question in the negative.
because our high court in nbc subsidiary expressly declined to address whether a constitutional right of access applies to particular proceedings governed by specific statutes nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,fn,d,which we find to include lps proceedings we will determine if the particular proceedings here are ones that are required to be public.in doing so,we will apply the inquiry adopted in nbc subsidiary,asking whether lps trials satisfy the historical considerations that would warrant a presumptive right of public access.nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d,see in re marriage of burkle th,holding presumptive right of access applies to divorce proceedings based upon historical considerations san bernardino county of public social services superior court d.public access to juvenile dependency proceedings may serve positive function,but because there is no tradition of access,first amendment right of access does not apply san bernardino county dpss.
lps jury trial is not an ordinary civil proceeding 
our high court did not define ordinary in the context of its application of the right of access to ordinary civil proceedings.nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,fn,d.but it appears that a trial to determine whether a person is gravely disabled and thus warrants the person commitment under the lps act is a special proceeding that is a creature of statute,rather than an ordinary civil proceeding.in conservatorship of martha th,d,the court considered whether a public conservator may dismiss or withdraw a petition for the reestablishment of an lps act conservatorship under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,under which an action may be dismissed with or without prejudice at the plaintiff request before the actual commencement of trial.the court noted that action,pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,is defined as any civil action or special proceeding.conservatorship of martha,at,d.it concluded that the dismissal provisions of code of civil procedure section,subdivision b applied,because an involuntary commitment or recommitment proceeding under the lps act is a special proceeding citation.conservatorship of martha,at,d see also bagration superior court th,fn,d lps act conservatorship proceedings for gravely disabled persons are special proceedings.
in people yartz cal th,d,yartz,our high court addressed whether a prior plea of nolo contendere to a child molestation offense could be used to find the defendant to be a sexually violent predator svp under section et,the sexually violent predators act svpa.the resolution of this issue turned on whether as defendant claimed,an svp proceeding was a civil suit for purposes of penal code section,former subdivision,which read in part the legal effect of a nolo contendere plea shall be the same as that of a plea of guilty,but the plea and any admission required by the court during any inquiry it makes as to the voluntariness of and factual basis for the plea may not be used against the defendant as a admission in any civil suit based upon or growing out of the act upon which the criminal prosecution is based.citation.yartz,at,d,original italics.the high court reviewed the nature of svp proceedings generally,and observed that t he svpa is not punitive in purpose and effect.id.at,d.it noted that s ince,judicial remedies have been divided into two classes actions and special proceedings.code civ.an action is defined under code of civil procedure section as an ordinary proceeding in a court of justice by which one party prosecutes another for the declaration,enforcement,or protection of a right,the redress or prevention of a wrong,or the punishment of a public offense.citations.a special proceeding under code of civil procedure section is e very other remedy that is not an action.citations.id.at,d.our high court,in rejecting the defendant argument that penal code section,former subdivision,barred the use of his nolo contendere plea in the svp proceeding because it constituted a civil suit,concluded that an svpa commitment proceeding is a special proceeding of a civil nature,because it is neither an action at law nor a suit in equity,but instead is a civil commitment proceeding commenced by petition independently of a pending action.citation.yartz,at,d.
under yartz,supra,cal th at page,d,although the statutory criteria for civil commitment obviously differ significantly as between the svpa and the lps act there can be no meaningful distinction between the two proceedings in terms of their classification because neither is a proceeding with the purpose or effect of imposing punishment on the individual yartz,at,d,conservatorship of ben,supra,cal th at,d,lps commitment may not reasonably be deemed punishment either in its design or purpose and both are special proceeding s of a civil nature and are civil commitment proceeding s commenced by petition independently of a pending action.citation.yartz,at,d,see also conservatorship of martha,supra,th at.
we therefore conclude that a jury trial under the lps act is not an ordinary civil proceeding as to which a qualified first amendment public right of access applies.
history and utility does not suggest right of access 
nbc subsidiary was concerned with public access to an ordinary civil trial,not the kind of special proceedings here a jury trial to determine whether a person should be involuntarily committed as gravely disabled under the lps act.in re marriage of burkle,supra,th at,d nbc subsidiary simply did not address whether divorce proceedings are among the ordinary civil proceedings that are presumptively open.consistently with the high court approach which in turn was founded upon the supreme court reasoning in cases such as richmond newspapers,supra.and press enterprise ii,supra.we will examine the historical considerations of lps jury trials to determine whether,as special proceedings,they are presumptively open.nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d.
historical tradition 
there is little helpful data concerning whether lps trials have a tradition of openness.the people concede this point whether a n lps jury trial has historically been open is unclear.there appears to be no reported case on this subject.we likewise have found no reported cases addressing the issue.additionally,our examination of the local superior court rules of numerous counties of the state has not been illuminative

there are elements of the statutory scheme that suggest the absence of a tradition of openness in lps proceedings.for example,section provides that n otwithstanding any other provisions of this section,any party to the proceeding may demand that the hearing be public,and be held in a place suitable for attendance by the public.this language suggests that,as a general rule,lps conservatorship proceedings are nonpublic in nature.therefore,regardless of whether this provision,as sorenson argues,applies to lps conservatorship jury trials see discussion at pt,post,it is some evidence that conservatorship proceedings are not presumptively open.in addition,certain provisions of the lps act safeguard the privacy rights of the proposed conservatee and provide for the confidentiality of records generated in his or her treatment.most notably,section provides in part that a ll information and records obtained in the course of providing services under division commencing with section to either voluntary or involuntary recipients of services shall be confidential.see also providing for damages action for willful violation of confidentiality provisions of lps act see also cal.judges benchguides,benchguide lps proceedings cjer,unauthorized disclosure of information made confidential under may result in substantial civil penalties.further,the lps act specifies a nonexclusive list of rights including a right to dignity,privacy,and humane care,subd.b in re qawi cal th,d,quoting riese,supra,d at.and a evaluation under the lps act is to be carried out with the utmost consideration for the privacy and dignity of the proposed lps conservatee.
these statutes militate against finding a tradition of openness of lps court proceedings,to the extent they may be construed to require that hearings be nonpublic,absent a demand that the hearing be public require that the privacy rights of proposed conservatees be given the utmost respect and preserve the confidentiality of medical and other records relating to proposed conservatees care and treatment.absent a contrary showing,therefore,we conclude that the first element of historical tradition does not favor a right of access.
utility considerations 
the element of utility relevant to determining a right of public access to conservatorship proceedings and court records is likewise difficult to evaluate.as a general matter,the supreme court has identified the utility of open trials in the criminal context as consisting of the factors of the enhance ment of the performance and accuracy of trial proceedings educat ion of the public,perform ing a therapeutic value to the community nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d,citing richmond newspapers,supra,at.lead opn.provid ing a means by which citizens scrutinize and check the use and possible abuse of judicial power citation and,related to the first attribute,serv ing to enhance the function of the proceeding citation.nbc subsidiary,at,d,citing richmond newspapers,at.brennan,conc.opn.
the first and fifth beneficial factors enhancing the conduct,accuracy,and function of trials nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d,are not as significant in lps proceedings as in criminal and ordinary civil proceedings.lps proceedings generally concern private issues relating to the proposed conservatee mental health.see people dixon th,d because involuntary civil commitment proceedings are aimed at determining the status of a person mental health,they involve primarily personal and confidential matters.while there are undoubtedly instances in which there will be contested lay or expert testimony in connection with proceedings to determine,inter alia,whether the proposed conservatee is gravely disabled,many lps proceedings do not have the character of criminal or civil trials in which public scrutiny will significantly enhance the process.san bernardino county dpss,supra,d at.open juvenile proceedings may be beneficial in discouraging perjury and encouraging witnesses to come forward.
the second factor educat ion of the public nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d,undoubtedly applies to lps proceedings.access to lps conservatorship proceedings would be beneficial,to the extent that it would inform members of the public of ongoing mental health issues in their communities.but too much can be made of this factor because education of the public is a mantra that may be readily invoked in support of access to any court proceeding.as justice brennan observed b ecause the stretch of this protection of a first amendment right of access is theoretically endless citation,it must be invoked with discrimination and temperance.for so far as the participating citizen need for information is concerned,t here are few restrictions on action which could not be clothed by ingenious argument in the garb of decreased data flow.citation.richmond newspapers,supra,at.brennan,conc.opn.
the third factor perform ing a therapeutic value to the community nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d,offers little support for the position that there should be public access to lps conservatorship proceedings.as described by the supreme court,the therapeutic function of public proceedings is relevant where societal reaction,including outrage,exists in response to the commission of crimes this openness has what is sometimes described as a community therapeutic value.criminal acts,especially violent crimes,often provoke public concern,even outrage and hostility this in turn generates a community urge to retaliate and desire to have justice done when the public is aware that the law is being enforced and the criminal justice system is functioning,an outlet is provided for these understandable reactions and emotions.proceedings held in secret would deny this outlet and frustrate the broad public interest by contrast,public proceedings vindicate the concerns of the victims and the community in knowing that offenders are being brought to account for their criminal conduct by jurors fairly and openly selected.press enterprise i,supra,at.while one of the goals of lps conservatorship proceedings is the protection of the public,subd.c conservatorship of john,supra,cal th at,d,the therapeutic value that public proceedings present to ensure that persons committing criminal acts are brought to justice has no application to proceedings determining whether a person is gravely disabled.
the fourth factor provid ing a means by which citizens scrutinize and check the use and possible abuse of judicial power nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d,applies to lps conservatorship proceedings.san bernardino county dpss,supra,d at.access to juvenile dependency proceedings may also serve to check judicial abuse.but this factor as is true with the public education factor has seemingly limitless application to any judicial proceeding.furthermore,to the extent that section permits any party to the proceeding to demand that the hearing be public,it serves as a form of escape valve,permitting a party to allow the public to check the use and abuse of judicial power nbc subsidiary,at,d,by requiring open proceedings.therefore,we find that the fact that access to lps proceedings may serve as a theoretical check with respect to the use and possible abuse of judicial power ibid,of itself,is insufficient to support a conclusion that there is a constitutional right to public access of special proceedings such as lps conservatorships.
in sum,the utility of open lps conservatorship proceedings is far less than the utility of having criminal proceedings or ordinary civil proceedings open to the public.this finding,coupled with the absence of a showing of a historical tradition of public access,leads us to conclude that there is no constitutional right of public access to lps proceedings,including trials.in re marriage of burkle,supra,th at pp,d first amendment right of access applies to divorce proceedings,where benefits of open civil trials generally applied to divorce proceedings and there was no showing they were traditionally closed.
applicability of code of civil procedure section 
our conclusion that public access to lps conservatorship proceedings is not constitutionally mandated does not end our inquiry.we must determine whether there is a statutory exception to code of civil procedure section california statute nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d,which would negate its requirement that lps proceedings be open to the public.under code of civil procedure section,court proceedings shall be public,e xcept as provided in section of the family code or any other provision of law.sorenson argues that section is such a statutory exception.he contends that it creates a presumption that lps proceedings are nonpublic,because it provides that any party to them may demand that a hearing which he contends includes a trial be public.the people respond that section based upon its language and legislative history may not be construed as providing for nonpublic lps trials,and therefore such trials are public under code of civil procedure section.
a resolution of this controversy requires that we employ the customary rules of statutory interpretation.we begin by examining the words of the statute if the statutory language is not ambiguous,then we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.citations.people montes cal th,d,quoting people walker cal th,d.when there are statutory ambiguities,we may examin e the context in which the language appears and adopt the construction which best serves to harmonize the statute internally and with related statutes.hsu abbara cal th,d.when the language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation,we look to a variety of extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,contemporaneous administrative construction,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.citations.citation.granberry islay investments cal th,d.using these extrinsic aids,we select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.people sinohui cal th,d.
following this approach,first,we scrutinize the actual words of the statute section,giving them a plain and commonsense meaning.citations.citation.garcia mccutchen cal th,d.if we find this step inconclusive,we then look to the legislative history of section.if we are unable to resolve the controversy from doing so,we examine other provisions of the lps act in an effort to harmonize them with the language of section in construing the statute.moyer workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d,moyer t he various parts of a statutory enactment must be harmonized by considering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.after considering section in the overall context of the lps act,and taking into consideration additional rights of patient privacy,we will conclude that lps proceedings,including jury trials,are presumptively nonpublic under section.
the language of section 
the relevant portion of section reads notwithstanding any other provisions of this section,any party to the proceeding may demand that the hearing be public,and be held in a place suitable for attendance by the public.the term the hearing in the previously quoted sentence refers to any hearing under the lps act.this is true for at least two reasons.first,the initial language of section refers to conducting hearings under this part,and part of division of the welfare and institutions code embraces the lps act in its entirety.second,the last paragraph of the statute expresses its as used in this section,a hearing under this part includes conservatorship and other hearings held pursuant to chapter commencing with section of this part.
the more difficult question is whether the hearing,in the context of any party to the proceeding may demand that the hearing be public,includes lps court trials and jury trials.one view,as argued by the people,is that the term the hearing,as used in section,can not be construed as including a formal trial.they claim that the phrase jury trial appears nowhere in section,and that its absence is telling.the people assert that had the legislature intended to make lps jury trials presumptively nonpublic,it could have readily done so by using the precise term.they argue further that section is inapplicable to jury trials because a hearing is a proceeding different from,and often containing less formality than,a trial 
the people rely on conservatorship of joseph th,d joseph in arguing that lps jury trials are not presumptively nonpublic under section.there,after the conservatee made a request for a hearing on a petition to reestablish lps conservatorship id.at,d,the court conducted a bench trial and reestablished the conservatorship the conservatee then demanded a jury trial pursuant to section,subdivision d.joseph,at,d.the court denied the request,concluding the conservatee had previously requested and received a court trial.id.at,d.
the appellate court in joseph held that the trial court erred in interpreting the conservatee initial request for a hearing as a request for a court trial.in so concluding,the court interpreted two code sections section,subdivision b,under which the court may dispose of a petition to reestablish conservatorship on its own motion,s ubject to a request for a court hearing or jury trial and section,subdivision d,under which a patient may demand a court or jury trial on the question of grave disability in connection with petitions to establish or reestablish an lps conservatorship,and may make such demand either within five days following the hearing on the conservatorship petition,or before the date of the hearing.joseph,supra,th at,d.it held that,the terms hearing in section,subdivision d,and court hearing in section,subdivision b,have the same meaning.in the context of those statutes,hearing and court hearing have the meaning of a proceeding short of a trial.id.at,d.the court therefore held that a conservatee may first request a hearing on a reestablishment petition and subsequently may demand a court or jury trial on the issue of whether he or she is gravely disabled under the lps act.alternatively,a conservatee may object to a reestablishment petition and demand a court or jury trial,without first requesting an initial hearing on the petition,and thereby waive his or her right to that hearing.ibid.
joseph,supra,th,d does not cause us to conclude that the plain meaning of the hearing in section is one that excludes lps jury trials.the court there was construing the somewhat ambiguous phrase in section,subdivision b,s ubject to a request for a court hearing or jury trial,in determining whether court hearing was synonymous with court trial in the context of the lps act proceedings,both informal and formal,on petitions for reestablishment of conservatorships.here,we interpret a different statute,section,and are concerned with whether the hearing that any party may demand be public includes lps court trials and jury trials.this is an entirely different issue from the one presented in joseph see kinsman unocal cal th,d,cases are not authority for propositions not considered.and as the court in joseph acknowledged,the meanings of the terms trial and hearing can vary depending on the particular context in which they are used and can,in certain circumstances,overlap.citations.joseph,at,d.
on the other hand,there is nothing on the face of section itself that suggests that the term the hearing includes jury trials.we are mindful that our task in seek ing the meaning of a statute is not simply to look up dictionary definitions and then stitch together the results.rather,it is to discern the sense of the statute,and therefore its words,in the legal and broader culture.hodges superior court cal th,d.since the language of section does not permit us to determine whether jury trials are nonpublic,we will look to extrinsic sources,including legislative history and the context of the lps act in which section is found,in an effort to resolve the question.
legislative history of section 
the people argue that the legislative history of section does not support the view that lps jury trials are presumptively nonpublic.rather,they contend,section adopted two years after section,under which the proposed conservatee is afforded the right to a jury trial makes no mention of jury trials and was added to allow for a superior court to hold hearings under the lps act at any place suitable to the mental and physical condition of the patient.they argue that because there is nothing in the legislative history indicating that the statute would apply to jury trials,section should not be so construed.
the legislative history materials submitted to the court below do not assist us in determining whether the legislature intended the language in section that any party to the proceeding may demand that the hearing be public to include jury trials while the materials contain no specific reference to jury trials and disclose that the legislation may have been enacted,in part,to allow for lps hearings to be conducted outside of a courtroom at a location suitable to the patient,they do not convince us that the term the hearing in the passage of section was intended to exclude jury trials.see garcia county of sacramento th,d the significance to be accorded extrinsic evidence of legislative intention depends upon its capacity to resolve ambiguities in statutory language.we conclude that the legislative history of section is not dispositive.
section in the context of the lps act 
as we have concluded,the issue of whether section should be construed as making lps jury trials presumptively nonpublic is not readily resolvable from the language of the statute itself or from its legislative history.we will therefore examine other relevant sections of the lps act to address the issue.see moyer,supra,cal d at.in placing section in the context of the lps act moyer,at,we specifically consider other sections that refer to hearings or trials,and other statutes that address confidentiality concerns.
lps act hearings and trials 
there are several types of hearings specified under the lps act.some are in the nature of administrative hearings before nonjudicial officers.for example,the act provides for a certification review hearing to be held within four days after a person is certified for intensive treatment for up to days under section,or is recertified for additional treatment of up to days under section.this hearing is held by a hearing officer with qualifications specified under section it is an informal hearing in which rules of evidence and procedure are inapplicable,subd.b.and if judicial review has been requested by requesting release through a writ of habeas corpus as provided in sections and,the court shall conduct an evidentiary hearing.
there are a variety of other hearings specifically described under the lps act.they include hearings to determine whether medication should be administered involuntarily based upon a detained person incapacity to refuse treatment to extend a temporary conservatorship beyond days,subd.b concerning objections to a conservator proposed transfer to a different facility of a conservatee who is a criminal defendant found incompetent to stand trial,subd.d to contest proposed court orders sought by a conservator requiring the conservatee to receive medical treatment to contest rights denied a conservatee under section to contest powers granted to a conservator under section arising from petitions for the appointment of a temporary conservator on habeas corpus petitions by the conservatee challenging the placement or the conditions of his or her confinement on a conservator petition to reestablish the conservatorship for an additional year and on the conservatee continued status as a conservatee,pursuant to his or her request.while many of these hearings are judicial proceedings to which the label trial seems inapplicable,other proceedings in which the person is granted the right to a jury to decide the controversy may comfortably be labeled either as hearings or trials.see,proceedings on petitions for postcertification treatment,subd.c proceedings,at conservatee request,for court or jury trial on grave disability question proceedings on petition to reestablish conservatorship,at conservatee request,before court or jury to determine whether grave disability still exists see also joseph,supra,th at,d conservatee,under,subd.b,may demand court trial or jury trial on grave disability question for reestablishment petition.
two specific provisions of the lps act convince us that a proper interpretation of the term the hearing under section is one that includes a court or jury trial.under section,the court must conduct the proceedings on a postcertification petition for further treatment of a person deemed to be imminently dangerous to others within four days of its filing,and the proceedings are to be conducted in accordance with constitutional guarantees of due process of law and procedures required under section of article i of the constitution of the state of california.but i f at the time of the hearing the person requests a jury trial,such trial shall commence within judicial days of the filing of the petition.thus,the postcertification proceeding is one that is heard by the court in a bench trial,or,if the person requests it,by a jury in a jury trial.there is no functional distinction between the two proceedings the terms hearing and trial in section both mean a trial.
secondly,under subdivision a of section concerning petitions to reestablish conservatorships,the clerk is required to given written notice at least days before termination of an lps conservatorship.the notice required in subdivision a of section includes the following language subject to a request for a court hearing by jury trial the judge may,on his or her motion,accept or reject the conservator petition.if the conservator petitions to reestablish conservatorship there shall be a court hearing or a jury trial,whichever is requested,on the issue of whether the conservatee is still gravely disabled and in need of a conservatorship.italics added.this language in section,subdivision a initially equates the term court hearing with jury trial,and later equates a court hearing to a bench trial.
the various contexts under which the lps act calls for a hearing,and the act interchangeable use of the words hearing and trial,lead us to conclude that the presumptive nonpublic hearing language in section was intended to apply to court trials and jury trials,as well as to other hearings under the act.
lps act confidentiality 
as we will discuss,construing section as making all lps proceedings whether they are labeled hearings or trials presumptively nonpublic is also consistent with the confidentiality of patient records as mandated under the lps act itself.it also comports with the broader context of a patient constitutional right of privacy,and the protections afforded to patients under the privilege.
as noted see pt,ante,section requires that a ll information and records obtained in the course of providing services under the lps act among other statutes be kept confidential.see also screening report prepared in connection with petition for evaluation of person believed to be gravely disabled and submitted to court confidential and subject to provisions of.while section contains specified exceptions,including disclosure t o the courts,as necessary to the administration of justice,subd.f,the statute is to be strictly construed in permitting release of information only under limited circumstances to limited government agencies.people gardner d.see also county of riverside superior court d.one of the legislative purposes in providing for confidentiality was undoubtedly to encourage persons with mental or alcoholic problems to seek treatment on a voluntary basis.the safeguarding of the privacy rights of the proposed conservatee is also emphasized elsewhere in the lps act.see,subd.b.
sorenson argued below that lps trial transcripts are confidential pursuant to section.it is unclear whether he continues to assert that position here the people respond that the confidentiality provisions of section can not be construed as applying to court transcripts because they are not information and records obtained in the course of providing services.in support of this position,they cite an opinion of the attorney general.see ops.cal.atty.we agree with the people on this narrow point.the court transcripts from lps conservatorship trials can not reasonably be construed as constituting records obtained in the course of providing services.but this begs the issue.that attorney general opinion only concerned whether the language of section renders court records nonpublic.it did not address whether conservatorship trials and the records derived from them are presumptively nonpublic under section nor could it have addressed that statute,since the opinion predated the enactment of section.the fact that section makes confidential the information and records generated from services provided to the proposed lps conservatee is relevant here because it gives context for our interpretation of the language in section.
the people also argue that the term the hearing in section should be read narrowly because in addition to the fact that the precise words jury trials were not used in the statute there is no other language in the lps act expressly making lps trials nonpublic.they correctly point out that section,subdivision d,under which the proposed conservatee is afforded the right to a jury trial,makes no mention of the fact that trials are to be closed to the public and the people correctly note that there are other statutes outside the lps act in which the legislature has more clearly provided for closed proceedings.see,subd.a paternity hearings or trials may be held in closed court,subd.b limited access to paternity court files,adoption hearings closed to public,subd.a the public shall not be admitted to a juvenile court hearing absent minor request access to juvenile case files limited to specified parties.but crediting these arguments,we nonetheless believe that section,when harmonized with other sections of the act,requires a broader reading that promotes the privacy of the proposed lps conservatee and the confidentiality of his or her records.
psychotherapist patient privilege 
in addition to the confidentiality language of section,we consider the privilege,which sorenson asserted below.that privilege which is an aspect of the patient constitutional right to privacy under article i,section of the california constitution people stritzinger cal d,stritzinger is codified under evidence code section.it affords the patient,whether or not a party,the privilege to refuse to disclose,and to prevent another from disclosing,a confidential communication between patient and psychotherapist ibid.at the time evidence code section was enacted approximately two years before the lps act,it was observed psychoanalysis and psychotherapy are dependent upon the fullest revelation of the most intimate and embarrassing details of the patient life unless a patient is assured that such information can and will be held in utmost confidence,he will be reluctant to make the full disclosure upon which diagnosis and treatment depends.citation.people wharton cal d,quoting judiciary com,west ann.ed.therefore,because an environment of confidentiality of treatment is vitally important to the successful operation of psychotherapy in re lifschutz cal d,see also jaffee redmond,d,the privilege has been broadly construed in favor of the patient.stritzinger,at,see also in re lifschutz,at,fn,the legislature acknowledged that the unique nature of psychotherapeutic treatment required and justified a greater degree of confidentiality than was legally afforded other medical treatment story superior court th,d public policy dictates that privilege be construed broadly in favor of patient and exceptions to privilege be construed narrowly.
it is true that the confidentiality provisions of section operate independently of the privilege.simons,california evidence manual privileges,see also people pack d,disapproved on another ground in people hammon cal th,d.indeed,section may afford broader protection than the privilege.for example,the mere fact of the patient entry into a facility for treatment may be subject to the confidentiality provisions of section,but it may not be protected under evidence code section.see in re d.likewise,communications between the patient and a nonclinician employee of a hospital that are found in a medical record may be confidential under section but may not be subject to the privilege.nonetheless,the privilege which is broadly construed in favor of the patient stritzinger,supra,cal d at,is consistent with the legislature establishment of broad confidentiality provisions under section for lps medical and other files generated in providing services to the proposed conservatee.
conclusion lps trials are presumptively nonpublic 
the outcome of an lps trial to determine whether a proposed conservatee is gravely disabled turns on the opinions rendered by expert witnesses,clinicians who have treated the person,forensic mental health experts,or both.see cal.conservatorship practice,supra,conservatorships for the gravely disabled under the lps act.this testimony is based in large part upon patient records and communications with the patient these are matters subject to the confidentiality provisions of section,and they may also be protected from disclosure by the privilege of evidence code section it would be anomalous and contrary to the express intent of the legislature to protect the dignity and privacy of the patient,subd.b to enforce the confidentiality provisions of section outside of the courtroom,but to ignore such confidentiality and forfeit the patient privilege and privacy rights once the matter proceeds to trial.
likewise,it would be incompatible with the protections afforded to the patient under section and evidence code section to construe section to require that only certain lps hearings be presumptively nonpublic,while allowing public access to confidential and sensitive patient information presented as evidence at lps trials.reading section in this fashion would effectively penalize the proposed conservatee for demanding a jury trial under subdivision d of section.we will not impose such an interpretation here that would lead to absurd consequences.people sinohui,supra,cal th at,d,see also cory board of administration th,d rejecting interpretation of statute that would yield bizarre results.
furthermore,permitting lps trials to be presumptively public thereby making public any confidential communications between the proposed conservatee and his or her psychiatrists or psychologists would be antithetical to one of the legislative purposes of confidentiality under the lps act.that purpose is to encourage persons with mental or alcohol problems to seek treatment on a voluntary basis.county of riverside superior court,supra,d at.in re lifschutz,supra,cal d at,in construing exception to privilege,we are necessarily mindful of the justifiable expectations of confidentiality that most individuals seeking psychotherapeutic treatment harbor.
g rave disability proceedings carry special threats to reputation.a finding of grave disability is equivalent to a finding that a person is unable to feed,clothe or house himself or herself because of a mental disorder,subd.h.conservatorship of roulet,supra,cal d at.those who are confined to mental institutions are stigmatized as sick and abnormal during confinement,and in some cases,even after release.conservatorship of susan,supra,cal th at,d,mosk,conc.dis.see also conservatorship of roulet,at,consequences of civil commitment include the stigma of mental illness that could be a socially debilitating as that of a criminal conviction.a conclusion that lps trials are presumptively public proceedings would cause proposed involuntary conservatees to suffer the embarrassment and stigma of public scrutiny to their alleged mental difficulties and to their personal psychiatric records.in re,supra,d at.one of purposes of is to avoid embarrassment resulting from undesired publicity through disclosure of lps treatment records.we therefore read section,in context with section and other provisions of the lps act and in a manner consistent with the patient privacy right and right to assert confidentiality under the psychotherapist patient privilege as providing that all lps proceedings,including court trials,jury trials and other hearings under the act,are presumptively nonpublic.see people dixon,supra,th at,d concluding,as dictum,that language of section suggests that the proceedings are private unless the parties request otherwise.
whether the parties,in effect,demanded public lps trials 
although the trial court concluded,as do we,that lps trials are presumptively nonpublic under section,it held that in this instance,the parties were deemed to have requested that the hearings be public.sorenson contends this was error.although the people argue that the court properly allowed access to the lps trial transcripts,they concede that the court decision was wrong in its rationale.we conclude that the court erred in finding that the parties were deemed to have requested public hearings.
the people evidence that was the basis of the court conclusion that the parties were deemed to have requested public trials consisted of the declaration of the bailiff,deputy sheriff sonia angelo,and the declaration of assistant district attorney steven somers.deputy angelo declared that she was the bailiff for the two lps jury trials the courtroom was unlocked and open to the public for both trials t he public did come and go freely during both jury trials and to her knowledge,no one objected to the courtroom remaining open.somers declaration consisted of a recitation of the substance of statements he received from annette cutino,deputy county counsel,to the effect that the courtroom was unlocked during both jury trials lps hearings for years had been held in open court and that parties to lps hearings had always operated as though the hearings were required to be public.somers also declared that he had spoken to superior court judge sam lavorato,who had said that he always operated upon the belief that the lps hearings were required to be held publicly.
the court below acknowledged from its review of the minutes that neither party expressly requested a public hearing in the two trial cases.it relied,however,upon the two aforementioned declarations in concluding that the parties had effectively requested public trials.in addition,it noted that at the conclusion of the trials,the trial judge lifted his admonition and permitted the jurors to discuss the case s and deliberations without limitation and the court record does not disclose that either party objected to such admonitions.
the somers declaration consists of inadmissible hearsay see,subd.b kulshrestha first union commercial cal th,d,to which sorenson objected.indeed,the people admit that this evidence was improper hearsay.although the court did not rule on the objection,we infer from its reliance upon the somers declaration that it implicitly overruled the objection.the court erred in admitting this declaration and considering it as evidence in support of its ruling.therefore,the only evidence properly considered on the issue of whether the parties effectively requested public lps trials consisted of the statements in the angelo declaration and the trial judge admonitions to the jury in both lps trials to which there were apparently no objections.
section calls for nonpublic lps proceedings unless a party makes a demand that they be public.in this context,this suggests the party affirmative assertion of a legal right,rather than passive inaction.see westrec marina management,arrowood indem.th,d demand defined as a request for something under an assertion of right or an insistence on some course of action black law dict.ed,t he assertion of a legal or procedural right.furthermore,given the nature of the evidence at lps trials which includes testimony of clinicians and other psychiatrists and psychologists that undoubtedly involves patient communications a determination that the proposed conservatee has been deemed through silence to have demanded a public trial is also a ruling that he or she has impliedly waived the privilege under evidence code section.as we have noted,this privilege is construed broadly in favor of the patient and any exceptions are construed narrowly.story superior court,supra,th at,d.and,as our high court stated in the context of a claimed waiver of the privilege,t he waiver of an important right must be a voluntary and knowing act done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.roberts superior court cal d,see also san diego trolley,superior court th,d.
under these circumstances,the undisputed admissible evidence namely,the bailiff statement that the courtrooms were not closed and the trial judge having released the jurors from the admonitions does not support the finding that the parties had effectively demanded that the lps trials be public the court therefore erred in authorizing real parties in interest to have access to the transcripts of those trials in contravention of section 
disposition 
respondent superior court erred in its order permitting real parties in interest the people,the herald,and the californian access to copies of the reporter transcripts of the jury trials conducted in two lps proceedings involving petitioner sorenson monterey county superior court case numbers and.accordingly,let a peremptory writ of mandate issue commanding respondent superior court to vacate its order and enter a new order denying the people,the herald,and the californian motion for access to these transcripts.upon finality of this opinion,the temporary stay issued by this court is vacated.
all statutory references are to the welfare and institutions code unless otherwise specified.
hereafter,the californian and the herald are collectively referred to as the media.
the information is not attached to the petition details concerning the criminal prosecution are unknown to this court.the record,however,indicates that on february,the superior court found sorenson incompetent to stand trial.by subsequent correspondence from the people,we have been advised that criminal proceedings were reinstated in september.after a preliminary hearing in october,the court bound sorenson over for trial on the one count alleged in the information.sorenson then entered a not guilty plea,but the court again suspended criminal proceedings in january.the court reinstated criminal proceedings on february.on february,sorenson entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity.
the record before us does not include the people informal request.we therefore are unaware of its contents,or even whether it was in writing or merely an oral request.
the five issues the court identified were whether lps proceedings are ordinary civil proceedings as contemplated by code of civil procedure section whether the contents and transcripts of c onservatorship matters are confidential whether the passage of section had an effect on the confidentiality provisions under section whether there was a demand for a public trial by either party at the two conservatorship trials and whether the suspension of criminal proceedings pursuant to penal code section et sequitur affect s the people request.
the initial motion to unseal records was filed only on behalf of the herald,as was the first brief following the court order of march.but in a supplemental brief,counsel for the herald indicated that relief was being sought on behalf of the californian as well.
real parties in interest the herald and the californian did not file informal oppositions or returns to the petition.after briefing was concluded,in april,the herald,in its opposition to the people motion to dismiss discussed,post,requested leave to be deemed to have joined in the people return to the petition or,alternatively,to have its opposition to the dismissal motion treated as its return to the petition.the herald contended that because the people r eturn expressly asserted the public right of access and hence preserved that issue for appeal,because t he herald resources are limited,and because t he herald had no reason to believe that the people would not continue to assert the public right of access,t he herald did not previously file a return or join in the people return.given that the petition raises issues of continuing public interest and the people,in fact,argued that the court transcripts are records accessible by the public,we will deem the herald opposition to the motion to dismiss as a return to the petition.
on april,the people had also filed a motion to dismiss the petition,asserting that the matter has been rendered moot by virtue of sorenson subsequent entry of a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity in the criminal proceeding.on april,this court denied the motion to dismiss without prejudice.
the complete text of sorenson letter reads in light of the exhibits attached to real party monterey county district attorney office motion to dismiss,petitioner respectfully requests to withdraw his writ of petition.
we note in passing that,ironically,the high court in the case discussed at great length herein,nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th,d,was also faced with a mootness question due to the fact that the trial proceedings being reviewed had terminated as a result of the parties having settled the dispute during jury deliberations.id.at,d,fn.the high court determined that it should resolve the controversy,notwithstanding its mootness,because of its presentation of an important question affecting the public interest that is capable of repetition,yet evading review.citation.ibid.
in addition,were the petition dismissed,there would remain a potential conflict between the challenged order,under which the people have been determined to be entitled to unfettered access to,and use of,the lps trial transcripts,and any order that may be entered in reliance upon sorenson recent conditional waiver,under which the people may be granted such access subject to a court protective order preventing disclosure of the transcripts to others.
indeed,sorenson below characterized the herald motion as a new request.
we acknowledge that the people captioned their motion request for reconsideration of order denying request for transcripts of jury trial.capitalization omitted.but because this pleading did not seek modification,amendment,or revocation of an order that had resulted from an application for an order made to a judge,or to a court code civ,subd.a,or constituted a subsequent application for the same order upon new or different facts,circumstances,or law code civ,subd.b,it did not constitute a motion for reconsideration or a renewed motion within the meaning of code of civil procedure section.see le francois goel cal th,d,code of civ,impos es a limitation on the parties ability to file repetitive motions see also standard microsystems winbond electronics th,d merely asking the court to grant relief that is inconsistent with a prior order,whether by the same or a different judge,is not a motion for reconsideration.the fact that the people motion was captioned request for reconsideration is of no consequence.sole energy petrominerals th,d nature of motion is determined by the nature of the relief sought,not by the label attached to it.
as noted,presiding judge roberts orders were not the result of prior applications or motions for access having been filed and heard by the court.we therefore express no opinion concerning whether hypothetically it would have been proper for presiding judge roberts,under code of civil procedure section,to have reassigned to a different judge a motion to reconsider or a renewed motion for access following an order he had entered based upon an application for access.
to avoid confusion,we will refer to the california supreme court as our high court or the high court,and to the united states supreme court as the supreme court.
the high court in nbc subsidiary also discussed two other supreme court cases involving the right of public access in criminal cases.in globe newspaper superior court,d globe,the supreme court struck down a state law requiring courtroom closure in criminal trials during the testimony of minor victims.justice brennan opinion for a majority of the court,granting relief to the newspaper that challenged the statute,reiterated that to the extent that the first amendment embraces a right of access to criminal trials,it is to ensure that the constitutionally protected discussion of governmental affairs is an informed one.citation.nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d,quoting globe,at.in waller georgia,d waller,the trial court granted the prosecution request to close a lengthy suppression hearing,over the defendant objection that such closure violated his sixth amendment right to a public trial.as summarized by the nbc subsidiary court,the supreme court held that the blanket closure order was overbroad and violated the defendant right to a public trial citation,and it announced that the standard for reviewing closure under the sixth amendment was the same as the standard for reviewing closure under the first amendment as set out in press enterprise i and its predecessors.citation.nbc subsidiary,at d,omitted,quotingwaller,at.
as the above quote denotes,the qualified right of access includes both access to proceedings and court records.the high court observed in a footnote that there is a first amendment right of access to civil litigation documents filed in court as a basis for adjudication but the first amendment does not compel public access to discovery materials that are neither used at trial nor submitted as a basis for adjudication.citations.nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,fn,d.this footnote served as the basis for the adoption by the judicial council in of rules and of the california rules of court concerning the sealing of trial court records.see mercury interactive klein,supra,th at,d.
as a general rule,a special proceeding is confined to the type of case which was not,under the common law or equity practice,either an action at law or a suit in equity.tide water oil superior court cal d.
