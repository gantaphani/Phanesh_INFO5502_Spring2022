when minnesota mining and manufacturing company,more commonly known as,decided to end its involvement in the background music business,dealers,including the sound of music company,were understandably concerned.in this suit,we consider whether sound of music has legal recourse for decision to terminate the parties background music business relationship.we conclude that did not breach its contract with sound of music,as the contract allowed to terminate the agreement by providing sound of music twelve months advance written notice of its intention to leave the background music business,as it did here.because we also find that sound of music can not obtain relief under either the illinois or minnesota franchise statutes,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of.in addition,we affirm the district court decision to deny sound of music leave to file a second amended complaint to add a claim under the illinois consumer fraud act because the claim would not survive a motion for summary judgment.
background 
a diversified company based in minnesota with thousands of products,was once in the background music business.in that business,supplied and background music,as well as the equipment that played the music.the sound of music company,founded in by former employee richard cushing,became one of many businesses that marketed and sold background music products to end users,including businesses which played the background music in their stores.sound of music had its offices in illinois but had contracts with businesses and stores throughout the country,including in minnesota.
sound of music and had several agreements governing their relationship.on october,terminated an agreement the parties had signed in.the parties next agreement,executed on may,plays a central role in this case.under the agreement,sound of music was a distributor of background music and background music equipment.the agreement provided that it would continue until december,unless earlier terminated by either party as provided herein.
as in many industries,the technology in the background music business has changed over the years.when sound of music and first began their relationship,background music was supplied to end users through magnetic tapes,a product.by the late,the industry had moved away from magnetic tapes,and suppliers instead used an analog satellite signal to transmit music.leased satellite space from a north carolina company to broadcast the signal for end users,and provided equipment that allowed end users to convert the analog signal into music that could be played in their stores.
during the,became concerned that the industry was shifting from analog to digital technology.as a result,it believed that it would incur significant costs if it remained in the background music business.in,asked donald will,one of its employees,to evaluate the company background music business.will team concluded that growth of the background music business beyond the current satellite contract would not be wise because employed aging technology no serious potential buyer for the background music business existed and shutting down the background music project quickly would give dealers at least twelve months notice and would enable the company to use gains from the sale of another division to offset expected losses from a rapid shutdown.on october,will completed a report and recommended a rapid shutdown of background music business.shortly thereafter,decided to follow his recommendation.on november,sent a letter to sound of music stating that would terminate its involvement in the background music business as of december.by its terms,the agreement would not have expired until december.
three days after receiving the letter,sound of music contacted its attorney for advice.sound of music was concerned about the substantial investment it had placed in the background music business.during the time the agreement governed,leased downlink equipment to sound of music and other dealers.sound of music then subleased the equipment to its customers,who used it to receive and play the satellite music in their stores.by october,however,sound of music had purchased the downlink equipment from at a cost of approximately and owned it outright.in the weeks and months following receipt of the termination letter,sound of music counsel researched options including possible legal remedies sound of music might have against for the termination of the agreement.ultimately,in april,sound of music was sold to muzak,another background service provider.
sound of music filed a complaint against on february,alleging claims for breach of contract,violation of the illinois franchise disclosure act,violation of the minnesota franchise act,and equitable recoupment.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of on all counts and denied sound of music request for leave to file a second amended complaint.sound of music appeals.
ii.analysis 
summary.standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.vision church vill.of long grove,cir.summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c see also celotex catrett,d.
as an initial matter,we note that contrary to sound of music assertion,the district court did not need to explicitly reconcile all the differences between statement of undisputed facts and sound of music response to statement when it ruled on motion for summary judgment.instead,the district court needed only to decide whether,based on the evidence in the record,a material dispute of fact existed that required trial.see.c waldridge am.hoechst,cir.the district court did so in a thorough opinion and concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact.sound of music maintains that this decision was erroneous,as it contends summary judgment should not have been granted on its claims for breach of contract,violation of the illinois franchise disclosure act,and violation of the minnesota franchise act.we now address these arguments.
breach of contract claim 
sound of music first argues that the district court improperly granted summary judgment on its claim that breached a contract between the parties when terminated the agreement.although the parties do not discuss whether minnesota or illinois law applies to this claim,the agreement contains a provision stating that minnesota law will apply to any questions,claims,disputes,or litigation arising from or related to this agreement.in a suit where the federal court subject matter jurisdiction is based on diversity,such as this one,the forum state choice of law rules determine the applicable substantive law.klaxon stentor.thomas guardsmark,cir.illinois courts generally adhere to a contract choice of law provisions.thomas,at stating illinois respects a contract choice of law clause if the contract is valid and the law does not contradict illinois fundamental public policy kohler leslie hindman,cir.because we see no reason why we should not recognize the parties choice of minnesota law as we analyze whether a breach of the contract took place,we will apply minnesota law to this claim.
to prevail on a breach of contract action under minnesota law,a plaintiff must prove the formation of a contract performance by the plaintiff of any conditions precedent to the right to demand performance by the defendant breach of the contract by the defendant and damages resulting from that breach.indus.rubber applicators,eaton metal prods,blattner sons,firemen ins.the parties agree that the agreement constituted a valid contract and that sound of music had performed its obligations under the contract.they dispute,however,whether termination of the parties relationship constituted a breach of the agreement.
the agreement provided that it was to continue until december.the agreement also provided,however,that it could be terminated sooner if certain conditions were met.in particular,the agreement termination provision stated 
termination.this agreement may be terminated by the parties as follows 
either or dealer may terminate this agreement if the other materially breaches the agreement by giving ninety days written notice 
by either party immediately upon written notice by one party to the other,if that other party files or has filed against it a petition under any bankruptcy act,has a receiver appointed for any of its assets,
c.in the event of bankruptcy by dealer or if dealer is unable to perform its material obligations to end users or to,may substitute for dealer and fulfill its obligations under the music service agreement.in such event end user will make payments directly to.
upon exit from the business by sale,divestiture,assignment of assets,or any other manner of exit,or any other material transfer of ownership of the equipment or music service portion of either party business upon twelve months advance written notice.
by providing sound of music with over twelve months advance written notice that it was exiting the background music business,contends it properly terminated the agreement pursuant to section d of paragraph.sound of music,however,argues that did not terminate the relationship in a manner allowed by the agreement.
unilateral termination 
sound of music first argues that section d did not allow to unilaterally terminate the agreement.instead,sound of music contends that both parties must agree to end the relationship for termination under section d to be proper.to support its argument,sound of music points first to the introductory language in paragraph,which provides that the agreement may be terminated by the parties plural,sound of music emphasizes for the reasons that follow it.sound of music also points to sections a and b of paragraph,which specifically provide that either party may terminate the agreement.because the either party language does not appear in section d,and the introductory language to the entire paragraph provides that termination may occur by the parties,sound of music concludes that termination under d can only occur if both parties agree to terminate the agreement.
we do not read the agreement as sound of music does.first,the introductory by the parties phrase does not contain any limitation on which party may use the provisions that follow it,and neither the paragraph introductory language nor section d states that consent of both parties is necessary for proper termination.in addition,that termination pursuant to section d is contingent upon sufficient advance notice suggests that consent is not required,as advance notice would not seem critical if a party could simply decline to agree to a proposed termination.
at best,the language in section d is ambiguous,meaning that it is susceptible to more than one meaning.see hous.and redev.auth.of chisholm norman.when a contract is ambiguous,a court may examine extrinsic evidence to ascertain the meaning of the contract.hickman safeco ins.of,norman,at.if the extrinsic evidence is conclusive,the proper reading of the contract is not a question of fact.see hickman,at.
here,the extrinsic evidence conclusively establishes that could unilaterally terminate the contract upon twelve months written notice if it exited the background music business.the agreement,and its termination provisions in particular,resulted from significant negotiations between the parties.unlike the parties prior agreement signed in,included in its draft of the agreement a specific date by which the agreement would expire on its own terms.draft also included a provision stating that it could terminate the agreement if it exited the business upon ninety days advance notice.these proposals worried sound of music,as it was concerned that might leave the background music business precisely what happened here.so sound of music asked that the provision allowing to terminate the agreement by exiting the business be removed entirely,or at least that the agreement provide that sixty months notice was required to terminate the contract if exited the business,however,would not agree.the agreement reflects that the parties ultimately agreed that could terminate the agreement if provided twelve months advance notice.
exiting the business 
next,sound of music contends that did not exit the business,as termination pursuant to section d required.the agreement does not define the term,the business,and sound of music maintains that the business should be read to include more product areas than those addressed in the agreement 
in particular,sound of music contends that the agreement should be read to allow for termination only if terminated its entire intouch business.this division included not just background music but also wireless communications,for example.sound of music draws its conclusion from the termination letter it received from,which stated in part 
for the past several months,has been carefully evaluating its intouch business.we have decided that a change in strategic business direction is necessary.as a result,we will terminate our dbs broadcast business on,we will continue to operate our other businesses.
dbs was shorthand for direct broadcast satellite,and sound of music acknowledges that the letter informed sound of music that was ending its satellite background music services business.
significantly,the only subject of the agreement was the background music services business.the agreement makes no mention of the intouch line of business nor of any of thousands of other products.we find nothing in the agreement or anywhere else in the record to indicate that the parties intended to make ability to terminate by exiting the business contingent on businesses which were not the subject of the agreement.because sound of music acknowledges that gave it at least twelve months written notice that it was terminating its background music business,properly terminated the agreement pursuant to section d.summary judgment in favor of on the breach of contract claim was therefore proper.
illinois franchise disclosure act claim 
sound of music next argues that the entry of summary judgment on its claim under the illinois franchise disclosure act illinois franchise act was erroneous the illinois franchise act provides that a franchisor may not terminate a franchise located in illinois prior to the expiration of its term unless good cause exists to do so.comp.stat.a.but the act also provides that actions thereunder must be brought within one year after the franchisee becomes aware of facts or circumstances reasonably indicating that he may have a claim for relief in respect to conduct governed by the act.comp.stat.the district court granted summary judgment on sound of music claim under the illinois statute after concluding that the statute of limitations had expired before sound of music filed suit.
although sound of music received notice in november that would cease its background music services business at the end of,sound of music did not file its complaint until february.sound of music acknowledges that it did not bring its claim until more than a year after it received the notice of termination,but it maintains that an issue of fact exists as to whether facts or circumstances reasonably indicated to sound of music that it might have a claim under the illinois franchise act before february of,one year before it filed suit.
we disagree.our decision in pyramid controls siemens industrial automation,cir,governs here,and it demonstrates that the district court grant of summary judgment was proper.in pyramid controls,a manufacturer sent the plaintiff distributor a notice that it was terminating their relationship,pursuant to a clause in the distribution agreement.at.shortly after learning of the impending termination,the plaintiff president consulted his company attorney.id.the attorney considered various causes of action,although not one under the illinois franchise statute,and then told the plaintiff it had no legal remedy.id.more than a year later,when a different attorney concluded a viable claim under the illinois franchise statute existed,the plaintiff filed suit.id.at.although the plaintiff contended actual knowledge of an illinois franchise act claim was necessary before a business could become aware of facts or circumstances reasonably indicating that he may have a claim for relief under the statute,we disagreed.id.at.an examination of the statutory language and illinois state court decisions,including brenkman belmont marketing,d,led us to conclude that illinois courts have decided that knowledge of facts reasonably indicating a claim plus consultation with an attorney is enough to trigger the statute of limitations clock.pyramid controls,at.
no illinois decision after pyramid controls suggests our conclusion was incorrect,and sound of music does not press us to overturn that decision.instead,it argues first that it was reasonable for its attorneys to take slightly over two months to review many years of documents to find support for a claim under the illinois franchise statute.sound of music would like the statute of limitations clock to begin ticking in february,a little over two months after it received notice of termination and exactly one year before it filed suit.unfortunately for sound of music,pyramid controls instructs that the reasonableness of the attorneys review is irrelevant here.instead,the statute of limitations began to run when sound of music had knowledge of facts reasonably indicating a claim and it had consulted its attorney.there is no requirement that the attorney know a viable claim exists.see id.at rejecting argument that actual knowledge of claim under illinois franchise statute necessary to trigger statute of limitations.
in this case,sound of music acquired the requisite awareness in november when it received the termination notice from.that letter stated intent to terminate the agreement because intended to leave the background music business.sound of music knew sufficient facts reasonably indicating that a claim under the illinois franchise act existed in november,more than a year before it asserted this claim against.
also in november,only three days after sound of music received termination letter,sound of music consulted its attorney seeking advice.after reviewing the letter,the attorney discussed with sound of music the possibility of continuing the business through obtaining satellite services so that customers of sound of music could be serviced and the business could continue.this attorney,the same attorney who had represented sound of music when it signed the agreement with,also directed the research of possible legal remedies against.thus,sound of music had facts reasonably indicating a claim under the illinois franchise act and presented these facts to its attorney in november,and it did not file suit until more than a year later.
in a separate argument,sound of music contends that the statute of limitations should have been triggered not when it had facts reasonably indicating a claim and presented them to its attorney,but only when its damages were ascertainable.sound of music contends its damages from the termination were not ascertainable until the spring of,when it sold its business.no case to which sound of music points supports its argument.first,in profit management development,jacobson,brandvik,and anderson,d,the illinois appellate court stated that although actual damages were an essential element of the legal malpractice claim at issue,damages were speculative,and thus prevented a trigger of the statute of limitations,only if their existence itself is uncertain and not if the amount is uncertain or yet to be fully determined,at.similarly,in midwest commerce banking elkhart city centre,cir,we stated that damages are for people who have been harmed,and that the statute of limitations on the tort action at issue would not begin to run until harm occurred.at.
in this case,sound of music knew in november of the consequences of the agreement termination.indeed,it consulted its attorney almost immediately to investigate possible legal remedies for decision to terminate the parties relationship.even if sound of music did not know the exact amount of its damages in november,it knew at that time that it had been harmed.the statute of limitations began to run in november when sound of music acquired facts reasonably indicating a claim under the illinois franchise statute and consulted with its attorney,and the district court correctly granted summary judgment on this claim because sound of music did not file its claim until more than a year later.in light of our determination that sound of music illinois franchise act claim was untimely,we need not address additional arguments in support of the district court decision to grant summary judgment on this claim.
minnesota franchise act claim 
sound of music also disagrees with the district court decision to grant summary judgment in favor of on sound of music claim under the minnesota franchise act.like the illinois franchise disclosure act,the minnesota franchise act provides that a franchise may not be terminated except for good cause,subd.b.sound of music maintains violated this provision by terminating the agreement without good cause.
raises multiple arguments in support of the district court decision,including its contention that sound of music waived any right it may have had to claim it was a franchisee within the meaning of the minnesota franchise act.specifically,points to paragraph of the agreement,which states the relationship between and sound of music is that of a supplier to its distributor.sound of music is not an agent,partner,involved in a joint venture with,or franchisee of.emphasis added.but the minnesota court of appeals has stated that the requirements in the minnesota franchise act,not the labels used by the parties,determine whether a relationship exists.upper midwest sales ecolab,
in any event,resolution of the effect of paragraph is not necessary.we conclude that even if the agreement did not preclude sound of music from bringing a claim under the minnesota franchise act,summary judgment was proper because the agreement between and sound of music was not a franchise under the act.under the minnesota franchise act,a franchise is a contract or agreement,either express or implied,whether oral or written,for a definite or indefinite period,between two or more persons 
i by which a franchisee is granted the right to engage in the business of offering or distributing goods or services using the franchisor trade name,trademark,service mark,logotype,advertising,or other commercial symbol or related characteristics 
ii in which the franchisor and franchisee have a community of interest in the marketing of goods or services at wholesale,retail,by lease,agreement,or otherwise and 
iii for which the franchisee pays,directly or indirectly,a franchise fee.
subd.a all three elements must be present for a franchise to fall within the minnesota franchise act purview.ot,oy ab.
in this case,sound of music has not demonstrated that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether it paid a franchise fee for the agreement between sound of music and.under the minnesota franchise act,a franchise fee is any fee a franchisee must pay or agrees to pay for the right to enter into a business or to continue a business under a franchise agreement,subd.such a fee includes the payment either in lump sum or by installments of an initial capital investment fee,any fee or charges based upon a percentage of gross or net sales whether or not referred to as royalty fees,any payment for goods or services,or any training fees or training school fees or charges.id 
sound of music maintains in this suit that termination of the agreement violated the minnesota franchise act,yet it does not contend that it paid a franchise fee for the agreement the parties entered into in.nor could it succeed on such an argument.the agreement in the record makes no mention of a franchise fee or any fee that sound of music had to pay for the right to enter into or continue business with.and,notably,sound of music does not contend that any evidence in the record indicates it paid a franchise fee for the agreement.
instead,sound of music apparently contends that a dea
