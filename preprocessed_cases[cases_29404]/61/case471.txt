we are called upon to determine whether a newspaper of general circulation that was established prior to may,without publishing notice,obtain an adjudication that it is a newspaper of general circulation for every city incorporated since within the county in which the newspaper is established.we conclude that doing so is inconsistent with applicable statutes and contrary to public policy.
the impact of becoming a newspaper of general circulation for a city is significant.certain legal notices,such as fictitious business name notices,may be published in any adjudicated newspaper in the county.bus.others,however,must be published by a newspaper of general circulation for a particular city.for example,probate notices must be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city in which the decedent resided,subd.b.foreclosure notices must also be published in a newspaper of general circulation for the city where the real property is located,subd.b.
contentions 
the daily journal corporation daily journal appeals from the denial of its motion to vacate an order deeming the metropolitan met news a newspaper of general circulation for cities incorporated within the county of los angeles since.the daily journal contends the trial court erred in denying its motion to vacate based upon the met news failure to show that it met the statutory qualifications to be adjudicated a newspaper of general circulation for the cities in question,and its failure to publish the required notice.the met news contends an order denying a motion to vacate is not appealable.
legislative background 
the legislative setting was described by our supreme court in in re norwalk call cal d,norwalk call.the government code provides that whenever any official advertising,notice,resolution,order,or other matter is required by law to be published in a newspaper,such publication shall be made only in a newspaper of general circulation,and that term is defined in section as a newspaper for the dissemination of news and intelligence of a general character which has a bona fide subscription list of paying subscribers and has been established,printed and published at regular intervals for at least one year preceding publication in the state,county,or city where the publication is to be made.the word established is defined as referring to a newspaper which has been in existence under a specified name for the whole of the period.until a newspaper could qualify as printed and published within the meaning of the predecessor of section even though the physical act of printing was not performed in the place where the paper was to appear in re mcdonald cal,but in that year the legislature adopted provisions,still in effect,defining printed and published in such manner that a newspaper could not be deemed one of general circulation for an area unless per cent of the mechanical work of typesetting and impressing type on paper was completed there.also in,however,the legislature enacted the provision involved in this proceeding,declaring,nothing in this chapter alters the standing of any newspaper which,prior to the passage of chapter of the statutes of,was an established newspaper of general circulation,irrespective of whether it was printed in the place where it was published for a period of one year as required.in this section was amended to add the proviso,provided,however,that this section shall apply only in the event that said newspaper has altered neither the county,nor the town,nor the city of its publication or printing,or both,since the effective date of this act.the proviso was eliminated in by an amendment,thus restoring the statute to the form in which it was enacted in.norwalk call,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.
norwalk call,supra,held that where a newspaper had before met the requirements to qualify as an established newspaper of general circulation for a township,the facts that the township subsequently was incorporated as a city and that the newspaper was not printed within the city did not terminate the newspaper standing as of general circulation for the geographical area.cal d at.the met news relies upon this reasoning to support its position that because it could publish certain notices for the entire unincorporated area of los angeles county in,it is entitled to continue to publish those notices throughout that geographic area after incorporation of a portion of the area.
procedural and factual background 
in,henry molz,proprietor and publisher of the los angeles enterprise newspaper,petitioned the superior court for a decree declaring the newspaper to be of general circulation for the city and county of los angeles and the state of california,as defined in section of the government code the decree issued.in october,it was modified to reflect the change of the newspaper name to met news.the order states that the original decree in this case recites the place of printing which,under government code,is unnecessary in light of the founding date,and deleted the place of printing.
in april,the met news filed a second application for modification of the decree.this application was filed ex parte and without publication.it sought to further modify the judgment to include cities incorporated after within the county of los angeles.judge malcolm mackey granted the application,and decreed the met news a newspaper of general circulation,as defined in section,for the cities of artesia,baldwin park,bell,bell gardens,bellflower,calabasas,carson,cerritos,commerce,diamond bar,downey,gardena,hawaiian gardens,industry,la,la habra heights,lakewood,la mirada,lancaster,la puente,lawndale,lomita,los angeles,malibu,norwalk,palmdale,paramount,pico rivera,rancho palos verdes,palos verdes estates,rolling hills,rolling hills estates,rosemead,san dimas,santa fe springs,santa clarita,signal hill,south el monte,temple city,walnut,and west hollywood,as well as the county of los angeles,and state of california.
the daily journal asserts that it discovered the order in january.in february,the daily journal filed a motion to vacate the order.the motion states as grounds for relief that the met news failed to publish notice as required by section and that a blanket adjudication for all cities in los angeles county incorporated after is impermissible.the daily journal disqualified judge mackey,pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure,and the case was reassigned to judge soussan bruguera.
judge bruguera denied the motion to vacate the modification.this appeal followed.we permitted the california newspaper publishers association cnpa to file a brief as amicus curiae in support of the daily journal.
discussion 
appealability 
the met news has moved for dismissal of the appeal,arguing that the order denying the motion to vacate is not appealable.we reject this contention.
a proceeding to adjudicate that a newspaper is a newspaper of general circulation is a special proceeding governed by section et.see in re herman cal.section provides an appeal may be taken to the supreme court from any final decision or judgment,or from any final order vacating,modifying or setting aside a decision or judgment previously entered.the order appealed from here is an order denying a motion to vacate a judgment,not an order vacating,modifying or setting aside a decision or judgment previously entered.in re hancock d,was an appeal from an order denying a motion to modify a decree.the court of appeal held that although section does not directly provide for an appeal,a denial of a motion to modify such a decree is appealable under former section of the code of civil procedure now code civ,subd.a,which provided for an appeal from a final judgment in a special proceeding.see in re hancock,supra,at.in re hancock is on point,but the met news urges us to repudiate it as incorrectly decided.
former section and current section are both located in part of the code of civil procedure.the met news points out that our supreme court has held that the provisions of part of the code of civil procedure do not apply to special proceedings unless the statutes governing the special proceeding expressly incorporate those procedures.carpen
