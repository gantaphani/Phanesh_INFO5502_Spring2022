francis gutierrez and joseph rydel both contracted for cable television service with an entity known to them only as broadband.both disputed charges that appeared on their cable bills,both refused to pay,and both accounts were ultimately turned over to credit protection association cpa,a collections agency.the letters they received from cpa represented that it was collecting debts on behalf of broadband.
unknown to gutierrez and rydel,broadband was not the name of a real entity or their actual creditor.instead,it was the brand name used by their true creditors,cable franchisees lasalle telecommunications,and communications and cable of chicago,collectively,chicago cable.confusingly,an entity with the name broadband,llc as opposed to broadband no llc does exist.and complicating matters further,chicago cable and broadband,llc are sister corporations,falling under the massive umbrella of their mutual parent.
when rydel decided to file a state court class action in illinois over the disputed charges,he did so against broadband,llc corporate broadband,believing it to be his creditor.corporate broadband then moved to dismiss the complaint against it,claiming that rydel sued the wrong entity.it was then that rydel learned that broadband the brand name and broadband,llc the corporate entity were purportedly not the same and that his true creditor was chicago cable 
this chicago cable provided rydel cable service and was his true creditor,not corporate to the instant suit under the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa,et.both gutierrez and rydel sued corporate broadband under for allegedly design ing,compil ing,and furnish ing any form knowing that such form would be used to create the false belief in a consumer that a person other than the creditor is participating in the collection of a debt in support of their claim,plaintiffs point to,among other documents,their bills and collection letters that direct payment be made to broadband not broadband,llc,at a denver,colorado address where corporate broadband receives mail.because of the denver address and the use of the name broadband,the plaintiffs argue that corporate broadband must have been the entity that designed,compiled and furnished the bills and collection letters.they further allege that the documents deliberately deceived them into thinking corporate broadband,and not their true creditor chicago cable,was attempting to collect their debts.the problem with that,the plaintiffs urge,is corporate broadband led them to believe they were dealing with communications giant,and not the lowly franchisee,chicago cable,in an attempt to intimidate them into paying their cable bills above other possible outstanding debts.
plaintiff rydel gutierrez does not join in this count of the complaint also alleged that chicago cable violated,which makes it unlawful for a debt collector to use any false,deceptive,or misleading representations or means in connection with the collection of any debt.rydel argues that chicago cable meets the definition of debt collector under the fdcpa because,in the process of collecting his own debts,chicago cable use d any name other than his own which would indicate that a third person is collecting or attempting to collect such debts.rydel asserts that even though chicago cable represented itself as cable services or broadband throughout its relationship with him,the bills requesting payment to cable services and the collection letter listing broadband as payee amounted to the use of a name other than chicago cable own,indicating that a third person cable services or broadband or,perhaps even corporate broadband was attempting to collect his debts.again,the problem with chicago cable behavior,rydel alleges,relates to its tapping into the power of its parent,producing undue pressure on him to pay his bills.and,because cable services and broadband were not registered assumed names of chicago cable under illinois law and not registered service marks under federal trademark law,rydel complains that he had no means of identifying his true creditor,resulting in the mistake in state court where he wrongly filed against corporate broadband.
the district court granted summary judgment to both corporate broadband and chicago cable.gutierrez and rydel timely appeal,and we affirm.
ii.analysis 
heller,ryczek,and politano affidavits 
before we turn to the merits of the district court decision,we must first address the plaintiffs complaint that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to strike three affidavits the defendants proffered in support of their motion.the plaintiffs argue in the alternative that if the district court was unwilling to strike the affidavits,it should have reopened discovery for the limited purpose of allowing plaintiffs the opportunity to depose the three affiants.
it is questionable whether the plaintiffs request for additional discovery below preserved the issue for appeal.after making a argument requesting that the district court strike the offending affidavits a fairly harsh remedy,the plaintiffs request for more depositions appeared as an afterthought at the end of their reply brief in support of their motion to strike.the motion nowhere mentioned federal rule of civil procedure f which specifically provides for reopening of discovery in the midst of summary judgment briefing,and was unsupported by affidavits as generally required by rule f.see woods city of chicago,cir finding that failure to file an affidavit in support of a rule f motion alone justifies the district court decision to deny the additional discovery,cited with approval in first bank tr.am eurocopter,cir.lexis,at.
even giving the plaintiffs the benefit of the doubt as to the viability of their request to remand this case for additional discovery,we find no reason to disturb the district court decision to allow the three depositions to stand,which we review for an abuse of discretion.see mcleod arrow marine,cir woods,at.
heller affidavit 
the district court refused to strike jennifer heller affidavit because the plaintiffs admitted all material facts for which the affidavit was cited in support thus,the district court reasoned,defendants reliance on the heller affidavit did not prejudice the plaintiffs.
the plaintiffs counter that heller affidavit contained a statement with which they did not agree.yet,we observe that the defendants did not cite to or rely upon the specific paragraph plaintiffs dispute in support of their motion.rather,the defendants used heller affidavit solely to outline corporate structure during the time period relevant to this case and to explain the relationships among the various entities at issue.the plaintiffs admitted these particular facts.
there is no evidence that the district court,in ruling on the defendants motion,relied on heller affidavit except for the propositions for which it was specifically cited and with which the plaintiffs have no argument.because heller affidavit in no way prejudiced the plaintiffs ability to oppose the defendants motion,the district court properly refused to strike it or to reopen discovery to allow heller deposition.
ryczek affidavit 
we agree with the district court that the plaintiffs were on notice prior to the close of discovery that martha ryczek,chicago cable collections manager,had information pertinent to this matter and was a potential witness,despite the fact that she was not listed in any of the defendants discovery responses or offered in response to the plaintiffs rule b deposition notice.because the plaintiffs had a fair opportunity to seek discovery from ryczek prior to the deadline for filing motions,the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to strike her affidavit or allow additional discovery.
richard baucom,the defendants designated rule b deponent,discussed ryczek and her job responsibilities during his deposition in response to detailed questions by the plaintiffs counsel.those questions were quite clearly directed at finding additional witnesses who would assist plaintiffs in the discovery process.we reproduce the relevant deposition testimony in full 
q who sets standards for sending a bill from your company to credit protection association,

q no,that correct or no,i incorrect 
a no,that correct.
q okay.this is like hide and seek.i actually trying to find the people who are going to be responsive to my requests.
ex at see also,ex.at ryczek mentioned,six days after baucom deposition,by diane evans,debt collector cpa representative,as cpa collections manager contact at broadband to whom they report.
plaintiffs argue now that the above did not put them on notice that ryczek possessed relevant information about chicago cable internal and external collection processes,reasoning that because she reported to baucom,baucom would possess the same information as ryczek.but baucom and evans testimony should have alerted the plaintiffs that ryczek would have more and better information with regard to collections than would baucom.specifically,their testimony revealed that ryczek oversaw chicago cable collections operation,was supervised only minimally by baucom,and was cpa direct client contact 
based on the above,we can not conclude that the district court abused its discretion in allowing ryczek affidavit to stand.although the defendants did have an obligation to seasonably supplement their rule a disclosures and interrogatory responses,such amendments are required only in certain circumstances,such as when the additional information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process.e,see also david caterpillar,cir.here,the plaintiffs knew of ryczek and the fact she possessed information relevant to this case through baucom and evans depositions.
finally,although we in no way condone the defendants choice to provide baucom,a largely unresponsive witness,as their rule b deposition representative,we also note that the plaintiffs made a tactical decision not to insist that the defendants produce better witnesses after baucom proved inadequate.such a request very likely would have been viewed favorably had it been made prior to the close of discovery,with possible sanctions levied against the defendants for failing to provide an appropriate deponent in the first instance.yet,the plaintiffs raised their dissatisfaction with baucom after the close of discovery,in the midst of briefing,and with prior knowledge that better witnesses,like ryczek,existed.the district judge was not required to belatedly punish the defendants by striking ryczek affidavit or reopening discovery in such circumstances.see,grayson,cir where a party own lack of diligence is to blame for that party failure to secure discoverable information,it is not an abuse of discretion to deny a rule f motion,cert.denied,d kalis,cir quoting pfeil rogers,cir.
politano affidavit 
the district court also found that the plaintiffs were adequately on notice that politano was a potential witness.although we found the district court to be on firm ground with respect to ryczek,we can not agree this was the case with politano.
the plaintiffs admit they had seen politano name on a service mark application they uncovered through their own internet search of the united states patent and trademark office website it was not a document produced to the plaintiffs by the defendants.that document showed that broadband was registered as a service mark of,that the application was filed december,three months after the filing of the present lawsuit,and that the attorney of record was politano.the plaintiffs asked baucom,the defendants rule b designee,do you know who frank politano is baucom responded,no.i do not.politano,it turns out,works for the parent,as its trademark and copyright counsel.his affidavit was offered to explain how chicago cable,an subsidiary,came to provide cable services under the brand name broadband.
we do not believe that the service mark application and baucom deposition testimony were enough to put the plaintiffs on notice that politano possessed information pertinent to their claims such that they would be expected to request his deposition or anticipate that his affidavit might be offered in support of the defendants motion.no witness indicated politano possessed information pertinent to this matter or was even employed by during the relevant time period.
we believe that the correct course would have been to reopen discovery to allow for politano deposition.yet,despite the district judge misstep with respect to her analysis on this issue,we do not find it necessary to remand the case for further proceedings.because the plaintiffs also assert that striking the affidavit would have been a proper remedy below and because we are obligated to review the district judge decision de novo,davis transp.cent.express,cir,we can ignore politano affidavit and any statements of material fact for which it was offered in support and proceed to the merits of the plaintiffs claims.even without politano affidavit testimony,which established only a narrow set of facts with regard to rydel claim,we believe the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.
gutierrez and rydel claim against broadband,llc 
section a of the fdcpa provides 
it is unlawful to design,compile,and furnish any form knowing that such form would be used to create the false belief in a consumer that a person other than the creditor of such consumer is participating in the collection of or in an attempt to collect a debt such consumer allegedly owes such creditor,when in fact such person is not so participating.
the plaintiffs claim here that corporate broadband designed,compiled and furnished billing statements,a certain notice,and collection letters knowing that the documents would make the plaintiffs falsely believe that it,rather than chicago cable,was attempting to collect their debts.
the purpose of is to prohibit.see white goodman,cir.the classic effectively sells his letterhead to the creditor,often in exchange for a fee,so that the creditor can prepare its own delinquency letters on that letterhead.use of a third party letterhead gives the delinquency letters added intimidation value,as it suggests that a collection agency or some other party is now on the debtor back.nielsen dickerson,cir internal citations omitted.plaintiffs do not contend corporate broadband engaged in.instead,they urge us to apply to thwart the kind of deceit they say corporate broadband perpetrated in allowing its address and a variation of its name to appear on at least three types of documents arguably used in chicago cable debt collection monthly bills sent by chicago cable,a document titled important notices to our customers,and the collection letters sent by cpa 
the monthly bills 
for corporate broadband to have violated,it must have design ed,compil ed,and furnish ed the allegedly deceptive forms.a emphasis added see also laubach arrow serv,noting that the conjunction and indicates that all three are required as elements of a offense.the only evidence proffered by plaintiffs that corporate broadband designed,compiled,and furnished the plaintiffs monthly bills is the address contained on the detachable payment coupon included with the bill,and,in the case of gutierrez,the name of the payee.
rydel payment coupons directed him to make his checks payable to cable services and to send them to cable services at a denver,colorado post office box.after being notified of the name change from cable services to broadband,gutierrez payment coupon directed her to make her checks payable to broadband not broadband,llc and to send them to broadband not broadband,llc at the same denver,colorado post office box listed on rydel payment coupons.it is undisputed that corporate broadband receives mail at the post office box listed on the bills.however,it is also undisputed that chicago cable billing system generates the information contained on cable subscribers bills and that chicago cable sends those bills to its customers.
the plaintiffs request that we infer that corporate broadband permitted chicago cable to use its address on the bills and in the case of gutierrez,permitted the use of an abbreviated version of its name,broadband.from this premise,the plaintiffs argue that permitting the use of its address and,in the case of gutierrez,its abbreviated name meets requirement that corporate broadband design,compile,and furnish the allegedly deceptive form.they further allege that the plaintiffs were deceived by the bills into believing a third involved in the collection of their debt.
although the record is far from clear,we will assume that the denver address appears on the bills because corporate broadband permitted its use by chicago cable,and we will further assume that,to the extent the words broadband appear in conjunction with the denver address on gutierrez bills,corporate broadband intended it to represent an abbreviated version of its name and also permitted its use.however,permitting the use of a post office box not obviously associated with corporate broadband in rydel case corporate broadband name appears nowhere on the bill,and his bills directed payment to cable services surely does not amount to designing,compiling,and furnishing the bill,as is required under the act.rather,the undisputed evidence establishes that chicago cable designed,compiled,and furnished the bills to its customers.and,even though gutierrez bills contained both the denver address and the payee broadband,plaintiffs present no case law that would support a finding that permitting two such pieces of information to appear on a bill designed,compiled,and furnished by the creditor amounts to a violation of.
moreover,if the primary purpose behind is to protect consumers from believing that their debt has been turned over to some other entity as a means of intimidating them into paying,see white,at,the billing practice criticized here is not the kind of behavior the law was meant to discourage.even though their bills directed payment to an unfamiliar address,the bills listed the payees as cable services or broadband and were printed on paper bearing the blue globe logo appearing next to the familiar trademark.the bills were consistent with the plaintiffs understanding of the identity of their local cable service gutierrez and rydel ordered cable in person from an individual they believed represented,and they both signed work orders bearing the logo and the name cable services.both admit that the name cable services was later changed to broadband to reflect broader services,including internet access.the bills,referencing the only entities with which they dealt throughout their cable acquisition,could not have deceived them into believing a third attempting to collect their debt,as they claim.
put differently,where,as here,the plaintiffs monthly bills provided consistent information both before and after the plaintiffs fell into arrears,it makes no sense to assert that a post office box a name considered benign prior to the billing dispute takes on new meaning after the dispute that the new meaning to be imputed is that a third party has been interjected into the process where none was suspected before and that the plaintiffs wills were overborne by such a revelation.see nielsen,at noting that is designed to thwart debtor intimidation white,at noting that congress concern in enacting was to prevent deception inducing debtors to abandon legitimate defenses.indeed,there is no evidence of any intimidation occurring attached no significance to the denver,colorado address on his bill when questioned about it during his deposition,the address was even discussed in gutierrez deposition,and both plaintiffs admit that they believed they were dealing with throughout the events leading to this lawsuit.thus,even if we decide,which we do not,that corporate broadband designed,compiled,and furnished the bills,no rational trier of fact could find that corporate broadband did so knowing that the bills would be used to deceive plaintiffs into believing that another entity,and not their cable service provider,was attempting to collect their debt,as required by the plain language of the act.see.
customer notice 
the second document that allegedly draws corporate broadband under is titled important notices to our customers.although the document itself appears in the record,there is no corresponding record support for the proposition that the plaintiffs actually received or saw the document prior to the initiation of the lawsuit,or that the document was designed,compiled,and furnished by corporate broadband.
plaintiffs direct us to certain admissions by corporate broadband in support of such propositions,but those discovery responses only admit that certain information contained in the notice is accurate,and then go on to state that corporate broadband is unclear where plaintiffs obtained a copy of the notice and nowhere admits any involvement in the production of it.plaintiffs bald allegations that the notice was materially misleading,when they provide no affidavit or other testimony that they even received or relied on the document during their billing dispute,can not create an issue of fact as to the deceptive nature of the document.nor does the simple existence of the document,without more,support an inference that corporate broadband designed,compiled,and furnished the notice knowing that it would deceive the plaintiffs.
collection letters 
finally,plaintiffs point to the collection letters sent to them by the debt collector,cpa.they again allege that it was corporate broadband who actually designed,compiled,and furnished the letters because they refer to broadband as the plaintiffs cable service provider and creditor and provide a denver,colorado address.
according to the copies of the letters in the record,rydel received two collection letters from cpa.only the second refers to broadband as his other refers to cable services.despite the difference in payee,both request,in the detachable payment coupon appearing at the bottom of the letter,that payment be sent to the same not the denver,colorado post office box appearing on the payment coupon attached to the bills.the cpa letters request payment be sent to a chicago,illinois street address.oddly enough,the one letter sent by cpa to gutierrez refers to broadband in the body of the letter,but the payment coupon requests remittance to and directs payment be sent to cable services at the denver,colorado post office box appearing on her bills.
as with the bills,the information contained in cpa payment to cable services or broadband at a local chicago address in rydel case or to cable services at the denver,colorado address in gutierrez not remotely imply that corporate broadband designed,compiled,and furnished the letters or result in confusion that corporate broadband is actually attempting to collect the debt.second,and more importantly,it is undisputed that cpa formulated the collection letters with the advice of its counsel and sent them to the plaintiffs.though corporate broadband does admit that it reviewed some of the form letters sent by cpa not necessarily the particular form letters sent to plaintiffs,simply reviewing such documents does not trigger liability under.
for all of the above reasons,the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of corporate broadband.
rydel claim against communications and cable of chicago.
rydel alleges that chicago cable violated,which provides 
a debt collector may not use any false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.without limiting the general application of the foregoing,the following conduct is a violation of this section 
the use of any false representation or deceptive means to collect or attempt to collect any debt or to obtain information concerning a consumer.
the use of any business,company,or organization name other than the true name of the debt collector business company or organization.
rydel claims that chicago cable violated this provision of the fdcpa when it held itself out as cable services or broadband during its relationship with rydel,thus deceptively using a name other than its true name 
for chicago cable to be liable under,though,it must be a debt collector as defined by the statute.rydel does not dispute that chicago cable was the franchisee that provided his cable service and that any debt he owed,he owed to chicago cable.typically,chicago cable would be considered a creditor for fdcpa purposes,and not a debt collector.see the term creditor means any person who offers or extends credit creating a debt or to whom a debt is owed.yet,rydel argues that chicago cable falls into the exception listed in t he term debt collector includes any creditor who,in the process of collecting his own debts,uses any name other than his own which would indicate that a third person is collecting or attempting to collect such debts.where prohibits third parties from peddling their influence to creditors through,is the other side of the coin,prohibiting creditors from using the materials provided by to intimidate their debtors into paying.see white,at.
our task,then,is to first determine whether chicago cable in the process of collecting its own debts,used a name other than its own,which would indicate that a third party was attempting to collect rydel debts.see.if chicago cable does not fall into this exception,it can not be liable under as a debt collector.
rydel alleges that chicago cable used a false name in two phases of the debt collection process first,while attempting to collect on rydel account and second,after the debt had been referred to cpa for processing.we can easily dispense with any claim that chicago cable actions after rydel account had been referred to cpa for collection qualifies it for the exception.at that point,chicago cable was no longer in the process of collecting its own debts that work was the responsibility of cpa,an undisputed debt collector.see.because chicago cable was not in the process of collecting its own debts during the second phase of the collection process involving the debt collector cpa,chicago cable does not qualify as a debt collector under and can not be held liable under for any representations made in the letters sent by cpa.
as to the first phase of the collection process,rydel argues that chicago cable,falsely representing itself as cable services,attempted to prompt him to pay his debts through sending monthly service bills,which listed his accumulating arrearages.in that case,chicago cable would be in the process of collecting its own debts,meeting prong one of the exception.
whether the name cable services is a name other than chicago cable own,as required in prong two,is an open question what is undisputed is that chicago cable represented itself as cable services throughout its own attempts to collect rydel debt,never once representing itself as chicago cable or anything other than cable services.what is also undisputed is that chicago cable holding itself out as cable services on its bills was consistent with every other contact rydel had with chicago cable.for example,when rydel signed up for cable services,he did so on an cable services purchase order with a service representative that he understood to be from.after his cable was disconnected for nonpayment,he received telephone calls from individuals representing cable services.
regardless of whether chicago cable was entitled to represent itself as cable services,the name cable services on rydel bills could not have left rydel,or any unsophisticated consumer,with the impression that a third party was involved in the debt collection process.indeed,cable services was the only party of whom he was aware and was the entity to which he believed he owed the debt.it would have created more confusion had chicago cable,once rydel fell into arrears,started listing itself on his cable bills as his creditor instead of the name in which all other business had been transacted.see maguire citicorp retail,cir noting that to avoid liability under the exception,a creditor need not use its full business name or its name of incorporation,it should use the name under which it usually transacts business,or a acronym,or any name that it has used for the inception of the credit relation.internal citations and quotations omitted because chicago cable consistent use of the name cable services on the bills received by rydel could not have indicated that a third party was attempting to collect his debts,chicago cable does not fall under prong three of the exception and was not a debt collector subject to liability under.
rydel argues vigorously that because chicago cable failed to register cable services or broadband as assumed names as required by illinois law and failed to register broadband as a service mark until after this litigation was initiated,it was using those names illegally.because the names were illegal,rydel claims that chicago cable use of those names in its debt collection contacts with him was a per se violation of.rydel further argues that a rule allowing an illegal name to be used in debt collection,even if the name has been used by the creditor since the inception of its relationship with the debtor,creates a bad result,when,as here,because of the illegal name,the debtor then has trouble identifying his true creditor.
without passing on whether chicago cable use of such names was actually illegal,we can not accept either argument here although rydel latter argument attracts some sympathy,especially when a corporation structure is as labyrinthine as.this is because the fdcpa focus is not on whether the name used by the creditor is permitted by law,but on whether the name used results in the debtor deception in terms of what entity is trying to collect his debt.again,for a creditor to be liable under,its use of a name other than its own must indicate that a third person is collecting or attempting to collect the consumer debt.in this case chicago cable consistently represented itself as cable services throughout its dealings with rydel no deception as to what entity was trying to collect his debt occurred.thus,summary judgment was properly granted on rydel claim.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of broadband,llc and communications and cable of chicago.
while it is entirely possible that francis gutierrez and joseph rydel may ultimately lose in their effort to prove that the defendants committed violations of the fair debt collection practices act,et fdcpa,in my opinion there are disputed issues of material fact that render summary judgment in favor of the defendants inappropriate at this time.this is true even taking the record as my colleagues do.unlike them,however,i would find that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to permit the plaintiffs to conduct further discovery when pulled key affidavits out of its hat at the last minute.indeed,throughout the pretrial proceedings,approach to the case was deplorable.it played a shell game with its various corporate affiliates,forcing the plaintiffs to guess which entity was doing what at each moment.to this day,i am not sure myself.this record contains no answers to important questions such as what type of entity communications and cable of chicago,ccc is how is it related to the other corporate entities at issue here and where did it derive its authority to use the name and logo,in combination with the word broadband.moreover,conduct during discovery bordered on the sanctionable,and at the very least,should not have been allowed to stand uncorrected.i would
