introduction 
the question presented in this appeal is whether pretrial publicity denied john goss a fair trial.goss claim arises from pretrial press coverage of the september murder of his former girlfriend,janice amerin,and the subsequent manhunt that culminated in his arrest.amerin lived in the small town of plains,kansas,which is located in meade county in the southwest part of the state on the oklahoma border.she was shot and killed in her parents home,with her mother as an eyewitness to the crime.the victim mother identified goss as the suspect who fled the murder scene in amerin car.
at the time of the crime,the population of meade county was approximately,and the population of plains was approximately.the murder was the first in meade county in more than seventy years,and the victim and her family were and respected members of the community.following the murder,local law enforcement and residents engaged in an unsuccessful manhunt in search of goss.he was found two weeks later hiding in a small town in northwestern oklahoma.local and regional media covered the crime and the manhunt.in addition,the case gained statewide notoriety after a gubernatorial candidate referenced goss release from prison shortly before the murder in a campaign brochure calling for harsher punishment for violent crimes.
in october,a jury convicted goss of murder and unlawful possession of a firearm.goss subsequently filed a petition for habeas relief,pursuant to,in federal district court,arguing that pretrial publicity prejudiced the jury that heard his case and denied him a fundamentally fair trial.this appeal arises from the district court denial of his petition.finding that the kansas courts properly applied united states supreme court precedent governing constitutional challenges to pretrial publicity,we affirm the district court decision.
ii.factual and procedural background 
the essential facts underlying goss crimes are not in dispute.as set forth by the kansas supreme court during the direct appeal 
janice amerin resided with her parents near plains.on september,as janice was preparing to leave for work,goss appeared at the residence.he and janice had dated sporadically.shirletta amerin,janice mother,heard her daughter screaming in the garage.she rushed to the scene and saw janice and goss struggling.goss forced janice into her automobile.as goss was attempting to start the vehicle,janice broke away and started running for the house.goss fired two shots at her before janice ran inside the home.goss followed and shirletta heard more shots.goss then returned to the garage and drove away in janice car.
shirletta ran into the house and found her daughter standing in the kitchen.janice told her she had been shot by goss.an ambulance was called but janice died before it arrived.an autopsy revealed janice had been shot three times.on his way to the amerin home,the meade county sheriff saw janice car in a ditch,with footprints from the vehicle pointing north into a milo field.a fruitless manhunt was organized.on september,goss was arrested in tyrone,oklahoma.
state goss.
goss sought a change of trial venue because of the press coverage.the trial court evaluated the effect of pretrial publicity in ruling on two motions to change venue.the first motion and ruling occurred in march,seven months prior to trial.the court recognized that,although the case had already received a significant and extraordinary amount of attention from the press,publicity in and of itself does not demonstrate entitlement to a change of venue.at.the court found insufficient evidence that the publicity had affected the people of meade county to such a point that they going to carry with them an attitude that would deprive goss of a fair trial.id.at.thus,the court concluded that goss had failed to meet his burden of proof but allowed him the opportunity to raise the issue again if he could develop further evidence.id.at.
the second motion to change venue was heard only one month before trial,in september.in support of his motion,goss called nine witnesses whose names were chosen at random from the local phonebook.seven of the witnesses initially testified on direct examination that they had a preconceived opinion that goss was guilty.upon further questioning,however,three of the seven said they could put aside their opinions and give goss a fair trial.based on his review of the evidence,including his finding that five of nine witnesses could be impartial,the trial court denied goss motion to change venue,concluding that it was not convinced that the pretrial publicity in this matter was of such a nature so as to preclude or raise the likelihood that a fair and impartial jury can not be impounded in meade county,and meade county residents who are not directly associated with the victim family by friendship or association could put aside any and all pretrial publicity that has been aired so far and make decisions based upon the evidence that is introduced at the trial.at.
jury selection occurred in two sessions on october.the court called a total of people from the community as potential jurors,of whom were questioned.the court excluded for cause.after peremptory challenges,fourteen were selected to serve as jurors and alternates.goss did not object to the seating of the jury.
after a trial,the jury convicted goss.he was sentenced to three consecutive life terms on the murder count and to a consecutive term of three to ten years on the firearm count.at that time,kansas did not have the death penalty.
on appeal,the kansas supreme court affirmed the trial court ruling on goss motion to change venue and on the convictions.goss,at.the state supreme court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motions,providing two reasons for its conclusion.id.at.first,citing to the change of venue hearing,the court found an adequate number of potential jurors in the jury pool who passed the test of impartiality.id.second,the court found the trial court was generous with excusing jurors for cause,but,even so,a jury was selected in less than a day and defendant passed the remaining prospective jurors for cause.id 
on june,goss filed this action claiming the kansas supreme court decision regarding his motion to change venue represented an unreasonable application of federal law as determined by the united states supreme court.a magistrate judge recommended the petition be granted based on a finding that the pretrial publicity was so extensive that prejudice could be presumed under supreme court precedent.the district court,however,rejected the magistrate recommendation,finding goss did not show his case was tried in such a corruptive atmosphere that neither a fair trial or an impartial jury could be presumed.dist.order,at.the court determined the extent of the publicity fell far short of establishing presumed prejudice and therefore held that the kansas supreme court finding regarding the impartiality of the jury in petitioner trial was not contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established supreme court precedent.id.
the district court granted a certificate of appealability to this court,see c,on the question of whether the kansas courts denial of the motion to change venue violated goss sixth amendment right to an impartial jury and fair trial.goss now argues the pretrial publicity and community sentiment following the murder should have caused the state courts to conclude that any jury empaneled in meade county would be fatally prejudiced against goss,in violation of his constitutional rights.
iii.standard of review 
since goss filed his federal habeas petition after enactment of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa of,the act governs our review.wallace ward,cir.where a state court adjudicates the merits of a claim underlying a federal habeas petition,aedpa requires a federal court to deny the claim unless the state court decision is contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the united states supreme court,or resulted in a decision based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in state court.d.
this court reviews de novo a district court denial of a habeas petition.beem mckune,cir en banc.since the kansas courts adjudicated the merits of goss motion to change venue,we will only reverse the district court denial of the habeas petition if we conclude,after an independent review of the record,that goss is entitled to relief under d.
pursuant to d,a state court decision is contrary to established federal law as determined by the united states supreme court if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.williams taylor,d.a state court decision is an unreasonable application of federal law under d if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.at.an objective standard is used to evaluate the reasonableness of the state court application of federal law.id.at.importantly,even if the federal habeas court concludes that the state court decision applied clearly established federal law incorrectly,relief is appropriate only if that application is also objectively unreasonable.penry johnson,d emphasis added.
under aedpa,a state court factual determinations are afforded a presumption of correctness.e.petitioner carries the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.id.
a state trial court finding regarding the impartiality of particular jurors is a question of fact.patton yount,d.only when a manifest error occurs can a federal habeas court overturn a state court finding regarding jury impartiality as a whole.id.at.this standard also applies to any questions about the impact of pretrial publicity on the jury pool.swindler lockhart,cir.accordingly,our court independently evaluates testimony with respect to bias to decide whether the state court committed manifest error by holding the jury was sufficiently impartial.grancorvitz franklin,cir.
iv.discussion 
the sixth amendment as incorporated by the fourteenth amendment guarantees the right of a trial by jury in all state criminal cases.duncan louisiana,d.the fourteenth amendment due process clause independently requires the impartiality of any jury empaneled to hear a case in a state court.irvin dowd,d.in essence,the right to jury trial guarantees to the criminally accused a fair trial by a panel of impartial,indifferent jurors.the failure to accord an accused a fair hearing violates even the minimal standards of due process.id.at.
potential jurors,however,are not expected to be totally ignorant of the facts surrounding a case.rather,jurors are sufficiently impartial under constitutional standards if they can lay aside any preconceived opinions regarding the outcome of the case and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.id.at.criminal defendants bear the burden of establishing juror partiality.id.
goss challenges the denial of habeas relief solely on the ground of prejudicial pretrial publicity.he argues w hen the totality of the circumstances are considered,the evidence shows a cohesive community convinced,before the trial,of the guilt of the defendant and thus unable to afford goss a fair trial.aplt.br.at.therefore,he argues,the trial court abused its discretion in denying a change of venue.
importantly,however,goss has not argued that the jury actually selected was,in fact,prejudiced.indeed,goss exercised his peremptory challenges and passed the jury for cause,and did not object to the seating of any particular juror.rather,his argument is that the pervasive pretrial publicity and evidence of community sentiment at jury selection demonstrate any jury from meade county would be presumptively prejudiced.
supreme court framework 
the united states supreme court has examined due process concerns stemming from pretrial publicity in two contexts.the first context occurs where the pretrial publicity is so pervasive and prejudicial that we can not expect to find an unbiased jury pool in the community.we presume prejudice before trial in those cases,and a venue change is necessary.the second context is where the effect of pretrial publicity manifested at jury selection is so substantial as to taint the entire jury pool.
pretrial publicity 
the supreme court has found presumed prejudice based on pretrial publicity in only three cases,all dating from the.in the first,rideau louisiana,d,the court found such widespread community exposure to the defendant and his his locally televised it need not even reach the jury selection stage to conclude that a change of venue was necessary a ny subsequent court proceedings in a community so pervasively exposed to such a spectacle could be but a hollow formality.id.at.
in the second case,estes texas,d,the court reversed a conviction where the jury pool was first exposed to extensive televised pretrial publicity,which was then followed by a atmosphere at trial due to television cameras in the courtroom.at.
the final case where prejudice was presumed on publicity grounds alone is sheppard maxwell,d.in that case,the supreme court reversed the conviction of an ohio doctor for the murder of his wife after finding his trial corrupted by the massive,pervasive and prejudicial publicity that attended the defendant prosecution.at.the court based its conclusion on both the publicity itself and the trial judge failure to insulate the defendant from the impact of the publicity,as exemplified by the court statement that bedlam reigned at the courthouse during the trial and newsmen took over practically the entire courtroom,hounding most of the participants in the trial,especially sheppard.id.at.
to be sure,cases where the courts presume prejudice based on pretrial publicity alone are rare.the key in those cases,the supreme court has explained,is that the influence of the news media,either in the community at large or in the courtroom itself,pervaded the proceedings the proceedings in those cases were entirely lacking in the solemnity and sobriety to which a defendant is entitled in a system that subscribes to any notion of fairness and rejects the verdict of a mob.murphy florida,d.
in this circuit,in summarizing these cases,we held that prejudice will only be presumed where publicity created either a circus atmosphere in the court room or a lynch mob mentality such that it would be impossible to receive a fair trial.hale gibson,cir.in other words,
t o demonstrate that prejudice should be presumed,the defendant must establish that an irrepressibly hostile attitude pervaded the community simply showing that all the potential jurors knew about the case and that there was extensive pretrial publicity will not suffice to demonstrate that an irrepressibly hostile attitude pervaded the community.this presumed prejudice is rarely invoked and only in extreme circumstances.
id.quoting stafford saffle,cir.in hale,we went on to find no pretrial prejudice since the bulk of the press coverage occurred seven months prior to trial,even though of potential jurors had prior knowledge of the case.
jury selection 
another line of supreme court cases looks to the effect of pretrial publicity on jury selection to determine whether,in fact,it had such a pervasive effect so as to deny the seating of a fair jury.the first major case examining the effect of pretrial publicity on jury selection is irvin dowd,supra.in irvin,the court looked at the results of jury selection and found a biased jury pool arising from a barrage of newspaper headlines,articles,cartoons and pictures that was unleashed against the defendant during the six or seven months preceding his trial.at.the print and broadcast publicity preceding trial revealed prejudicial details of the defendant background,including a reference to a crime committed as a juvenile,his prior convictions for arson,and his confession to six murders,including the murder for which he was convicted in the case.id.at.examining the selection process,the court emphasized that the trial court had excused of veniremen for cause due to fixed opinions as to the guilt of the defendant an astounding of prospective jurors when asked,entertained some opinion as to in intensity from mere suspicion to absolute certainty and most damaging,eight of twelve jurors actually seated thought defendant was guilty.id.at.
in a trilogy of more recent cases,the supreme court has refined the application of irvin to claims of biased jury pools.in the first case,murphy florida,supra,the court rejected a presumed prejudice claim because the largely factual publicity in the record appeared several months before trial and its effect on jury selection appeared to be relatively modest the trial court excused for cause only twenty of potential jurors due to an opinion as to the defendant guilt.id.at.similarly,in patton yount,supra,the court declined to find presumed prejudice even where pretrial publicity revealed inadmissible information such as defendant prior conviction for murder and his confession over three quarters of potential jurors admitted they would carry an opinion as to defendant guilt into the jury box and eight of the fourteen jurors and alternates actually seated admitted that,at some time,they had formed an opinion as to the defendant guilt.id.at.the court found that even daily coverage of the voir dire was not critical since it was purely factual and since there was no barrage of inflammatory publicity immediately prior to trial.id.at.finally,in virginia,d,the court discounted claims of media coverage even where eight of twelve seated jurors had read or heard something about the case prior to trial.
these two lines of cases establish that while substantial adverse pretrial publicity can create such a presumption of prejudice in a community that the jurors claims that they can be impartial should not be believed,patton,at,they do not stand for the proposition that juror exposure to news accounts of the crime with which the defendant is charged alone presumptively deprives the defendant of due process.murphy,at.interpreting this precedent,we noted in the oklahoma city bombing case,where media scrutiny was at its zenith,the following 
i n order for the reviewing court to reach a presumption that inflammatory pretrial publicity so permeated the community as to render impossible the seating of an impartial jury,the court must find that the publicity in essence displaced the judicial process,thereby denying the defendant his constitutional right to a fair trial.
united states mcveigh,cir.in those circumstances,we simply can not rely on jurors claims that they can be impartial and must declare the publicity to be prejudicial as a matter of law.id.at quoting patton,at.but,as we also noted in mcveigh,despite the proliferation of the news media and its technology,the supreme court has not found a single case of presumed prejudice in this country since the watershed case of sheppard in.id.
application 
while significant,the facts of this case do not meet the high hurdle established by supreme court precedent for finding presumed prejudice.goss contends the kansas supreme court decision was an unreasonable application of the relevant precedent in two related ways,which parallel the two lines of cases detailed above.he argues the decision failed to adequately consider the sense of community outrage and prejudice generated by the publicity prior to trial,and discounted the effect of the publicity on potential jurors at jury selection.in goss view,consideration of the totality of the circumstances shows a cohesive community convinced,before the trial,of the guilt of the defendant.aplt.br.at.we discuss and reject his contentions below.
prejudice prior to trial 
little doubt exists that the murder of janice amerin and the subsequent manhunt for and capture of goss generated substantial press coverage and community interest.the murder occurred in a rural community.it was the first homicide in seventy years.the victim was a member of a local farm family.the manhunt following the murder involved numerous local law enforcement officers and residents.
following the crime,a number of articles were published about the murder and manhunt.some articles that appeared between the murder and goss capture mentioned goss prior criminal record,concerns about the parole process evidenced by goss release from prison only eleven days before the crime,and the prosecution goal of putting goss in prison for life.another article around the time of goss capture quoted the judge who would later preside over goss trial in a manner that suggested the judge was already convinced of goss guilt.the judge was commenting about a potential parolee in an unrelated case and his propensity for violence.he stated,i do see the potential parolee as the kind of guy who going to go out and commit further acts of violence,but i did see goss that way,either.at.this trial judge also recognized the high level of publicity surrounding goss case,referring to it as extraordinary.at.other articles revealed raw sentiments by local residents.for instance,an article that appeared in a hutchinson,kansas newspaper quoted a resident stating,if they find him i hope he shoot himself or they shoot him.at.
the case also acquired statewide publicity when it became an issue in the kansas gubernatorial campaign.a challenger to the incumbent governor produced a campaign brochure using the crime as an example of lax parole standards.the brochure concluded goss was guilty of murder.the brochure also referred to goss as a walking time bomb and provided details of the killing.at.although the brochure was not distributed to voters in meade county,local papers quoted it in stories about the gubernatorial race.the campaign flap led the meade county attorney to state at the time,i do know what going on in this case.it kind of turning into a circus with no help from me this case has taken on a life of its own.at.
press coverage of the case diminished after the election.following the election and goss arraignment in early november,no press coverage reoccurred until goss second preliminary hearing in february,four months after the crime.only one article about the hearing appeared in the meade globe press a weekly newspaper,and three appeared in the daily newspaper published in hutchinson,kansas.although primarily factual,one article quoted testimony from the hearing attributing to goss various jail house statements regarding janice amerin,such as i f she does come back to me,i kill her,he get even with her and he would bury the bitch.at.in another article,the county attorney was quoted as saying 
there is something i sure like for everyone to know.people seem to be automatically assuming that the trial will be moved elsewhere.the fact is that a potential juror will not be dismissed just because he is familiar with the case.potential jurors must simply be able to say that they will objectively listen to the evidence and will render a fair and impartial verdict.we could still have this trial right here in meade county.
following this press coverage in february,no further articles about the case were published prior to the trial in october.
in our independent assessment of united states supreme court precedent,goss has not shown that the kansas supreme court decision was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the united states supreme court.d.as we discussed above,it is not enough for a defendant to show juror exposure to news accounts.murphy florida,d.rather,the defendant must show a trial atmosphere that had been utterly corrupted by press coverage.id.at.
goss argument implicates two legally relevant factors a the nature of the publicity and its temporal nexus to the trial,and b the effect of the publicity on the potential jury pool.examining these factors,singularly and collectively,goss can not meet this standard.
nature of the publicity and its temporal nexus to trial 
nothing about the press coverage here suggests the corruptive and pervasive media blitz the supreme court has required to presume prejudice.first,while the record contains n
