opinion of the court 
the trustee in the chapter bankruptcy proceedings of andrew bressman debtor appeals the district court affirmance of the bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment to appellees,attorneys newman greenberg,the law offices of robert hill schwartz together,newman schwartz,and cole,schotz,meisel,forman leonard,cole schotz.the trustee seeks to recover certain funds received by appellees as counsel fees.we will affirm the judgment of the district court.
in july,the debtor filed voluntarily for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code.the bankruptcy court approved cole schotz to represent the debtor as.on june,the chapter proceedings were converted to chapter proceedings.cole schotz continued to represent the debtor in the bankruptcy proceedings,but as counsel for the debtor.upon his appointment,the trustee engaged the same litigation counsel that had represented the creditors committee since the beginning of the chapter proceeding.
upon the conversion to chapter,cole schotz advised the debtor that all payments for future services would have to be paid from sources.it thereafter received four fee payments a check from the savings account of stefanie bressman,the debtor wife,on august,a check from stefanie pnc checking account on october,a check from the same account on december,and a check from pas realty,a firm owned by the debtor father,on january.it is only the december,check for that is at issue here.on november,and january,cole schotz filed certifications with the bankruptcy court in accordance with of the code reporting these fees for representing the debtor out and their source 
in the summer of,the securities and exchange commission commenced disciplinary proceedings against the debtor as a result of his activities as president and of baron,a securities firm,which had also declared bankruptcy.in august,stefanie bressman hired newman schwartz to provide representation for the debtor in the proceedings as well as in any criminal proceedings that might ensue.the retention agreement required bressman to pay newman schwartz a retainer of and to make that payment and all ensuing payments of their fees with assets.at that time,stefanie and the debtor assured the attorneys responsible for the firm representation that stefanie came from a family of substantial financial means and had adequate assets,separate from the debtor,with which to pay for the representation.three days after she entered the retention agreement,stefanie caused to be wire transferred from her personal account at chase bank to newman schwartz.the investigation led to a state court indictment of the debtor for a variety of crimes.upon newman schwartz advice,the debtor exercised his fifth amendment right against self incrimination in both the criminal case and the bankruptcy proceedings.eventually,the debtor pled guilty to fraud and grand larceny.
between august,and august,newman schwartz was paid an additional for services rendered to the debtor.with the exception of one payment received from his mother,each payment came from stefanie.these payments are not at issue here.rather,the trustee seeks to recover six payments received by the firm from stefanie personal account at pnc bank between november,and december.
more than a year before his bankruptcy,the debtor established a trust in the cook islands.the debtor contingent interest in this trust was disclosed in the schedules filed with the bankruptcy court on july,and the debtor testified concerning the terms of this trust at a hearing twenty days later that was attended by counsel for the creditors committee.
between november and december,six wire transfers totaling passed from the cook islands trust to bressman personal account.on the business day following each of the six transfers,stefanie paid a substantial portion of the amount transferred to cole schotz and newman schwartz in satisfaction of bills for their respective representations of the debtor.the six payments made to newman schwartz totaled.
the trustee,after his appointment on june,continued the efforts of the creditors committee to identify and recover assets of the estate.on december,he instituted this suit against stefanie,other family members and numerous firms to recover the assets of the cook islands trust for the estate.the complaint was amended to seek recovery of the fees paid to newman schwartz and to cole schotz on may.the claims against all other defendants were settled without a determination of whether the trust was part of the debtor estate.
the trustee and the law firms filed for summary judgment.in support of their motions and in opposition to the trustee,the law firms filed affidavits of the responsible attorneys,which set forth the facts recounted above and averred that they had no knowledge that the cook islands trust was the source of the funds used by stefanie to pay the fees at issue.neither questioned stefanie about the source of the funds because they believed they had no reason to do so.
in response to these affidavits,the trustee filed an affidavit of his counsel.with respect to cole schotz,he described correspondence between that firm and himself in which he had inquired concerning the source of the fees being paid to cole schotz.this correspondence culminated in a letter to cole schotz on november,which stated in part as follows 
i am in receipt of your supplemental certification,dated november,acknowledging that,since the conversion of the within bankruptcy proceedings to chapter,your firm has received approximately from stefanie bressman in payment of fees incurred by your firm in connection with the within bankruptcy proceedings.
i know that you are fully aware of the pending adversary proceeding against stefanie bressman,seeking recovery of funds transferred to bressman as fraudulent conveyances.the purpose of this letter is to advise you that wasserman,as bankruptcy trustee,will likely be forced to seek disgorgement of the fees paid to your firm by stephanie sic bressman if it is ultimately determined that such fees are the fruit of fraudulent conveyances by bressman.please be guided accordingly.

with respect to newman schwartz,trustee counsel stressed the following telephone conversation with one of the firm attorneys who represented the debtor in the criminal proceedings 
on october,i received a telephone call from richard greenberg,of newman schwartz,concerning the trustee rule subpoena.greenberg wanted to know a why the trustee was interested in the source of newman schwartz fees and b whether newman was required to appear for a deposition of october.
in response,i advised greenberg that the trustee was investigating whether his firm had received payment from funds or assets that constituted property of andrew bressman bankruptcy estate and that the trustee would seek disgorgement of any fees paid from estate property.greenberg stated this his firm had not received payment from andrew bressman.i responded that the mere fact that the payments were not received from andrew bressman did not mean that newman schwartz was not paid with estate assets.
app.iv at tab.
before the bankruptcy court,the trustee contended that the challenged fee payments were unauthorized transfers recoverable under and.he further asserted that newman schwartz had violated by failing to report the challenged fee payments to the bankruptcy court and that both firms had violated and by receiving funds of the debtor estate without court approval.according to the trustee,these violations of,and required that the challenged fees be disgorged.
the bankruptcy court assumed without deciding that the trust was an asset of the bankrupt estate.it held that,even making this assumption,and were not applicable to the situation before it and that the only remedies potentially available to the trustee were authorized by and.it further ruled,however,that the firms were transferees for value,in good faith,and without knowledge of the voidability of the transfer within the meaning of b.the law firms affidavits provided prima facie evidence that they had no reason to know that the challenged fees came from the trust and the trustee had not satisfied its burden of producing sufficient evidence to support a contrary inference.on appeal,the district court affirmed.
the trustee advances the same arguments before us,urging that we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand with instructions to enter summary judgment for the trustee.
section a of the bankruptcy code authorizes the trustee to avoid transfers of property of the estate that are not authorized by the code or an order of the bankruptcy court.section a provides that,to the extent a transfer is avoided under a,the trustee may recover the property transferred or its value from the initial transferee or from any subsequent transferee.under b,however a trustee may not recover an otherwise avoidable transfer from a subsequent transferee that takes for value,in good faith,and without knowledge of the voidability of the transfer avoided.we may assume arguendo for present purposes that b creates an affirmative defense with respect to which the transferee has the burden of persuasion,as held by the sixth circuit court of appeals in in re nordic village,cir,rev on other grounds,d 
the trustee acknowledges that the firms took for value.he insists,however,that the law firms were on inquiry notice that the original source of stefanie payments was the trust,that the trust assets were a part of the estate,and accordingly that the transfers were voidable.like the bankruptcy court and the district court,we will assume in our analysis of the trustee arguments that the trust was an estate asset.we accept,as the controlling law,the precepts articulated in the following quotation from the trustee brief quoting from in re sherman,cir 
no one supposes that knowledge of voidability means complete understanding of the facts and receipt of a lawyer opinion that such a transfer is voidable some lesser knowledge will do.bonded fin,cir citations omitted accordingly,we believe that a transferee has knowledge if he knew facts that would lead a reasonable person to believe that the property transferred was recoverable.in re nordic village,cir quoting smith,at,rev on other grounds sub nom.united states nordic village,d.in this vein,some facts suggest the underlying presence of other facts.if a transferee possesses knowledge of facts that suggest a transfer may be fraudulent,and further inquiry by the transferee would reveal facts sufficient to alert him that the property is recoverable,he can not sit on his heels,thereby preventing a finding that he has knowledge.in such a situation,the transferee is held to have knowledge of the voidability of the transfer.in re agricultural research technology group,cir bonded fin,at in re goodwin.

we will,however,supplement this quotation with the following observations of the court in bonded financial services european american bank,cir,from which the sherman court took its law 
some facts strongly suggest the presence of others a recipient that closes its eyes to the remaining facts may not deny knowledge.see bosco serhant,cir.but this is not the same as a duty to investigate,to be a monitor for creditors benefit when nothing known so far suggests that there is a fraudulent conveyance in the chain.knowledge is a stronger term than notice,see smith mixon,at.a transferee that lacks the information necessary to support an inference of knowledge need not start investigating on his own.
it is undoubtedly true,as the trustee insists,that he put the firms on notice just prior to their receipt of the challenged payments that he was investigating whether they were being paid from estate assets and would seek to recover them if his investigation revealed that they were.this does not mean,however,that the giving of such notice gave them knowledge of the voidability or imposed a duty on them to initiate their own investigation.rather,the issue is whether the facts known to the firms and the reasonable inference to be drawn from those facts would affirmatively suggest to a reasonable person in their position that they were receiving assets of the estate.if not,there would be no duty to investigate.
having determined the applicable substantive law,we turn to the law of summary judgment and the application thereof to the record before us.summary judgment is appropriate only where the court is satisfied that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.insofar as the trustee motion for summary judgment is concerned,the law firms burden in opposing that motion,even assuming they have the trial burden of persuasion on the issue,is simply to come forward with evidence which,if believed,would support a finding in its favor or,stated otherwise,such evidence as would entitle it to successfully resist a motion for a directed verdict.united states v.one acre parcel of land,cir.the affidavits filed by the law firms clearly satisfied this burden,and it follows that the trustee is not entitled to summary judgment on the record before us.
turning to the law firms motions for summary judgment and assuming,again,that they have the burden of proof on the issue,they had the burden of supporting their motions with credible evidence that would entitle them to a directed verdict if not controverted at trial.celotex catrett,d brennan,dissenting anchorage assocs.bd.of tax review,cir chaplin nationscredit,cir to obtain summary judgment,if the movant bears the burden of proof on an issue because as a defendant he is asserting an affirmative defense,he must establish beyond peradventure all of the essential elements of the defense to warrant judgment in his favor.quoting from cir united states four parcels of real property,cir when the moving party has the burden of proof at trial,that party must show affirmatively the absence of a genuine issue of material fact it must show that,on all the essential elements of its case on which it bears the burden of proof at trial,no reasonable jury could find for the party.see also state bank fed.reserve bank,cir moore,federal practice.once a moving party with the burden of proof makes such an affirmative showing,it is entitled to summary judgment unless the party comes forward with probative evidence that would demonstrate the existence of a triable issue of fact.e four parcels,supra.
the most difficult issue here is whether the law firms support for their motions was sufficient to meet this concededly high standard and thereby put the burden on the trustee to come forward with evidence demonstrating that there is a genuine issue for trial.while we think it is a close issue,we conclude that this burden has been met.
it is,of course,true that the probative value of the law firms denial of relevant knowledge depends on the credibility of their witnesses.but their testimony finds substantial corroborating evidence in the record and,in the absence of any contrary evidence,we believe it would have to be accepted by a reasonable jury.
the record demonstrates that the members of each firm handling their respective representations were sophisticated,experienced lawyers who understood the risk entailed in being paid with estate assets and specifically focused on that issue.this is corroborated in the case of newman schwartz by the fact that the responsible attorney insisted in the representation agreement on receiving payment for their services from assets.in the case of cole schotz,corroboration comes from the fact that the firm changed its arrangement with the debtor for the payment of its fees upon the conversion of the chapter proceeding to a chapter proceeding.
the record also demonstrates that each firm anticipated providing a very substantial amount of legal services in the course of its representation.investing those services while having knowledge that they were being paid with estate assets involved a risk of loss that it is economically unrealistic to attribute to the firms.the firms conduct in making the investment of their services in their respective representations thus corroborates their sworn denial of knowledge.because of that corroboration,we believe a reasonable jury could not
