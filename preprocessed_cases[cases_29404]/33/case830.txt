introduction 
qui tam plaintiff nora armenta and plaintiffs east bay municipal utility district,city and county of san francisco,and city of santa monica petition for a writ of mandate commanding the superior court to vacate its order of march,and enter a new and different order prohibiting most of that which the march order permits real parties in interest james jones company,mueller,tyco international us,and watts industries,to do.petitioners contend that california law precludes real parties in interest from interviewing and retaining experts who are privy to armenta confidential information.in addition,they contend,armenta has a valid work product interest in richard preston maas reports,an interest that los angeles department of water and power counsel had no authority to waive.for the reasons stated post,we agree and grant the petition for a writ of mandate.
factual and procedural background 
on january,petitioner nora armenta armenta filed a second amended complaint for violation of the california false claims act,et.armenta,a former employee of james jones company jones,alleges on behalf of the los angeles department of water and power ladwp and other municipal water systems that jones,mueller,tyco international us,tyco,and watts industries,watts sold the water systems water valves,fittings and other metal water distribution parts that did not meet contract specifications.the parts that jones sold contained significantly higher levels of lead and zinc than called for in the specifications.as a consequence,lead levels in the water supply possibly could rise and the parts could degrade prematurely.
in april,armenta counsel retained richard preston maas maas as an expert on lead leaching from bronze water distribution parts.in may,ladwp also retained maas.maas thereafter served as armenta and ladwp joint expert.he produced several reports and memoranda for ladwp concerning the status and results of lead leaching tests he performed.these reports and memoranda,although paid for by ladwp,addressed as well the concerns and views of armenta counsel.
in order to protect the work product of their collaborative relationship,counsel for armenta and ladwp executed a joint prosecution agreement that became effective on january,before either party retained maas.the agreement confirms a mutuality of interest in a common and joint prosecution of the action.its purpose is to ensure that the exchanges and disclosures of plaintiffs materials contemplated by the agreement do not diminish in any way the confidentiality of plaintiffs materials and do not constitute a waiver of any privilege otherwise available.the agreement expresses the parties intention and understanding that communications among us and any joint interviews of prospective witnesses are confidential and are protected from disclosure to any third party by our clients respective privilege and our own privilege.
the agreement further provides that i n order to pursue this joint prosecution of the action effectively we have also concluded that,from time to time,the mutual interests of our respective clients will best be served by sharing documents,factual material,mental impressions,strategies,legal theories,memoranda,interview reports,and other information,including the confidences of each client,all of which will hereinafter be referred to as plaintiffs materials.in the absence of such sharing,these plaintiffs materials would be privileged from disclosure to adverse or other parties as a result of the privilege,the attorney privilege or other applicable privileges.the agreement specifically applies to plaintiffs materials received from other counsel or jointly obtained by any one counsel on behalf of the other counsel.italics added.
the agreement continues in effect regardless of any conclusion or resolution of the action with respect to any party whose counsel is a signatory to this agreement or with respect to all parties.counsel agree that they and their clients will continue to be bound by the agreement following any conclusion or resolution of the action.
maas and counsel for armenta consulted extensively with two other experts that ladwp retained,exponent,and stephen rothenberg rothenberg.exponent,analyzed the results of maas testing,conferred with counsel about the anticipated use of maas data at trial,and discussed confidential work product information about litigation theories and tactics.exponent,prepared written reports.rothenberg,a toxicologist retained as a consulting expert,with whom counsel discussed litigation theories and strategy,did not prepare written reports.
on october,ladwp sought the trial court approval of a settlement with real parties in interest to which ladwp had agreed.article,paragraph of the settlement agreement states that ladwp will provide to real parties all data,reports and studies generated or developed by or on behalf of the ladwp and its retained experts or consultants in connection with the action,whether developed before or after the ladwp filed its.the materials to be produced to real parties include all documents which reflect any analysis,opinions data related to the ladwp and developed by or on behalf of the ladwp experts or consultants in connection with the action 
ladwp took the position that it independently sought and procured test results,reports and other data produced by maas,exponent,and rothenberg.in ladwp view,these materials thus were exempt from the joint prosecution agreement,which provides in paragraph four that nothing contained herein shall limit the right of any counsel to disclose any document or information obtained from that counsel client or any information that has been independently obtained by such counsel.italics added.moreover,ladwp argued,inasmuch as ladwp counsel always had represented that she intended to disclose the test results,neither party to the joint prosecution agreement could claim work product privilege in these materials.finally,as ladwp understood the law,the california public records act,et superseded the joint prosecution agreement.petitioners opposed the motion.
at the october,hearing on the motion to approve the settlement agreement,petitioners disputed ladwp assertion that it had always indicated its intent to make all test results public.petitioners noted that the only time ladwp counsel stated she would disclose test results,she was referring to tests conducted by ladwp personnel.in petitioners view,there never had been any contemplation that the product of joint experts would be disclosed before the conclusion of the litigation.petitioners would agree to public disclosure of joint experts test results only if real parties in interest were prohibited from using the results in the litigation.
the court did not dispute that maas reports were covered by the joint prosecution agreement.it accepted,instead,the argument that the public records act required a governmental agency settling a case to make public documents underlying the decision to settle.the court asked,accordingly,c an a joint prosecution agreement trump the public records act in the court view,ladwp had a responsibility to the people they represent to say,we did this because it is safe,we thought this was the way to go,and we are not jeopardizing the health of the people who reside in the city of los angeles by engaging in this type of settlement.
the court overruled petitioners objections to the settlement agreement.it ruled that t he information sought can be produced and may be produced.it stayed execution on the implementation of the dissemination of that information for days to give the interested parties an opportunity to bring a protective order motion.the court inclination was to permit complete dissemination of the information,but do that in the framework of timing of exchange of expert information.in other words,the information would be turned over at the same time the exchange of expert information and all of that comes forward.
real parties in interest objected to delayed disclosure,in part on the ground that they were unable to duplicate the tests the experts performed.they presented their objections at a december,heari
