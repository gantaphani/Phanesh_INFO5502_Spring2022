plaintiff,a deputy public defender,was investigated by his employer,the county,upon allegations that he had made deceptive statements to the court while representing a criminal defendant.during each of several attempts to interview plaintiff in the matter,a supervising attorney directed plaintiff to answer questions about the incident,told plaintiff that his refusal to cooperate would be deemed insubordination warranting discipline up to and including dismissal,but advised no use in a criminal proceeding,criminal use could be made of his answers.nonetheless,on advice of counsel,plaintiff declined to answer,invoking his privilege against compelled under both the federal and state constitutions,cl.cal,art.i.he was terminated from employment on grounds of the deceptive court conduct,and for disobeying the employer orders to answer questions.
plaintiff sought mandate to obtain reinstatement,urging,among other things,that he could not be compelled,on pain of dismissal,to answer potentially incriminating questions unless he received,in advance,a formal grant of immunity from direct or derivative use of his answers in any criminal case against him.the trial court upheld the termination,but the court of appeal reversed.the appellate court found substantial evidence that plaintiff had engaged in deceptive court conduct.however,it agreed with plaintiff contention that,having invoked his constitutional right against,he could not be compelled,by threat of job discipline,to answer his employer questions unless his constitutional privilege was first supplanted by an affirmative grant of criminal use immunity coextensive with the constitutional protection.we granted review to address the latter issue.
we conclude that the court of appeal erred.united states supreme court decisions,followed for decades both in california and elsewhere,establish that a public employee may be compelled,by threat of job discipline,to answer questions about the employee job performance,so long as the employee is not required,on pain of dismissal,to waive the constitutional protection against criminal use of those answers.here,plaintiff was not ordered to choose between his constitutional rights and his job.on the contrary,he was truthfully told that,in fact,no criminal use could be made of any answers he gave under compulsion by the employer.in the context of a noncriminal public employment investigation,the employer was not further required to seek,obtain,and confer a formal guarantee of immunity before requiring its employee to answer questions related to that investigation.
accordingly,we will reverse the judgment of the court of appeal.
facts and procedure 
in january,plaintiff,a santa clara county deputy public defender,represented michael dignan on charges of ammunition possession by a felon.troy boyd had been arrested with dignan,but not detained.plaintiff proposed to introduce,on dignan behalf,boyd statement to the police that his parents owned the house where the ammunition was found,and he had rented it since he was years old.the apparent purpose of the proffered statement was to raise a reasonable doubt about control of the area in which the contraband had been discovered.but the statement efficacy for that purpose depended,as the court of appeal noted,on its ambiguity and incompleteness as boyd later explained,he did rent the house from his parents,but he sublet portions of it to others,including dignan.thus,if boyd were on the witness stand,the true context of his statement would likely be revealed.
the prosecutor moved in limine to exclude boyd extrajudicial statement as inadmissible hearsay.a hearing on the motion took place on monday,january,before judge tielh.the prosecutor argued the defense could not claim boyd unavailability as the basis for a hearsay exception,because there was no evidence the defense had exercised due diligence to procure boyd presence at trial.when the court asked plaintiff what hearsay exception would apply,plaintiff said he had not sent out an investigator to look for boyd in part because boyd has a warrant for his arrest.and if the san jose police are not going to be able to find boyd,i think that my investigator is going to be very hard put to find an individual who is avoiding contact with anybody that has to do with the judicial system.
plaintiff presented a warrant for boyd and argued that this met his burden of showing boyd was unavailable.plaintiff urged that exclusion of boyd statement would deprive his client of a critical defense.plaintiff further represented that boyd had experienced problems with the law and avoided all contact with authority figures.ultimately,the court ruled in limine that boyd hearsay statement would be admitted.
plaintiff then requested the jury be instructed that boyd was a fugitive,so jurors would not wonder why he had failed to call boyd.when the prosecutor remarked that this was a good question,because plaintiff had exerted no effort to find boyd,plaintiff responded that he wanted to tell the jury he had not done so because boyd got a warrant for his arrest and he ducking.plaintiff indicated he intended to move the arrest warrant into evidence in order to explain boyd absence.
three days after this court hearing,a police sergeant went to the house in question,where he found boyd.boyd told the officer he had recently spoken to a public defender investigator.confronted in court with this information,plaintiff indicated it was he who had spoken with boyd.plaintiff related that on sunday,january,day before he claimed in court that boyd was an unavailable went to the house to take photographs,where he found boyd with a group watching the super bowl.according to plaintiff,he carried no subpoena because he did not expect boyd to be there.plaintiff also said boyd had indicated he would not cooperate in being served and did not wish to testify.plaintiff maintained that his accidental encounter with boyd was attorney work product,which he had no obligation to disclose.
the prosecutor argued that plaintiff had made an affirmative misrepresentation to the court.without ruling on this assertion,the court,per judge tielh,determined that boyd was an available witness,and that this would be considered in passing upon any trial objection to the admission of boyd hearsay statement.
in late february or early march,chief assistant public defender david mann learned of this incident.mann was told that the prosecutor in the dignan case was getting transcripts in the matter and wanted to go after plaintiff in some fashion.when mann contacted the district attorney office,he was advised that three options were being file misdemeanor charges against plaintiff,to report him to the state bar,or to leave it to the public defender office to handle.
deciding not to wait for the district attorney decision,mann initiated an internal investigation on april,plaintiff appeared with his counsel,zacharias ledet,for an interview in the matter.also present were joe guzman,supervisor of the felony division of the public defender office,and a departmental investigator,alayne bolster.when bolster asked plaintiff to describe his conversation with boyd,ledet interjected that plaintiff refused to answer on grounds of protection afforded him by the federal and state constitutions and the laws of california.
guzman responded by addressing the following to plaintiff tom,you have a right to remain silent and not incriminate yourself.your silence,however,may be deemed insubordination,leading to administrative discipline up to and including termination.any statement made during this interview can not,and i emphasize can not,be used against you in any subsequent criminal proceeding.italics added.
ledet retorted that the protection against penal use asserted by guzman only applied to peace officers,and that guzman advisement thus afforded plaintiff no protection unless you receive a ruling from a court of law.guzman then stated he wanted to make clear that this is not a criminal proceeding this is an employee investigation what we do here stays within the public defender office.this is not going to be sent to the da office,okay.what i saying is,anything you say at this meeting can not be used against you in a criminal proceeding.so you are directed to answer the questions and your refusal to answer the questions will be deemed as insubordination.these points were reiterated in full later in the interview.through ledet,plaintiff continued to object.
a second interview,with ledet present,occurred on april.guzman advised that,because this was an internal investigation,plaintiff did not have a right to refuse to answer,and that such refusal would be insubordination warranting discipline up to and including termination,but that any information plaintiff provides in this particular interview can not and will not be used against him in a criminal case.ledet responded that guzman had provided no authority for his assurances,and that cases cited in correspondence between the parties were concerned only with peace officers.
at the conclusion of this meeting,ledet asserted that guzman had exhausted his right under governing personnel policies to interview plaintiff,and that further efforts to do so would be unreasonable.ledet further stated that plaintiff would continue to invoke his rights not to answer.
on june,mann recommended plaintiff termination on three civil service grounds insubordination stemming from plaintiff refusal to answer investigators questions,gross misconduct unbecoming a county officer stemming from the dignan incident,and seeking,in violation of office rules governing attorney ethics,to mislead a court by artifice or false statement.plaintiff sought a prediscipline administrative hearing.see skelly state personnel bd.cal d.the hearing officer sustained the charges and discipline,as did the county personnel board.
plaintiff sought mandamus relief in the superior court.among other things,he insisted he could not be dismissed for refusing,on grounds of his constitutional right against,to answer his employer potentially incriminating questions unless he received,in advance,a formal grant of criminal use immunity.the court denied the petition,ruling that substantial evidence supported the charges and discipline,and that defendant was not entitled to formal immunity before being compelled to answer his employer questions.
the court of appeal reversed.the appellate court found substantial evidence supporting the charge that plaintiff representation of dignan involved deceptive conduct unbecoming a county officer and tending to discredit his office however,the court agreed with plaintiff contention that a public employee must receive a formal grant of criminal use immunity before being required,on pain of discipline,to answer potentially incriminating official questions about his or her job performance.
hence,the court of appeal held,the employer mere advisements and assurances that plaintiff statements could not be used criminally were insufficient to permit compulsion of his answers.the discipline imposed,the court noted,was based in part on a erroneous in the court plaintiff insubordination for refusing to answer,and it was not clear he otherwise would have been terminated.accordingly,the court of appeal reversed the superior court judgment with directions to issue a writ of mandamus directing the county personnel board to vacate and reconsider its decision in light of the views expressed.
we granted review,limited to the following issue when a public employee invokes his or her fifth amendment right against in a public employer investigation of the employee conduct,must the public employer offer immunity from any criminal use of the employee statements before it can dismiss the employee for refusing to answer questions in connection with the investigation turning to that question,we conclude that the answer is no.
discussion 
the fifth amendment to the united states constitution declares that n o person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself italics added.the california constitution similarly provides that p ersons may not be compelled in a criminal cause to be a witness against themselves cal,art.i,italics added.
the constitutional guarantee against compelled protects an individual from being forced to testify against himself or herself in a pending criminal proceeding,but it does more than that.it also privileges a person not to answer official questions in any other proceeding,civil or criminal,formal or informal,where he or she reasonably believes the answers might incriminate him or her in a criminal case.lefkowitz turley,d turley see kastigar united states,d kastigar.one can not be forced to choose between forfeiting the privilege,on the one hand,or asserting it and suffering a penalty for doing so on the other.malloy hogan,d.
in many instances,of course,it is necessary or highly desirable to procure citizens answers to official questions,including their formal testimony under oath.in such circumstances,an individual invocation of the privilege against would frustrate legitimate governmental objectives.in light of the competing interests,it is well established that incriminating answers may be officially compelled,without violating the privilege,when the person to be examined receives immunity coextensive with the scope of the privilege,immunity against both direct and derivative criminal use of the statements.kastigar,supra.see murphy waterfront comm,d.in such cases,refusals to answer are unjustified,for the grant of immunity has removed the dangers against which the privilege protects.citation.kastigar,supra,at.
official compulsion,for purposes of the privilege,is not limited to court process,and may include a public employer threat to dismiss an employee for refusing to answer potentially incriminating questions.garrity new jersey,d garrity.thus,the law is clear that incriminating answers coerced from a public employee under threat of dismissal can not be used against the employee in a criminal proceeding,at.this is so even where the employee received no advance grant of formal immunity.see,at.
on the other hand,the constitutional privilege against compelled in a criminal case or cause,cal,art.i,does not protect against the nonpenal adverse use of officially compelled answers,segretti state bar cal d,blackburn superior court th,d.thus,incriminating answers given by a public employee under threat of job sanction for refusal to answer may themselves form the basis for job discipline,including termination,so long as the employee has requisite protection against the criminal use of such statements.
the united states supreme court has been less than clear about the minimum circumstances under which one may be officially compelled,over his or her constitutional objection,to give incriminating answers for nonpenal use.in adams maryland.adams,a federal statute provided that testimony before a congressional committee could not be used criminally against the witness.nonetheless,the defendant,who had been summoned to answer questions before a senate investigating committee,was convicted of maryland charges on the basis of his confession before the committee that he ran a gambling business in that state.
seeking to uphold the conviction,the state urged,among other things,that the defendant had waived the statutory protection by failing,before the committee,to claim his constitutional privilege against.the high court responded that no language of the statute requires such a claim in order for a witness to feel secure that his testimony will not be used to convict him of a crime.adams,supra.indeed,the court noted,such an interpretation would render the statute superfluous,for a witness does not need any statute to protect him from the criminal use of testimony he is compelled to give over his objection.the fifth amendment takes care of that without a statute,italics added.
however,other supreme court cases contain language that might suggest that one subjected to coercive official questioning in a noncriminal setting may insist on the constitutional privilege,without fear of sanction,until the privilege is supplanted,and thus removed,by the authorized grant or conferral of an immunity coextensive with the privilege itself,chavez martinez,d plur.opn.of thomas,chavez witness may insist on immunity agreement before being compelled to give testimony in noncriminal case lefkowitz cunningham,d cunningham government can not penalize assertion of the constitutional privilege against compelled by imposing sanctions to compel testimony which has not been immunized turley,supra.witness protected by the privilege may rightfully refuse to answer unless and until he is protected at least against the use of his compelled answers and evidence derived therefrom in any subsequent criminal case in which he is a defendant stevens marks,d witness has constitutional right to stand on the privilege against until it has been fairly demonstrated to him that an immunity,as broad in scope as the privilege it replaces,is available and applicable to him.
several cases have squarely held that persons could not be sanctioned when,in noncriminal proceedings,they invoked the constitutional privilege to refuse to answer official questions,or to produce materials potentially subject to the privilege,even though they received official assurances that no criminal use of the evidence sought was contemplated,and even though they could move to suppress the evidence produced if the prosecution later attempted such criminal use,maness meyers,d one served with subpoena for production of sexually explicit magazines as evidence for civil injunction against distribution of obscene materials was not required to let cat out of the bag before testing whether his invocation of fifth amendment privilege was valid but see,at.conc.opn.of white,formal immunity is functional equivalent of rule that neither incriminating answers nor their fruits can be used criminally see united states doe,d doe before compelling citizen production,over fifth amendment objection,of potentially incriminating business records for nonpenal purpose,government must follow strict procedures of statute allowing united states attorney to seek criminal use immunity prosecutor informal promise not to use materials criminally is insufficient statute is intended to require government to balance interest in obtaining material against risk of hindrance to future prosecution if immunity is granted pillsbury conboy,d conboy deponent questioned in civil case about content and truth of his previously immunized federal grand jury testimony could not be held in contempt for invoking fifth amendment rights at deposition deponent was not required to rely on mere predictive judgment that,in any subsequent criminal prosecution against him,court would suppress civil deposition testimony as covered by prior immunity see also marchetti united states,d marchetti professional bookmaker subject to special tax on proceeds of illegal wagering could not be convicted of violating registration provisions of internal revenue code over defense that compliance would require supreme court would not clear way for enforcement of registration provisions by judicially imposing restrictions on criminal use of information derived,since congress,not courts,should balance criminal versus uses of registration requirement byers justice court cal d,byers absent prior judicial rule conferring criminal use immunity,one involved in auto collision could not be convicted for leaving accident scene without disclosing information,as required by law though purpose of disclosure statute was to protect accident victims from financial loss,required disclosures were potentially.
california statutes set forth various circumstances in which persons whose potentially incriminating statements are required for reasons other than criminal prosecution are,or may or must be,afforded immunity from the criminal use of,or prosecution for,the immunity matters discussed in their compelled answers.see,prosecutor may request judicial immunity for witness in felony proceeding,subd.e,as added by stats,ch,firefighter must receive formal written offer of criminal transactional immunity before being required to answer employer incriminating questions,one called to testify in civil service investigation by state personnel board can not be excused on grounds of privilege if granted criminal transactional or use immunity,one compelled,over objection,to testify before fair political practices commission has criminal transactional immunity with respect to matters disclosed,subd.e person compelled,over objection,to testify before corporations commissioner in investigation has criminal transactional immunity with respect to matters disclosed.
plaintiff and the court of appeal thus have derived the premise that immunity,on the one hand,and the right to exclusion from evidence in a subsequent prosecution,on the other,are two separate concepts that may not be conflated.as the court of appeal reasoned,one subjected to coercive official questioning in a noncriminal setting is constitutionally privileged to refuse to answer unless personally immunized,and,if personal immunity is denied,or is unavailable from an authorized source,the person can not be sanctioned for remaining silent,but if one does speak under official compulsion,without the protection of formal immunity,the constitution nonetheless prohibits direct or derivative use of the statements in a criminal prosecution against the declarant.
whatever the general merits of this principle,federal and california courts have taken a different tack in cases involving noncriminal investigations of the job performance of public employees.given the paramount duty of public employees to their employers,and the importance of ensuring the proper performance of public duties,the decisions consistently indicate that a public employee may be compelled,upon threat of job discipline,to answer questions about his or her job performance,so long as the employee is not also required to surrender the constitutional privilege against criminal use of any statements thereby obtained.
as we will explain,the united states supreme court has explicitly stated that the fifth amendment does not prevent a public employer from disciplining an employee who refuses to answer official questions,where there is no further requirement that the employee forfeit the privilege against and agree that the answers thus compelled may be used in a criminal prosecution against the employee.the court has never held,in the context of a noncriminal investigation of public employee job performance,that an employee must be offered formal immunity from criminal use before being compelled,by threat of job discipline,to answer questions on that subject.
lower federal courts,and california courts other than the instant court of appeal,have thus consistently concluded that the constitution does not require a public employer to obtain and provide an affirmative grant of criminal use immunity before using the threat of job discipline to compel answers from its employee in the course of an investigation of job performance.rather,these cases hold,the employee may be punished for refusal to answer the employer questions if he or she is not required to surrender the constitutional privilege against criminal use of the statements thereby obtained.over four decades,the supreme court has declined numerous opportunities to overturn these decisions.no reason appears to depart from the rule thus well established.
thus,in garrity,police officers were questioned by the state attorney general office,which was acting pursuant to broad authority to investigate the fixing of traffic tickets.a state statute called for the forfeiture of public employment by one who invoked the fifth amendment,or refused to waive immunity,in response to official questioning about his or her job performance.accordingly,each officer was warned that anything he said could be used against him in a criminal prosecution,that he could refuse,on grounds of his constitutional privilege,to provide answers,but that if he did so,he would be dismissed.in other words,the officers were told that unless they waived their constitutional right against,they would lose their jobs.
though preserving their constitutional objections,the officers answered,and their answers were used to convict them of conspiracy to obstruct administration of the traffic laws.deeming the answers coerced,the high court reversed the convictions,holding that the fifth amendment right against,as incorporated in the fourteenth amendment,prohibits use in subsequent criminal proceedings of statements obtained under threat of removal from office garrity,supra.
subsequent to garrity,in two cases decided the same day,the high court provided additional insight about the fifth amendment rights of public employees under investigation in connection with their job performance.in the first case,gardner broderick,d gardner,a new york city police officer subpoenaed before a grand jury prior to the garrity decision was asked to sign a waiver of his privilege against.pursuant to provisions of the new york constitution and the city charter,he was told his refusal to do so would lead to his discharge from public employment.when he refused to sign the waiver,he was fired,and he sought reinstatement.the state court dismissed his petition.the supreme court reversed,holding that the privilege against does not tolerate the attempt,regardless of its ultimate effectiveness,to coerce a waiver of the immunity it confers on penalty of the loss of employment,at,italics added.
arguing for a contrary result,the city sought,among other things,to distinguish spevack klein,d,decided the same day as garrity.spevack held that an attorney could not be disbarred solely for refusing,on grounds of his privilege against,to testify at a disciplinary hearing.in gardner,the city asserted that different considerations should apply in the case of a public official such as a policeman.gardner,supra.unlike the lawyer,the city argued,the public officer is directly,immediately,and entirely responsible to the city or state which is his employer.he owes his entire loyalty to it.he has no other client or principal.he is a trustee of the public interest,bearing the burden of great and total responsibility to his public employer.unlike the lawyer who is directly responsible to his client,the policeman is either responsible to the state or to no one,at.
we agree,the gardner court responded,that these factors differentiate the situations.if appellant,a policeman,had refused to answer questions specifically,directly,and narrowly relating to the performance of his official duties,without being required to waive his immunity with respect to the use of his answers or the fruits thereof in a criminal prosecution of himself,the privilege against would not have been a bar to his dismissal.gardner,supra,fn.citation omitted,italics added.
the second case,sanitation men sanitation comm,d sanitation men i,concerned a new york city commission investigation,again prior to the garrity decision,of suspected corrupt acts by city sanitation employees.fifteen suspected employees were called to testify before the commission.pursuant to the city charter,they were told that if they invoked the privilege against to avoid testifying about their own job conduct,or that of other employees,they would be discharged.twelve of the employees refused to testify before the commission and,on that sole ground,were dismissed.three answered questions,denying the charges against them.subsequently,these three were summoned before a grand jury and asked to sign waivers of immunity.they refused,and were then dismissed for that sole reason.
the court of appeals upheld the dismissals.however,the supreme court reversed on the grounds elaborated in gardner,holding again that the fifth amendment forbids dismissal from public employment for refusal to surrender the privilege against.nonetheless,the high court observed,as we stated in gardner,if new york had demanded that petitioners answer questions specifically,directly,and narrowly relating to the performance of their official duties on pain of dismissal without requiring relinquishment of the benefits of the constitutional privilege,and if they had refused to do so,this case would be entirely different.in such a case,the employee right to immunity as a result of his compelled testimony would not be at stake.sanitation men i,supra,italics added.the court made clear that public employees,like all other citizens,are entitled to the privilege against.nonetheless,the court cautioned,petitioners,being public employees,subject themselves to dismissal if they refuse to account for their performance of their public trust,after proper proceedings,which do not involve an attempt to coerce them to relinquish their constitutional rights,at,italics added.
as a consequence of the decision in sanitation men i,the public employees at issue in that case were reinstated.thereafter,they were recalled to appear before a senior city sanitation official.before being questioned on this occasion,each of the of whom were represented by advised by the official that the employee had all rights guaranteed by new york law and the federal and state constitutions,and that these included the right to remain silent,although refusal to answer material and relevant questions about his job conduct might subject the employee to disciplinary action.each employee was further told,in light of garrity,gardner,and sanitation men i,that any answers he gave could not be used in a criminal prosecution against him,except a perjury prosecution stemming from the falsity of any answers.beyond this advisement,the employees received no formal grant or offer of criminal immunity.
again the employees refused to answer substantive questions about their participation in the suspected corrupt scheme.accordingly,they were suspended and,ultimately,dismissed.
in the employees federal reinstatement action,both parties moved for summary judgment.the district court granted the employees motion and denied the city.the court concluded that under new york criminal procedure statutes,the city lacked authority to confer any form of criminal immunity necessary to supplant the fifth amendment privilege and permit the city to compel the employees answers on pain of dismissal.
in uniformed ass n,commissioner of of cir sanitation men ii,the federal court of appeals reversed.the court reasoned that there need be no statute conferring the criminal use immunity required to discharge a public employee who refuses,on grounds,to answer questions.the court asserted that,in garrity,the very act of the attorney general in telling the witness that he would be subject to removal if he refused to answer was held to have conferred such immunity,and in adams,the high court observed that when one is compelled to give a statement,the fifth amendment confers immunity directly,without the necessity of a statute.sanitation men ii,supra,at.
in any event,the court noted that in gardner,justice fortas stated in so many words that if a public officer is asked about performance of his official duties and is not required to waive immunity,the privilege is not a bar to his dismissal for refusal to answer.justice fortas said nothing about a statutory grant of immunity,and the citation of garrity in the gardner opinion shows why nothing needed to be said the proceeding here involved no attempt to coerce relinquishment of constitutional rights,because public employees do not have an absolute constitutional right to refuse to account for their official actions and still keep their jobs their right,conferred by the fifth amendment itself,is simply that neither what they say under such compulsion nor its fruits can be used against them in a subsequent prosecution.sanitation men ii,supra,italics added.
accordingly,the federal court of appeals ordered the federal district court to enter summary judgment for the city.with only justice douglas dissenting vote,the united states supreme court denied certiorari.uniformed sanitation men,et commissioner of sanitation of the city of new york,et,d.
consistent with sanitation men ii,many lower federal court cases have since held that the fifth amendment does not require a formal,affirmative grant of immunity before a public employee may be dismissed for his or her blanket refusal to answer official questions about performance of the employee public duties,so long as the employee is not required to surrender the constitutional privilege against the direct or derivative use of his or her statements in a subsequent criminal prosecution,aguilera baca cir,cert.denied,d aguilera hill johnson cir,harrison wille cir,wiley mayor and city council of baltimore cir,cert.denied,d arrington county of dallas cir,hester city of milledgeville cir,see weston of housing urban dev,weston gulden mccorkle cir,cert.denied,d confederation of police conlisk cir,cert.denied sub nom.rochford confederation of police,d confederation of police.
california cases postdating garrity,gardner,and sanitation men decisions of this to similar effect.in szmaciarz state personnel bd.d,a corrections officer faced administrative charges for bringing marijuana cigarettes into the prison.questioned at his disciplinary hearing,he invoked the fifth amendment,and was nonetheless ordered to answer,receiving no offer of immunity in the process.he did respond under protest,admitting he carried the contraband into the facility.he received a suspension.he sought mandamus to overturn the suspension,claiming he should have been allowed at the hearing to exercise his privilege against.the court of appeal disagreed.citing the pertinent united states supreme court decisions,the court held that he could be compelled,for disciplinary purposes,to answer questions pertaining to his job performance,although no criminal use could be made of his answers,at.
in kelly state personnel bd.d,a state criminalist was terminated for refusing to provide requested information during an internal investigation of allegations that he supplied illegal drugs,including some from evidence,to a third person.he had been advised that any information he provided could not be used against him in a criminal prosecution.his petition for mandate,seeking reinstatement,was denied,and the court of appeal affirmed.justice reynoso opinion noted that the appeal involved only associational and privacy issues,not the petitioner fifth amendment rights.on the latter score,justice reynoso observed,i t is settled that a public employee may be required to answer questions relative to his fitness for his employment if his answers can not be used against him in a subsequent criminal proceeding.citation.if the employee still refuses to answer questions relevant to his official duties then he may be dismissed.citation,at.
in lybarger city of los angeles cal d,lybarger,a police officer,lybarger,was interviewed by the department internal affairs division,which was investigating serious allegations of misconduct in his unit.he was advised that a criminal investigation was also pending,and that refusal to cooperate with the internal affairs inquiry would be insubordination,which might lead to dismissal.he was then ordered to answer questions and refused to do so.at a subsequent disciplinary hearing,he testified he acted on advice of counsel.he was terminated for disobeying the order.the superior court denied his petition for mandate seeking reinstatement.
on appeal,lybarger asserted violations of his rights under the public safety officers procedural bill of rights act,et.he pointed out that government code section,subdivision a forbids punitive action against an officer for lawful ly excercis ing the rights granted under this chapter,which rights included,under government code section,former subdivision g now subdivision h,the right immediately to be informed of his constitutional rights i f prior to or during the interrogation it was deemed that he might be charged with a criminal offense 
under this scheme,lybarger asserted,he could not be disciplined solely by reason of his exercise of his constitutional right to remain silent.moreover,he insisted,he had been denied his statutory right to be advised of his constitutional rights where it was deemed that criminal charges might be filed.
addressing the first issue,the majority made clear that lybarger had neither a constitutional nor a statutory right to remain silent free of administrative sanction.as a matter of constitutional law,it is well established that a public employee has no absolute right to refuse to answer potentially incriminating questions posed by his employer.instead,his rights are deemed adequately protected by precluding any use of his statements at a subsequent criminal proceeding.citing turley,supra,and garrity,supra.lybarger,supra,cal d,italics added.
on the other hand,the majority then held that lybarger interrogators had violated his statutory right to an advisement that he had a constitutional right to remain silent,subject to disciplinary action for doing so,but that his statements obtained under threat of discipline could not be used against him in a criminal prosecution.the omission of such an advisement,the majority concluded,was prejudicial,and lybarger dismissal for refusing to answer questions was therefore invalid.lybarger,supra,cal d.
in williams city of los angeles cal d,williams,we addressed a similar police internal investigation involving lybarger partner,officer williams.we reiterated our conclusion that the constitution gives a public employee no absolute right to refuse to answer incriminating employer questions,but instead adequately protects the employee rights by precluding use of any compelled statements in aid of a criminal prosecution,at.like lybarger,williams also claimed his statutory advisement rights had been violated.unlike lybarger,however,williams had answered the questions posed to him,and had been dismissed on the basis of the incriminating information he provided.this court concluded that omission of the statutory advisement,though improper,did not warrant invalidating williams dismissal for admitted misconduct on duty,at.
finally,in long beach city employees city of long beach cal d,long beach,we addressed a statute requiring every nonsafety public employee to undergo polygraph testing that involved intrusive,questions about the employee childhood,past drug use,history of petty crimes,and the like.we accepted plaintiff employees contention that this testing violated the california constitutional right of privacy.nonetheless,we restated,as correct,the gardner rule that a public employee may be pain of answer questions specifically,directly,and narrowly relating to the performance of his official duties.citations,at.thus,we said,i f the city had demanded only that its employees answer questions pertaining directly to performance of their duties upon pain of dismissal,without using the intrusive intermediary of polygraph testing,then this case would be entirely different.citation.ibid.
we are therefore persuaded that neither the federal nor the california constitutional privilege against compelled requires a public employer to provide its employee with a formal grant of criminal use immunity before it can require the employee,upon threat of job discipline,to answer questions relating to the employee job performance.on the contrary,the employer may discipline,and even dismiss,a public employee for refusing,on grounds of the constitutional privilege,to answer the employer questions,so long as the employee is not required,as a condition of remaining in the job,to surrender his or her right against criminal use of the statements thus least where,as here,the employee is specifically advised that he or she retains that right.see fn,ante.
as the high court suggested in gardner,the competing public and personal interests are best reconciled by such a rule.in performing their official functions,government officers and employees owe unique duties of loyalty,trust,and candor to their employers,and to the public at large.long beach,supra,cal d.public agencies must be able promptly to investigate and discipline their employees betrayals of this trust.in the vast majority of cases,the urgent administrative need to root out and eliminate misfeasance or malfeasance by public employees takes priority over any penal implications.see discussion,post.the constitution can not mean that a public employee may refuse with impunity to account for his or her performance on the public payroll,and may delay the progress of an em
