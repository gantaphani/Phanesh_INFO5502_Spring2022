three entities sued their former attorneys alleging professional negligence and related claims the court entered judgment in defendants favor after sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend and granting a judgment on the pleadings on plaintiffs fourth amended complaint.the court concluded each of the claims was barred by the statute of limitations and the doctrine was inapplicable.we reverse,determining the claims related back to an earlier,complaint.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiffs malpractice action against procopio involves procopio legal representation of plaintiffs in a complex,real estate litigation that spawned numerous appeals in this court.plaintiffs filed their original complaint against procopio while the underlying litigation was ongoing and within one year after they substituted a new counsel.plaintiffs then filed several amended malpractice complaints.the trial court found the fourth amended complaint was untimely.plaintiffs challenge this conclusion on appeal.
to properly resolve the appellate issues,it is necessary to summarize the history of the underlying litigation and its relationship to the complaint and amended complaints filed in the malpractice action.because we are reviewing a judgment on the pleadings and on a demurrer,we base this factual description on the allegations of the complaint and documents that were properly the subject of judicial notice.see buesa city of los angeles th.
this action arises from the development of a acre community in spring valley,consisting of a residential community,a commercial business park,and a golf course and resort.the property planned for the residential development was initially held by plaintiff pointe residential,a limited partnership affiliated with plaintiff gosnell builders.in the mid,pointe residential and gosnell builders entered into a complex series of transactions with palomba weingarten and related entities in which weingarten agreed to provide needed financing for the project.one of the entities,properties,llc wwi,acquired ownership of the residential property.plaintiff pointe sdmu,a limited partnership affiliated with gosnell builders,was formed to own and develop the mixed use portion of the property.
by,the gosnell and weingarten parties were engaged in numerous disputes pertaining to the residential and developments.in about august,the three plaintiffs pointe residential,pointe sdmu,and gosnell builders retained the procopio law firm,which filed two lawsuits on behalf of these plaintiffs.
in the first case known as the residential litigation,gosnell builders and pointe residential sued weingarten,wwi,and astra management corporation astra,a corporation of which pointe residential was a minority shareholder.weingarten filed a against pointe residential and gosnell builders.
in the second case known as the case,pointe sdmu sued atlas homes,llc atlas,an entity formed by weingarten.atlas filed a against various parties,including pointe sdmu,pointe residential and gosnell builders.
the two cases were assigned to superior court judge robert may.in november,judge may conducted a court trial on certain equitable issues in the residential action.at the trial,the plaintiffs pointe residential and gosnell builders were represented by procopio.in march,the court issued a statement of decision,finding weingarten liable for breach of fiduciary duty on a shareholder derivative claim asserted by pointe residential on behalf of astra.the court deferred ruling on several accounting and punitive damage issues.
shortly thereafter,judge may consolidated the case with the residential case for purposes of the next phase of the trial.the entire consolidated action the residential and cases will be referred to as the pointe i litigation.
in november,the nonjury trial in the pointe i litigation began,and encompassed all remaining causes of action and certain issues on punitive damages.during the trial,the three plaintiffs continued to be represented by procopio.pointe sdmu additionally retained a second attorney,michael vivoli,to serve as cocounsel for pointe sdmu.at the trial,the parties raised numerous legal and factual issues involving their complicated business relationships,and the trial took place over the next two months.
on february,vivoli was associated as cocounsel also for pointe residential and gosnell builders.
on february,judge may issued a tentative decision in the pointe i trial,finding in plaintiffs favor on some of their claims and finding for defendants on others.on april,the court confirmed the tentative decision in all respects.the court then ordered an accounting and appointed a referee to submit recommendations to the court.
on about april,vivoli filed a new and independent action on behalf of the three plaintiffs pointe residential,gosnell builders,and pointe sdmu against weingarten and related entities.this action,known as the pointe ii case,was filed primarily to recover certain damages resulting from weingarten posttrial conduct,and to recover certain damages for pointe sdmu that it had not sought in the first pointe i action.
on may,plaintiffs substituted vivoli as their sole counsel in the pointe i litigation the residential and cases.during the next year,judge may conducted several hearings and issued additional written rulings pertaining to various unresolved issues from the pointe i trial.
while this pointe i litigation activity was ongoing,and months after terminating their relationship with procopio,on april,plaintiffs pointe residential,pointe sdmu,and gosnell builders filed a legal malpractice action against procopio.the malpractice complaint lists each of the three parties as plaintiffs and names procopio and attorney steven strauss as defendants.the complaint contains a single cause of action general negligence and alleges within the last year that defendants,as plaintiffs attorneys,failed to use due care in the handling of pointe san diego residential community,et palomba weingarten,et litigation.
less than four months later,in july,plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint in the legal malpractice action,providing substantially more detail with respect to the nature of the malpractice claims as to each plaintiff.those allegations essentially concerned procopio failure to assert specific claims and seek certain remedies in the pointe i consolidated litigation.
procopio filed an answer and a in september.
on september,judge may entered a final judgment in the pointe i case.in the final judgment,the court reconfirmed its earlier findings that each plaintiff prevailed on certain claims,but were unsuccessful on other claims.
each set of parties appealed.while the were pending,in december,plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint in the legal malpractice action,reorganizing the causes of action and adding several additional grounds for the malpractice claim arising from procopio representation of the plaintiffs in the pointe i litigation.procopio filed an answer to this complaint.
nineteen months later,in july,this court issued its decision on the pointe i litigation appeals,affirming the judgment in some respects,reversing the judgment in other respects,and reversing the order granting a partial new trial.pointe san diego residential community,properties,july.we shall refer to this decision as the july pointe i appellate decision.of relevance here,this court held judge may erred in concluding that pointe residential had timely alleged wwi breach of an agreement known as the agreement and judge may erred in concluding that pointe sdmu timely alleged a permanent trespass claim and thus pointe sdmu was not entitled to the million damage award for this breach.
eleven months later,on june,plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint in the legal malpractice action,containing eight causes of action,each of which was based on procopio representation of plaintiffs in the pointe i litigation.the first seven causes of action identified specific acts or omissions alleged to constitute legal malpractice in the pointe i litigation,several of which were based on our determinations in the july pointe i appellate decision.the eighth cause of action alleged breach of contract based on the negligence allegations.
procopio demurred to the first cause of action pertaining to procopio failure to allege and recover damages for breach of the agreement,contending primarily that the claim was untimely.plaintiffs opposed the demurrer,arguing that the claim was valid and timely as to pointe residential and gosnell builders because they sustained no injuries until this court filed its july pointe i appellate decision,and in any event,the claim related back to the original april malpractice complaint.the court rejected these arguments,but provided plaintiffs leave to amend the complaint.
plaintiffs then filed their fourth amended complaint,essentially alleging the same causes of action,with certain modifications and clarifications.the first cause of action sought damages for procopio failure to recover relief for breach of the agreement on behalf of pointe residential and gosnell builders.the second cause of action alleged on behalf of pointe sdmu that procopio failed to timely plead a permanent trespass claim.the third cause of action alleged on behalf of pointe residential that procopio failed to claim half of the tax benefits that weingarten appropriated to herself.the fourth cause of action pertained to interests in the diversion of fill dirt and unauthorized grading.the fifth cause of action was for failure to recover all damages for breach of a development management agreement.the sixth cause of action was for failure to name weingarten as a defendant in the pointe sdmu action the complaint named only atlas which is insolvent.the eighth and ninth causes of action were for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty based on the prior allegations 
the complaint also included additional allegations pertaining to the dates plaintiffs sustained injuries from each alleged act of malpractice and allegations concerning the issue.with respect to the issue,plaintiffs alleged they did not include more detailed facts in their original complaint because they were unaware of the precise nature of their attorneys malpractice,particularly given that the litigation was ongoing and no final judgment had been entered.plaintiffs also alleged that procopio refused to agree to toll the statute of limitations and a t all relevant times,procopio was uniquely and solely aware of,and in possession of the fact that,their conduct in the representation of plaintiffs had fallen below the standard of care,and that defendants breach of the standard of care either had or might potentially in the future cause damage to plaintiffs,but procopio had concealed these facts from plaintiffs.
procopio demurred to the first and fourth through sixth causes of action.the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend on the basis the claims were time barred.the court found plaintiffs suffered injuries from the claimed malpractice no later than april.the court also found the doctrine was inapplicable because the original complaint did not contain sufficient factual allegations.relying on davaloo state farm ins.th davaloo,the court stated that although plaintiffs filed the original april complaint within one year of the accrual of the cause of action,the complaint was wholly defective because it was void of operative facts and thus the subsequent complaints could not relate back to the complaint.
the court then granted procopio demurrer and motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to the remaining causes of action second,third,eighth and ninth.the court found the second and third causes of action accrued more than one year before plaintiffs asserted the allegations in a complaint,and that these claims did not relate back to the original complaint.the court also concluded that pointe sdmu could not recover under the second cause of action because atlas,the sole underlying defendant,was insolvent and could not have paid a judgment 
procopio thereafter dismissed its with prejudice based on an agreement of the parties to submit the matter to binding arbitration following the appeal.

review standards 
on appeal from an order of dismissal after an order sustaining a demurrer,our standard of review is de novo,we exercise our independent judgment about whether the complaint states a cause of action as a matter of law.los altos el granada investors city of capitola th.in reviewing the complaint,we must assume the truth of all facts properly pleaded by the plaintiff and matters properly judicially noticed.howard jarvis taxpayers city of la habra cal th.however,we do not assume the truth of contentions,deductions,or conclusions of fact or law and may disregard allegations that are contrary to the law or to a fact which may be judicially noticed.dutra eagleson th.
a motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same function as a general demurrer,and thus attacks only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters that can be judicially noticed.citations.citation.burnett chimney sweep th.as with our review of an order sustaining a demurrer,we review de novo the court judgment on the pleadings.id.at.
further,to prevail on a demurrer based on the statute of limitations,a defendant must establish the entire cause of action is untimely.a demurrer challenges a cause of action and can not be used to attack a portion of a cause of action.caliber bodyworks,superior court th.thus,where a plaintiff sues a defendant for legal malpractice alleging several distinct acts of malpractice with respect to a single representation,a demurrer is properly granted on the basis of the statute of limitations only if each alleged act of malpractice is time barred.ph ii,superior court th,reversing demurrer sustained to legal malpractice cause of action because plaintiff timely alleged at least one negligent act.
this rule applies here even though plaintiffs have separated procopio various alleged acts of malpractice during the pointe i litigation into distinct causes of action.the gravamen of a complaint and the nature of the right sued upon,rather than the form of the action,is relevant for purposes of statute of limitations analysis.augusta united service automobile th.each plaintiff pointe residential,pointe sdmu,and gosnell builders had one primary right the right to be free of negligence by their attorneys in connection with the litigation for which they were retained.see bay cities paving grading,lawyers mutual ins.cal th.plaintiffs alleged their attorneys breached that right in multiple ways,but it nevertheless remained a single right.thus,although each separate act of malpractice allegedly committed during the pointe i litigation has a separate cause of action number and label,for purposes of determining whether the demurrer should have been sustained,we look at the malpractice claims as one cause of action.see san diego unified school dist.county of san diego th,see also slater blackwood cal d.
ii.legal principles regarding limitations period for legal malpractice 
the statute of limitations for legal malpractice actions is contained in code of civil procedure section,subdivision a under this statute,the limitations period generally commences when the plaintiff actually or constructively discovers the facts of the wrongful act or omission,but no later than four years,subd.a see beal bank,ssb arter hadden,llp cal th.however,this limitations period is tolled until the plaintiff suffers actual loss or damage resulting from the allegedly negligent actions while the attorney continues to represent the client in the same matter,subd.a see jordache enterprises,brobeck,phleger harrison cal th,jordache gold weissman th.
for purposes of the tolling rule,the test for actual injury under section is whether the plaintiff has sustained any damages compensable in an action jordache,supra,cal th at,italics added.under this standard,the fact of damage,rather than the amount,is the critical factor.id.at.thus,a plaintiff sustains actual injury when he or she incurs attorney fees to rectify the problem caused by the prior attorney alleged negligence.id.at.further,actual injury may occur even if the loss is contingent on an appeal or other final adjudication.id.at village nurseries greenbaum th.the analysis concerns whether events have developed to a point where plaintiff is entitled to a legal remedy,not merely a symbolic judgment such as an award of nominal damages.citation.however,once the plaintiff suffers actual harm,neither difficulty in proving damages nor uncertainty as to their amount tolls the limitations period.jordache,supra,cal th at.
in sustaining the demurrer and granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings,the court found plaintiffs claims in the fourth amended complaint were untimely because the complaint was filed more than one year after plaintiffs discovered the facts constituting the wrongful omissions and suffered injury,and more than one year after plaintiffs discontinued their relationship with procopio and began paying fees for their new attorney services.the court further found the doctrine inapplicable based on davaloo,supra,th.
on appeal,plaintiffs argue primarily that the claims were timely because they related back to the original complaint.they alternatively argue that even if the doctrine is inapplicable,they timely filed the complaint pertaining to three factual grounds for their malpractice claim because the fees paid to their second attorney were unrelated to these alleged acts of malpractice.they essentially contend they did not suffer injury with respect to these acts of malpractice until this court filed its opinion on the appeal from the underlying judgment.
we conclude the doctrine applies in this case.we thus need not analyze whether the court properly found the record establishes plaintiffs sustained injury with respect to each discrete act of alleged malpractice more than one year before they filed their complaint.
iii.relation back 
an amended complaint is considered a new action for purposes of the statute of limitations only if the claims do not relate back to an earlier,complaint.under the doctrine,an amendment relates back to the original complaint if the amendment rests on the same general set of facts involves the same injury and refers to the same instrumentality.norgart upjohn cal th,barrington robins cal d,austin massachusetts bonding insurance cal d,austin.an amended complaint relates back to an earlier complaint if it is based on the same general set of facts,even if the plaintiff alleges a different legal theory or new cause of action.smeltzley nicholson cal d,idding north bay construction th,idding.however,the doctrine will not apply if the the plaintiff seeks by amendment to recover upon a set of facts entirely unrelated to those pleaded in the original complaint.stockwell mcalvay cal d.
in determining whether the amended complaint alleges facts that are sufficiently similar to those alleged in the original complaint,the critical inquiry is whether the defendant had adequate notice of the claim based on the original pleading.the policy behind statutes of limitations is to put defendants on notice of the need to defend against a claim in time to prepare a fair defense on the merits.this policy is satisfied when recovery under an amended complaint is sought on the same basic set of facts as the original pleading.citation.garrison board of directors th,accord lamont wolfe cal.app d,see benfield mocatta metals cir,finding that for doctrine to apply,there must be a sufficient commonality of alleged acts of wrongdoing to preclude a claim of unfair surprise.additionally,in applying the analysis,courts should consider the strong policy in this state that cases should be decided on their merits.idding,supra,th at see smeltzley nicholson,supra,cal d at.
under these principles,the third and fourth amended complaints related back to the original complaint.the original complaint named plaintiffs pointe residential,gosnell builders,and pointe sdmu,and defendants procopio and attorney strauss.the complaint was a form complaint,and the plaintiffs checked the box marked general negligence on the form.pursuant to the instructions on the form,plaintiffs also included an attachment alleging defendants were the legal proximate cause of damages to plaintiff s and b y the following acts or omissions to act,defendant negligently caused the damage to plaintiff.in the description of reasons for liability section,plaintiffs stated defendants,as plaintiffs attorneys,failed to use due care in the handling of pointe san diego residential community,et palomba weingarten,et litigation.italics omitted.
because there was a single litigation matter by that title in which procopio had represented these three plaintiffs,procopio was put on notice that the professional negligence claim was based on its representation of plaintiffs in this case,and of the need to gather and preserve evidence relating to this representation.when plaintiffs filed their initial complaint,judge may had ruled against plaintiffs on several claims and procopio was aware of these rulings.procopio had represented these plaintiffs for several years in this precise litigation,controlled the litigation strategy,participated in numerous client conversations and meetings,and produced or had immediate access to the documents that would inevitably become relevant in the malpractice action.although the original complaint did not detail how the firm had allegedly breached the standard of care,the form complaint and the fourth amended complaint rested on the same general set of facts procopio prosecution of the pointe i litigation,involved the same injury monetary damages sustained as a result of alleged professional negligence,and referred to the same instrumentality alleged professional negligence.
further,as a fiduciary,procopio had superior knowledge of the relevant facts and had full access to all of the information pertaining to the adequacy of its representation.generally,under california liberal pleading rules,l ess particularity is required when it appears that defendant has superior knowledge of the facts,so long as the pleading gives notice of the issues sufficient to enable preparation of a defense.okun superior court cal d,see youngman nevada irrigation dist.cal d,rannard lockheed aircraft cal d.based on the allegations of the pleading,procopio was provided the necessary information to permit it to gather and preserve the relevant materials and begin to conduct discovery and prepare a defense to the claims that were later refined and augmented in the amended complaints.
moreover,under rules applicable to legal malpractice cases,plaintiffs were required to file an action within one year after suffering damages,even if those damages were merely in the nature of attorney fees paid to a new attorney to take action to correct potential malpractice.see jordache,supra,cal th at.in may,plaintiffs terminated their relationship with procopio and substituted vivoli as their sole counsel.during the next year,plaintiffs and the weingarten parties actively continued their adversarial litigation in the underlying matter,and judge may continued to issue statements of decisions,rather than a final judgment.thus,although the underlying dispute was actively proceeding in a parallel fashion,plaintiffs filed a protective complaint to guard against any claim that the statute had run because of their substitution of counsel.however,because the precise nature of the alleged malpractice and the injuries caused by the alleged malpractice were not entirely clear to plaintiffs,plaintiffs pled their former attorneys negligence in general terms in this initial complaint.
on this record,it would defeat this state liberal pleading rules and statutory and judicial policies requiring prompt filing of malpractice complaints to hold the doctrine inapplicable here merely because plaintiffs original complaint did not contain detailed allegations of the precise nature of the alleged legal malpractice.if procopio had required additional information about the claim at that point,it could have filed a demurrer on the basis of uncertainty or engaged in discovery to seek information about the exact factual basis for the malpractice claim.
the criterion of relation back is whether the original complaint gave
