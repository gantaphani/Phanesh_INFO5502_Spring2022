plaintiff daniel solin,an attorney,retained myers,llp to obtain advice regarding solin representation of edith reich and brigitte jossem together referred to as the clients.in that regard,solin disclosed certain privileged and confidential information of the clients the secrets,which implicated them in criminal activities.
solin sued for professional malpractice,alleging that failed to advise him of pertinent legal authority regarding one of the matters on which he retained the law firm.the clients intervened,seeking dismissal of the suit to avoid the disclosure of the secrets.the trial court determined that could not effectively defend the action without disclosing the confidences of the clients,and dismissed the lawsuit.we affirm the judgment of dismissal.
in,solin entered into a agreement to act as outside counsel to the clients,who were conducting business activities through a corporate entity,international development and trade service,idts.
approximately six years earlier,in,reich had been convicted in federal court in new york of a wire fraud in which she was charged with having fabricated of fraudulent orders for delivery to the then soviet union.she was sentenced to four months in prison.
on march,the agreement between solin and the clients expired.at that time,idts and its principals continued to be involved in multiple legal proceedings,and were the subject of a federal grand jury investigation.that normally secret information became public when the clients asserted the fifth amendment privilege against in a civil case in the southern district of new york involving russian companies attempting to collect a judgment against idts.in that regard,an affirmation filed by their lawyer,barry bohrer,became a matter of public record.
in attempting to support his clients claims of fifth amendment privilege,bohrer disclosed the fact of the grand jury subpoenas,and asserted that document production and testimony in the civil case might implicate the clients in the following violations of law underreporting of federal and state income taxes destruction,theft or hiding of corporate documents transfer of idts funds to personal or bank accounts use of corporate funds for purchase of personal real estate,art,jewelry antiques and attempts to bribe the arbitration tribunal in moscow.bohrer argued that requiring reich and jossem to produce documents and answer questions at depositions may potentially furnish a link in the chain of evidence if not itself constitute evidence of violations of myriad federal and state criminal statutes.bohrer identified the following laws as among those which could be implicated by the clients testimony or production of documents in the civil action the foreign corrupt practices act the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act the money laundering control act of the mail and wire fraud statutes the travel act the federal conspiracy statute and relevant state and federal tax fraud and tax evasion statutes.
the district court sustained the clients fifth amendment privilege claims,ruling that answers to the questions asked at deposition provided reich and jossem with reasonable cause to fear that their answers may furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute them for criminal activity.aaot foreign economic ass vo technostroyexport international development trade services.civ,wl at,dist.lexis.
in early,solin and the clients were negotiating the terms under which solin would continue in his role as outside counsel.solin was concerned that his continued representation would implicate him in any criminal proceedings that might be brought against the clients.solin consulted with two criminal lawyers,elkan abramowitz and paul goldberger.the former was current counsel to the clients,and the latter had formerly represented them.both abramowitz and goldberger assured solin that his conduct was ethical and proper.
solin raised two additional concerns with goldberger.first,in order to induce solin to continue in his representation of them,the clients had threatened to sue him for alleged loans which were,in fact,fees.in addition,the clients were refusing to pay for the five year renewal term in advance,as they had done in,or to provide security for five annual payments.solin wished to determine the best way to protect himself against a contract dispute developing in the future.goldberger told solin that these questions were not within his expertise,and suggested that he discuss them with alan cohen,a criminal lawyer at.
solin consulted with cohen.the basis of this lawsuit concerns which matters the two men discussed.solin contends that he asked cohen to provide advice on three subjects his exposure to personal criminal liability arising out of his continued representation of the clients how to deal with his clients claim that fees paid were a loan and how to structure a new relationship that would best protect him against a future fee dispute,since the clients were unwilling to pay fees for the five year renewal term or to provide security for annual payments.
solin sued based upon cohen alleged failure to provide him with competent advice concerning the payment terms of the clients renewal agreement.specifically,solin claims that malpractice consisted of failing to call to his attention the new york line of cases permitting general retainers.solin avers that,had he known of these cases,he would have been entitled to hold reich and jossem responsible for the balance of the fees due for the remaining term of the retainer agreement in an amount of,plus interest.
cohen,on the other hand,maintains that the parties did not discuss the payment terms of the clients renewal retainer agreement except as those terms impacted the criminal law advice rendered by.thus,the resolution of the dispute between the parties concerns the substance of the discussions between solin and cohen concerning the legal advice sought and given in,essentially,a single meeting.
concerned that prosecution of this lawsuit would result in disclosure of their privileged and confidential information,the clients,together with solin and,negotiated and entered into a stipulation and order of confidentiality,which was presented to and signed by the trial court on january.several days later,the clients filed an ex parte application for a protective order postponing solin deposition.subsequently,on february,the clients moved to dismiss the action or,in the alternative,for a protective order precluding the disclosure of their privileged and confidential information.the clients argued below that the action must be dismissed because its prosecution defense would necessarily result in the disclosure of the clients highly sensitive and privileged information.they maintained that it is immaterial whether or not solin needs to disclose reich and jossem secrets and confidences to prove his has already stated that it will rely on reich and jossem privileged information to defend itself,and this fact alone obligates solin to dismiss the instant lawsuit.
the trial court concluded that could not effectively defend itself against solin claims of malpractice without reference to and use of the clients secrets.consequently,the trial court dismissed the action.
discussion 
at the issue in this case is the protection to be accorded the privilege.this privilege has been a hallmark of jurisprudence for almost years.mccormick,evidence ed,wigmore,evidence mcnaughton,pritchard sic cir,aff.baird koerner cir.the privilege authorizes a client to refuse to disclose,and to prevent others from disclosing,confidential communications between attorney and client,et clearly,the fundamental purpose behind the privilege is to safeguard the confidential relationship between clients and their attorneys so as to promote full and open discussion of the facts and tactics surrounding individual legal matters.people flores d.in other words,the public policy fostered by the privilege seeks to insure the right of every person to freely and fully confer and confide in one having knowledge of the law,and skilled in its practice,in order that the former may have adequate advice and a proper defense.baird koerner,supra,at.mitchell superior court cal d.
t he privilege is absolute and disclosure may not be ordered,without regard to relevance,necessity or any particular circumstances peculiar to the case.gordon superior court th,d see also shannon superior court d.in california the privilege has been held to encompass not only oral or written statements,but additionally actions,signs,or other means of communicating information.ex parte mcdonough cal,estate of kime d.furthermore,the privilege covers the transmission of documents which are available to the public,and not merely information in the sole possession of the attorney or client.in this regard,it is the actual fact of the transmission which merits protection,since discovery of the transmission of specific public documents might very well reveal the transmitter intended strategy.in re jordan cal d.while it is perhaps somewhat of a hyperbole to refer to the privilege as sacred,it is clearly one which our judicial system has carefully safeguarded with only a few specific exceptions.mitchell superior court,supra,cal d at.
in sum,there can be no balancing of the privilege against the right to prosecute a lawsuit to redress a legal wrong.consequently,as general dynamics superior court cal th,d,hereafter general dynamics teaches,unless a statutory provision removes the protection afforded by the privilege to confidential communications between attorney and client,an attorney plaintiff may not prosecute a lawsuit if in doing so client confidences would be disclosed.general dynamics,supra,at,d.
solin argues that a proper reading of the supreme court decision in general dynamics requires that we reverse the judgment dismissing his lawsuit.accordingly,we review the facts of that case in detail.
the plaintiff,andrew rose,worked for the defendant,general dynamics,as an attorney.after years with the company,he was summarily fired.rose sued his employer for wrongful discharge,alleging that his termination was due to the fact that he spearheaded an investigation into employee drug use,protested the company failure to investigate the bugging of the office of the chief of security,and advised company officials that the company salary policy might be in violation of the federal fair labor standards act.rose sought recovery under two theories that his firing,without good cause,violated an contract,and that his termination in retaliation for the conduct outlined above was in violation of fundamental public policies.general dynamics demurred to rose complaint,contending that because rose was an attorney he could be fired at any time for any reason,pursuant to our supreme court decision in fracasse brent cal d.that opinion held,in turn,that a client who retains an attorney to prosecute a personal injury lawsuit on a contingency fee basis has the right to discharge the attorney at any time and for any reason,subject to the attorney right to recover the reasonable value of the services rendered up to the time of discharge.
the supreme court rejected general dynamic contention that fracasse brent mandated dismissal,cautioning that fracasse should not be read as standing for more than its context and rationale will reasonably support.general dynamics,supra,cal th at,d.as to rose cause of action for breach of an contract,the court held that no reason appears why an employer that elects to limit its freedom to terminate the employment relationship with counsel should not be held to the terms of its bargain.id.at,d.the court noted as well that limitations on a right to discharge counsel are not likely to present issues implicating the distinctive values subserved by the relationship.such suits can thus for the most part be treated as claims brought by the nonattorney employee.id.at,d.
the court also sanctioned counsel suits for retaliatory discharge in limited circumstances.such lawsuits are permissible when the retaliatory discharge claims are founded on allegations that an attorney was terminated for refusing to violate a mandatory ethical duty embodied in the rules of professional conduct and when counsel nonattorney colleagues would be permitted to pursue a retaliatory discharge claim and governing professional rules or statutes expressly remove the requirement of attorney confidentiality.general dynamics,supra,at,d.the court further explained if the conduct in which the attorney has engaged is merely ethically permissible,but not required by statute or ethical code,the inquiry facing the court is slightly more complex.under these circumstances,a court must resolve two questions first,whether the employer conduct is of the kind that would give rise to a retaliatory discharge action by a non attorney employee under gantt sentry insurance,supra,cal th,d,and related cases second,the court must determine whether some statute or ethical rule,such as the statutory exception to the privilege codified in the evidence code see,specifically permits the attorney to depart from the usual requirement of confidentiality with respect to the and engaged in the nonfiduciary conduct for which he was terminated.id.at,d.thus,the supreme court made clear that an may pursue an action for retaliatory discharge only if the claims are grounded in explicit and unequivocal ethical norms embodied in the rules of professional responsibility and statutes id.at,d,emphasis in original,or if the claims are maintainable by the non attorney employee under circumstances in which the legislature has manifested a judgment that the principle of professional confidentiality does not apply.ibid.
the supreme court cautioned that the attorney who publicly exposes the client secrets will usually find no sanctuary in the courts.except in those rare instances when disclosure is explicitly permitted or mandated by an ethics code provision or statute,it is never the business of the lawyer to disclose publicly the secrets of the client.in any event,where the elements of a wrongful discharge in violation of fundamental public policy claim can not,for reasons peculiar to the case,be fully established without breaching the privilege,the suit must be dismissed in the interest of preserving the privilege.general dynamics,supra,at,d.
without reference to the particular factual scenario presented in general dynamics,solin cites two passages from that opinion and argues that they mandate reversal of the judgment of dismissal.first,in following up on the statement quoted in the immediately preceding paragraph to the effect that a lawsuit which can not be prosecuted without divulging privileged information must be dismissed,the supreme court stated we underline the fact that such drastic action will seldom if ever be appropriate at the demurrer stage of litigation.general dynamics,supra,at,d.second,solin relies on the following instructive statement from the supreme court in general dynamics t he trial courts can and should apply an array of ad hoc measures from their equitable arsenal designed to permit the attorney plaintiff to attempt to make the necessary proof while protecting from disclosure client confidences subject to the privilege.the use of sealing and protective orders,limited admissibility of evidence,orders restricting the use of testimony in successive proceedings,and,where appropriate,in camera proceedings,are but some of a number of measures that might usefully be explored by the trial courts as circumstances warrant.we are confident that by taking an aggressive managerial role,judges can minimize the dangers to the legitimate privilege interests the trial of such cases may present.id.at,d.however,as the supreme court put it,a case should not be read as standing for more than its context and rationale will reasonably support.general dynamics,supra,d.general dynamics simply does not support the result that solin suggests.
as to the first point,did not bring a demurrer to challenge the legal sufficiency to the complaint,nor did the trial court dismiss the action at the demurrer stage of litigation.the complaint itself,but three pages long,did not reveal that solin disclosed to the clients secrets.because it provided no basis to conclude that the matter could not be litigated without disclosure of privileged information,a demurrer to the complaint would not have been productive.
contrary to his suggestion that this litigation was dismissed in the demurrer stage,solin explains in his opening brief on appeal that discovery proceeded along normal lines documents produced,interrogatories answered,depositions scheduled until disclosed the existence of a handwritten memorandum made by cohen contemporaneous with the original solin meeting the notes.also prior to the hearing on the clients motion to dismiss,solin,and the clients had negotiated and entered into a protective order.at the time that the trial court considered the clients motion to dismiss,it was clear that the parties disagreed about the nature of the advice sought by solin,and that both parties would rely on the testimony of the percipient witnesses to the melveny consultation,which solin acknowledges included the disclosure of the clients secrets.indeed,solin asserts that this conflict concerning what was discussed during the melveny consultation is likely to prove outcome determinative before a jury.
in short,the factual underpinnings of solin claim and defense,including the latter intention to examine witnesses concerning all of the matters discussed in the melveny consultation and to introduce the notes into evidence to corroborate cohen testimony,had been revealed at the time that the trial court ruled on the clients motion to dismiss.this,then,is the more usual case described by the supreme court in general dynamics,in which the question of whether the privilege serves as a bar to the plaintiff recovery will be litigated and determined in the context of motions for protective orders or to compel further discovery responses,as well as at the time of a motion for summary judgment.general dynamics,supra,cal th at,d.
solin also cites general dynamics in support of its contention that the trial court was obliged to use its equitable arsenal to permit his lawsuit to proceed.thus,solin argues that the trial judge failed to follow the admonition of the supreme court in general dynamics which mandates that in cases brought by a lawyer in which there is a danger of disclosing privileged information,the trial courts can and should apply an array of ad hoc measures from their equitable arsenal designed to permit the attorney plaintiff to attempt to make the necessary proof while protecting from disclosure client confidences subject to the privilege.id.at,d.
solin fails to take into account the context within which the supreme court instructed the trial courts to fashion devices that would permit an attorney plaintiff to pursue legal redress against a former client without doing violence to the privilege.in general dynamics,the plaintiff lawyer alleged in his complaint that,due to the untoward conduct of his employer,he was no longer bound by the privilege thus,he argued that his lawsuit could be fully prosecuted without disclosing confidential information protected by that privilege.the employer disagreed,claiming that the plaintiff continued to be bound by the privilege.it was in the context of these facts that the supreme court charged the trial court with the responsibility to permit the plaintiff to try to establish that he could in fact prove his case without divulging confidences subject to the privilege.
general dynamics and the other cases cited by the parties all concern a plaintiff who might need to disclose confidential information in order to make his case against a defendant who is the holder of the privilege.as solin argues,the supreme court in general dynamics cautioned against dismissing such a case prematurely.however,whether or not a lawyer plaintiff can prove his or her case without disclosure of privileged information can be easily tested,by proceedings or by a motion for nonsuit after the plaintiff has presented his without the use of the confidential information.
here,of course,there is no need to resort to the trial court equitable arsenal to permit solin to make the necessary proof solin claims,and we accept his representation,that he has no need to divulge any privileged information in order to prove his case.solin then assures us that,contrary to the advice of its trial counsel,also has no need to divulge any privileged information in order to defend against solin claim of malpractice.solin argues because his case against does not depend at all on what they consulted about on the criminal side,solin has no need to raise,much less disclose,privileged information.of course,solin has acknowledged that he did consult with cohen about possible criminal exposure.that fact is not in dispute.nonetheless,argues that it can not defend this professional negligence case without disclosing privileged evidentiary details revealed by solin in the course of seeking that advice from cohen.the singular issue,therefore,is whether will be prejudiced in its defense of this professional malpractice case if it can not disclose the evidentiary details of the privileged matters communicated by solin to cohen in the course of seeking advice as reflected in the notes.
defendant does not have the same opportunity to test whether the charges can be successfully defended without the use of the client secrets.it may very well be that,were this lawsuit to proceed,a jury would render judgment in favor of even without any testimony from cohen regarding the evidentiary details that solin disclosed to him when he sought legal advice.in that event,we could say,after the fact,that did not need to disclose the client secrets in order to defend itself.if,however,is made to defend itself without use of the client secrets,and a jury returns a verdict for solin,we can not know whether the verdict would have been different had been permitted to present all relevant evidence regarding its consultation with solin,including the client secrets.
solin argument must therefore rest on the contention that will not be prejudiced in its defense of the malpractice action if it is prohibited from introducing what solin refers to as the evidentiary details of the conversation between solin and cohen.however,evidence code section provides that,except as otherwise provided by statute,all relevant evidence is admissible.and there can be no doubt that what solin told in order to obtain legal advice which solin now claims was faulty is relevant evidence.thus,the equitable tool that solin proposes is to preclude introduction of relevant evidence.limiting this evidence would give a distorted view of the melveny consultation,and would keep from the jury the facts that solin determined that needed to know in order to render a legal opinion,and the facts on which based its legal advice,and would deprive of its right to its accuser on the critical issue of solin credibility.clearly,would be prejudiced by the presentation to the factfinder of a limited and distorted view of the facts underlying this lawsuit.
in sum,is entitled to present to the jury all relevant information consistent with whatever strategy it determines best serves its interests,regardless of solin views of the necessity of the evidence.has indicated its intention to elicit full and extensive testimony concerning the substance and details of the discussion between solin and cohen,including the clients secrets,and to introduce the notes to corroborate cohen recollection of that consultation.pursuant to evidence code section,solin would be to object to any such testimony or other evidence which revealed his clients secrets the trial court must exclude information subject to a claim of privilege,and therefore must sustain the objection.solin would benefit from the exclusion of evidence that could bolster defense and its credibility.thus,solely as a result of his disclosure of his clients confidences,solin would obtain an unfair advantage in his lawsuit against.nothing in general dynamics or in any other case cited by solin countenances this result.
it strikes us as fundamentally unfair for a client to sue a law firm for the advice obtained and then to seek to forbid the attorney who gave that advice
