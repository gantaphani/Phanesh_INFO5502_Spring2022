because van hook filed his federal habeas petition before april,the provisions of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of do not apply.see lindh murphy.even without the act added layer of deference to judgments,we can not agree with the court of appeals that van hook is entitled to relief.
the sixth amendment entitles criminal defendants to the effective assistance of counsel that is,representation that does not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness in light of prevailing professional norms.strickland washington,quoting mcmann richardson.that standard is necessarily a general one.no particular set of detailed rules for counsel conduct can satisfactorily take account of the variety of circumstances faced by defense counsel or the range of legitimate decisions regarding how best to represent a criminal defendant.at.restatements of professional standards,we have recognized,can be useful as guides to what reasonableness entails,but only to the extent they describe the professional norms prevailing when the representation took place,at.
the sixth circuit ignored this limiting principle,relying on aba guidelines announced years after van hook went to trial.see,at quoting aba guidelines for the appointment and performance of defense counsel in death penalty cases,ed.the aba standards in effect in described defense counsel duty to investigate both the merits and mitigating circumstances in general terms it is the duty of the lawyer to conduct a prompt investigation of the circumstances of the case and to explore all avenues leading to facts relevant to the merits of the case and the penalty in the event of conviction.aba standards for criminal justice,ed.the accompanying commentary noted that defense counsel have a substantial and important role to perform in raising mitigating factors,and that i nformation concerning the defendant background,education,employment record,mental and emotional stability,family relationships,and the like,will be relevant,as will mitigating circumstances surrounding the commission of the offense itself.at.
quite different are the aba guidelines for capital defense counsel,published in,on which the sixth circuit relied.those directives expanded what had been in the standards a broad outline of defense counsel duties in all criminal cases into detailed prescriptions for legal representation of capital defendants.they discuss the duty to investigate mitigating evidence in exhaustive detail,specifying what attorneys should look for,where to look,and when to begin.see aba guidelines,at.they include,for example,the requirement that counsel investigation cover every period of the defendant life from the moment of conception,at,and that counsel contact virtually everyone who knew the defendant and his family and obtain records concerning not only the client,but also his parents,grandparents,siblings,and children,at.judging counsel conduct in the on the basis of these guidelines without even pausing to consider whether they reflected the prevailing professional practice at the time of the trial was error.
to make matters worse,the court of appeals following circuit precedent treated the aba guidelines not merely as evidence of what reasonably diligent attorneys would do,but as inexorable commands with which all capital defense counsel must fully comply.at quoting dickerson bagley.strickland stressed,however,that american bar association standards and the like are only guides to what reasonableness means,not its definition,at.we have since regarded them as such see wiggins smith.what we have said of state requirements is a fortiori true of standards set by private organizations w hile states are free to impose whatever specific rules they see fit to ensure that criminal defendants are well represented,we have held that the federal constitution imposes one general requirement that counsel make objectively reasonable choices.roe.
van hook insists that the sixth circuit missteps made no difference because his counsel were ineffective even under professional standards prevailing at the time.he is wrong.
like the court of appeals,van hook first contends that his attorneys began their mitigation investigation too late,waiting until he was found guilty only days before the sentencing hearing to dig into his background.see,at.but the record shows they started much sooner.between van hook indictment and his trial less than three months later,they contacted their lay witnesses early and often they spoke nine times with his mother beginning within a week after the indictment,once with both parents together,twice with an aunt who lived with the family and often cared for van hook as a child,and three times with a family friend whom van hook visited immediately after the crime.app.to pet.for cert.as for their expert witnesses,they were in touch with one more than a month before trial,and they met with the other for two hours a week before the trial court
