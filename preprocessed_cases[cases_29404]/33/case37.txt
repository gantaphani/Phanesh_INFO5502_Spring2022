pro se gerald fabiano appeals from the district court judgment in favor of his former employer,the corporation counsel office of the city of boston.fabiano asserts that he was unlawfully terminated in retaliation for filing a lawsuit in state court against the city of boston zoning board of appeal,which was the corporation counsel client.the district court awarded summary judgment to the city and the individual,holding that as a matter of law,fabiano termination did not violate the first amendment.we affirm the judgment below,albeit on different grounds than those set forth by the district court.
background 
we present the facts in the light most favorable to fabiano,as the party opposing summary judgment.see sparks fidelity title ins,cir.in june,fabiano was appointed assistant corporation counsel for the city.he served as a senior litigation lawyer in the government affairs division and was an employee.kevin joyce,the director of government affairs,was fabiano immediate supervisor from december until his termination.merita hopkins was the corporation counsel.
during late and early,hopkins received reports from joyce and another manager expressing concerns about fabiano case management skills,particularly with respect to his approach to settlement.in june,these concerns were discussed at a meeting attended by fabiano and hopkins.
in january,fabiano informed joyce that he had initiated a pro se action appealing a decision of the city of boston zoning board of appeal zoning board to the superior court.the government affairs division represents the zoning board on appeals,and fabiano had personally worked on two such cases during his tenure.
in fabiano pro se appeal,he challenged the renewal of a zoning variance for a restaurant located one hundred feet from real estate in which he had an ownership interest fabiano contended that a variance had never been initially granted,and that the renewal,issued in error,permitted a restaurant to provide services,thus diminishing the limited parking supply on his residential street.plaintiff mother,who owned a different abutting property,joined him in the action.like fabiano,she represented herself.
when fabiano notified joyce of the litigation,joyce immediately responded that his action in taking the appeal presented a conflict of interest and strongly advised fabiano to retain separate counsel.in the district court,joyce testified that fabiano told him that he was representing himself and family members,while fabiano claimed he told joyce he was only representing himself according to fabiano,joyce angrily told fabiano that he had to pick which side he was on and said that the litigation violated.ch,the state ethics law.
notwithstanding the strong reaction of joyce,fabiano did not seek permission for or procure outside counsel.he believed that under the conflict of interest policy governing situations in which an employee acts on his own behalf,his action was permissible.
the matter was reported to hopkins,who was told apparently incorrectly that fabiano was representing his family as well as himself in the action.after consulting with outside counsel,hopkins came to believe that fabiano actions were potentially in violation of state law,as well as state ethical rules governing the practice of attorneys.
for a few months after fabiano filed the zoning board action,joyce regularly asked fabiano about his trial schedule,something that he had never done before.on may,shortly after fabiano reported that he had no trials scheduled,hopkins terminated his employment.she did this while holding a copy of the zoning board complaint in her hand,telling fabiano that she lacked confidence in his judgment and was dismayed that he had not consulted state statutes,the board of bar overseers,the state ethics commission,or any manager before entering his appearance against the city.
hopkins contended that she did not fire fabiano for suing the city,but rather for his failure to follow city policy with respect to written disclosure and prior written approval of his lawsuit,as well as his inability or unwillingness to acknowledge the serious professional,ethical and practical problems created by his lawsuit.she stated that the zoning board lawsuit was merely one more example of poor judgment with respect to his caseload.
after investigation,the city acknowledged that the variance decision had resulted from inadvertent clerical error.joyce answered and handled the matter on behalf of the city.on february,the zoning appeal was resolved in favor of fabiano and his mother by agreed judgment.
in december,fabiano filed a complaint in the massachusetts superior court asserting first amendment claims against each defendant pursuant to as well as common law state claims.defendants removed the case to federal court.
after a hearing,the district court allowed the defendants motion for summary judgment with respect to the first amendment claims,and remanded the state claims to state court.fabiano hopkins,d.the district court held that fabiano litigation pertained to a matter of public concern in only a most limited sense.id.at quoting connick myers,d.even if fabiano conduct were protected by the first amendment,the court continued,the constitutional concern was outweighed by the valid workplace concern of the corporation counsel that fabiano should have consulted with his supervisor before initiating this litigation,and sought to minimize any actual conflicts or appearance of conflicts.id.at.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.rosenberg city of everett,cir citing.c.we review the district court award of summary judgment de novo,construing the record in the light most favorable to fabiano and resolving all reasonable inferences in his favor.id.
we may affirm the district court entry of summary judgment on any ground revealed by the record.houlton citizens coalition town of houlton,cir.although the district court ruled only on the merits of fabiano first amendment claims,we take a somewhat different approach,holding that neither the city of boston nor the individual defendants may be liable pursuant to.
municipal liability pursuant to 
in an action pursuant to,there can be no municipal liability under a respondeat superior theory.monell of soc,d.rather,to establish liability against the city,fabiano must prove deprivation of a constitutional right by means of the execution of the government policy or custom.city of canton harris,d see also monell,at.
hopkins is the relevant policymaker for the purposes of our analysis,as the decision to terminate fabiano employment ultimately resided with her.fabiano does not point to any relevant city policy beyond the mere fact that hopkins decided to fire him.nor does he assert that the city has made a practice of punishing attorneys who have taken legal action against it or otherwise exercised their first amendment rights 
absent evidence of an unconstitutional municipal policy,a single incident of misconduct can not provide the basis for municipal liability under.oklahoma city tuttle,d.such a result would be the equivalent of imposing respondeat superior liability upon the municipality.id.fabiano termination stands alone as a unique incident of alleged misconduct and does not,as a matter of law,suffice to ground liability against the city.
individual liability and qualified immunity 
the individual defendants,hopkins and joyce,assert an affirmative defense of qualified immunity.qualified immunity is intended to shield public officials from civil damages liability as long as their actions could reasonably have been thought consistent with the rights they are alleged to have violated.anderson creighton,d.where the defendant seeks qualified immunity,a ruling on that issue should be made early in the proceedings so that the costs and expenses of trial are avoided where the defense is dispositive.saucier katz,d.
in assessing this defense,we consider a sequence of questi
