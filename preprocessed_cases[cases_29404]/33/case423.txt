steve houston,a nevada state prisoner,appeals from the district court judgment denying his petition for habeas corpus pursuant to.houston habeas petition challenges his jury trial conviction for conspiracy to commit murder,three counts of attempted murder with the use of a deadly weapon,and three counts of discharging a firearm out of a motor vehicle.
houston contends that his sixth amendment rights were violated when the state trial court denied his motion to continue the trial so he could be represented by retained counsel,and denied his appointed counsel motion to withdraw based on a conflict of interest arising from the clark county public defender prior representation of the prosecution star witness.we hold that the trial court denial of houston motion to continue the trial did not violate the sixth amendment and that the nevada supreme court rejection of this claim was neither contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,federal law.we vacate and remand for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether houston right to counsel was violated.
we review de novo the denial of habeas relief by a district court.polk sandoval,cir.houston petition is governed by the and effective death penalty act aedpa.under aedpa,a state prisoner is entitled to relief only if the state court ruling resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.a state court decision is contrary to federal law if it applies a rule of law different from one set forth in supreme court holdings or makes a different determination based on materially indistinguishable facts.earp ornoski,cir citing williams taylor,d.the unreasonable application clause requires the state court decision to be more than incorrect or erroneous.lockyer andrade,d holding that the state decision must be objectively unreasonable.when applying aedpa standards,this court reviews the last reasoned decision addressing the issue by a state court.see robinson ignacio,cir.the nevada supreme court affirmance on direct appeal is the last reasoned opinion relevant to houston claims.
we first consider whether houston sixth amendment rights were violated by the trial court denial of his motion to continue the trial.
to establish a sixth amendment violation based on the denial of a motion to continue,houston must show that the trial court abused its discretion through an unreasoning and arbitrary insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay.morris slappy,d citing ungar sarafite,d.
the record supports the state court conclusion that the trial judge acted within his broad discretion in denying houston motion for a continuance to retain counsel.specifically,he confirmed that counsel was able to proceed to trial,evaluated houston diligence in timely retaining private counsel,and weighed the potential impact a continuance may have had on the victims and witnesses.the continuance was sought just four days before trial was scheduled to begin.see slappy,at.acknowledging that appropriate factors to consider include administration of justice,difficulty in assembling witnesses,bad faith delaying tactics,victims concerns.moreover,the motion to continue was based solely on houston desire to retain counsel because he was unsatisfied with his public defender preparation for trial,not on any potential conflict of interest.indeed,the potential conflict was not discovered until after the motion to continue was denied.accordingly,the nevada supreme court application of slappy and denial of relief on this claim was not objectively unreasonable.see d andrade,at.
next,we consider whether houston right to counsel was violated.
attorney craig jorgenson was appointed from the clark county public defender office to defend houston against charges that he fired shots from his car into a car driven by terrance chadwick and occupied by two of chadwick sisters.both the state and the defense agreed that there was a history of bad blood between houston and chadwick family.this history included the murder of chadwick grandmother and the shooting of his brother,for which houston was tried and acquitted.
after the jury had been empaneled,jorgenson discovered for the first time that the clark county public defender office had represented the victim and key prosecution witness,chadwick,in a case charging chadwick with multiple counts of attempted murder with the use of a deadly weapon.ultimately,chadwick pled guilty to firing a gun into a house 
the next morning,before opening arguments,jorgenson immediately moved to withdraw from houston case because he felt conflicted by his office prior representation of chadwick.jorgenson explained that the earlier case involving chadwick was tied,factually,to the state theory of retribution and the motive in houston case and that houston defense theory implicated chadwick as the aggressor.jorgenson told the judge that his heart is going to be with chadwick,and that he believed chadwick had not committed the crimes in the earlier case,for which chadwick had been convicted and served a prison sentence.such wrongful conviction,jorgenson explained,may have given chadwick a motive to act as the aggressor toward houston or to lie in order to convict houston out of revenge.jorgenson also expressed concern that,under his cross examination,chadwick may admit facts which would expose him to criminal liability or impact his parole status.
the judge denied the motion to withdraw,finding that no actual conflict existed because jorgenson had not personally represented chadwick in the previous proceeding.the judge further found that chadwick had waived any potential conflict that may have existed by waiving his privilege.notably,the trial court did not seek nor require a conflict waiver from houston.
at trial,chadwick was the only witness who testified that houston fired shots into the van occupied by chadwick and his sisters.as such,his credibility was paramount.
houston argues that the clark county public defender prior representation of chadwick in a case created a conflict,which adversely affected jorgenson trial performance by limiting his impeachment of chadwick through his prior conviction,his parole status,and his failed polygraph exam.
based on the trial record alone,the nevada supreme court denied relief on this claim because jorgenson had not personally represented chadwick,chadwick had waived his privilege,and the prior representation did not involve the same facts as houston case the nevada supreme court made no mention of the trial judge failure to obtain a waiver from houston or of jorgenson subjective belief that his representation was conflicted.
the district court acknowledged that chadwick earlier case was somewhat related to houston prosecution,but concluded that jorgenson performed as any attorney would have.without discussing the trial court failure to obtain a waiver from houston,the district court denied relief because houston failed to present evidence demonstrating that a conflict adversely affected counsel performance.
the supreme court has held that a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to assistance of counsel.strickland washington,d.where the conflict stems from counsel representation of multiple defendants,the petitioner must establish that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer performance.cuyler sullivan,d.the supreme court has defined an actual conflict by the effect a potential conflict had on counsel performance.mickens taylor,d.
where defense counsel timely points out a conflict of interest in joint representation,the trial court is required to investigate further ignoring counsel objection mandates automatic reversal of the resulting conviction.see holloway arkansas,d.conflicts can also arise from successive representation,particularly when a substantial relationship exists between the cases,such that the factual contexts of the two representations are similar or related.trone smith,cir see also fitzpatrick mccormick,cir.the supreme court,however,has left open the question whether conflicts in successive representation that affect an attorney performance require a showing of prejudice for reversal.see mickens,at.
in this case,after chadwick waived his privilege,the trial judge concluded that no conflict existed,without ever inquiring into the impact the prior representation may have had on houston or on jorgenson performance.indeed,the judge saw no conflict here whatsoever and failed to see how houston has a right to waive anything.because any conflict that existed was houston either to waive or to assert,the trial judge exclusive focus on chadwick was misplaced,rendering the conflict inquiry inadequate.see lockhart terhune,cir.similarly,the nevada supreme court failed to reach the issue of whether jorgenson acted adversely to his current client,or whether his performance prejudiced houston.
the limited record before us reveals that jorgenson expressed concern over jeopardizing chadwick parole status,stated his belief that chadwick had been wrongfully convicted in a case related to the ongoing feud at issue in houston case,and told the judge that his heart is going to be with chadwick.on these facts,the trial judge should have conducted a more complete evidentiary hearing on the potential conflict.as it now stands,the record is insufficient for us to determine whether an actual conflict of interest existed,or whether jorgenson labored under a perceived conflict and limited his cross examination of chadwick as a result.
the proceedings in alberni mcdaniel,cir,cert.denied,d are instructive.in that case,public defender buchanan represented the,flamm,prior to representing alberni.id.at.the earlier case involved a drug exchange between flamm and alberni that led to hostilities,later resulting in the shooting of another man.id.buchanan defended alberni against charges that he murdered this other man and flamm was called as an eyewitness to the altercation.id.counsel told the judge he felt conflicted by the prior representation and therefore unable to cross examine his former client.id.at.the judge obtained a waiver of the privilege from flamm,but not from alberni.id.at.during trial,buchanan failed to impeach flamm through his prior conviction and parole status,among other things.id.at.because the record was incomplete,we remanded for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the attorney performance was adversely affected by the prior representation.id.at.
houston argues that chadwick prior conviction,parole status and failed polygraph exam were available to jorgenson to impeach chadwick credibility,but that jorgenson chose not to use them.as support,houston offers a number of examples in which similar evidence was admitted through various exceptions to nevada evidentiary rules.the state insists,and the dissent would agree,that such evidence was inadmissable under nevada law,so jorgenson could not have used this information during chadwick cross examination but,as we have already stated,chadwick credibility was a particularly important aspect of the case and certainly central to houston defense.we are mindful not to speculate about jorgenson trial strategy,nor whether the trial judge would have admitted the impeachment evidence in this case.what is important is whether jorgenson modified his representation of houston in a way that adversely affected his performance,see id.at lockhart,at,and whether this effect prejudiced houston,whether there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at.on the incomplete record before us,we can not make that determination.
an evidentiary hearing is needed to resolve these factual issues.aedpa allows for an evidentiary hearing when a petitioner alleges facts,which,if proven,would entitle him to relief and shows that he did not receive a full and fair hearing in the state court.see e alberni,at.houston has alleged facts suggesting the existence of a conflict of interest and the prejudicial effect of jorgenson adverse performance,which,if proven,would entitle him to relief under strickland.the trial court failed to fully investigate jorgenson perceived conflict and no state court has held a full and fair hearing on this serious conflict allegation.as a result,the nevada supreme court conclusion that no actual conflict existed is based on an incomplete record,devoid of sworn testimony explaining jorgenson tactical reasons,if any,for not attempting to vigorously impeach chadwick with his parole status or failed polygraph exam.similarly,the district court prematurely determined that jorgenson performance was not adversely affected by a conflict,without hearing from jorgenson on the matter.
we are cognizant of the potential increase in litigation arising from the imputation of one attorney conflict to an entire public defender office.however,the facts of this case are unique and,therefore,unlikely to open any floodgates of imputed conflict claims.this is particularly true because this case concerns a longstanding feud between houston and chadwick and the prior representation at issue here was the direct result of that bad blood.we are confident that allowing further exploration of the fact that jorgenson subjectively felt conflicted and expressed this to the judge will not create a broad rule of imputed disqualification 
we therefore reverse the portion of the district court decision pertaining to the conflict of interest and remand with instructions to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine whether a conflict of interest adversely affected counsel performance and,if so,whether there is a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different in the absence of that effect.see strickland,at.alberni,at.we affirm the remainder of the district court judgment.
affirmed in part,vacated and remanded for an evidentiary hearing.each party shall bear their own costs.
i concur with part ii holding that the trial court denial of the motion to continue was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of morris slappy,d.however,i see no reason to order an evidentiary hearing regarding the alleged violation of houston sixth amendment right to counsel.houston has never requested a hearing.neither has the state.the trial court inquired into the matter,and it is already apparent that houston claim lacks merit.i therefore dissent from part iii of the majority opinion.
the supreme court has established that,absent a showing of prejudice under strickland washington,d,habeas relief can be granted due to the violation of a defendant sixth amendment right to counsel in either of two circumstances first,relief is granted if defense counsel timely objected to concurrent representation of two or more defendants with conflicting interests and the trial court failed to take adequate steps to ascertain whether the risk of conflict was sufficient to require separate counsel.holloway arkansas,d.second,in any other case of multiple concurrent representation,relief is granted only if the defendant demonstrates that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer performance.cuyler sullivan,d see also mickens taylor,d.houston is entitled to an evidentiary hearing if he alleged facts that,if proven,would demonstrate a violation of his rights under holloway or sullivan,and he did not receive a full and fair opportunity to develop those facts.earp ornoski,cir.for the reasons described below,i would hold that houston failed to allege facts that would entitle him to habeas relief under holloway.i would also hold that houston already received a full and fair opportunity to develop the facts regarding his sullivan claim,and that those facts establish the absence of a sixth amendment violation.
an evidentiary hearing regarding the adequacy of the trial court inquiry under holloway clearly is not required.the record already contains a complete transcript of the december hearing during which the trial court inquired into jorgenson alleged conflict of interest.houston does not contend that addi
