a maine jury found horace salley,iii guilty of possession of a firearm following a conviction of misdemeanor domestic violence in violation of g salley appeals claiming prosecutorial misconduct finding no error,we affirm.
background 
the arrest 
horace and skyla salley began dating in may and were married in december of that year skyla had two children from a previous relationship and was pregnant with salley baby at the time of the wedding.from the start,the couple relationship was a tumultuous one and things came to a head on november,when a operator received a domestic assault complaint from skyla,who indicated that salley had a gun.state trooper carmen lilley was dispatched to the couple home in smyrna mills,maine.
upon arrival,lilley met salley in the yard.salley first tried to deny that the call originated from his home but lilley was not buying it.salley then admitted his identity and lilley cuffed him on suspicion of domestic assault.lilley next asked salley three times where his gun was and each time salley denied having a gun or that there was a gun in the house.lilley left a cuffed salley in the squad car and went into the home where he found a visibly shaken skyla with the couple baby in the bedroom.skyla and lilley spoke about what had happened,including the fact that salley had a gun,with which he had previously threatened her.skyla also informed lilley about the specific circumstances surrounding salley obtaining the gun discussed fully below.she then retrieved the gun out of the bedroom closet.
salley was arrested and charged with knowingly possessing a firearm after being convicted of misdemeanor domestic assault.the underlying domestic assault conviction involved an assault against an.at the time of trial,skyla and salley had divorced.
the main focus of the trial was whether the gun that police seized from the salley home a bushmaster bullpup assault rifle was in fact salley.to establish this critical fact,the government first called william steinhagen,who had purchased a bushmaster bullpup rifle at a shop in new hampshire in.steinhagen testified that he traded the rifle sometime around to a man in maine for a chevy.the trade came about when steinhagen answered an advertisement the man had placed in a regional classified ad magazine called uncle henry swap and sell guide.steinhagen traveled to maine to make the trade and though he could not recall the man name,he described his appearance and age as being similar to salley.steinhagen also testified that he called the man cell phone en route to the trade and the government established through cell phone records that the phone number steinhagen called was salley.the uncle henry advertisement was also admitted into evidence and it listed salley cell phone number as the contact number and the town he was living in as the relevant town.steinhagen went on to identify the firearm seized from salley home as the gun that he had purchased and then traded.steinhagen also confirmed that the serial number on the gun seized from the salley home matched the serial number on the paperwork for the gun he bought.
skyla also offered testimony regarding the gun origins.she was with salley,she recalled,when he placed the uncle henry advertisement and when a man called in response to the ad.then in late,skyla went with salley to detroit,maine where she waited in the car while salley met with the man and obtained the gun.skyla thought salley traded his flatbed truck for the gun.
the government also called two of salley acquaintances,david smith and his father,james smith.as david remembered,salley visited the smith home in november with a woman.skyla,being that woman,confirmed this gathering.david indicated that during the visit salley showed them a gun,fired it at an old car in the yard,and let david fire it too.david identified the gun police seized from the salley home as the gun he fired with salley.james smith,david father,also testified that salley came to his home in november and that he caught a glimpse of salley with a gun.james also heard the gun being fired,leading him to believe it was a gun.it was his understanding that salley received the gun via trade in exchange for either his flatbed wrecker or chevy coupe.james said he knew salley from trading items with him.
in addition to testifying about salley acquisition of the gun,skyla also described her and salley.the following testimony is relevant to this appeal.in october,the maine department of health and human services dhhs took skyla oldest child away from her because caseworkers believed that salley was a threat to the child.realizing she had to make a decision between salley and her children and choosing the latter skyla broke it off with salley.her first step was checking into a women shelter and obtaining a order against salley out of fear for her life and safety.skyla obtained the order in december,and in the underlying complaint she claimed salley owned a gun and had threatened her with it.
the couple separation was,and in january the reunited pair moved into the smyrna mills home,which was purchased partially in skyla name.about two weeks after they bought the house,skyla said salley retrieved his gun from a storage unit and brought it into the home where he primarily kept it in his tool room.skyla recalled seeing salley handle the gun and in particular she noted an instance a month before he got arrested where he had the gun in his hands while he sat on the bed in the bedroom.during the month leading up to his arrest,salley,as skyla recounted,threatened more than once to shoot her with the gun.
after the government concluded its case,salley presented a series of witnesses though he chose not to testify himself.salley called among others,dhhs case workers,the realtor who handled the smyrna mills property sale,and neighbors.significant for purposes of this appeal,salley called rebecca hughes,the woman who purchased the salleys smyrna mills home from them.hughes testified that she began moving boxes containing her and her roommates belongings into the home around november,which was just prior to salley arrest.
defense counsel rested and closing arguments followed.the government highlighted the testimony of steinhagen,lilley,and the smiths.the prosecutor argued that this testimony was enough to convict salley,in the event the jury did not find skyla credible.while the prosecutor downplayed skyla significance,defense counsel summation focused on her.essentially,the defense theory was that skyla perhaps in cahoots with david smith connived to put salley in jail in order to keep dhhs off her back and so she could keep the sale proceeds from the smyrna mills home for herself.the jury was convinced and found salley guilty after a short deliberation.
post trial 
four days after the jury issued its verdict,the trial judge sua sponte raised a concern about statements made by the prosecutor during the government closing.the statements were 
prosecutor the bottom line is,the gun that steinhagen bought in new hampshire was recovered from the defendant bedroom on the date alleged in the indictment.there been no suggestion that it was planted there.there been no suggestion that salley did know it was there.
the trial judge expressed concern that this statement might contradict the evidence,imply salley had the burden of proof,be perceived as a comment on salley decision not to testify.apprised of the court concerns,salley filed a motion for a new trial based on the prosecutor statements.
in a written decision,the district court denied salley motion.while the court found that the prosecutor second was inaccurate and that the jury would likely perceive it as a commentary on salley failure to take the stand the court concluded that the error was harmless in light of the cumulative evidence and the court jury instructions.salley appealed the denial of his new trial motion to this court.
standard of review
