jason dirk walton appeals an order of the circuit court of the sixth judicial circuit summarily denying his successive motion to vacate three convictions of murder and corresponding death sentences under florida rule of criminal procedure.under our mandatory jurisdiction to review orders arising from capital proceedings,we affirm the circuit court order.see art.v,b.const.
in his first claim,walton has failed to demonstrate that the state violated his constitutional rights by utilizing inconsistent theories to secure convictions against each of the criminal defendants in this triple homicide.walton also has not established prejudice from the alleged use of a state agent,who did not testify in his second sentencing proceeding.next,the trial court properly denied walton motion for additional public records because each request was either overbroad,collateral,or irrelevant to his postconviction claims.lastly,this court has previously considered and repeatedly rejected the evidence presented by walton in support of his challenge to the constitutionality of florida lethal injection protocol.thus,for the reasons explained below,we affirm the circuit court order summarily denying postconviction relief.
proceedings to date 
conviction and sentencing 
in,jason dirk walton was convicted of three counts of murder in pinellas county.see walton state,so d,walton i armed with guns on a rainy friday night,walton,richard cooper,jeffrey mccoy,and terry van royal entered steven fridella residence with the plan to rob the victim of money and drugs.see so d at walton state,so d,walton ii.once inside the house,they bound and held at gunpoint fridella and two other men,gary peterson and bobby martindale.walton ransacked the house but did not find any money or drugs.with the original plan proving unsuccessful,the three victims were killed by several shotgun blasts.see walton i,so d at.
walton made two statements to the police in which he admitted being present at the time of the homicide but denied any part in the shootings.see id.he told police that although he initiated the idea to commit the intended crime,he tested his handgun before entering the house and it had misfired.see id.he observed van royal and cooper pointing shotguns at the victims.as walton exited the house,he heard several gunshots.see id.
the jury found walton guilty of all three counts of murder.see id.during the first penalty phase,the state introduced the testimony of an alleged jailhouse informant and former cellmate of codefendant cooper.see id.at.the cellmate testified that cooper had indicated walton was the ringleader and had informed cooper that the codefendants were going to eliminate the victims.id.the state also introduced the written confessions of cooper and mccoy.see id.at.following the jury recommendation,the trial court imposed a death sentence for each murder.on direct appeal,this court affirmed the convictions but reversed the death sentences and remanded for a new sentencing hearing because the written confessions constituted hearsay and thus were admitted in violation of walton confrontation rights.see id.at.
during the second sentencing hearing,the state did not introduce the written confessions or the testimony of the jailhouse informant.instead,it again presented walton confession,including the statement that walton turned on the television full blast to prevent the neighbors from hearing the victims scream and that he heard shotgun blasts as he left.walton ii,so d at.a taped statement by mccoy was presented to the jury,which described the four men carefully devising the plan as retaliation because one of the victims had stolen marijuana from walton trailer.see id.a majority of the jury recommended death sentences on all counts,which the trial court imposed and this court affirmed.see walton ii,so d at.
rule and habeas proceedings 
governor martinez signed a death warrant for walton on september,and denied walton request for clemency.thereafter,this court granted a stay of execution for walton to file his first rule motion to vacate his convictions and sentences.the trial court denied walton ensuing motion in the same year,walton filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in this court,in which he claimed error in the penalty phase jury instructions and presented other claims that were also concurrently presented in his motion to vacate on appeal of the order denying the rule motion,walton contended that the circuit court erred when it denied his claim that the prosecutor had utilized inconsistent theories in securing the death sentences against him,which violated his rights under brady maryland,d,and giglio united states,d.of note,walton has also raised this claim in the motion presently under review.this court relinquished jurisdiction,reversed for an evidentiary hearing regarding walton entitlement to various public records,and reserved ruling on the other claims pending disposition of the public records request.see walton iii,so d at.
subsequently,walton filed his third amended motion to vacate based on newly discovered evidence found during the public records litigation.in this motion,it appears that walton retooled his inconsistent theories claim as an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.the circuit court denied the motion after an evidentiary hearing.on appeal,walton raised several additional claims this court affirmed the order and denied the habeas petition.see walton iv,so d at.
successive postconviction proceedings 
in,walton filed a successive motion for postconviction relief based on the discussion of inconsistent prosecutorial theories in bradshaw stumpf,d,and newly discovered affidavits from two witnesses regarding the jail informant alleged role as a state agent.walton also claimed that florida lethal injection protocol violates the eighth amendment based on the newly discovered evidence presented within an article,inadequate anaesthesia in lethal injection for execution,published in the lancet and the american bar association report on the death penalty,evaluating fairness and accuracy in the state death penalty system the florida death penalty assessment report,issued in.in conjunction with his motion,walton filed demands for public records from the department of corrections,the office of the attorney general,and the office of the state attorney,which were met with objections from each entity.the circuit court denied the public records request and entered a separate order summarily denying the motion to vacate.walton now seeks relief from this court,raising four issues related to the motion to vacate and two issues relating to the motion for production of additional public records.
ii.analysis.
a.the state did not use inconsistent theories to secure death sentences against all codefendants.
in bradshaw stumpf,d,the united states supreme court addressed a prosecutor use of inconsistent theories.walton asserts that bradshaw recognized a new constitutional right,which was that the state violates due process if it advances inconsistent positions to secure the same sentence against codefendants.drawing from this newly recognized right,walton now alleges that the state presentation of inconsistent theories in the codefendants cases violated his due process rights.walton asserts that the state contended during his criminal proceedings that he was the ringleader and he ordered the codefendants to shoot the victims.walton then posits,in supposed contrast,that the state argued in the separate trials of his codefendants cooper and van royal that they shot the victims of their own will and thus were not entitled to mitigation for acting under extreme duress or substantial domination by walton at the time of the murders.walton maintains that these alleged inconsistencies subjected him to irreparable prejudice because the state prosecutorial theory and the trial court decision focused on his ringleader role as the basis for imposing the death sentences.
a successive rule motion may be denied without an evidentiary hearing if the records of the case conclusively show that the movant is entitled to no relief.see.f b.this court reviews the circuit court decision to summarily deny a successive rule motion de novo,accepting the movant factual allegations as true to the extent they are not refuted by the record,and affirming the ruling if the record conclusively shows that the movant is entitled to no relief.see state coney,so d.f b.
the record conclusively demonstrates that walton is not entitled to relief because this claim is procedurally barred and meritless.florida rule of criminal procedure d b requires any motion to vacate judgment of conviction and death sentence to be filed within one year after the judgment and sentence become final unless the motion alleges that a fundamental constitutional right,held to apply retroactively,was established after that period.thus,as the circuit court determined,walton claim is procedurally barred because the bradshaw court did not recognize a new fundamental constitutional right that applies retroactively.see van poyck state,so d,raleigh state,so d,see also fotopoulos sec y,dep t of,cir t he bradshaw court did not hold that the use of inconsistent theories in the prosecution of two defendants violates the right to due process.
rather,the united states supreme court specifically declined to rule on the question of whether the prosecutor use of inconsistent theories constituted a due process violation.see bradshaw,at.after concluding that the court of appeals had erroneously held that the prosecutorial inconsistencies voided the guilty plea,the united states supreme court express ed no opinion on whether the prosecutor actions amounted to a due process violation,or whether any such violation would have been prejudicial.id.at.
additionally,walton concedes that he had previously raised versions of this claim in his initial and third motions to vacate,belying any assertion that this is a newly discovered error.see walton iv,so d at walton iii,so d at.in fact,this court has already applied the reasoning of fotopoulos state,so d,to determine that walton trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to rebut the state ringleader argument with the prosecutor statements in cooper trial that it was absolutely ludicrous to fault walton for cooper actions,and that no evidence supported the incredible proposition that walton dominated cooper during the crime.see walton iv,so d at.we held that walton was unable to show prejudice on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim because the 
e vidence introduced at walton trial showed that walton originated the plan to rob the victims on a rainy night,walton armed the group prior to the episode,and walton was the only defendant involved who knew the location of the victims house.in the face of this overwhelming evidence,it is clear that the introduction of two statements by a state attorney in a codefendant trial would not have been overly persuasive.certainly,of this evidence does not undermine our confidence in the outcome.
id.citation omitted.thus,this court has already determined that the alleged inconsistent statements are neither persuasive nor do they undermine our confidence in walton convictions and sentences.this claim is therefore procedurally barred because walton has failed to demonstrate a basis for escaping the time limitation on raising the issue.
even if this claim did not face a procedural bar,it would still fail because the state advanced a wholly consistent theory of the crime in prosecuting the codefendants.the prosecutorial theory that walton was the ringleader and that cooper and van royal were the primary shooters is neither a differing nor an irreconcilable rendition of the factual scenario.in contrast,the state in fotopoulos clearly advanced inconsistent positions,asserting in codefendant deidre hunt case that she was an independent actor voluntarily participating in the murders,yet presenting the central theory in fotopoulus trial that hunt was dominated by fotopoulos.see fotopoulos,so d at see also bradshaw,at.where the state advanced the theory that the defendant was the primary shooter but asserted in the codefendant hearing that the codefendant was the primary shooter.unlike the irreconcilably contrasting theories in fotopoulos and bradshaw,which each court upheld as permissible,the state here did not alter its theory with regard to the identity of the principal shooters.
in raleigh state,so d,this court analyzed a similar claim where the appellant challenged the state theory of the principal actor identity in a double murder.there the prosecutor asserted that the appellant was the principal actor in the murder of both victims.however,during closing argument in the codefendant trial,the prosecutor noted the codefendant had admitted that he killed one of the victims and that the appellant killed the other victim.this court determined that the due process concerns in bradshaw were not present because the state had consistently asserted in both trials that raleigh was a principal actor in the death of one victim and that the statements of the codefendant merely reflected that the codefendant played a greater role in the murder than he initially admitted.the essence of this argument was that the codefendant was no less culpable for the murder of the victim than raleigh.raleigh,so d at.similarly,the prosecutor argument that walton was the ringleader and that cooper and van royal were the shooters was directed to the culpability of each defendant.in asserting that cooper was not under the control and substantial domination of walton when he shot the victims,the prosecutor sought to establish that cooper was no less culpable than walton,who orchestrated the plan that culminated in the triple homicide,and thus cooper was not entitled to mitigation for allegedly acting under duress.
a comparison of the challenged statements in cooper sentencing hearing with those at walton hearing confirms the cohesion of the state theory.at cooper hearing,the state said that cooper 
was ready,posed and willing with his finger on the trigger and he made the decision to pull that trigger and to cock it and to pull the trigger again,and aimed it at a second victim and to cock it again and pull the trigger again and aim it at a third victim and then to reload either the last shot or the fourth shot and to come back in the house and pull the trigger again and then cock it again and eject the shell inside the house.
in walton hearing,the state argued took the handgun,typically he had other people do the dirty work,but unquestionably,he was the ringleader,he was the planner,he was the prime mover among these younger individuals.emphasis supplied.in direct comparison,these statements show the underlying principle and theme that walton was the ringleader and that cooper ultimately pulled the trigger.
as an aside,walton has claimed that this scenario was a total fiction.however,walton own confession,along with the other facts presented during the sentencing hearing,corroborates the state theory that walton organized the criminal episode.therefore,the state did not take an inconsistent position or change course in its theory.raleigh,so d at.in each proceeding resulting from the triple homicide,the state maintained the position that walton was the ringleader and that cooper and van royal were the triggermen.the state did not advance inconsistent theories implicating walton due process rights.thus,we affirm the circuit court summary denial of this claim because walton has failed to demonstrate either a new and fundamental change in constitutional law or that the state used inconsistent theories to secure the death penalty against walton and his codefendants.
any possible error in the alleged failure to disclose the use of a state agent in the sentencing hearing that resulted in the death sentence that was later vacated did not prejudice walton.
walton next contends that the state withheld material and exculpatory evidence tending to prove that a did not testify during either the guilt phase of the trial or the resentencing a state agent,in violation of brady maryland,d,and giglio united states,d.he claims that three affidavits filed in the federal proceedings of codefendant cooper constitute newly discovered evidence supporting this claim.despite the fact that the witness did not testify during the second penalty proceeding,walton asserts that the state failure to disclose the informant status as a state agent prejudiced him because the resentencing order referenced the informant prior testimony.we review de novo the application of the law while giving deference to the trial court on questions of fact.see way state,so d.under this review,it is clear that walton is not entitled to relief on this claim because he has failed to demonstrate any prejudice from the alleged errors.
newly discovered evidence claim 
walton contends that these affidavits constitute newly discovered evidence that the state utilized a state agent to secure incriminating evidence against him and that they lend further support to his brady and giglio claims.to obtain a new trial based on newly discovered evidence,a defendant must meet two requirements first,the evidence must not have been known by the trial court,the party,or counsel at the time of trial,and it must appear that the defendant or defense counsel could not have known of it by the use of due diligence.second,the newly discovered evidence must be of such nature that it would probably produce an acquittal on retrial.see jones state,so d.newly discovered evidence satisfies the second prong of this test if it weakens the case against the defendant so as to give rise to a reasonable doubt as to his culpability.id.at quoting jones state,so d.
under this second prong,walton has failed to demonstrate that these affidavits constitute evidence of such a nature that it would probably produce an acquittal on retrial.to the extent the affidavits suggest that the informant may have assisted as a state agent,they do not outweigh the strong evidence of walton role in the triple homicide,which this court has affirmed.see walton i,so d at.at most,the affidavits suggest that the jailhouse informant told some police officers that he was assisting the state and that he was housed in the section of the jail that included informants.these general allegations,which do not specifically link the informant comments to walton case or even the witness to the resentencing proceeding,can not supersede the plethora of evidence supporting walton convictions and sentences.
even though the informant was not presented as a witness during either the guilt phase of the trial or the resentencing hearing,walton further asserts that the informant testimony nevertheless contaminated the resentencing hearing because the resentencing court included small details about the commission of the crime,such as walton grabbing the victim hair,that were presented only in the informant prior testimony.within the context of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in walton prior appeal,however,this court rejected the contamination argument 
walton seizes upon the trial court determination in its order that walton grabbed one of the victims by the hair,in an attempt to show that the entire resentencing was tainted with evidence from the previous penalty phase reversed in walton i.the state can not identify any source for this information,and there is seemingly no record material from the resentencing proceedings which supports this statement by the trial court.while this presents questions,the inclusion of one errant phrase by the trial court in its sentencing order is not significant evidence that the trial court relied upon the original confessions of mccoy and cooper and,thus,the testimony of the informant who corroborated these confessions in sentencing walton to death.clearly,taken in conjunction with the presence of overwhelming evidence before the court supporting its conclusions as to walton leadership role in the burglary planning,this mistaken statement by the trial court within its final order was harmless.certainly,the trial court final sentencing decision did not hinge upon whether walton actually placed his hands upon a victim hair or not.thus,this error did not contribute to walton sentence,and we conclude that it was harmless under state diguilio,so d.
walton iv,so d at footnote omitted emphasis supplied.thus,walton has failed to establish that these affidavits constitute newly discovered evidence that would probably produce a different outcome.
ii.brady claim 
furthermore,these affidavits do not establish walton claim of a brady violation.nothing in the record regarding the alleged informant speculative use as a state agent undermines our confidence in the verdict or sentences rendered to meet the materiality prong of brady.the state is required,under brady,to disclose material information within its possession or control that is favorable to the defense.see mordenti state,so d.to establish a brady violation,the defendant has the burden to show that favorable exculpatory or impeaching,was willfully or inadvertently suppressed by the state,and because the evidence was material,the defendant was prejudiced.see strickler greene,d.under strickler,the materiality prong of brady requires that the defendant demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability of a different outcome expressed as a probability sufficient to undermine our confidence in the outcome.see id.even if we were to assume that the state erroneously withheld information,walton suffered no prejudice because the informant did not testify during either the guilt phase of the trial or during the resentencing hearing.any possible impeachment of the informant that was not established due to the claim that the state withheld his state agent status can not be deemed material because there was no witness to impeach with the use of the alleged state agent in either the guilt phase of the trial,which resulted in walton judgment of conviction,or during the resentencing hearing that determined his sentence.thus,there is no reasonable probability that the nondisclosure of the informant status would result in a different outcome such as to undermine our confidence in the verdicts or sentences under brady and strickler.
iii.giglio claim 
moreover,the state did not present any testimony from the alleged informant during the guilt phase of the trial or the resentencing hearing,which leaves no reasonable possibility that the use of this testimony could have affected the outcome pursuant to giglio.to establish a giglio violation,it must be shown that the testimony given was false the prosecutor knew the testimony was false and the statement was material.guzman state,so d.this test requires us to consider whether there is any reasonable possibility that the false evidence could have affected the jury verdict or sentencing recommendation.see guzman state,so d.if the state actually presented misleading testimony at the first sentencing hearing,walton still did not suffer any prejudice because the informant did not testify before a jury during the phases of the criminal proceeding that resulted in his judgment of conviction and death sentence.the only hearing during which false testimony from the informant could have been presented was the hearing that resulted in the death sentence that this court later vacated.thus,walton has failed to establish a reasonable possibility that this alleged error could have affected the jury verdict or any sentence under giglio.
we affirm the circuit court summary denial of this claim because the purported newly discovered evidence of a brady or giglio violation lacks any reasonable probability to undermine our confidence under brady or any reasonable possibility that it could have affected the jury verdict or recommendation of a death sentence under giglio.furthermore,the affidavits do not constitute newly discovered evidence of such a nature that it would probably produce an acquittal on retrial.therefore,this claim must also be denied.
iv.public records request 
in conjunction with this claim,walton sought additional public records from the office of the state attorney.walton requested all records,files,documents,notes,pleadings,memoranda,and attorney work product relating to codefendant cooper postconviction proceedings.he also desired access to all records,files,documents,notes,pleadings,
