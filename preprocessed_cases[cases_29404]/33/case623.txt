ii.facts and procedural 
on february,defendant was driving a white ford ranger pickup truck when he mary jo greenlee,injuring her and damaging her mercedes.defendant gave his insurance information to greenlee.officer manual ochoa of the san jose police department responded to a call about the accident.he noted defendant license plate,which had a current registration sticker,and asked for defendant driver license,registration,and proof of insurance,all of which defendant provided.the registration information indicated that his vehicle was owned by sears and roebuck company sears.defendant insurance company was esurance,and the insurance card indicated that it covered a ford vehicle.
greenlee husband,officer stephen greenlee of the san jose police department,also arrived at the scene and observed defendant ford ranger,its license plate,and the damage to his wife car.
on february,greenlee called esurance,reported the accident,and made a claim against the policy identified on defendant insurance card.on february,officer greenlee called esurance and learned that although the insurance policy number was correct,that policy did not cover a vehicle with the license plate number recorded in officer ochoa police report officer greenlee investigated further.he noticed that defendant was not the registered owner of the vehicle whose license plate was on the ford ranger.he then spoke to a manager at sears and advised him that a sears vehicle had been involved in an accident.the manager denied this and brought officer greenlee out to the vehicle yard.parked there was a sears ford van bearing a license plate with the same number as that recorded in officer ochoa police report.the plate did not have a current registration sticker.officer greenlee also noticed that one of the van plates was missing.the manager told officer greenlee that he had given the van registration to defendant along with a new registration sticker to be put on the license plate.he also informed officer greenlee that defendant had later been terminated 
on february,heran flores,an esurance claims representative,called defendant to follow up on greenlee claim and secure a recorded statement about the accident.defendant said that he had been driving a rented ford van.defendant promised to forward a copy of the rental contract,but he never did,and esurance was unable to obtain one.accordingly,esurance denied greenlee claim.
on april,the santa clara county district attorney filed a complaint case no.charging defendant with receipt of stolen property,the license plate count providing false identification to a peace officer count presenting a false registration card count and failing to provide proof of automobile insurance count,subd.a,subd.a.at the preliminary hearing,count was amended to allege providing false information,the proof of insurance and statements that the ford ranger was covered.on july,defendant pleaded no contest to the charges as amended.
on december,the filed a second complaint case no.alleging that on february and,defendant presented a false insurance claim or caused a false claim to be filed,in violation of section,subdivision a.on april,before the preliminary hearing,defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the prosecution was barred under section.on june,the trial court denied the motion,and on july,after the preliminary hearing,defendant was held to answer.on september,defendant pleaded no contest to the charge.
iii.the appeal 
defendant contends that counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to renew the motion to dismiss after the preliminary hearing,an omission that forfeited any claim that the second case was barred by section.
to obtain reversal due to ineffective assistance,a defendant must first show that defense counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,that counsel performance did not meet the standard to be expected of a reasonably competent attorney.people cunningham cal th,strickland washington.second,the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that defendant would have obtained a more favorable result absent counsels shortcomings.people cunningham,supra,cal th at.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.strickland washington,supra,at people staten cal th.
because the defendant bears this burden,a reviewing court will indulge in a presumption that counsel performance fell within the wide range of professional competence and that counsel actions and inactions can be explained as a matter of sound trial strategy.people carter cal th.moreover,where the record on direct appeal does not show the reason for counsel challenged actions or omissions,the conviction must be affirmed unless there could be no satisfactory explanation.people anderson cal th.under such circumstances,a claim of ineffective assistance is generally rejected on direct appeal and more properly raised in a petition for habeas corpus,which can include declarations and other information outside the appellate record that reveal the reasons for the challenged conduct.people mayfield cal th,tactical choices presented on a silent record are better evaluated by way of a petition for writ of habeas corpus and will be rejected on direct appeal.
the record on appeal does not reveal why trial counsel failed to renew the motion to dismiss.however,defendant has included an explanatory letter from counsel as an exhibit to the petition for habeas corpus.
under the circumstances,we shall affirm the judgment on appeal and address defendant claim in connection with our review of the habeas petition.
iv.the habeas petition 
to warrant the issuance of an order to show cause,defendant bears the burden of stating a prima facie case for habeas relief.in re bower cal d.
in his letter,trial counsel explained that after the preliminary hearing,he did not renew the motion because he thought the initial motion would preserve for appeal defendant claim under section.
before unification of the superior and municipal courts,the failure to renew a motion that had been denied before the preliminary hearing forfeited the claims raised in the motion people lilienthal cal d,suppression motion people matthews d,motion for people pendergrass d,motion to disclose confidential informant.this forfeiture rule has survived the unification of the trial court.see people hinds th,people hoffman th,people hart th.
defendant claim of ineffective assistance hinges on whether a renewed motion to dismiss would have been granted.if it would have,then counsel failure to have renewed it after the preliminary hearing would demonstrate ineffective assistance.the omission could not have reflected a reasonable tactical decision and its prejudice would be obvious,in that defendant unnecessarily faced a second prosecution.
applicable principles 
section provides in relevant part an acquittal or conviction and sentence under any one provision of law bars a prosecution for the same act or omission under any other,subd.a.in kellett superior court cal d kellett,the seminal case interpreting the statutory bar against multiple prosecutions,the supreme court held that when the prosecution is or should be aware of more than one offense in which the same act or course of conduct plays a significant part,all such offenses must be prosecuted in a single proceeding unless joinder is prohibited or severance is permitted for good cause.failure to unite all such offenses will result in a bar to subsequent prosecution of any offense omitted if the initial proceedings culminate in either acquittal or conviction and sentence.id.at,fn.omitted.the purpose of the kellett rule is to prevent needless harassment and the waste of public funds through multiple trials based on the same underlying facts.ibid.
there is an exception to the kellett rule where the prosecutor is unable to proceed on the more serious charge at the outset because the additional facts necessary to sustain that charge have not occurred or have not been discovered despite the exercise of due diligence.people davis cal th,davis.for this exception to apply,however,the prosecution must have actually exercised due diligence in searching for additional evidence.id.at.
moreover,kellett does not require,nor do the cases construing it,that offenses committed at different times and at different places must be prosecuted in a single proceeding.people cuevas th,people ward d,people douglas d.rather,the kellett rule is limited to cases where the prosecutor has or can reasonably obtain sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction.davis,supra,cal th at.to give practical meaning to the interpretation of section by kellett,courts have developed and applied an evidentiary test as a guide to determining if the kellett criterion whether the same act or course of conduct plays a significant part with respect to each crime is met w hat matters,rather than abstract definitions of the elements of the respective crimes or the precise moment when one crime was completed is the totality of the facts,examined in light of the legislative goals of penal code sections and,as explained in kellett.more specifically,if the evidence needed to prove one offense necessarily supplies proof of the other the two offenses must be prosecuted together,in the interests of preventing needless harassment and waste of public funds.people hurtado d,fn,quoting people flint d,accord people valli th.
discussion 
defendant notes that all the charges in the first case arose from his course of conduct on february.that course of conduct included providing false insurance information to greenlee and officer ochoa,and that particular conduct was the factual basis underlying his conviction under vehicle code section for providing false information to a peace officer.defendant asserts that giving greenlee false insurance information after the accident with the implication that his insurance would provide coverage caused her to file what turned out to be a false claim against his esurance policy.thus,defendant argues that because the evidence of his conduct on february was essential proof of liability in both cases,section and the kellett rule barred the second prosecution.
the attorney general claims that defendant is mistaken about the conduct underlying the charge in the second case.according to the attorney general,the charge under section,subdivision a for presenting a false insurance claim was not based on defendant course of conduct on february but rather on defendant subsequent false statements on february to the esurance representative about driving a rental vehicle at the time of the accident.thus,because the second case was based on conduct separate and different from the conduct underlying the first case,further prosecution was permisssible.
we reject the attorney general claim.the record,establishes that after the preliminary hearing,the prosecution for violating section,subdivision a could not have been based on defendant false statements to the esurance representative rather,the case proceeded on the evidence that defendant gave greenlee false insurance information which caused her to file a false claim with esurance.
in his motion to dismiss,defendant claimed the second case was barred because the alleged violation of section,subdivision a arose from the same course of conduct for which he was prosecuted in the previous case,and therefore the second prosecution would involve recycling the same evidence,including that he gave false insurance information to greenlee and officer ochoa.he also claimed that all of the facts necessary to prosecute him for presenting a false claim,including his false statements to the esurance representative just days after the accident,were available and could,and should,have been discovered had the prosecutor exercised due diligence.
in opposition to the motion,the prosecutor asserted that the charges under section were based solely on the fact that defendant made false statements to esurance days after the accident,and but for those statements,there would have been no prosecution under section.thus,the evidence necessary to prove the violation of section an insurance policy and false and material statements was separate and distinct from that used to prosecute the crimes charged in the first case.
at the hearing on the motion,the parties reiterated their positions,and the court denied the motion.it adopted the prosecutor theory that the second case was based on different acts committed at a different time than the acts underlying the first case.the case then proceeded to the preliminary hearing.
at the preliminary hearing,officer ochoa testified about what happened when he arrived at the scene of the accident on february,including that defendant gave him registration and insurance information and that later investigation of the license plate on the ford ranger revealed sears to be the registered owner.paul campos,field investigator for esurance,testified that defendant had a standard automobile insurance policy for property damage and personal injury that he may cause while driving a covered vehicle.he said that on february,greenlee filed a claim against defendant esurance policy based on the information defendant had given her.he noted that at that time,defendant ford ranger was not covered because he previously had removed it from his policy.later,an esurance representative called defendant about greenlee claim to discuss the accident.their conversation was recorded and transcribed.
at this point in the hearing,the prosecutor asked campos what defendant had said to the representative.defense counsel raised a hearsay objection to such testimony and the transcript.the court sustained the objection as to both.campos then testified that as a result of defendant statements to the representative,he further investigated greenlee claim and determined that it would have been covered if what defendant had was true.more specifically,campos said that if defendant had provided documentation to show that the accident involved a rental car,then greenlee claim would have been covered.defense counsel raised a hearsay objection to campos last statement.the prosecutor argued that he was not offering it for the truth but only to explain what the insurance company did with greenlee claim.the court accepted the testimony for that limited nonhearsay purpose and not for the truth of its content campos continued and said that defendant told the esurance representative that he had been driving a rental van when the accident happened,and he offered to provide the rental contract.he never did and the company was unable to get a copy.campos conceded that defendant did not himself file or present any claim under his policy related to the accident nor did he sign or submit any documents related to greenlee claim.nevertheless,campos opined that defendant statements to the esurance representative appeared to be an implicit representation that greenlee claim was covered.ultimately,however,her claim was denied.
at the close of testimony,defense counsel claimed that the prosecutor had not shown that defendant knowingly presented or knowingly caused greenlee to present a false claim to esurance.he argued that although defendant gave greenlee bad insurance information,he did not expect her to make a claim or intend to defraud anyone.
the prosecutor noted that section,subdivision a proscribed personally presenting a false claim or causing another to do so.although previously,in opposition to the motion to dismiss,the prosecutor had argued that but for the false statements to the esurance representative there would be no second prosecution,the prosecutor now offered two theories of liability.the prosecutor argued that defendant could be held liable because he gave greenlee false information and caused her to make a claim against esurance based on the representation that the vehicle he was driving was covered italics added alternatively,he argued that what defendant caused here is to be he claimed that he had a vehicle that was rented that would have been covered,and it was not covered because he was driving a rented vehicle,from the evidence.so any way you look at it,it falls within the statute.
presumably because there was no evidence that defendant directly presented an insurance claim,false or otherwise,and because the hearsay evidence of his false statements about a rental van was admitted only to help explain esurance subsequent actions on greenlee claim,the court opined that the prosecutor was proceeding on a cause to be presented theory,people singh th,liability under identical former statute for providing false information that caused lawyer to file an insurance claim.the court then found that there was sufficient evidence to support liability on that theory.
thus,to recap,the court denied the motion to dismiss on the theory that the two cases against defendant were based on entirely different conduct the charges in the first case were based on defendant conduct during the february incident the charge in the second case was based on his false statements to esurance on february.later,however,the court held defendant to answer in the second case on the theory that defendant conduct on february caused greenlee to file a false claim.moreover,defendant could not have been held to answer based on his false statements because evidence of his statements was admitted only for the nonhearsay purpose of explaining esurance subsequent actions on greenlee claim 
given this procedural history,we return to the question of whether a renewed motion to dismiss after the preliminary hearing would have been granted.it seems clear that the prosecutor could not have opposed a renewed motion on the same ground he asserted before,that the second case was based exclusively on defendant false statements to esurance.indeed,at the preliminary hearing,the prosecutor abandoned exclusive reliance on defendant false statements as the basis for the charge.rather,after the preliminary hearing,the factual basis for the second prosecution could only have been defendant course of conduct on february,and more specifically his giving false insurance information to greenlee which caused her to file a false claim.
because that course of conduct was the basis for all of the charges in the first case,section and the kellett rule would have barred a second prosecution based on that same conduct unless the exception for previously unknown or unavailable evidence applied,unless the prosecutor in the first case could not have added a charge under section,subdivision a because additional facts necessary to sustain that charge had not yet occurred or had not been discovered despite the exercise of reasonable diligence.people davis,supra,cal th at.here,the attorney general makes that claim,arguing that even if the first and second cases were based on the same course of conduct,the second prosecution was not barred because there was no evidence the prosecutor knew or should have known about defendant false statements to esurance when she was prosecuting the first case.
before addressing this claim,we review a few cases concerning the exception.
in davis,supra,cal th,the court cited stearns cir stearns for the proposition that a subsequent prosecution is not barred when the government,despite reasonable efforts,has been unable to discover the facts necessary to sustain a conviction on the more serious crime.citation.but this exception applies only when the government acted with due diligence at the outset but was unable to discover the additional facts necessary to sustain the greater charge.citation.davis,supra,cal th at.
in stearns,supra,a married couple disappeared without a trace from an atoll in august.in october,the defendants were found in possession of the couple boat.they claimed the couple had drowned.they were later charged with and convicted of theft of the boat.in,one of the victim bones surfaced along with evidence of foul play,and the defendants were charged with felony murder.they claimed that double jeopardy clause barred the subsequent prosecution.id.at.the court applied an exception to the bar where the state is unable to proceed because the facts necessary to sustain the subsequent charge have not been discovered despite the exercise of due diligence.id.at.the court noted that the exception applied only if relevant facts are discovered after the first prosecution.the government may not take advantage of it unless it acted with due diligence at the outset but was unable to discover additional facts necessary to sustain the greater charge.ibid.
in finding the exception applicable,the court noted that authorities had initially suspected foul play,and a investigative team,including divers,had searched all accessible parts of the atoll for evidence of the couple disappearance,including campsites,buildings and fixtures on the abandoned naval base,land areas,and a lagoon.however,the search produced no evidence or clues.the court recognized that a more thorough and expensive search using different equipment,bloodhounds,and experts may have been possible,but it opined that d ue diligence did not require these extraordinary methods at this remote site,based on the facts known at the time.stearns,supra,at.under these circumstances,the court concluded that the government did not have the facts necessary to sustain the murder charge when defendants were charged and convicted of theft.ibid.
in davis,supra,cal th,davis kidnapped a man,robbed him,and then took his car.the victim reported the incident,and later,davis was arrested while driving the victim car.he was charged with and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of unlawfully taking the car.the next year,davis was jointly prosecuted for both a double murder and the earlier kidnapping and robbery.davis argued that the prosecution for the earlier offenses was barred because they arose from the taking of the car for which he had already been convicted.id.at.in rejecting this argument,the court found that,notwithstanding reasonable investigative efforts at the time,the prosecution could not have proceeded on earlier charges because neither the victim nor anyone else could identify davis as the perpetrator.moreover,the evidence necessary to prosecute him did not exist until after the defendant had already served his misdemeanor sentence,at which time he told a third party how he had obtained the car.id.at.
in in re benny d benny,the probation officer filed a petition alleging that the minor committed an armed robbery and then an amended petition alleging that the minor was an accessory to the same robbery.a hearing was held only on the original petition,and the court found the allegation not true.the probation officer then filed a new petition reflecting the amended charge of accessory.the court found that allegation true.on appeal,however,the court reversed,concluding that the prosecution of the second petition was barred because both petitions were based on the same course of conduct and involved the same witnesses and evidence.the court observed that t he prosecutor,representing the probation officer,should have become aware early in his investigation of the facts leading to the filing of the initial petition that the minor course of conduct might involve him as an accessory as well as a principal in the robbery.the probation officer testified that prior to the filing of the original petition he possessed the arrest report of the police.at the hearing of the first petition the prosecutor,in response to objection to hearing this petition in its amended form,advised the court that the allegations of the original petition and those of the amended petition involved basically the sam
