discussion 
appellant contends the trial court erred by granting respondents motion for judgment on the pleadings.

we independently review the trial court ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings to determine whether the complaint states a cause of action.gerawan farming,lyons cal th,d.in doing so,we accept as true the plaintiff factual allegations and construe them liberally.id.at,d.if the trial court ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings is correct upon any theory of law applicable to the case,we will affirm it,even if we may disagree with the trial court rationale.schabarum california legislature th,d.
in order to plead a claim for interference with prospective economic advantage,a plaintiff must allege an economic relationship between it and a third party that carries a probability of future economic benefit to the plaintiff,defendant knowledge of the relationship,intentional acts by the defendant designed to disrupt the relationship,actual disruption of the relationship,and economic harm to the plaintiff proximately caused by the defendant acts.korea supply lockheed martin cal th,d,korea supply.in addition,the plaintiff must allege that the defendant conduct was wrongful by some measure beyond the fact of the interference itself.della penna toyota motor sales,cal th,d,fn citation omitted della penna.in this context,an act is independently wrongful if it is unlawful,that is,if it is proscribed by some constitutional,statutory,regulatory,common law,or other determinable legal standard.korea supply,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.the conduct must be independently actionable.the act of interference with prospective economic advantage is not tortious in and of itself,but requires pleading that a defendant has engaged in an act that was independently wrongful in order to distinguish lawful competitive behavior from tortious interference.ibid.
respondents motion for judgment on the pleadings only challenged the sufficiency of the wrongful conduct allegation in the first amended complaint.the first amended complaint alleged that insignia interference was wrongful because it violated the rules of the association,which applied to the property listing because the listing agent,cb richard ellis,was an association member and placed the listing on the association multiple listing service.the first amended complaint specifically alleged that the association rules prohibited an associate from inserting himself or herself into a transaction or potential transaction initiated by another associate and using tactics calculated to interfere with the first associate relationship with the client.it alleged that,although insignia was not a member of the association,it subjected itself to the rules by virtue of conducting negotiations on behalf of a client on an association listing.
the first amended complaint further alleged insignia interference was wrongful because it violated business and professions code section and constituted an unfair business practice in that such practice is unfair,unethical,oppressive,and unscrupulous when balanced against the injury caused stevenson versus the justification for such conduct by defendants.it also alleges insignia conspired with the others to violate the association rules,and this conspiracy constituted an unfair business practice under business and professions code section.
respondents motion for judgment on the pleadings argued,inter alia,that the first amended complaint did not adequately plead wrongful conduct because insignia was not bound by the association rules.to support this proposition,the motion relied upon definitions and other provisions of the rules not pled in the first amended complaint.the t
