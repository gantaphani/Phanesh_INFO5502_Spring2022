the question presented by this case is whether,assuming the other elements of the tort are established,an attorney may be held liable for malicious prosecution when he commences a lawsuit properly but then continue s to prosecute it after learning it is not supported by probable cause we conclude an attorney may be held liable for continuing to prosecute a lawsuit discovered to lack probable cause.
factual and procedural 
the instant case for malicious prosecution is based upon a lawsuit the fraud lawsuit brought by patricia brookes brookes who is named as a defendant in this case but is not a party to this jerome zamos and odion okojie collectively zamos.zamos had represented brookes in another lawsuit the foreclosure lawsuit arising from the foreclosure on her house.jerome zamos and okojie practiced law together.jerome zamos was the attorney who primarily represented brookes in the foreclosure lawsuit,although okojie made some appearances in that case.
after a jury trial of the foreclosure lawsuit,when it appeared that the jury was deadlocked,brookes settled the lawsuit against some of the defendants in that case in exchange for paid by those settling defendants as damages for emotional distress.out of that,zamos received as a contingency fee,and brookes received.as part of the settlement,brookes expressly released all claims to her house.the terms of the settlement agreement were stated on the record before the court at two separate hearings.brookes appeared by telephone at the first hearing,held on october,and appeared personally at the second hearing,held on october.
almost two years later,in,brookes sued zamos for fraud,among other claims,based upon certain alleged representations zamos made to induce her to settle the foreclosure lawsuit.brookes alleged that jerome zamos told her that he would continue to represent her to judgment against the nonsettling defendants in the foreclosure lawsuit,he would substitute into and represent brookes in a malpractice lawsuit brookes filed against her former attorneys the malpractice lawsuit,he would have her house returned to her,and he would withdraw from representing her in the foreclosure lawsuit if brookes did not accept the settlement.brookes also alleged,among other things,that zamos never intended to keep his first three promises and that zamos withdrew from representing her against the nonsettling defendants,never substituted into the malpractice lawsuit,and never tried to have her house returned to her.
james stroud,van do,and their law firm,stroud do collectively stroud represented brookes in the fraud lawsuit.in october,shortly after brookes fraud lawsuit was served on odion okojie,zamos sent to stroud reporter transcripts of three hearings in the foreclosure lawsuit,which transcripts zamos contended proved that brookes fraud claim had no merit.the first two hearings reflected in the transcripts were those held on october,and october,and the transcripts show that brookes was told and agreed that she was releasing all claims to her house and that zamos would not substitute into the malpractice lawsuit.the third hearing,held on january,was a hearing on zamos motion to be relieved as counsel in the foreclosure lawsuit.during that hearing,jerome zamos explained that he had submitted all of the paperwork necessary for entry of default against the nonsettling defendants,and the trial court explained to brookes that zamos would be relieved as counsel and that brookes would be responsible for bringing the default to judgment.when the trial court asked brookes whether there was a problem with relieving zamos as counsel,brookes responded,no,not really.the transcript even shows that brookes contended that zamos was never her attorney of record,and she complained that zamos forced her to come into court for the hearing she asked the court,why could he just send me whatever to be relieved of counsel a short time later,brookes told the court,i do care if you sign him off or not.he never been on.
after stroud and brookes refused to dismiss the fraud lawsuit against zamos despite these transcripts,zamos moved for summary judgment.in opposition to zamos motion for summary judgment,stroud submitted a declaration signed by brookes in which brookes stated,among other things,that she agreed to settle the foreclosure lawsuit in reliance upon zamos promises to continue representing her against the nonsettling defendants,represent her in the malpractice lawsuit,and have her house returned to her.the trial court questioned whether brookes could establish that she was damaged as a result of zamos alleged fraud,but the court nonetheless denied zamos motion,although it did so reluctantly,finding that brookes declaration raised a triable issue of fact regarding whether zamos made the alleged promises.
brookes fraud lawsuit proceeded to trial before a judge who had not been the judge in any of the other proceedings in that case.before the trial began,the trial judge informed the parties that he had read the transcripts of the three hearings discussed above in preparation for ruling on several motions.based on the judge understanding of brookes anticipated testimony,he warned stroud several times that he needed to advise brookes of her fifth amendment rights,and that he would notify the district attorney office if brookes testimony at trial contradicted those transcripts because such testimony would be perjurious.
carl taylor and nancy peterson testified at the trial.apparently although the record is not entirely clear,brookes was unable to testify due to health reasons,and zamos had to put on the defense before the plaintiff was completed.when brookes failed to appear after all other witnesses had completed their testimony,stroud asked for a continuance to allow her an additional opportunity to appear.the trial court denied stroud request and granted zamos motion for a nonsuit.in granting the motion,the court found that,even if brookes testified in accordance with the offers of proof that had been made,no reasonable jury would ever provide a judgment for brookes.in addition,the court found that,based upon the transcripts of the hearings regarding the settlement of the foreclosure lawsuit,brookes settlement of that lawsuit acts as a bar probably in the form of estoppel to brookes fraud lawsuit.
following entry of judgment in the fraud lawsuit,zamos filed the instant malicious prosecution action against brookes,stroud,taylor,and peterson.zamos alleged on information and belief that taylor encouraged brookes to file the fraud lawsuit against zamos and engaged stroud to represent brookes,and that peterson urged brookes to file the fraud lawsuit and gave false testimony to assist brookes in prosecuting the lawsuit.zamos also alleged that defendants prosecuted the fraud lawsuit to extort an unwarranted settlement by zamos.
stroud,taylor,and peterson filed a joint motion in which they argued that zamos could not show a reasonable probability of success on the malicious prosecution claim.stroud asserted that zamos can not show that the fraud lawsuit was brought without probable cause because stroud decision to file the action was based upon brookes statements regarding zamos alleged promises corroboration by peterson and,to a lesser degree,by taylor and the timing of zamos alleged promises,zamos receipt of the contingency fee from the settlement,and zamos motion to be relieved as counsel in the foreclosure lawsuit.taylor and peterson asserted that zamos could not hold them liable for malicious prosecution because their sole involvement with the fraud lawsuit was as witnesses,and thus they were protected by the litigation privilege.
in opposition to the motion,zamos presented evidence that shortly after the fraud lawsuit was filed stroud received the transcripts that zamos contended gave notice to stroud that the fraud lawsuit had no merit.zamos also presented evidence that taylor sought counsel to represent brookes in the fraud lawsuit and gave assistance to stroud during peterson deposition.taylor graduated from law school,although apparently he is not a licensed attorney.zamos contended that this evidence show ed that taylor was actively involved in maliciously prosecuting the fraud lawsuit.finally,zamos presented evidence that peterson was not present or within hearing distance when jerome zamos spoke with brookes about the settlement agreement in the foreclosure lawsuit,and therefore peterson is liable for malicious prosecution because her assertion that she heard zamos make the alleged promises at issue in the fraud lawsuit was demonstrably false.
the trial court granted the motion as to all of the moving parties.as to stroud,the court found that stroud had probable cause to bring the lawsuit based upon brookes representations that were corroborated by taylor and peterson.the court held that taylor and peterson were immune from liability under the common law witness immunity doctrine set forth in briscoe lahue,d and silberg anderson cal d.the court awarded in attorney fees to taylor and in attorney fees to peterson.zamos timely appealed from the trial court order dismissing the entire action against stroud,taylor,and peterson and awarding attorney fees.
the court of appeal affirmed the dismissal as to taylor and peterson,holding that zamos failed to meet their burden to demonstrate that their malicious prosecution claim would succeed against taylor and peterson.however,the court of appeal reversed the dismissal as to stroud,hold ing that zamos met his burden with respect to stroud because it concluded that an attorney may be liable for malicious prosecution if the attorney continues to prosecute a lawsuit after discovery of facts showing the lawsuit has no merit.
both plaintiffs jerome zamos and odion okojie and defendants james stroud and van do petitioned this court for review.defendants petition was granted plaintiffs petition was denied.
we affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.
ii.discussion 
interface between statute and malicious prosecution 
code of civil procedure section,the statute,provides in relevant part a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim,subd.b.under this statute,the party moving to strike a cause of action has the initial burden to show that the cause of action aris es from an act in furtherance of the moving party right of petition or free speech.equilon,supra,cal th at,d.once that burden is met,the burden shifts to the opposing party to demonstrate the probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.code civ,subd.b equilon,supra,cal th at,d.to satisfy this prong,the plaintiff must state and substantiate a legally sufficient claim.citation.put another way,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.citation.jarrow formulas,lamarche cal th,d,fn.omitted jarrow formulas.
the parties agree that plaintiffs malicious prosecution action arises from acts in furtherance of defendants right of petition or free speech thus,the issue is whether plaintiffs presented evidence in opposition to defendants motion that,if believed by the trier of fact,was sufficient to support a judgment in plaintiffs favor.whether plaintiffs have established a prima facie case is a question of law.wilson parker,covert chidester cal th,d,wilson in deciding the question of potential merit,the trial court considers the pleadings and evidentiary submissions of both the plaintiff and the defendant code civ,subd.b though the court does not weigh the credibility or comparative probative strength of competing evidence,it should grant the motion if,as a matter of law,the defendant evidence supporting the motion defeats the plaintiff attempt to establish evidentiary support for the claim.
liability for continuing to prosecute lawsuit found to lack merit 
previously,this court has characterized one of the elements of the tort of malicious prosecution as commencing,bringing,or initiating an action without probable cause.to establish a cause of action for the malicious prosecution,of a civil proceeding a plaintiff must plead and prove that the prior action was commenced by or at the direction of the defendant and was pursued to a legal termination in his,plaintiff,favor citations was brought without probable cause citations and was initiated with malice citations.bertero national general cal d,bertero.crowley katleman cal th,d,crowley,italics added.
defendants contend continuing to prosecute a lawsuit discovered to lack probable cause does not constitute the tort of malicious prosecution,and in making this argument they rely heavily on the torts being a disfavored cause of action.
the tort of malicious prosecution is disfavored both because of its potential to impose an undue chilling effect on the ordinary citizen willingness to report criminal conduct or to bring a civil dispute to court sheldon appel albert oliker cal d,sheldon appel and because,as a means of deterring excessive and frivolous lawsuits,it has the disadvantage of constituting a new round of litigation itself id.at.wilson,supra,cal th at,d.for these reasons,we have declined to extend the scope of the tort.crowley,supra,cal th at,d,sheldon appel,at.
on the other hand,we have cautioned that this convenient phrase,the characterization of malicious prosecution as a disfavored cause of action,should not be employed to defeat a legitimate cause of action or to invent new limitations on the substantive right,which are without support in principle or authority.bertero,supra,cal d at,see crowley,supra,cal th at,d.
confining the tort of malicious prosecution to the initiation of a suit without probable cause would be,we conclude,without support in authority or in principle.
the question we address today is a question of first impression in this court,and was first addressed by a california court of appeal only two years ago however,so far as our research reveals,the rule in every other state that has addressed the question is,and in many states has long been,that the tort of malicious prosecution does include continuing to prosecute a lawsuit discovered to lack probable cause.
over years ago the drafters of the restatement second of torts restatement stated that one who continues a civil proceeding that has properly been begun or one who takes an active part in its continuation for an improper purpose after he has learned that there is no probable cause for the proceeding becomes liable as if he had then initiated the proceeding,com.c.indeed,almost years ago corpus juris,in reciting the elements of an action for malicious prosecution,stated the first element as the commencement or continuance of an original criminal or civil judicial proceeding.malicious prosecution,italics added see.malicious prosecution.
the restatement position on this question has been adopted or was anticipated by the courts of a substantial number of states alabama laney glidden,so,arizona smith lucia,arkansas mclaughlin cox,colorado slee simpson,idaho badell beeks idaho,iowa wilson hayes iowa,kansas nelson miller,mississippi benjamin hooper electronic supply,so d,fn.new york broughton state of new york,ohio siegel scott sons ohio ohio app,oregon wroten lenske,pennsylvania wenger philips,and washington banks nordstrom.
even more significantly,defendants have not brought to our attention,nor has our own research revealed,a single state that has declined to adopt the restatements view in this regard.
defendants position,that the tort of malicious prosecution does not include continuing a lawsuit discovered to lack probable cause,is no more supported by the decisions of this court than it is by authority.
defendants rely upon two decisions of division seven of the second,supra,th,d and vanzant,supra,th,d.in,the plaintiff in a malicious prosecution action contended a party can be held liable for malicious prosecution even if he or she first becomes aware of facts that negate the claim after the litigation is commenced,at,d.reiterating the position it had taken five months earlier in vanzant,division seven of the second district court of appeal rejected the contention.id.at,d.vanzant relied upon this courts decision in coleman gulf ins.group cal d,coleman for the proposition that california courts have typically refused to permit malicious prosecution claims where,as here,the claim is based on the continuation of a properly initiated existing proceeding.vanzant,at,d.
coleman is distinguishable.in order to establish a cause of action for malicious prosecution,a plaintiff must prove the prior action was commenced by or at the direction of the defendant in the malicious prosecution action.citation.coleman,supra,cal d at,italics added.in coleman,the underlying action was commenced by the plaintiffs in the malicious prosecution action.therefore,in order to establish their cause of action against the defendant insurer for malicious prosecution,the plaintiffs argued that the insurer,in maliciously causing the defendant to file a frivolous appeal,caused the initiation of a separate action.this is the argument the coleman court rejected.
in the underlying action in coleman,the survivors of a man who drowned in a city swimming pool brought a wrongful death action against the city and were awarded in damages.during the pendency of the city appeal,the city insurer offered the plaintiffs less than half the judgment award to settle,and plaintiffs declined,but later accepted a settlement of.the plaintiffs then sued the insurer,which allegedly controlled all aspects of the defense,on the ground,among others,of malicious prosecution,claiming the appeal had been frivolous,designed solely to force the plaintiffs to settle for a fraction of the judgment and to enable the insurer to realize interest earnings during the pendency of the appeal based on the differential between the statutory rate of interest and the market rate.coleman,supra,cal d at.
the coleman court distinguished bertero,supra,cal d.in bertero,this court held malicious prosecution may include maliciously filing a.by seeking affirmative relief through a,the bertero court pointed out,the defendants did more than attempt to repel the plaintiff attack they took the offensive in attempting to prosecute a cause of action of their own.bertero,at.by contrast,the coleman court held,filing an appeal is not a separate proceeding and has no independent existence citation it is merely the continuation of an action.citation.based on the reasoning of bertero,a defendant appeal can not be considered a separate action seeking affirmative relief,but rather is merely the continuation of an attempt to repel plaintiff attack.coleman,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.
the operative distinction,then,is between continuing a prosecution and continuing a defense.in coleman,the defendant in the malicious prosecution action had merely continued its defense of the underlying wrongful death action by causing the filing of the appeal in that action here,according to the evidence presented in opposition to the motion,defendants in the malicious prosecution action continued their prosecution of the underlying fraud action after learning it was baseless.
just as it is without support in authority,the limitation defendants urge is also without support in principle.malicious prosecution is actionable because it harms the individual against whom the claim is made,and also because it threatens the efficient administration of justice.bertero,supra,cal d at,see crowley,supra,cal th at,d.continuing an action one discovers to be baseless harms the defendant and burdens the court system just as much as initiating an action known to be baseless from the outset.see harper et,the law of torts ed,clearly,it is as much a wrong against the victim and as socially or morally unjustifiable to take an active part in a prosecution after knowledge that there is no factual foundation for it,as to instigate such a proceeding in the first place.as the court of appeal in this case observed,it makes little sense to hold attorneys accountable for their knowledge when they file a lawsuit,but not for their knowledge the next day.
moreover,as the court of appeal went on to point out,holding attorneys liable for the damages a party incurs as a result of the attorneys prosecuting civil claims after they learn the claims have no merit also will encourage voluntary dismissals of meritless claims at the earliest stage possible.because an attorney will be liable only for the damages incurred from the time the attorney reasonably should have caused the dismissal of the lawsuit after learning it has no merit,an attorney can avoid liability by promptly causing the dismissal of,or withdrawing as attorney in,the lawsuit.this will assist in the efficient administration of justice and reduce the harm to individuals targeted by meritless claims.moreover,by advising a client to dismiss a meritless case,the attorney will serve the client best interests in that the client will avoid the cost of fruitless litigation,and the client exposure to liability for malicious prosecution will be limited.
defendants contend our malicious prosecution includes continuing to prosecute a lawsuit discovered to lack probable be unworkable and therefore contrary to public policy.defendants assert the holding would be unworkable because it would divert an attorney attention away from the zealous representation of his or her client by causing the attorney continually to the merits of the litigation and to fear retaliation for malicious prosecution if the attorney argues for an extension of the law.we disagree.only those actions that any reasonable attorney would agree are totally and completely without merit may form the basis for a malicious prosecution suit.wilson,supra,cal th at,d,sheldon appel,supra,cal d at.the same standard will apply to the continuation as to the initiation of a suit.applying the standard in any given case may be very difficult.however,applying it to the decision to continue to prosecute a case should be no more or less difficult than applying it to the decision to initiate a case 
for the reasons stated,we conclude an attorney may be held liable for malicious prosecution for continuing to prosecute a lawsuit discovered to lack probable cause.
defendants prima facie liability 
as we stated earlier,the parties agree that plaintiffs malicious prosecution action arises from acts in furtherance of defendants right of petition or free speech.thus,the issue is whether plaintiffs presented evidence in opposition to defendants motion that,if believed by the trier of fact,was sufficient to support a judgment in plaintiffs favor.plaintiffs,we conclude,did make the required showing.
as the court of appeal observed,whether the facts known to stroud constituted probable cause to prosecute the fraud lawsuit is a question of law.wilson,supra,cal th at,d.the court must make an objective determination of the reasonableness of stroud conduct,to determine whether,on the basis of the facts known to stroud,the institution and prosecution of the fraud lawsuit was legally tenable.sheldon appel,supra,cal d at.the test applied to determine whether a claim is tenable is whether any reasonable attorney would have thought the claim tenable.id.at.in the present case,stroud presented evidence in support of the motion to show that the facts available to stroud at the time the lawsuit was filed were sufficient to support a cause of action for fraud.but in opposition to the motion,zamos presented evidence that stroud was given transcripts shortly after the fraud lawsuit was filed that,zamos contends,show s that stroud knew or should have known that the fraud lawsuit had no merit.
zamos alleged promise to represent brookes in the foreclosure action 
brookes alleged that jerome zamos told her he would continue to represent her against the nonsettling defendants in the foreclosure lawsuit.however,at the january,hearing,the judge advised brookes there was a motion pending to relieve zamos in the foreclosure
