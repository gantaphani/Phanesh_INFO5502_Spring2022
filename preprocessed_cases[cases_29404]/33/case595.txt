defendant anthony achilles poletti was accused by his victim of subjecting her to a variety of acts of sexual molestation when she was between the ages of and years old.those acts included rape,forced oral copulation,and other forms of child sexual abuse.
in,a jury convicted defendant of fifteen felonies,including rape,forcible lewd acts upon a child,aggravated sexual assault upon a child by oral copulation,aggravated sexual assault upon a child by sexual penetration,dissuading a witness from reporting a crime,and possession of child pornography.the jury acquitted defendant,however,of raping victim during the winter break of her freshman year of high school winter break rape.
on appeal following defendant initial trial,this court reversed.we directed the trial court on remand to enter a verdict of acquittal of a rape alleged to have taken place in june,citing a lack of substantial evidence supporting the charge.we ordered a retrial on the remaining sexual abuse charges on juror misconduct grounds.because the convictions for dissuading a witness from reporting a crime and possession of child pornography were unaffected by any error,we directed the court to enter verdicts of conviction on those counts.
at defendant second trial,although the alleged winter break and june rapes were not charged,evidence of them was admitted both to attack and bolster victim credibility.the jury found defendant guilty of two counts of forcible lewd touching of a child under age and hung on nine other charges of child sexual abuse.the trial court sentenced defendant to years eight months in prison.
on appeal,defendant contends the trial court erred by admitting evidence of the uncharged winter break and june rapes without informing the jury of his prior acquittals.defendant also raises several claims of prosecutorial misconduct and asserts cumulative error.though we affirm the judgment,we find that several instances of prosecutorial misconduct took place and we are reporting the prosecuting attorney conduct to the state bar of california.
i.factual and procedural background 
defendant is charged 
the santa cruz county district attorney filed a count information against defendant in august.it charged defendant with five counts of forcible lewd acts upon a child under age,subd.b,counts,aggravated sexual assault upon a child under age by rape,subd.a,count aggravated sexual assault upon a child under age by oral copulation,subd.a,count forcible oral copulation,subd.c,count two counts of aggravated sexual assault upon a child under age by sexual penetration,subd.a,counts three counts of forcible rape,subd.a,counts,two counts of forcible lewd acts upon a child aged or,subd.c,counts dissuading a witness from reporting a crime,subd.b,count and possession of child pornography,subd.a,count.
the alleged victim of the charged sexual abuse was defendant.
b.the first trial and appeal 
defendant was tried and convicted of all but two of the charged offenses.he was acquitted of one count of forcible rape count and one count of lewd acts upon a child aged or count.both of those charges related to the alleged winter break rape.the trial court sentenced defendant to years eight months in prison.
on appeal,this court reversed.in a nonpublished opinion,we concluded juror misconduct had occurred that required reversal of counts of various forms of child molestation.we also concluded that no substantial evidence supported the conviction on count for forcible rape in june.in reaching the latter conclusion,we noted that the basis for that count was an incident that victim testified occurred in june,just after she had turned years old.people poletti,nonpub.opn.unpub.lexis poletti.on direct examination,victim had testified that defendant came into her bedroom,pulled her into her bathroom,pushed her against the counter,took her pants down,and took his penis and rubbed it in her butt.and after that she remember ed him sticking it inside her vagina.id.at.on,however,victim had denied being raped during the june incident and explained that her direct testimony referred to a rape that occurred over her freshman year winter break.id.at.the alleged winter break rape was the basis for counts and,of which defendant was acquitted.id.at.victim testified that incident occurred sometime during winter break after the new year when she was a freshman in high school.id.at.on,victim confirmed that the incident occurred shortly after january,during a break that had begun just before christmas.id.at.even when confronted with hospital records showing defendant was hospitalized between december,and january,she insisted the incident took place in the first few days of.ibid.
in view of victim contradictory accounts of the june incident,this court concluded that the evidence supporting defendant conviction on that count was not sufficient to overcome the presumption of innocence and to meet the burden resting upon the prosecution to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.poletti,supra,at.
the convictions on counts and for dissuading a witness and possession of child pornography were not impacted by the errors.accordingly,we directed the trial court on remand to enter a verdict of acquittal on count,enter verdicts of conviction on counts and,and retry the assaultive counts.poletti,supra,at.
c.the second trial 
defendant was retried in august and september.he was retried on five counts of forcible lewd acts upon a child under age,subd.b,counts,four counts of aggravated sexual assault upon a child under age,subd.a,counts,forcible oral copulation,subd.c,count forcible rape,subd.a,count former count and forcible lewd acts upon a child aged or,subd.c,count former count.
defense motion to admit evidence of victim testimony at the first trial regarding the alleged winter break rape and june rape 
before the second trial,defendant moved to admit evidence regarding the alleged winter break and june rapes to undermine victim credibility.the prosecutor objected only to the admission of evidence that defendant was acquitted of those rapes,in part because defendant was being retried on former count,which charged the june incident as forcible lewd acts,rather than as rape.with respect to the admission of evidence of the two uncharged rapes,the prosecutor stated that victim frankly will be testifying on direct about all of these incidents.and so i you know,he not charged with anything from around christmas time,the alleged winter break rape.there going to be some testimony about that.with respect to the june event,he is charged with that event and there going to be testimony about that.the court granted defendant motion and prohibited the parties from mentioning the first trial or any convictions or acquittals.
victim,who was years old at the time of the second trial,testified that defendant,her,began molesting her when she was or years old.the molestation was random in that a lot of time would pass between incidents.victim testified about nine specific incidents that occurred in the home she shared with her mother,and two.
the first molestation,when victim was or years old,occurred in the downstairs bathroom.defendant pulled down victim pants and rubbed his penis up and down her butt crack.victim did not remember how the incident ended.on,she acknowledged that she told an investigator in that the incident ended when the front door opened.she acknowledged that could have happened because the front door was right by the downstairs bathroom.victim explained that she told the investigator that the front door opening prompted the incident to end because she was trying to find a reason for why it had ended and that seemed like the closest to the truth.the first incident was the basis for the count charge of forcible lewd acts upon a child under age.
the second incident also occurred in the downstairs bathroom when victim was about years old.defendant pushed her against the wall,removed her pants and shirt,rubbed his penis around her vagina,and inserted it into her vagina.victim put her clothes back on and tried to leave but defendant blocked her way.he then pushed her down,put his penis in her mouth,and moved his hips back and forth.those events formed the basis for counts through,which charged defendant with two counts of forcible lewd acts upon a child under age and two counts of aggravated sexual assault upon a child under age.
the third incident victim recalled took place in the master bedroom when she was about years old.she was wearing her mother lingerie and defendant used a video camera to film himself penetrating her vagina with his fingers.in connection with that alleged conduct,defendant was charged with one count of forcible lewd acts upon a child under age count and one count of aggravated sexual assault upon a child under age count.
the fourth incident,which occurred a few months after the third,also involved a video camera.defendant and victim were in the master bathroom.victim was up against the wall with her back to the defendant.he made her spread her legs apart and again filmed himself penetrating her vagina with his fingers.victim conceded on that she had previously testified that her back was against the wall.she explained the discrepancy by saying that t hese things happened a lot and she had a hard time keeping the incidents straight.the fourth incident formed the basis for counts and,which charged defendant with aggravated sexual assault upon a child under age and forcible lewd acts upon a child under age,respectively.
the fifth incident victim recounted involved uncharged conduct.victim testified that the defendant came into the bathroom while she was showering,pulled back the shower curtain,and took pictures of her.
victim was approximately years old at the time of the sixth incident the winter break rape.a round winter break,defendant took her into the upstairs bathroom and pushed her against the counter.from behind,he pulled down her pants and she felt his penis pressing into her vagina.when asked whether he penetrated her vagina victim responded,i mean,i remember it hurting.so i think a little bit but i do the prosecutor asked victim did you used to believe that event had taken place a couple days after new year defense counsel objected to the question as leading.after that objection was sustained,the following exchange took place between the prosecutor and victim 
q at any time have you said that event took place a couple days after new year 
q and do you still believe that event happened a couple days after new year 
q and why is that 
a because there were records that he was in the hospital.in the last hearing they showed records 
victim further explained,i mean,i know it could have taken place during that time now because he,like,there were records of him being in the hospital but i know that the event happened.i just it just must have happened at a different time.defendant was not charged in the second trial in connection with the alleged winter break rape.
on,defense counsel confronted victim with her testimony at the first trial which was referred to as a prior hearing at the second trial that the rape occurred a few days into.she responded that she had been mistaken about the time it had taken place.she claimed not to recall insisting in the prior proceeding that the rape had taken place shortly after new years even after being shown hospital records indicating the defendant was in the hospital at that time.
victim next testified to a seventh incident that occurred in june when she was years old.defendant came into her bedroom and grabbed her.she tried to resist but he overpowered her and pushed her against the counter in the upstairs bathroom.he covered her eyes,pulled her pants down,and put his penis in her vagina.on,defense counsel confronted victim with her testimony about the june incident at the first trial when she said on direct that she was raped but then denied it on.victim explained that on in the prior proceeding she was confused and thought defense counsel was asking about a different incident.the seventh incident was the basis for count former count,charging defendant with forcible lewd acts upon a child aged or.
the victim testified about an eighth incident,alleging defendant made her orally copulate him in the master bedroom.when she said she did not want to perform the act he offered to dip his penis in juice to make it taste better.he then put his penis in her mouth.victim could not remember when the eighth incident occurred.she acknowledged on that she had not mentioned the detail about defendant offer to dip his penis in juice at the prior hearing or to investigators.the oral copulation was charged in count.
lastly,victim testified that when she was or years old defendant was helping her assemble a bed in her bedroom.he pulled down her pajama pants and snapped a picture with his cell phone.victim heard her mother and defendant fighting about the photo the following day.defendant said a friend had sent it to him.victim mother asked victim if the photo depicted her.afraid to tell the truth because defendant was present and looked angry,victim said no.defendant was not charged in connection with that incident.
victim testified that she never told her mother about the molestation because she worried her mother would get angry or disbelieve her.she did not tell her father,with whom she lived half the time,because she feared hurting or disappointing him.the first person victim confided in about the abuse was her best friend,tori.victim first told tori about the abuse when they were both in the eighth grade.victim could not recall the specifics of those conversations other than that tori urged victim to report the abuse to an authority figure.
when victim was a freshman or sophomore in high school the guardian of her friend,jessica,called victim father and informed him that victim might have been abused by defendant.victim father discussed the call with victim and she told him it had only happened once and not to tell her mother.victim falsely told tori that her father was not going to do anything about the abuse because money was tight and it would be hard without the financial help from my mom.victim testified she did not lie to tori her father had mentioned money issues in a prior conversation and she used it as an excuse not to have to tell tori that she,victim,was ready to tell anyone still.
tori,victim best friend in the eighth grade and high school,testified that victim first told her defendant was do ing things to her in the summer of,following their graduation from eighth grade.according to tori,in that first conversation,victim told her defendant had made her orally copulate him and had rubbed his penis along her butt crack.between summer and the end of,tori and victim discussed the abuse often.tori recalled victim saying defendant would try to come in while she was in the shower and would put his hand up her shirt or skirt.at some point victim also told tori the defendant had put his penis in her vagina.
tori urged victim to tell someone about the molestation but victim said she did not want to and told tori not to tell her mother.tori initially respected victim wishes,but eventually told her mother that victim was being abused.she could not recall which details she told her mother and which she withheld.
roxanne clair 
tori mother,roxanne clair,testified that in early tori disclosed that she was concerned about victim and implied that victim was being sexually abused by defendant.tori mentioned things like defendant watching victim take a shower or pictures that he took when she was younger.clair never knew about specific acts of sexual abuse.clair understood from tori that victim did not want to talk about the situation,did not want her mother to find out,and would deny the accusations if anyone asked her about them.
clair contacted child protective services to report her concerns about victim in february.
krissi durant 
krissi durant testified that in she was a sexual assault detective with the santa cruz county sheriff office.on friday,february,a child protective services social worker informed durant about allegations of defendant sexual abuse of victim.at noon that day,durant went to victim high school to interview her.school administrators called victim out of class and durant spoke with her in a private office at the school.after durant introduced herself and said she was there to discuss information child protective services had received,victim began crying.during the interview victim cried a lot and was short with her answers.
victim made a pretext call to defendant the following tuesday.she called from the sheriff office using her cell phone.durant recorded the call,which was played for the jury 
victim began the call by telling defendant she had been talking to her school counselor about stuff going on at home that she did like,but that she had not told the counselor about defendant touching her.defendant responded was i drunk or something i mean that was me.are you sure i mean,what about your dad victim then asked,what about the pictures you took like when you picked the lock,and i was in the shower,and you came in with a camera and started taking pictures defendant initially denied doing so,saying no,i do remember that,and i would never do that.victim insisted defendant remembered but was denying it and he responded,well even if,i mean,i did deny it,if i said so,i would go to jail.do you understand if i said so on the phone,you know what i mean 
victim asked defendant why and he responded maybe you remind me of your mom i could tell you why,i mean,other than maybe i sick and need just to not do drugs i mean,maybe i my affection for you.you know,showed my love the wrong way.later,defendant continued,if,you know,you say this to people,and if you have to,you have to.you know what i mean but i go to jail,and the marriage is over,and my life is over,and i wo be able to see my kids again.but i need to do whatever it takes to make,you know,things right with you.when victim again pressed defendant to explain why he said i do know.you were a pretty little girl.i do know.i mean,you know,i took affection i needed from you.i do know.because i know you loved me.i do know.you know what i mean i mean maybe because i did think you would tell.
victim asked defendant to promise me like you never touch me again he responded i i promise,never ever ever.i not i wo even give you a hug unless you want me to.you are safe,and i swear i gon na look at not doing drugs and whatever it takes.i mean,i i probably in denial about the whole thing then.defendant mentioned being in denial two other times during the call saying you know,it so horrible i must be in denial about it.i mean,i remember playing with you.you know what i mean but and i sure it was misguided affection.sick.i sorry.there i sure i in denial.i mean,you know what though you have nothing to worry about from me.do you believe that 
victim also asked defendant why he would want to touch her and like have sex with her and stuff when she was so young.defendant answered i do,i do know like i said,it must be some mental problem i have.i mean no one,no one has ever,you know,touched you,right victim responded no.
victim asked defendant do you still have those videos that you took when i was in mom lingerie no.no.no way,said defendant,i probably erased them or destroyed them,or i have the tape in the room.i go over them to make sure.i mean,your mom looks at those tapes too.i mean,if there something on there,i better find it.he also told victim he never showed pictures to anyone or put them on the internet.
officer durant reached defendant on his cell phone in the evening following the pretext call.defendant met her at the sheriff office that night,at which point he was arrested.defendant did not have his cell phone with him at the time of his arrest and it never was recovered.
officer durant interviewed tori in april.at that time,tori stated victim had said defendant took pictures of her in the shower and videotaped her while she was wearing her mom lingerie.tori said nothing about defendant raping victim or rubbing his penis against her backside.
search warrant 
todd phillips,who was a deputy sheriff in santa cruz county in february,testified that he and other officers served a warrant to search defendant residence on the afternoon of february,a few hours after the pretext call took place.officers seized lingerie,digital cameras,video cameras,computers,videotapes,undeveloped camera film,dvds,and cds from the home.
ervin heartsner,a retired police officer who performs computer forensics work for the santa cruz county sheriff office,testified that he examined defendant computer,which was seized during the search.he found pictures and videos of victim mother defendant wife in which she was nude or partially clothed.in some images she was engaged in sex acts,including oral copulation,vaginal intercourse,and digital penetration.where she was engaged in sex acts with a man,the man appeared to be the one filming or taking the pictures and his face was not visible.heartsner also found pornographic images on the computer.some depicted adult women,some depicted children.he did not find any images depicting molestation or abuse of victim.
victim mother 
victim mother testified that she once saw a picture on defendant cell phone showing a woman from the waist to the.the woman was naked,although flannel pants were visible in the picture.victim was about years old at the time.thinking it was a picture of victim because the flannel pants resembled victim pajamas,victim mother confronted defendant in the master bedroom.he denied the picture was of victim,saying a friend had sent it to him.victim mother then went to victim room and asked if defendant had ever taken a picture of her.she said he had not.
verdict and sentencing 
on september,the court granted defendant motion for acquittal of the forcible rape charged in count former count for insufficient evidence.
the jury deliberated for three full days.on september,jurors found defendant guilty of counts and,which charged two counts of forcible lewd acts upon a child under age and were based on two incidents in which defendant videoed himself digitally penetrating victim.the jury was unable to reach verdicts on the other charges.therefore,the court declared a mistrial as to counts through,and.
the court sentenced appellant to a term of years eight months.on count,the court imposed the upper term sentence of eight years.the court imposed a consecutive upper term sentence of eight years for count.on count,the dissuading a witness conviction from the first trial,the court imposed a consecutive midterm sentence of two years.finally,on count,the possession of child pornography conviction from the first trial,the court imposed a consecutive eight month term of the midterm sentence.
during the trial,the court issued an order to show cause to the prosecutor,assistant district attorney ross taylor,as to why he should not be held in contempt for comments he made to the court outside the presence of the jury.the order to show cause was based on the following exchange 
the court taylor,your obvious disdain for selected rulings of the court is totally unprofessional.the way you push back,and it been almost from the very beginning of the case.and,you know 
taylor are you serious 
the court yes,i am totally serious.it not a good time to engage me in argument about it 
taylor ya,well,you know 
the court taylor,because i not going to listen to you.and you are increasing my ire 
taylor i not interested in what you have to say.i do know if i could be any less interested.some of the rulings that you made are just outrageous,your honor 
following a december,hearing,the court issued an order and judgment of contempt.in doing so,the court characterized the exchange above as the culmination of a continuum of insolent and inappropriate behavior by the prosecutor that occurred throughout the trial.the court ordered the prosecutor to pay a fine.
ii.discussion 
admission of evidence of uncharged rapes of which defendant was previously acquitted 
defendant contends the court erred under people griffin cal d griffin and its progeny in admitting victim testimony about the alleged winter break and june rapes without informing the jury that he had been acquitted of rape charges based on those incidents.the attorney general responds that griffin does not apply because victim testimony was not admitted pursuant to evidence code section and the jury was not permitted to use it to conclude that defendant had a propensity to commit the charged crimes.
procedural background 
as noted,defendant moved to admit evidence of the alleged winter break and june rapes.the defense sought to confront victim with her prior testimony insisting the winter break rape occurred while defendant was in the hospital and her prior testimony as to whether she was raped during the june incident.the prosecutor did not object and defendant motion was granted on the understanding that the jury would not learn of the acquittals.
the prosecution elicited testimony from victim about the winter break rape and the june rape in its case in chief.victim varied from her testimony in the first trial regarding the winter break rape,conceding it could not have taken place in the first few days of because defendant was in the hospital at that time.consistent with her direct testimony in the first trial but inconsistent with her testimony on in that trial,victim testified that defendant raped her in june.
towards the end of the trial,defendant requested the jury be instructed that he was acquitted of the uncharged winter break and june rapes.defense counsel argued that victim testimony on direct examination regarding those incidents was akin to evidence code section propensity evidence.the court denied defendant request,reasoning a limiting instruction would prohibit the jury from using the testimony regarding uncharged rapes as propensity evidence.
the court instructed the jury as follows the defense presented evidence concerning victim allegations that the defendant committed two forcible rapes,the first involving the winter break incident and the second involving the alleged june of incident.neither allegation is charged in this case as forcible rape.the sole purpose for which evidence of the winter break incident was presented,and the sole purpose for which you may consider it,is a s it pertains to the credibility of victim with regard to her testimony as to the offenses with which defendant is charged.do not consider the evidence as it relates to the winter break forcible rape allegation for any other purpose.you may consider the evidence concerning the alleged incident in june of for the purposes of determining whether the people have proven defendant guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as to the charge of a lewd act upon a child who was or years old as alleged in count and for the purpose of evaluating victim credibility as it relates to the charged offenses.you may not consider this evidence for any other purposes.
legal principles 
in griffin,the defendant was tried for murdering a woman after he attempted to rape her.the trial court admitted evidence that the defendant had raped another woman but excluded evidence that he was acquitted of that alleged rape.our supreme court concluded evidence of the rape was admissible because the similarities between the crimes made evidence of the rape relevant to prove that the murder victim injuries were not accidental but inflicted by defendant and to prove that he intended to rape her.griffin,supra,cal d at.however,the griffin court concluded the trial court erred in excluding evidence the defendant was acquitted of the rape.id.at.noting that evidence of other crimes always involves the risk of serious prejudice,the court reasoned that the rule that a properly authenticated acquittal is admissible to rebut prosecution evidence of guilt of another crime is fair to both the prosecution and the defense by assisting the jury in its assessment of the significance of the evidence of another crime with the knowledge that at another time and place a duly constituted tribunal charged with the very issue of determining defendant guilt or innocence of the other crime concluded that he was not guilty.id.at.the griffin court recognized that,b ecause of the requirement of proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,evidence of an acquittal is not,of course,as convincing of innocence as a judgment of conviction is convincing of guilt.id.at,fn.but,the court reasoned,this fact goes to the weight not the admissibility of the evidence.ibid.
griffin has been applied in cases involving the admission of a defendant alleged prior bad acts under evidence code section and the admission of uncharged sex offenses under evidence code section mullens,supra,th at surveying griffin progeny and applying its rule for the first time in the context of,propensity evidence.in mullens,a sex offense prosecution,evidence the defendant had committed an uncharged sex offense was admitted under evidence code section to show he had a propensity to commit sex crimes.the mullens court concluded that the rationale underlying griffin applied equally in the context of evidence code section propensity evidence because such evidence involves the risk of serious if not severe prejudice.mullens,supra,at.
we review de novo the trial court conclusion that the griffin rule did not,as a matter of law,apply here.
any error was not prejudicial 
at issue in this appeal is whether the griffin rule applies where evidence of uncharged sex crimes is admitted for the limited purpose of assessing victim credibility.we need not decide that question,however.even assuming the court erred in refusing to inform the jury about defendant acquittals,that assumed error did not prejudice defendant.
before addressing prejudice,we note the attorney general contention that evidence of the uncharged rapes was admitted only to attack the victim credibility is unpersuasive.italics added.we would be inclined to agree if evidence of the uncharged rapes had first been introduced by defense counsel and the prosecutor had simply questioned victim about the incidents on redirect in an effort to rehabilitate her credibility.but that is not what transpired.rather,the prosecutor elicited testimony about the uncharged rapes from victim on direct examination.he elicited that testimony in his case in chief,not to discredit his principal witness,but to blunt the impact of defense counsel.accordingly,evidence related to the uncharged rapes was admitted for a broader purpose than the attorney general contends.
turning to prejudice,the question is whether it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to defendant would have been reached had the jury been informed of defendant acquittals.mullens,supra,th at people watson cal d.our review focuses not on what a reasonable jury could do,but what such a jury is likely to have done in the absence of the error under consideration.in making that evaluation,we may consider,among other things,whether the evidence supporting the existing judgment is so relatively strong,and the evidence supporting a different outcome is so comparatively weak,that there is no reasonable probability the error of which the defendant complains affected the result.people breverman cal th.
defendant was convicted of two counts of violating section,subdivision b.the elements of an offense under that provision are physical touching of a child under age for the present and immediate purpose of sexually arousing or gratifying the defendant or victim and the touching was accomplished by use of force,violence,duress,menace,or fear of injury.people alvarez cal th.
there was evidence corroborating victim testimony that defendant videotaped her both in the master bedroom while she was wearing her mother lingerie and a few months later when she was in the bathroom.specifically,defendant appears to admit such conduct during the pretext call officer durant testified that tori told her that victim described such conduct and lingerie and video equipment were found in the home.the pretext call also corroborated victim testimony that defendant touched her sexually during those incidents.on that call,defendant said he had showed victim his love the wrong way.he offered a number of possible reasons for doing so she remind ed him of her mom he sick she was a pretty little girl he needed affection and he did think she would tell.he also said that if she told people he would go to jail and never see his kids again.taken together,these statements strongly suggest defendant touched victim for the present and immediate purpose of sexually arousing himself,and thus support victim testimony that defendant digitally penetrated her during the videotaping incidents.
no evidence was introduced to substantiate victim testimony as to the final element of counts and,the use of force,violence,duress,menace,or fear of injury during the incidents thus,to convict defendant on counts and,jurors had to credit victim testimony on that point.the question for us,then,is whether it is reasonably probable that at least one juror would not have done so had they learned defendant had been acquitted of the uncharged rapes.people soojian th,u nder the watson standard a hung jury is considered a more favorable result than a guilty verdict.and,we embark on that inquiry guided by the fact that the acquittals are only slightly probative of victim lack of credibility.griffin,supra,cal d at,fn.b ecause of the requirement of proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,evidence of an acquittal is not as convincing of innocence as a judgment of conviction is convincing of guilt.
the jury heard other evidence undermining victim credibility.for example,victim testified that,to conceal the fact that she had downplayed the alleged molestation when confronted by her father,she told tori that her father was not going to do anything because of money problems.relatedly,victim hid the extent of the molestation from her father.she denied that the picture on defendant cell phone depicted her when her mother confronted her.she effectively testified that she invented her explanation to investigators for why the first alleged incident ended,saying she was trying to find a reason for why it had ended and that seemed like the closest to the truth.and victim credibility with respect to the uncharged rapes was impeached with her prior inconsistent testimony about those incidents.evidence of the acquittals was,accordingly,cumulative of other evidence defendant used to undermine victim credibility generally and with respect to the uncharged rapes specifically.it is not likely,therefore,that evidence of the acquittals would have impacted the decision of a juror to credit victim testimony about the alleged conduct related to the video recordings.
we acknowledge that the jury deliberated for more than three days and hung on nine of charges.people cardenas cal d,jury deliberations of hours indicated the closeness of case people brown th,jury inability to reach a verdict on one of the two counts showed closeness of case.and,as noted,the jury had to credit victim testimony as to the use of force to convict defendant of counts and.nevertheless,given the pretext call strong corroboration of the other elements of those counts,the other evidence available to defendant to undermine victim credibility,and the slight probative value of the acquittals,we can not say it is reasonably probable the jury would have reached an outcome more favorable to defendant had it learned of the acquittals.
prosecutorial misconduct 
defendant also raises four claims of prosecutorial misconduct.
discovery violation 
defendant contends the prosecution committed misconduct by failing to disclose material it was required to provide to the defense under brady maryland brady and section.pursuant to brady,the prosecution has a duty under the fourteenth amendment due process clause to disclose evidence that is both favorable to the defendant because it is exculpatory or impeaching and material to guilt or innocence.people salazar cal th.state law requires the prosecution to disclose to the defendant or his or her attorney f relevant written or recorded statements of witnesses or reports of the statements of witnesses whom the prosecutor intends to call at the trial.upon a showing that the defense complied with the informal discovery procedures provided by the statute,and that the prosecutor has not complied with section,a trial court may make any order necessary to enforce the provisions of the statute,including,but not limited to,immediate disclosure,contempt proceedings,delaying or prohibiting the testimony of a witness or the presentation of real evidence,continuance of the matter,or any other lawful order,subd.b.the court may also advise the jury of any failure or refusal to disclose and of any untimely disclosure.ibid.a violation of section is subject to the standard set forth in watson.people verdugo cal th,verdugo.
defendant maintains the prosecutor violated brady and section by failing to disclose statements victim made before the second trial indicating that she no longer believed the winter break rape occurred a couple of days after the new year the attorney general asserts,without explanation,that t here was no discovery violation.
as discussed above,at the first trial victim was adamant the winter break rape took place in the early days of,even when confronted with records showing defendant was in the hospital at that time.at the second trial,the prosecutor first question to victim about the timing of the winter break rape was did you used to believe the winter break rape had taken place a couple days after new year victim explained that she did used to hold that belief,that she no longer did so because of the hospital records,and that the rape must have occurred at another time.on,victim testified that she told the prosecutor prior to taking the stand that she no longer believed the winter break rape occurred while defendant was hospitalized.outside the presence of the jury,the prosecutor represented to the court that victim never made any statements to him that required disclosure.he stated that in his pretrial conversation with victim he merely told her she would need to explain the timing of the winter break rape.the trial court credited the prosecutor and found no discovery violation 
the phrasing of the prosecutor question did you used to believe the winter break rape had taken place a couple days after new year strongly supports the conclusion that he was aware victim planned to change her testimony.italics added.how else would he know the belief she adhered to at the first trial was one she used to,but no longer,held nevertheless,we conclude that there was no brady violation because victim statement that the winter break rape did not occur when defendant was in the hospital was not favorable to his case.accordingly,it did not fall within the scope of brady,supra,at page.verdugo,supra,cal th at.while we do find there was a section violation defendant does not demonstrate prejudice.a section violation is prejudicial and thus is a basis for reversal only where it is reasonably probable,by standards,that the omission affected the trial result.people zambrano cal th,fn,overruled on other grounds by people doolin cal th,fn.
defendant says he was prejudiced by the discovery violation because h e lost his ability to choose to exclude entirely victim allegation of the uncharged winter break rape and,alternatively,because the jury was not advised of the prosecution failure to disclose.it is not clear defendant would have succeeded had he sought to exclude the evidence.the prosecutor could have sought and obtained permission to introduce evidence of the uncharged rape as propensity evidence under evidence code section or under evidence code section,subdivision c,subd.c specific instance of conduct admissible to support or attack the credibility of a witness.however,because the attorney general does not make that assertion,we shall assume evidence of the uncharged winter break rape would not have been introduced but for the discovery violation.the question,then,is whether it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to defendant would have been reached absent that evidence.we think not.
apart from the winter break rape,the jury heard victim testify about eight incidents of sexual abuse,including two other times defendant put his penis in her vagina and two forced oral copulations.thus,the winter break rape testimony was no more inflammatory than victim other testimony,reducing the likelihood its admission was prejudicial.m
