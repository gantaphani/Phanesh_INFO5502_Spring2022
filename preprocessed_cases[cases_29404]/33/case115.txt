barbara rubens appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york denny chin,judge entered october,dismissing rubens legal malpractice claim in its entirety,granting roy mason and mason,ketterman cawood counterclaim for costs and expenses incurred in their representation of rubens in the arbitration that is the subject of this legal malpractice claim,and dismissing counterclaim for fees and costs incurred in their efforts to collect their expenses 
we find that the district court predicated its grant of summary judgment as to liability on an affidavit from the arbitrator who presided over the underlying arbitration,the probative value of which was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.the affidavit,therefore should not have been admitted.we therefore vacate the grant of summary judgment to the defendants on liability and remand to the district court.we find further that the district court did not exceed its allowable discretion in awarding to the defendants the costs and expenses they incurred in their representation of rubens in the arbitration,and accordingly,we affirm that part of the district court judgment.
background 
barbara rubens was fitted with a dalkon shield intrauterine device iud on march.in,rubens was hospitalized for pelvic inflammatory disease.rubens dalkon shield iud was removed at that time.rubens then brought a claim against the dalkon shield claimants trust trust claiming that the dalkon shield had caused her pelvic inflammatory disease and that she had suffered infertility,depression,loss of income,and pain and suffering as a result.
rubens decided to forgo litigation in favor of arbitration and retained attorney michael pretl to represent her in the arbitration.rubens subsequently discharged pretl and retained the law firm of mason,ketterman morgan,mkm the to morgan,shelsby,carlo,downs everton in june.attorney roy mason was rubens lead counsel.the arbitration was presided over by a single arbitrator,blair fensterstock.fensterstock rendered a decision in favor of the trust and against rubens on october.
rubens then instituted a legal malpractice claim against mkm and mason in federal court in june,pursuant to rubens alleges that,but for the negligence of mason and mkm,she would have won her claim against the trust and been awarded damages in the amount of.specifically,rubens claims that mason and mkm were negligent in stipulating to the admission of the trust chlamydia test results,which contradicted the results of an independent test that rubens had had performed failing to understand that the trust chlamydia test was negative and thus could not support the theory that chlamydia caused her pelvic inflammatory disease failing to call witnesses to prove that the trust chlamydia test was negative or to rebut the trust biofilm defense failing to introduce the reichel presumption and failing timely to disclose expert witnesses,resulting in the preclusion of testimony crucial to prove the causal link between the dalkon shield and her injuries.
the parties the district court for summary judgment on the legal malpractice claim.the defendants moved for summary judgment on their counterclaim for costs and expenses incurred during their representation of rubens in the arbitration.in support of their motion for summary judgment on liability,the defendants submitted an affidavit from fensterstock,the arbitrator who presided over the arbitration of rubens claim against the trust.in his affidavit,fensterstock addressed each of rubens allegations of malpractice and attested that his adjudication of those claims would not have been different had the alleged malpractice not occurred.in a memorandum decision dated september,the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on liability,dismissing rubens complaint in its entirety,granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on their counterclaim for costs incurred in the arbitration,and denied the defendants motion for costs incurred in attempting to recover rubens unpaid balance.
i.the fensterstock affidavit 
in its decision on liability,the district court indicated that because t he parties here do not contest that mkm,as rubens counsel,owes her a duty,it focused only on the issues of breach and proximate cause.before addressing each claim of negligence specifically,the court stated its conclusion,based almost entirely on fensterstock affidavit 
fensterstock,however,as the sole decisionmaker in the arbitration,provides a sworn statement that mkm allegedly negligent behavior would have had no effect on the outcome of the arbitration.see fensterstock aff.even assuming that mkm was negligent in its representation of rubens,in light of fensterstock affidavit,no reasonable jury could conclude that rubens would have prevailed at arbitration.
rubens mason,wl,at,emphasis added.the court then addressed each of rubens allegations of negligence.with regard to rubens claims that the defendants were negligent in admitting the chlamydia test results,failing to call certain witnesses,disclosing witnesses in an untimely fashion,and failing to introduce the reichel presumption,the court reiterated its reliance on fensterstock affidavit to determine that no reasonable jury could conclude that rubens is able to prove either a breach of the duty to use reasonable care or proximate causation and that summary judgment in the defendants favor was proper.as for rubens claim that the defendants misunderstood that the results of the trust chlamydia test were negative,the district court found that although mason did describe the trust test results as positive he elicited testimony to the effect that a positive result could result from rather than the presence of genital chlamydia.the court concluded,however,that e ven assuming that mason was confused and misinterpreted the trust test results as being positive,fensterstock put such little weight on both sets of chlamydia test results that the alleged error would not have changed the ultimate result.id.at.
ii.the retainer agreement 
when she hired mkm to represent her in the arbitration,rubens signed two retainer agreements that contain the same provision regarding the payment of costs and expenses 
client agrees that she will be entirely reasonable sic for all costs and expenses in this litigation.the client understands that the costs and expenses could exceed and that it will be necessary to pay for accommodations and expert witnesses.in addition,the client understands that some experts may require advance payment of their fees.client accepts full responsibility for the payment of these costs and expense and agrees to indemnify mason,ketterman morgan if the firm incurs any expenses as a result of the client failure to pay the costs and expenses in this case.
rubens admits that she signed the retainer agreements,that she received at least some letters from mkm requesting payment,that she did not pay most of those bills,and that she did not respond to the letters requesting payment or contest any of the amounts due.in her opposition to the defendants motion for summary judgment on costs and expenses,rubens submitted an affidavit in which she claimed that she had not received some of the bills and that she believed some of the expenses listed were not properly billed to her case.
with regard to the defendants counterclaim for these costs and expenses,the district court found that rubens did not dispute the evidence setting forth the costs and expenses she owes for the arbitration and concluded 
in the absence of any evidence putting into question the reasonableness of these costs,and because there are no disputed issues of material fact,i conclude that mkm is entitled to judgment against rubens for on its counterclaim for arbitration costs and expenses.

judgment was entered on october.rubens filed a timely notice of appeal on november.
discussion 
on appeal,rubens argues that the grant of summary judgment dismissing her malpractice claim can not stand because it was predicated on inadmissible evidence.specifically,rubens argues that the district court improperly prob ed the mental processes of fensterstock,the trier of fact below,in order to adjudicate the element of causation in the legal malpractice suit.rubens also argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the defendants on their counterclaim for costs and expenses incurred in the underlying arbitration because her affidavit disputing these costs and expenses created a question of fact.
the defendants first argue that rubens is precluded from raising an argument as to the admissibility of fensterstock affidavit on appeal because she did not move to strike the affidavit before the district court.the defendants further argue that fensterstock affidavit is admissible because the propriety of his decision in the underlying arbitration is not at issue thus,he is merely a witness to facts relevant to the issues in the legal malpractice suit.with regard to the award of costs and expenses,the defendants argue that rubens can not create a material issue of fact by submitting a conclusory affidavit.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo and determine whether the court properly concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact so that the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.miller wolpoff abramson,cir,cert.denied,d.we review rulings on admissibility under federal rule of evidence for abuse of discretion.leopold baccarat,cir.the proper standard of review for the interpretation of the terms of the retainer agreement is the de novo standard for contract interpretation.goodheart clothing laura goodman,cir.
i.the arbitrator affidavit was inadmissible and the district court improperly relied upon it 
rubens adequately preserved her objection to fensterstock affidavit 
the defendants argue that rubens did not preserve her objection to the admission of fensterstock affidavit because the objections she made before the district court focused on prohibiting fensterstock from testifying at trial,rather that on striking the admission of his affidavit in support of summary judgment.this argument fails to acknowledge that in deciding a motion for summary judgment,a court may rely only on material that would be admissible at trial.azrielli cohen law offices,cir.thus,any argument that fensterstock testimony at trial would be inadmissible was also,necessarily,an argument that his testimony through affidavit in support of summary judgment was inadmissible.
rubens argued for preclusion of fensterstock testimony in her opposition to the defendants motion for summary judgment and in an affidavit submitted in support thereof.she argued that allowing fensterstock to testify would be prejudicial because he acted as judge and jury in the arbitration so that a in the malpractice case would see fensterstock as the person who is supposed to be fair and neutral.she also argued that allowing fensterstock to testify would usurp the role of the judge and jury in the malpractice suit it is the job of this judge and jury to make the legal and factual decisions.by these arguments rubens raised the issue of the admissibility of fensterstock testimony sufficiently to preserve it for appeal.albany savings bank,fsb halpin,cir appellant adequately raised issue of contract release ambiguity to preserve for appeal claim that parol evidence should be admitted.
fensterstock affidavit was unduly prejudicial 
on a motion for summary judgment,a district court may rely only on material that would be admissible at trial.see azrielli,at.of course,to be admissible,evidence must be relevant,see,but relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
in order to prevail on a claim of legal malpractice under new york law a client must demonstrate that the attorney was negligent,that the negligence was a proximate cause of the injury and that the client suffered actual and ascertainable damages.mccoy feinman.an attorney is negligent if it is shown that he failed to exercise the ordinary reasonable skill and knowledge commonly possessed by a member of the legal profession.id.at,at,quoting darby darby vsi int l.for a defendant in a legal malpractice case to succeed on a motion for summary judgment,evidence must be presented in admissible form establishing that the plaintiff is unable to prove at least one of the essential elements.crawford mcbride,dep t mem.
because legal malpractice is a species of negligence,see page keeton et,prosser and keeton on torts ed,the question of causation presented is the objective,reasonable person standard,id.i t is enough for plaintiff to introduce evidence from which reasonable persons may conclude that it is more probable that the event was caused by the defendant than that it was not.the questions to be resolved by the in the legal malpractice action,therefore,are whether the lawyer fell below the applicable standard of care,and if so,whether a reasonable in the underlying suit would have arrived at a different result but for the attorney negligence.see zarin reid priest,dep t in order to establish the elements of proximate cause and actual damages in a malpractice case,the plaintiff must show that but for the attorney negligence,what would have been a favorable outcome was an unfavorable outcome.the malpractice judge or jury must decide a case within a case and determine what the result would have been absent the alleged malpractice.see ronald mallen jeffrey smith,legal malpractice ed weil,gotshal manges,llp fashion boutique of short hills,t o establish the elements of proximate cause and actual damages,the client must meet a case within the case requirement,demonstrating that but for the attorney conduct the client would have prevailed in the underlying matter or would not have sustained any ascertainable damages.
here,the parties did not dispute that mkm and mason owed rubens a duty.on the issue of breach,the parties submitted competing expert affidavits.rubens expert opined that mason departed from applicable standards of legal practice in several respects and that these departures substantially contributed to rubens losing her case at arbitration.the defendants expert countered that these same acts were reasonable strategic decision s.determining whether mason alleged failures were negligent or merely reasonable tactical decisions presented a question of fact that could not be resolved on summary judgment.see greene payne,wood littlejohn,dep t affirming denial of summary judgment where the question was whether defendants failure to plead separately a pendant state law claim in federal court was negligent or an honest mistake of judgment where the proper course of action was open to reasonable doubt internal quotation marks omitted.thus,the dispositive issue on summary judgment became whether the defendants could demonstrate through admissible evidence that rubens was unable to prove causation.
fensterstock affidavit addressed the subjective question of what fensterstock himself would have decided if mason had performed exactly as rubens now alleges he should have performed.in response to rubens claim that mason was negligent in failing timely to disclose expert witnesses,fensterstock declared that he had reviewed the expert reports that rubens claimed should have been admitted and that they would not have changed my opinion.to rubens claim that mason erroneously stipulated to the admission of the trust chlamydia test and misunderstood the results of rubens own test,fensterstock responded that the competing chlamydia tests were a because e ven if the chlamydia tests had not been presented to me,i would still have found in favor of the trust because of the scientific uncertainty surrounding biofilm.he further averred that mason failure to argue that the reichel presumption applied to rubens case could not have changed the result because he was aware of the reichel presumption and determined that it was not applicable to rubens case.
fensterstock pronouncements in the subsequent malpractice suit about what he would have decided absent the allegedly negligent acts carry undue weight because he was the sole,in esse
