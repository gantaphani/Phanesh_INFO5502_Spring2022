in this case we impose discipline on two attorneys for their use of television advertising devices that violate the rules of professional conduct.these devices,which invoke the breed of dog known as the pit bull,demean all lawyers and thereby harm both the legal profession and the public trust and confidence in our system of justice 
we conclude that attorneys pape and chandler the attorneys violated rules regulating the florida bar b and b by using the image of a pit bull and displaying the term pit bull as part of their firm phone number in their commercial.further,because the use of an image of a pit bull and the phrase pit bull in the firm advertisement and logo does not assist the public in ensuring that an informed decision is made prior to the selection of the attorney,we conclude that the first amendment does not prevent this court from sanctioning the attorneys based on the rule violations.we determine that the appropriate sanctions for the attorneys misconduct are public reprimands and required attendance at the florida bar advertising workshop.
background and procedural history 
on january,the florida bar filed complaints against the attorneys,alleging that their law firm television advertisement was an improper communication concerning the services provided,in violation of the rules of professional conduct.the advertisement included a logo that featured an image of a pit bull wearing a spiked collar and prominently displayed the firm phone number.the bar asserted that this advertisement violated the version of rules regulating the florida bar b and b,which state 
descriptive statements.a lawyer shall not make statements describing or characterizing the quality of the lawyer services in advertisements and written communications provided that this provision shall not apply to information furnished to a prospective client at that person request or to information supplied to existing clients.
prohibited visual and verbal portrayals.visual or verbal descriptions,depictions,or portrayals of persons,things,or events must be objectively relevant to the selection of an attorney and shall not be deceptive,misleading,or manipulative.
the referee found that the attorneys did not violate rule b,relying on the distinction that the logo and telephone number describe qualities of the respondent attorneys but do not describe or characterize the quality of the lawyer services.the referee also rejected the bar assertion that the ad violated rule b.after noting that pit bulls are perceived as loyal,persistent,tenacious,and aggressive,the referee found these qualities 
objectively relevant to the selection of an attorney as they are informational,because these are qualities that a consuming public would want in a trial lawyer and the ad is not improperly manipulative the advertisement is tastefully done,the logo is not unduly conspicuous in its replacement of an ampersand between respondents names atop the tv screen,and the large print number is an effective mnemonic device tailored to maximize responses from potential clients.
the referee also concluded that the ad was protected speech and therefore that an interpretation of rules b and b to prohibit the ad would render the rules unconstitutional as applied.
generally,a referee findings of fact regarding guilt carry a presumption of correctness that should be upheld unless clearly erroneous or without support in the record.bar senton,so d,quoting.bar wohl,so d.however,where there are no genuine issues of material fact and the only disagreement is whether the undisputed facts constitute unethical conduct,the referee findings present a question of law that the court reviews de novo.see rykiel rykiel,so d,stating that if the issue presented in a decision is a pure question of law,the decision is subject to de novo review.bar cosnow,so d,concluding that whether the attorney admitted actions constitute unethical conduct is a question of law.the facts are not in dispute,and therefore our review is de novo.
violation of attorney advertising rules 
as a preliminary matter,the pit bull logo and telephone number in the ad by the attorneys do not comport with the general criteria for permissible attorney advertisements set forth in the comments to section of the rules of professional conduct.the rules contained in section are designed to permit lawyer advertisements that provide objective information about the cost of legal services,the experience and qualifications of the lawyer and law firm,and the types of cases the lawyer handles.see generally regulating.bar cmt.the comment to rule provides that a lawyer advertisement should provide only useful,factual information presented in a nonsensational manner.advertisements using slogans fail to meet these standards and diminish public confidence in the legal system.the television commercial at issue here uses both a sensationalistic image and a slogan contrary to the purpose of section.
more specifically,the attorneys ad violated rule b,which prohibits the use of statements describing or characterizing the quality of the lawyer services.in florida bar lange,so d,we approved the referee finding that an advertisement that stated when the best is simply essential violated the predecessor provision to rule b because it was and purported to describe the quality of the lawyer services.in this case,the simultaneous display of the pit bull logo and the phone number conveys both the characteristics of the attorneys and the quality of the services they purport to provide.at the very least,the printed words and the image of a pit bull in the television commercial could certainly be perceived by prospective clients as characterizing the quality of the lawyers services.
on this question we disagree with the referee,who distinguished the quality of the lawyer services from the qualities,traits or characteristics of the lawyer.we conclude that this is an artificial distinction which unduly limits the scope of the rule by interpreting quality of the lawyer services in the narrowest sense.from the perspective of a prospective client unfamiliar with the legal system and in need of counsel,a lawyer character and personality traits are indistinguishable from the quality of the services that the lawyer provides.a courteous lawyer can be expected to be well mannered in court,a lawyer well prepared,and a pit bull lawyer vicious to the opposition.in the attorneys advertisement,the pit bull image appears in place of an ampersand between the attorneys names,and the ad includes the use of the words pit bull in the attorneys telephone number in large capital letters.the combined effect of these devices is to lead a reasonable consumer to conclude that the attorneys are advertising themselves as providers of pit bull style representation.we consider this a characterization of the quality of the lawyers services in violation of rule b.
we also conclude that the ad violates rule b,which requires that visual or verbal depictions be objectively relevant to the selection of an attorney,and prohibits depictions that are deceptive,misleading,or manipulative.the comment to this rule explains that it 
prohibits visual or verbal descriptions,depictions,or portrayals in any advertisement which create suspense,or contain exaggerations or appeals to the emotions,call for legal services,or create consumer problems through characterization and dialogue ending with the lawyer solving the problem.illustrations permitted under zauderer office of disciplinary counsel of the supreme court of ohio,d,are informational and not misleading,and are therefore permissible.as an example,a drawing of a fist,to suggest the lawyer ability to achieve results,would be barred.examples of permissible illustrations would include a graphic rendering of the scales of justice to indicate that the advertising attorney practices law,a picture of the lawyer,or a map of the office location.
emphasis supplied.the logo of the pit bull wearing a spiked collar and the prominent display of the phone number are more manipulative and misleading than a drawing of a fist.these advertising devices would suggest to many persons not only that the lawyers can achieve results but also that they engage in a combative style of advocacy.the suggestion is inherently deceptive because there is no way to measure whether the attorneys in fact conduct themselves like pit bulls so as to ascertain whether this logo and phone number convey accurate information.
in addition,the image of a pit bull and the display of the words as part of the firm phone number are not objectively relevant to the selection of an attorney.the referee found that the qualities of a pit bull as depicted by the logo are loyalty,persistence,tenacity,and aggressiveness.we consider this a charitable set of associations that ignores the darker side of the qualities often also associated with pit bulls malevolence,viciousness,and unpredictability.further,although some may associate pit bulls with loyalty to their owners the manner in which the pit bull is depicted in the attorneys ad in this case certainly does not emphasize this association.the dog,which is wearing a spiked collar,directly faces the viewer and is shown alone,with no indication that it is fulfilling its traditional role as man best friend.
pit bulls have a reputation for vicious behavior that is borne of experience.according to a study published in the journal of the american veterinary medical association in,pit bulls caused the greatest number of fatalities between and.jeffery saks,et,breeds of dogs involved in fatal human attacks in the united states between and,am.veterinary med.ass,available at the dangerousness of pit bulls has also been recognized in a number of court decisions.see,giaculli bright,so d,dca recognizing that p it bulls as a breed are known to be extremely aggressive and have been bred as attack animals hearn city of overland park,p it bull dogs represent a unique public health hazard not presented by other breeds or mixes of dogs.pit bull dogs possess both the capacity for extraordinarily savage behavior and physical capabilities in excess of those possessed by many other breeds of dogs.moreover,this capacity for uniquely vicious attacks is coupled with an unpredictable nature.matthews amberwood assocs.partnership,the extreme dangerousness of the pit bull breed,as it has evolved today,is well recognized.
in state peters,so d dca,the third district court of appeal upheld a city of north miami ordinance imposing substantial insurance,registration,and confinement obligations on owners of pit bulls.the city of north miami ordinance contained findings that pit bulls have a greater propensity to bite humans than all other breeds,are extremely aggressive towards other animals,and have a natural tendency to refuse to terminate an attack once it has begun.see id.at the current county ordinance provides that it is illegal to own a pit bull.see county,
this court would not condone an advertisement that stated that a lawyer will get results through combative and vicious tactics that will maim,scar,or harm the opposing party,conduct that would violate our rules of professional conduct.see,regulating.bar g h prohibiting threats to present criminal or disciplinary charges solely to gain an advantage in a civil matter.yet this is precisely the type of unethical and unprofessional conduct that is conveyed by the image of a pit bull and the display of the phone number.we construe the prohibitions on advertising statements that characterize the quality of lawyer services and depictions that are false or misleading to prohibit a lawyer from advertising his or her services by suggesting behavior,conduct,or tactics that are contrary to our rules of professional conduct.
further,we reject the referee finding that the use of the words pit bull in the phone number is merely a mnemonic device to help potential clients remember the attorneys number.phone numbers are memorable because of the images and associations they evoke.the phone number sticks in the memory precisely because of the image of the pit bull also featured in the ad,the association of pit bulls with the characteristics discussed herein,and the go for the jugular style of advocacy that some persons attribute to lawyers.in short,this is a manipulative and misleading use of what would otherwise be information to create a nefarious association.
indeed,permitting this type of advertisement would make a mockery of our dedication to promoting public trust and confidence in our system of justice prohibiting advertisements such as the one in this case is one step we can take to maintain the dignity of lawyers,as well as the integrity of,and public confidence in,the legal system.were we to approve the referee finding,images of sharks,wolves,crocodiles,and piranhas could follow.for the good of the legal profession and the justice system,and consistent with our rules of professional conduct,this type of advertising can not be permitted.we therefore conclude that the ad aired by the attorneys violates rules b and b.
first amendment protection of lawyer advertising 
we also disagree with the referee conclusion that the application of rules b and b to prohibit this advertisement violates the first amendment.lawyer advertising enjoys first amendment protection only to the extent that it provides accurate factual information that can be objectively verified.this thread runs throughout the pertinent united state supreme court precedent.
the seminal lawyer advertising case is bates state bar of arizona,d,which involved the advertising of fees for low cost legal services.in bates,the supreme court held generally that attorney advertising may not be subjected to blanket suppression,and more specifically that attorneys have the constitutional right to advertise their availability and fees for performing routine services.id.at.the cost of legal services,the supreme court concluded,would be relevant information needed to reach an informed decision.id.at.
in reaching this conclusion the supreme court recognized that a dvertising is the traditional mechanism in a economy for a supplier to inform a potential purchaser of the availability and terms of exchange.id.at.c ommercial speech serves to inform the public of the availability,nature,and prices of products and services,and thus performs an indispensable role in the allocation of resources in a free enterprise system.in short,such speech serves individual and societal interests in assuring informed and reliable decisionmaking.id.at.citation omitted.
the supreme court emphasized that advertising by lawyers could be regulated and noted that because the public lacks sophistication concerning legal services,misstatements that might be overlooked or deemed unimportant in other advertising may be found quite inappropriate in legal advertising.id.at.the supreme court specifically declined to address the peculiar problems associated with advertising claims relating to the quality of legal services,but observed that s uch claims probably are not susceptible of precise measurement or verification and,under some circumstances,might well be deceptive or misleading to the public,or even false.id.at.emphasis supplied.
after bates,the supreme court considered a missouri rule that restricted lawyer advertising to newspapers,periodicals,and the yellow pages,and limited the content of these advertisements to ten categories of information name,address and telephone number,areas of practice,date and place of birth,schools attended,foreign language ability,office hours,fee for an initial consultation,availability of a schedule of fees,credit arrangements,and the fixed fee charged for specified routine services.see in re,d.even the manner of listing areas of practice was restricted to a prescribed nomenclature.see id.at.in violation of the state restrictions,the lawyer advertised areas of practice that did not use the prescribed terminology,listed the states in which the lawyer was licensed,specified that he was admitted to practice before the united states supreme court,and did not restrict the recipients of announcement cards to lawyers,clients,former clients,personal friends,and relatives.see id.at.
