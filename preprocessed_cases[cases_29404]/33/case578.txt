at issue in this matter are written communications pertaining to three recording contracts executed by the late harry lillis crosby,the talented entertainer known to all as bing crosby.in the proceedings below,the trial court rejected plaintiffs claim of privilege with respect to the documents,many of which were either authored or received by persons crosby had hired to help manage his business interests.we conclude that the trial court ruled correctly and that the court of appeal erred in granting plaintiffs petition for writ of mandate.
factual and procedural background 
bing crosby was one of the most successful entertainers of his time.when he died in,he left an extensive portfolio of interests in records,radio and television productions,motion pictures,and musical and literary works,as well as the contract and publicity rights related to those interests.he also left business interests he had accumulated in mining,oil,real estate,and other financial ventures.crosby owned these interests during his lifetime,but he managed them with the assistance of others he employed.one such employee was basil grillo grillo,an accountant who became crosby business manager and worked for him for over years.crosby and his employees referred to crosby various business operations collectively as bing crosby enterprises enterprises 
after crosby death,the executor of his estate richard bergen of the law firm of meyers continued to maintain crosby business office,where enterprises operated.in,the executor entered into a limited partnership agreement with hillsborough productions,and kathryn crosby crosby second and surviving spouse to form hlc properties,limited hlc properties,an entity that would manage the interests crosby left.ultimately,the executor transferred the estate percent interest in certain properties to hlc properties.kathryn crosby also transferred her percent interest in these same properties to hlc properties.the properties transferred to hlc properties include the three recording contracts that are the subject of this litigation.in january,the superior court filed the order settling first and final account and report of executor,which approved the formation of hlc properties,approved the estate agreement to transfer estate properties and assets to hlc properties,and approved the estate transfer of its limited partnership interest in hlc properties to various family member trusts.upon final distribution of the estate,the executor was discharged.
in july,hlc properties and the trustee for the wilma wyatt crosby trust collectively hlc initiated this action against defendants mca records,grp records,umg recordings,mca,and universal studios,collectively mca,for allegedly underpaying royalties due on three recording contracts between crosby and mca predecessors in interest,dated march,january,and may,respectively.
in the course of pretrial discovery,mca propounded to hlc a demand for production of documents.in response,hlc produced some documents but withheld others that it listed in a privilege log as containing protected communications.mca later issued a third party deposition subpoena to crosby former law firm,meyers,for production of documents.meyers produced some documents through hlc attorney,who also submitted a supplemental privilege log that added three documents to hlc original privilege log.
thereafter,mca issued a subpoena duces tecum to hlc for the production at trial of of the documents hlc listed in its privilege logs.many of the documents reflected written communications between attorneys and persons crosby had hired,and of those,approximately had been sent when crosby apparently was conducting an audit of his recording artist royalties in and.in its motion and trial court briefing on the matter,mca contended the documents might provide critical support to its interpretation of the royalty provisions in dispute and its position that the contracting parties had previously resolved the accounting matters at issue.
on the first day of trial,the court considered the enforceability of mca subpoena duces tecum in view of hlc privilege objections.after hearing counsel arguments,the court agreed with mca that crosby was the client and the holder of the privilege and that the privilege terminated after his death.the court did not recognize enterprises or hlc as a privilege holder.
the court of appeal granted hlc petition for a writ of mandate in a published opinion.in brief,it found that enterprises constituted an organization during crosby lifetime,and therefore that hlc,as enterprises successor,currently holds the privilege.the court of appeal remanded the matter to the trial court with instructions to vacate its order compelling compliance with mca subpoena duces tecum and to consider each document listed in hlc privilege logs to determine whether,in accordance with the appellate court opinion,the privilege applied.
we granted mca petition for review.
discussion 
as proposed by the california law revision commission the commission and subsequently enacted by the legislature in,the evidence code declares authoritatively that evidentiary privileges such as the privilege are governed by statute.moeller superior court cal th,d.the party claiming a privilege shoulders the burden of showing that the evidence it seeks to suppress falls within the terms of an applicable statute.chadbourne,superior court cal d,chadbourne see also people gionis cal th,d,gionis.
when the facts,or reasonable inferences from the facts,shown in support of or in opposition to the claim of privilege are in conflict,the determination of whether the evidence supports one conclusion or the other is for the trial court,and a reviewing court may not disturb such finding if there is any substantial evidence to support it citations.gionis,supra,cal th at,d,quoting chadbourne,supra,cal d at.accordingly,unless a claimed privilege appears as a matter of law from the undisputed facts,an appellate court may not overturn the trial court decision to reject that claim.see ibid.
in the matter before us,hlc relies on section,subdivision d,which defines a holder of the privilege to include a successor of a n association or organization that is no longer in existence.hlc primary argument,which the court of appeal also largely espoused,is that enterprises was an unincorporated organization that during crosby lifetime,enterprises was the client and holder of the privilege with respect to the withheld documents and that hlc currently holds the privilege as enterprises successor 
conversely,mca relies on section,subdivision c,which provides that,if the client is dead,the holder of the privilege is the client personal representative.it is mca position that bing crosby,the natural person,not enterprises,was the client and holder of the privilege with respect to the documents that the executor of crosby estate held the privilege upon crosby death and that the privilege ceased to exist after the estate was finally distributed and the executor discharged.
resolution of the instant dispute hinges on two questions.first,who may hold the privilege initially second,who may succeed to the privilege we address these questions in order.
a.who may hold the privilege initially 
with certain exceptions not relevant here,the evidence code provides that a client has a privilege to refuse to disclose,and to prevent another from disclosing,a confidential communication the client has had with an attorney if the privilege is claimed by someone statutorily authorized to do so.a client means a person who,directly or through an authorized representative,consults a lawyer for the purpose of retaining the lawyer or securing legal service or advice from him in his professional capacity.for purposes of the evidence code,a person includes a natural person,firm,association,organization,partnership,business trust,corporation,limited liability company,or public entity.
as for who may claim the privilege,the evidence code designates a holder of the privilege,subd.a a person the privilege holder authorizes to claim the privilege,subd.b or the attorney at the time of the confidential communication if the privilege holder is in existence and has not authorized the communication disclosure,subd.c.section,in turn,defines a holder of the privilege to mean t he client when he has no guardian or conservator,subd.a,a guardian or conservator of the client when the client has a guardian or conservator,subd.b,t he personal representative of the client if the client is dead,subd.c,or a successor,assign,trustee in dissolution,or any similar representative of a firm,association,organization,partnership,business trust,corporation,or public entity that is no longer in existence,subd.d.pursuant to these statutory provisions,an individual,an association,or an organization may qualify as a client,and a living or existing client is the privilege holder initially.
hlc contends that when an unincorporated organization such as enterprises manages an individual assets or business interests,and the individual,either personally or through agents,consults an attorney about those assets or business interests,the managing organization holds the privilege.to evaluate this contention,we consider what characteristics,if any,are necessary for an organization to hold the privilege.
in the proceedings below,the court of appeal reviewed various dictionary definitions of the term organization,as well as case law addressing the term in other contexts,random house webster college dict.defining organization as a group of persons organized for some end or work or the administrative personnel or apparatus of a business.because the term generally describes a group of persons working to pursue a common purpose,the court of appeal concluded that the business staff assembled by crosby to operate his entertainment interests qualifies as an organization for purposes of succession to the privilege.similarly,hlc contends here that crosby developed enterprises as a business organization by surround ing himself with,loyal employees and attorneys to advise him in conducting his business interests.
the evidence code does not define the term organization.neither did the commission propose a statutory definition of the term for the legislature approval.the commission,however,observed in a comment to the statute defining client that such unincorporated organizations as labor unions,social clubs,and fraternal societies have a privilege when the organization rather than its individual members is the client.com,reprinted at pt.west ann.ed.foll,smith laguna sur villas community th,d holding that a condominium association was the holder of the privilege and that its individual members could not demand production of privileged documents,except as the association board allowed.while not binding,the commission official comments reflect the intent of the legislature in enacting the evidence code and are entitled to substantial weight in construing it.van arsdale hollinger cal d,overruled on another point in privette superior court cal th,fn,d,see people williams cal d.
as mca points out,each of the three unincorporated organizations the commission lists is a collective entity that the internal revenue code recognizes as having tax exempt status,c labor organizations,c social clubs,c fraternal organizations.additionally,the assets of the listed organizations generally are not subject to probate administration when their individual members die.here,there is no suggestion that enterprises qualified for tax exempt status,and the three recording contracts at issue were probated as part of crosby estate.nonetheless,such circumstances do not necessarily foreclose hlc privilege claim because the comment to section does not purport to limit availability of the privilege to only those unincorporated organizations specifically listed.
a core statutory concept is controlling on the matter,however.that is,even assuming an unincorporated business organization may consist of an individual and his employees working together to further the individual business affairs,the evidence code makes clear that the privilege belongs only to the client,whether the client is a natural person,an unincorporated organization,or some other entity.see smith laguna sur villas community,supra,th at,d.thus,the validity of hlc claim that it holds the privilege as enterprises successor depends on whether enterprises itself,as opposed to crosby or any other of its supposed individual members,was the original client and privilege holder with respect to the written communications at issue 
here,the trial court found that crosby,the natural person,not enterprises or any other business organization,was the client who sought the legal advice reflected in the documents.as a reviewing court,we may not disturb the trial court finding if there is any substantial evidence to support it.gionis,supra,cal th at,d,chadbourne,supra,cal d at.
our review of the record discloses the following evidence regarding crosby identity as the client whose communications with various attorneys are at issue.according to the sworn declaration of hlc counsel of record,mark brodka,crosby was a business machine who had business interests in a number of fields including entertainment,mining,oil,real estate,and other ventures.with regard to the three recording contracts at issue in this litigation,there appears no dispute that crosby signed them in his individual capacity,rather than in a representative capacity on behalf of enterprises or some other organization.the record also confirms that,after crosby died,his many business assets and interests,including the three recording contracts,were probated as part of his estate.
the record shows that the key person responsible for managing crosby business interests throughout crosby lifetime,grillo,believed he was hired to work for crosby as an individual.as grillo stated in his deposition testimony,the enterprises moniker was just a loose terminology to cover everything that crosby did.although grillo also claimed that enterprises had employed him,mozelle seger,nancy briggs,and others at the time of crosby death,the record contains no evidence that any source other than crosby himself paid their salaries and benefits.indeed,the court files of crosby probated estate contained an order showing that,after crosby death,his estate made employment termination payments to seger and briggs and paid their health and life insurance premiums all this supports the conclusion that crosby acted in an individual capacity in running his business affairs,not in any representative capacity on behalf of an entity with independent interests or an organization representing the collective interests of crosby and other members.
finally,the record indicates the attorneys listed on hlc privilege logs as authors or recipients of the withheld documents regarded crosby as the client they represented.referring to the logs,brodka declared members of the meyers firm who represented crosby included john,richard bergen,and donald petroni.additional attorneys who represented crosby or whom crosby consulted with were,among others thomas,stewart schwartz,george foley,todd johnson and beck.italics added.similarly,grillo testified in his deposition that john and todd johnson represented crosby and hired grillo for crosby.thomas,a tax attorney,indicated in his deposition that he did tax planning and prepared state and federal income tax returns for both crosby and bing crosby productions,but not enterprises notably,none of these attorneys claimed to have performed separate legal work on behalf of enterprises 
in sum,the record contains substantial evidence supporting the trial court determination that a natural person,crosby,was the original client who held the privilege for the communications pertaining to his three recording contracts.likewise,the evidence fails to demonstrate,as a matter of law,that enterprises was the client of the named attorneys with interests of its own or its collective members to protect.see gionis,supra,cal th at,d,chadbourne,supra,cal d at.hlc offers no authority suggesting that crosby himself could not be the client on whose behalf those attorneys were consulted,merely because he employed others to assist him in managing his business interests and assets
