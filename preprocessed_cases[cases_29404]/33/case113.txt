this appeal from the united states district court for the western district of new york concerns the enforceability of an attorney substitution agreement agreement.gary logan,seeks to rescind an agreement with ballow brasted rusin,bbor,obligating logan to pay bbor of the attorney fees logan recovered from his representation of eric roll,who formerly had been bbor client.logan seeks rescission on the grounds that bbor fraudulently induced him to enter into the agreement,and the agreement runs afoul of disciplinary rule a of new york lawyer code of professional responsibility dr and nevada supreme court rule.we hold that,due to logan delay in challenging the contract,he has waived his right to assert rescission.we also hold that because bbor unquestionably contributed to roll case and nothing in the record suggests that bbor refused to contribute more substantially to roll legal services,the agreement is enforceable pursuant to new york contract law.although the district court decision relied on alternative reasoning we nevertheless affirm the district court order compelling logan to pay plus interest as calculated under a.
on november,eric roll roll sustained injuries while serving in the air force at nellis air force base in nevada.he retained the plaintiff,bbor,a law firm in buffalo,new york,to represent him in his personal injury action.bbor filed a complaint on roll behalf in the united states district court for the western district of new york on november.on march,roll informed bbor that he wanted the defendant,gary logan logan,an attorney in las vegas,nevada,to replace bbor as his counsel.
when roll informed john ballow,a partner at bbor,that he wanted logan to assume his representation,ballow and logan negotiated terms that were memorialized in the agreement.the agreement substituted logan for bbor as roll counsel and provided that logan would pay bbor of the gross legal fees obtained in the event roll recovers monetary damages in this action,whether by settlement or judgment.the agreement also noted that bbor had already spent for expenses and disbursements litigating roll case,but provided that these expenditures would be included in the paid from the gross attorney fees.finally,the agreement provided that bbor would immediately transfer roll file to logan office.all parties involved signed the agreement and submitted it to the presiding judge,judge curtin,who the agreement and entered it as an order of the court on april.
after assuming representation of roll,logan filed a motion to transfer the case to the united states district court for the district of nevada.the transfer motion was granted and the case was tried in february.the jury deadlocked.the case thereafter was settled for in july.logan received attorney fees in the amount of.
when bbor demanded of the in accordance with the agreement,logan refused to make the payment and bbor commenced this suit in the united states district court for the western district of new york.logan answered and asserted various affirmative defenses,including two relating to the enforceability vel non of the agreement.
first,logan claimed that the agreement was induced by fraudulent misrepresentations.specifically,logan contended that,contrary to bbor assertions,bbor had not conducted extensive discovery,retained an expert,conferred with the expert to formulate a viable defense to the opposition motion for summary judgment,or incurred approximately in expenses.
second,logan argued that the agreement violated dr,which provides that 
a lawyer shall not divide a fee for legal services with another lawyer who is not a partner in or associate of the lawyer law firm,unless t he division is in proportion to the services performed by each lawyer or,by a writing given to the client,each lawyer assumes joint responsibility for the representation.

based on his claim that bbor materially had misrepresented the extent of its contribution to roll case and the disciplinary rule violation,logan refused to pay bbor pursuant to the attorney substitution agreement.
at the conclusion of discovery,bbor moved for summary judgment.in opposition,logan argued that there existed a dispute as to whether bbor had made material misrepresentations that induced logan to sign the agreement.the district court denied bbor motion,holding that bbor had violated united states district court for the western district of new york local rule of civil procedure local rule e requiring the filing of a memorandum of law with a motion for summary judgment,both parties had violated local rule d mandating the specification of particular admissible evidence following each material fact,and bbor failed to demonstrate that it is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law within the meaning of rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure.it is unclear,however,whether the final ground for denial was based on substantive or procedural grounds.
bbor then filed a motion for reconsideration of the court order.in an order signed on august,the court reconsidered its prior order and granted plaintiff motion for summary judgment.this order declared that the stipulation substituting counsel was a court order,not a contract,and therefore was not subject to logan asserted contract defense.alternatively,even if the stipulation had been deemed a contract,the court rejected logan fraudulent inducement claim.the court also found that dr was inapplicable because the agreement concerned an attorney substitution,not a agreement governing joint representation by multiple attorneys.as a result of these findings,the court granted bbor motion for reconsideration and ordered logan to pay plus interest as calculated according to a.because we agree that logan is required to pay bbor the amount memorialized in the agreement,albeit for different reasons than those given by the district court,we affirm.
after granting bbor motion for reconsideration,the district court granted bbor motion for summary judgment,concluding that there were no genuine issues of material fact,and that bbor was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.we review a district court granting of summary judgment de novo.rubens mason,cir.
logan contends that he is not required to fulfill his obligation under the agreement because bbor fraudulently induced him to enter into the agreement.the law is clear that a party induced to enter a contract by fraud or misrepresentations must make a choice the party may either elect to accept the situation created by the fraud and seek to recover his damages or he may elect to repudiate the transaction and seek to be placed in status quo.as a general rule,however,the defrauded party can not both rescind and maintain an action for deceit.richard lord,williston on contracts,at ed quoting ringsby truck lines beardsley,cir see also ferguson lion holding,d.logan chose the second option,rescission,as manifested both by his actions,refusal to remit any money to bbor and his words,his fifth affirmative defense.
where a party opts for rescission due to misrepresentation or fraud 
i t is well settled by repeated decisions of the supreme c ourt that he must upon the discovery of the fraud announce his purpose and adhere to it.if he continues to treat the property as his own the right of rescission is gone,and the party will be held bound by the contract.
