background 
kevin hall is an inmate at the federal correctional institution in greenville,illinois fci greenville,and was when he was indicted.assistant federal public defender lawrence fleming was appointed as hall counsel on september.earlier,fleming had represented a defendant named anthony gignac.gignac had pleaded guilty and had been sentenced ten days before fleming began his representation of hall.
on september,fleming revealed his representation of gignac to the assistant united state attorney who was prosecuting hall.he explained that gignac had informed prison officials that one thomas belwood,one of hall,was involved in the distribution of marijuana while serving as a corrections officer at fci greenville.fleming expressed his assumption that the reports of drug dealing at fci greenville that gignac had given to fbi agents in connection with his proffer still existed.fleming concluded by noting his concern that his serving as gignac counsel created a conflict of interest in his representation of hall if there is any possibility that gignac will be a witness in this case,there is an obvious conflict.br.of at.
the district court set hall pretrial conference for november,and a jury trial for december.each of hall pleaded guilty by the end of november.during that time,fleming had been communicating with the government in an effort to reach a plea agreement for hall.in another letter to the ausa,dated october,fleming expressed desire to begin conversation about hall case and stated that,if you will recommend the low end of the guidelines and agree that there will be no further prosecutions for any offense now known to the government,i will recommend that hall plead guilty pursuant to your standard plea agreement.br.of at.
with respect to fleming conflict of interest,the october letter expressed fleming assumption that the ausa did not perceive any conflict based on fleming prior representation of gignac 
finally,since i have not received a response to my letter of september,i assume you do not see any conflict on behalf of our office in this case.if you do,please let me know immediately.
in a letter from fleming to the ausa dated november,fleming stated that he had not received a plea agreement from the ausa despite the scheduled change of plea hearing on november,
i do have a plea agreement from you yet,but if you agree with the computations set out in my letter of october,copy attached i appreciate you getting a draft of a plea agreement to me by monday,november,so that i have a chance to review it with hall before the.
the november letter also stated that the government had not provided the discovery that fleming october letter had requested 
hall is still rather adamant about the fact that we still do have all the discovery,so if you have anything else you can give me,please send that also.
fleming concluded the november letter noting his concern that convincing hall to plead guilty was going to be difficult 
this is going to require a continuing sales job on my part,since my client is fairly well institutionalized,so please give me whatever you can to answer his arguments.
hall pleaded guilty on november,and was sentenced.hall eventually received a copy of his entire case file where he learned for the first time that fleming had represented gignac.in addition,there is no indication in the record that fleming informed the district court of the potential conflict.
discussion 
standard of review 
in reviewing the district court order denying a petitioner motion to vacate or set aside his conviction pursuant to,we review all questions of law de novo.stoia united states,cir.the district court factual findings are reviewed for clear error.id.a petitioner is entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his claims,when he alleges facts that,if proven,would entitle him to relief.id.
hall assertion that he was denied his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel is reviewed de novo.spreitzer peters,cir,modified in part,cir.
ii.analysis 
criminal defendants are guaranteed effective assistance of counsel at all stages of the proceedings against them.cates superintendent,cir.this right includes the right to representation that is free from conflict of interest.spreitzer,at quoting wood georgia,d.
there are two ways to assert a claim based on counsel conflict of interest.one,under strickland washington,d,the petitioner may show that his attorney had a potential conflict of interest and that the potential conflict prejudiced his defense or two,the petitioner may proceed under cuyler sullivan,d,where he must establish a violation by showing that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer performance.stoia,at quoting sullivan,at.emphasis added.
proceeding under sullivan places a lighter burden on the defendant than strickland because demonstrating an adverse effect is significantly easier than showing prejudice.spreitzer,at stoia,at.this more lenient standard applies because the requirements in sullivan reflect that prejudice is presumed if the petitioner establishes both that his counsel had an actual conflict and that the conflict had an adverse effect on counsel performance.stoia,at quoting strickland,at.
conflict of interest 
under sullivan,an actual conflict exists if the defense counsel was faced with a choice between advancing his own interests above those of his client.stoia,at.we have held that an attorney prior representation of another client leads to an actual conflict when the attorney faces the possibility of having to his former client.enoch gramley,cir.a corollary danger is that the lawyer will fail to the former client rigorously for fear of revealing or misusing privileged information.id.here,hall defense counsel had a potential conflict of interest because of his representation of gignac,who,according to fleming account,had provided information about belwood activities at fci greenville to fbi agents.because hall was charged with conspiring with belwood,gignac implication of belwood pertained to the offenses for which hall was indicted.
in cases where there is successive representation,we have held that the defendant must show either that the attorney representation of the first client was substantially and particularly related to his later representation of defendant,or that the attorney actually learned particular confidential information during the prior representation of the witness that was relevant to defendant later case.enoch,at.here,fleming representation of gignac enabled him to learn confidential information pertaining directly to hall case.fleming correspondence with the ausa reveals his own concerns about such a conflict.
adverse effect 
a showing of a conflict does not automatically entitle a petitioner to reversal.the supreme court in mickens taylor,d,requires that a petitioner also show adverse effect.however,we find no language in mickens that requires a petitioner to engage in speculation pointing to an actual adverse effect before he has the benefit of an evidentiary hearing.a petitioner demonstrates an adverse effect by showing that there is a reasonable likelihood that his counsel performance would have been different had there been no conflict of interest.stoia,at.pursuant to this requirement,a petitioner who pleaded guilty upon the advice of an attorney with a conflict of interest is not required to demonstrate that he would have decided against pleading guilty had he been represented by a attorney.id.explaining the distinction between strickland but for requirement and sullivan adverse impact standard.nor does such a petitioner need to establish that a attorney would have advised against pleading guilty.thomas foltz,cir explaining that the proper focus should be on whether the defense counsel conflict affected his actions and the defendant decision to plead guilty,not whether another attorney without conflict would have made the same recommendation.
as we have held,a defendant can establish ineffective assistance of counsel by showing that his attorney pressured him to plead guilty because of the attorney conflict of interest.daniels united states,cir.hall argues that fleming improperly influenced him to plead guilty and rushed him through that process in order to avoid the conflict between his successive representation of gignac and then hall.hall has presented record evidence,in the form of the correspondence between fleming and the ausa,which supports this position.hall produced what an individual in his position could have under these circumstances.it would have been practically impossible for hall to establish that fleming would have had trouble examining gignac or that he would have failed to turn the case over to a colleague.at an evidentiary hearing,hall can attempt to show adverse effect by establishing that fleming improperly pressured hall to accept the plea in order to avoid proceeding to trial.this is consistent with the requirement of sullivan that a defendant show that conflict of interest actually affected the adequacy of his representation.sullivan,at.if hall can show at a hearing that counsel neglected preparation for trial while pressuring hall to take a plea because of a conflicting interest,he will have established a conflict that affected the adequacy of representation.
while mickens contains dicta that can be read to cast doubt on the application of the sullivan framework in cases of successive representation,see mickens,at,the facts of this case are distinguishable.the conflict here involved successive representations that were just ten days apart and were also closely interrelated.it is unclear whether mickens would be applicable to such a situation.in any case,enoch,applying sullivan to cases of successive representation,remains controlling in this circuit and we see no reason to ignore it here.moss united states,cir explaining the effect of mickens in cases of successive representation and ultimately applying sullivan because the likelihood of prejudice under the circumstances exceeded that of a traditional successive representation.
in rosenwald united states,cited in the dissent,we stated that the fact that rosenwald did not go to trial did not undermine his allegations of prejudice,cir.we noted that even if the attorney took steps in advance of trial to avoid having to a witness,the client was nonetheless the victim of his attorney divided loyalties.in that case,as in this one,the record did not conclusively establish that his attorney representation was unaffected by his conflict of interest and we remanded for an evidentiary hearing.
in addition,rosenwald was a party to a civil case.we stated,the pragmatic pressure on counsel in cases such as these is purely lawyer does not want to lose a client whether that client is seeking advice on civil or criminal matters.id.we mentioned the attorney financial interest to illustrate that the attorney conflict in a civil case does not lessen the ethical quagmire merely because it does not possess the seriousness of a criminal proceeding.we said,the ethical dilemma is also the attorney must still guard secrets and confidences and must seek to promote the client interests whether the client is being represented in a civil or a criminal matter.see aba model code of professional responsibility conduct rule a confidentiality,b conflict of interest.rosenwald does not stand for the notion that an attorney interest is only financial nor does it suggest that the petitioner must show exactly what his attorney motivation was when the attorney proceeded despite the conflict.more importantly,rosenwald drives home the point that secrets between an attorney and his client are sacred as were those between fleming and gignac and that a conflict of interest can taint an attorney decisions before,during and after trial.
also the dissent states that hall has not shown adverse effect.we believe hall has put forth record evidence to show adverse effect.he has certainly put forth all someone in his position could without the benefit of an evidentiary hearing.the facts alleged are enough to warrant an evidentiary hearing they show that fleming was laboring under an actual conflict of interest and may have induced hall to plead guilty in an effort to avoid the conflict.hall was unaware of the conflict and he was entitled to have all the relevant information his attorney had in which to assist in his own defense.this includes both possible information fleming had with regard to gignac as well as the knowledge of the conflict itself.
under sullivan,hall need not show prejudice if he can show an actual conflict existed that had an adverse effect on his representation.we think,given a chance,that hall may uncover evidence at a hearing that would show an adverse effect.such a hearing may include testimony from fleming,the ausa,hall himself.
this does not ignore the holding in mickens,if hall can prove at a hearing that fleming conflict adversely affected his representation then mickens says he is entitled to relief.stoia and enoch are not disturbed by the holding in mickens.in stoia we held that a petitioner shows adverse effect by showing there is a reasonable likelihood that the attorney would have acted differently without a conflict.stoia united states,cir.in that case,after an evidentiary hearing,we denied relief because the adverse effect was not shown.if at the hearing it is found that hall can not show adverse effect,then he must proceed under the ordinary strickland standard of prejudice where he must show that but for counsel errors,the outcome of the proceeding would have been different.
hall is entitled to an evidentiary hearing to determine whether there was an actual conflict of interest that produced an adverse effect.
we reverse and remand to the district court for that purpose.
kevin hall pleaded guilty to a drug conspiracy.now he wants collateral relief on the ground that his lawyer formerly represented anthony gignac,who might have been called as a witness had a trial occurred,and therefore could not represent him adequately.the conclusion that these events call into question the validity of the plea is incompatible with mickens taylor,d,and would be hard to justify even under decisions.
after hall was indicted,the federal defender office for the southern district of illinois assigned lawrence fleming to represent him.fleming previously had furnished legal assistance to gignac,and given the posture of these proceedings i must assume that gignac might have been a witness had a trial been the united states attorney denies that gignac would have been called,and he should know.the prosecutor says that gignac knows nothing material to the charge against hall.hall theory is that fleming him to plead guilty in order to avoid the problem that would ensue if gignac took the stand.this is implausible on its own terms.why should fleming have cared the federal defender in the southern district has five other lawyers on the staff.if the case had gone to trial,and the prosecutor had shown any inclination to call gignac,fleming could have turned the representation ove
