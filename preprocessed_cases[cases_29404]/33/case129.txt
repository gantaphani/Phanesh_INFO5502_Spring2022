nicholas knopick knopick appeals the district court of the middle district of pennsylvania grant of summary judgment for appellee philip downey downey,esquire,on knopick legal malpractice tort and contract claims against downey.knopick claims that downey committed malpractice in failing to prosecute a legal malpractice action on knopick behalf against john connelly,esquire,susan kadel,esquire,and their law firm james,smith,durkin connelly,connelly defendants.
knopick argues that the district court should not have applied the occurrence rule to determine the start date of the statute of limitations for his claim against the connelly defendants instead,the court should have tolled the statute of limitations based on the discovery rule or fraudulent concealment doctrine.knopick also argues that even applying the occurrence rule,the district court erred in its ruling because he and downey had entered into an relationship before the statute of limitations had run.
we find that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of downey based on its application of the occurrence rule to knopick underlying claim against the connelly defendants.we will apply the discovery rule to knopick underlying claim and we subsequently find a genuine issue of fact as to when knopick should have known of his injury and its cause under the discovery rule.we will reverse the decision of the district court and remand knopick case for further proceedings,in accordance with this opinion.
background 
on may,knopick,a commercial pilot,and his wife,darlene knopick dolly,entered into a separation and property settlement agreement psa or the agreement whereby dolly would receive from knopick retirement plan.in july,knopick filed for divorce.dolly filed a motion to set aside the agreement and to hold an equitable distribution hearing for the property.in the motion,she alleged that knopick failed to disclose all of his stock investments at the time they entered into the agreement.specifically,she was unaware of two million dollars worth of stock that knopick held.knopick maintained that at the time of the agreement,dolly was fully aware of all of his assets,including the two million dollars worth of stock.in any case,the stock was encumbered by a two million dollar loan.
knopick retained the connelly defendants in to represent him in the matter.the connelly defendants told knopick that the agreement was valid,and that if it were set aside,he would only have to pay dolly the amount that the stock was worth at the time he entered into the agreement.on august,a psa hearing was held before judge kathy morrow in the court of common pleas in perry county,pennsylvania,to determine whether dolly was provided with full disclosure of knopick assets in.
before the hearing,knopick told connelly of four witnesses who could testify as to dolly knowledge of his assets at the time he entered into the psa.the witnesses on the list were dolly lawyer,carl wass knopick lawyer,michael hanft the couple accountant,charles chuck pegg and his wife,becky pegg.knopick claims that connelly represented that he would contact the witnesses on the list,including wall,chuck pegg,and hanft.prior to the psa hearing,dolly offered to settle the case,if knopick would transfer of his ups stock to her.based on advice from connelly and kadel,including kadel indication that they had a lot of evidence including tax returns,knopick rejected the offer.
neither kadel nor connelly met with knopick prior to the hearing.on august,the date of the hearing,knopick was informed that kadel,not connelly whom he had expected to appear on his behalf would represent him at the hearing.kadel did not call any of the witnesses that knopick had recommended.kadel told knopick that connelly did not need to be there,that the other witnesses were not necessary because of the tax records,and that the agreement would not be set aside.
in fact,only knopick testified on his own behalf.knopick denied committing any fraud or concealing his assets.he testified that dolly was aware of the value of his stock and that she had access to all of his financial statements.he further stated that dolly had access to his financial information each year when they prepared their joint tax returns with their accountant,pegg.
dolly and her sister,carol ann chaft,testified on dolly behalf.dolly testified that knopick had acted fraudulently and had failed to disclose his assets.dolly claimed that she thought knopick only had a small amount of stocks and that she did not know their value.dolly asserted that knopick and pegg did not share knopick financial information with her when they did the couple taxes.she also testified that,at the time,she believed hanft to be their family attorney.she professed that she never consulted with wass about knopick assets before signing the agreement.
after the hearing,kadel told knopick that it had gone well.connelly told knopick later that the hearing was not a big deal and that any competent attorney could handle it.app.at.over the next few months when knopick spoke to connelly and kadel,they told him that there was nothing to worry about,and assured him that the hearing had gone well.on july,the court decided the matter in dolly favor,setting aside the agreement in order to subject knopick assets to an equitable distribution hearing.knopick claims that at that point,kadel and connelly told him that an appeal was in the works shortly thereafter,knopick discharged the connelly defendants because of how connelly had handled the custody aspect of the case.at that point,knopick hired attorney rich wagner to represent him,and claims that only after wagner reviewed the case did he come to believe that connelly and kadel may have been negligent.
on july,knopick first met with downey,who had been recommended to him,to discuss bringing a malpractice action against the connelly defendants for their representation of him in the psa matter on august,at downey direction,downey and knopick met with attorney albert momjian,whom downey identified as an expert in domestic relations cases.after their meeting,downey met with knopick several times and told knopick that he had a good malpractice case.downey also told knopick that he had retained an expert and was filing suit on knopick behalf.
on october,downey sent a letter to the connelly defendants stating,in part,the following 
having reviewed the hearing transcript,it does appear that your firm was negligent in failing to present both testimonial and documentary evidence,and for repeatedly failing to object to improper testimony by darlene knopick and questioning by her attorney.
the evidence and objections in question,were of sufficient weight that they very likely would have resulted in a different outcome at this juncture we do not know knopick exact monetary loss as a result of your firm apparent malpractice however,it seems almost certain that it will exceed one million dollars,and could well be in the vicinity of fifteen million dollars.
please place your carrier on notice of this potential claim.the statute of limitations on this matter,in tort,is july,two years after the date of judge morrow order invalidating the property settlement agreement.
app.at.on march,five months later,downey asked knopick to sign an official agreement to file suit on the malpractice claim,which knopick did.however,downey did not file the lawsuit.
on february,downey sent knopick a letter terminating his representation.knopick claims that until this time,downey repeatedly told him that he had a good case.the letter stated that the statute of limitations on his claim against the connelly defendants had begun to run from the date of the august,hearing when the firm failed to call potentially relevant witnesses,and had expired on august,prior to downey representation of knopick 
on july,knopick filed suit against the connelly defendants,claiming legal malpractice under a breach of contract theory.in that complaint,knopick also brought claims against downey,alleging legal malpractice under both tort and contract theories of liability.on july,the connelly defendants moved to dismiss knopick claim against them.on december,the district court granted this motion.it found that knopick claim against the connelly defendants was grounded in tort,not contract.the tort claim was thus subject to a statute of limitations which had run,with regard to knopick claims against them,regardless of the start date of the statute of limitations,an issue which the court explicitly did not decide.knopick connelly,civil,wl,at.knopick did not file a timely appeal of that ruling.
on october,downey filed a motion for summary judgment on knopick claims against him.the district court granted the motion on january.in his motion,downey argued that knopick claims must fail because downey and the connelly defendants did not cause knopick to suffer economic damages and because the psa was the product of knopick own fraud.in a footnote,downey noted that if knopick claims survived summary judgment,a critical factor in determining his tort claim would be when the applicable statute of limitations began to run at the august hearing or at the time of knopick notice of the state court july order.knopick addressed the statute of limitations argument in his brief in response,claiming that the statute did not commence until the court order,and that downey,whom he retained in march,was therefore retained within the tort statute of limitations.
the district court granted downey motion for summary judgment on knopick tort claim on the statute of limitations ground finding that the occurrence rule applied to start the statute on the date of hearing august.the court also found that although the parties made numerous potentially meritorious arguments,the statute of limitations on knopick claims had run by the time he retained downey for the malpractice claim.this was devastating to knopick claim that downey committed malpractice by not filing a claim against the connelly defendants.in so finding,the court determined that pennsylvania discovery rule did not toll the start of the statute of limitations.the court also granted summary judgment on knopick contract claim for legal malpractice against downey,finding that the claim was actually grounded in tort the district court did not reach downey other arguments for summary judgment because of its dispositive statute of limitations determination.knopick appeals the district court order.

the district court had jurisdiction under,due to diversity of citizenship of the parties.we have jurisdiction over this appeal,pursuant to.
we exercise plenary review over a district court grant of summary judgment and apply the same standard of whether genuine issues as to material fact exist such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the plaintiff.a.debiec cabot,cir.we must view the record and draw inferences in a light most favorable to the party.in re ikon office solutions,cir.
iii.analysis 
state tolling principles are generally to be used by a federal court when it is applying a state limitations period therefore,we look to pennsylvania law,predicting how the pennsylvania supreme court would resolve the statute of limitations issue.debiec,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted jewelcor,karfunkel,cir.when ascertaining pennsylvania law,the decisions of the pennsylvania supreme court are the authoritative source.spence esab group,cir.when making a prediction as to how the pennsylvania supreme court would rule,we must look to decisions of state intermediate appellate courts,of federal courts interpreting that state law,and of other state supreme courts that have addressed the issue,among other sources.id.internal quotation marks omitted quoting norfolk ry.basell usa,cir.
pennsylvania imposes a statute of limitations on tortious conduct,including legal malpractice actions.pennsylvania favors strict application of statutes of limitations.glenbrook leasing beausang,appeal granted in part,pa and order aff without opinion.whether the statute has run on a claim is usually a question of law for the trial judge,but where the issue involves a factual determination,the determination is for the jury.foulke dugan,d,quoting hayward med.ctr.of beaver.
the trigger for the accrual of a legal malpractice action is not the realization of actual loss,but the occurrence of a breach of duty.wachovia bank,ferretti.under the occurrence rule,the statutory period commences upon the happening of the alleged breach of duty.id.at quoting robbins seventko orthopedic surgeons,geisenberger.where a plaintiff could not reasonably have discovered his injury or its cause,however,pennsylvania courts have applied the discovery rule to toll the statute of limitations.wachovia,at citing pocono int l raceway pocono produce.where the discovery rule does apply,the period on legal malpractice actions begins to run where the plaintiff knew or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known of the injury and its cause.crouse.cyclops.
knopick argues that instead of the occurrence rule,the court should have applied the discovery rule in deciding the statute of limitations issue on his claim against the connelly defendants.alternatively,knopick argues that the connelly defendants would have been equitably estopped from asserting a statute of limitations defense based on the doctrine of fraudulent concealment fraudulent concealment would also toll the start of the statute of limitations on knopick malpractice claim until he reasonably should have been aware of his injury and its cause see fine,at.
the discovery rule is historically grounded on considerations of basic fairness.taylor tukanowicz,citing ayers morgan.it was first enunciated by the pennsylvania supreme court in a coal conversion action where the subsurface injury,defendant removal of coal from plaintiff property,was unknown to the plaintiff.the analysis focused on the inability of the plaintiff,despite the exercise of diligence,to know of the trespass.pocono,at.this tolled the running of the statute,for no amount of vigilance w ould enable him to detect the approach of a trespasser who may be working his way through the coal seams underlying adjoining lands.id.internal quotation marks omitted quoting lewey fricke coke,he can not reasonably be required to act until knowledge that action is needed is possible to him.we are disposed to hold,therefore,that the statute runs against an injury committed in or to a lower stratum from the time of actual discovery,or the time when discovery was reasonably possible.
subsequently,the rule was principally applied in medical malpractice cases,notably one that involved the failure of a surgeon to remove a sponge after surgery.ayers,at citing lewey,at.the discovery rule was implicated based on the inability of the plaintiff to ascertain the presence of the sponge.this prevent ed the commencement of the running of the statute,for c ertainly he could not open his abdomen like a door and look in certainly he would need to have medical advice and counsel.pocono,at quoting ayers,at.in ayers,the pennsylvania supreme court reversed the lower court summary judgment order starting the statute of limitations at the time of surgery when the sponge was left in plaintiff abdomen.
pennsylvania courts have since applied the discovery rule to other types of actions under the same principle.see anthony koppers,rev on other grounds.
we also look to our circuit pronouncements regarding pennsylvania discovery rule in the context of medical malpractice and physical tort claims.we have found that the rule is designed to ameliorate the effects of the statute of limitations,and it is often applied in medical malpractice and latent disease cases in which the plaintiff is unable to discover his or her injury until several years after the tort occurred.mest cabot,cir finding material issue of fact as to whether plaintiffs exercised reasonable diligence in determining cause of their cows illness where plaintiffs relied on experts advice and defendant representation that its emissions from industrial facility were harmless citing cathcart keene indus.insulation,see also bohus,at finding either discovery rule or fraudulent concealment tolled limitations period and evidence supported jury conclusion that patient could not have discovered the cause of her injuries subsequent to bunion surgery until she consulted an orthopedic surgeon where original doctor assured her that the pain was result of normal healing process and plaintiff consulted other physicians who confirmed prognosis 
the common thread in the discovery rule application in medical malpractice cases is that a plaintiff suffers a physical ailment after undergoing treatment from a doctor,but is unaware of the subsequent injury at the time of the breach of duty.specifically,the symptoms have not yet become apparent or the symptoms experienced up until that time are presumed to be normal.until the plaintiff experiences abnormal symptoms,or the abnormal condition manifests itself,a plaintiff shall,under the rule,not be held responsible for knowing of the injury its cause,thus triggering the statute of limitations.
these principles are similarly applicable in the context of legal malpractice actions.both pennsylvania courts and federal courts within this circuit have recognized the discovery rule application in legal malpractice matters.in particular,the discovery rule has been applied in legal malpractice cases when the injured party is unable,despite the exercise of due diligence to know of his injury or its cause.see bohus,at.these courts have applied the discovery rule where requiring a plaintiff knowledge of his injury would otherwise be unreasonable.the effect is that the discovery rule tolls the running of the statute of limitations until a plaintiff is put in a position to discover the injury and its cause,either through inquiry or retention of a new lawyer.knowledge may also be imputed to plaintiffs when an adverse action is taken against them,be it through a court order or through a third party action,thus initiating the running of the statute of limitations at that time.
since this is a matter of state law,we look to pennsylvania state courts initially.the pennsylvania supreme court has acknowledged the occurrence rule in deciding when the statute of limitations should begin to run in the criminal defense context of a plaintiff claim of legal malpractice,but to our knowledge,has not yet analyzed the discovery rule application to legal malpractice in a civil suit.see bailey tucker,with regard to the respective statutes of limitations,the rule in this commonwealth is that the statutory period commences at the time the harm is suffered or,if appropriate,at the time the alleged malpractice is discovered citing pocono,at however,one of pennsylvania intermediate appellate courts,the pennsylvania superior court,has analyzed the discovery rule in legal malpractice contexts.these rulings,along with the pennsylvania supreme court application in the medical malpractice context,are instructive in this context.spence,at.
in wachovia,the pennsylvania superior court found that under the occurrence rule,plaintiff legal malpractice and breach of contract causes of action against its attorney would have accrued at the time the attorney allegedly breached a duty owed when she failed to mark a judgment in a legal filing as satisfied.at.however,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff,the court assumed that plaintiff,despite the exercise of due diligence,could not have reasonably been aware of this alleged breach until a third party initiated proceedings against the plaintiff for damages.the statute of limitations was therefore tolled from the time of the failure to mark the judgment until the third party lawsuit against wachovia two years later,in which the damages regarding the failure to mark were asserted.plaintiff delay in filing its malpractice claim until final resolution of the third party lawsuit nine years later was not excused by the discovery rule,because the plaintiff was reasonably aware of the malpractice when the third party claim was first filed.
in beausang,at,the pennsylvania superior court affirmed the trial court application of the discovery rule in delaying the start of the statute of limitations in a legal malpractice action.the case involved a leasing company that retained defendant butera,beausang,cohen brennan bbcb,a law firm,to prepare an agreement of sale and deed in connection with plaintiff purchase of office space from a condominium association.the agreement of sale included language that parking spaces would be included in the sale,but the deed contained no such language.six years after the sale,a dispute arose between the plaintiff and the condominium association regarding the use of the parking spaces due to the lack of title transfer of the spaces.the condominium association sent a letter to defendant bbcb accusing it of malpractice,a copy of which was sent to the plaintiff.
at that time,plaintiff glenbrook sought a second opinion from another firm which advised that glenbrook may have a malpractice claim against bbcb.following a bench trial five years later in the action between glenbrook and the condominium association,in which the court ruled in the condominium association favor,glenbrook filed suit against bbcb.glenbrook claimed that the statute of limitations for malpractice should be tolled until the resolution of the bench trial.
the superior court held that it would be unreasonable to expect the individuals that constituted the plaintiff,to learn of the injury of the firm deficiency in the deed or the operation of the real estate doctrine of merger at the time that the sale occurred and the deed was conveyed to the plaintiff.it made this finding notwithstanding the reference to the parking spaces in the agreement of sale.the court found that the plaintiff acquired knowledge of the harm and the statute of limitations began to run when the condominium association sent glenbrook the copy of the letter to bbcb accusing bbcb of legal malpractice and glenbrook sought a second legal opinion which confirmed that glenbrook had a possible legal action against bbcb 
in robbins,plaintiff medical corporation brought a legal malpractice action against its law firm,alleging negligence in its filing of an employee pension plan with the internal revenue service irs.the pennsylvania superior court found that the statute of limitations did not accrue at the time of filing,but rather when the irs,seven years later,notified the corporation that deductions for the pension plan were disallowed 
the nettlesome issue is how to differentiate between instances when application of the discovery rule is appropriate or not.where reasonable minds would not differ in finding that a party knew or should have known on the exercise of reasonable diligence of his injury and its cause,fine,at,a court should determine,as a matter of law,that the discovery rule does not apply.t he point of time at which the injured party should reasonably be aware that he or she has suffered an injury is generally an issue of fact to be determined by the jury only where the facts are so clear that reasonable minds can not differ may the commencement of the limitation period be determined as a matter of law.coregis ins.baratta fenerty,cir quoting sadtler jackson cross.
reasonable diligence is an objective test,kach hose,cir,but it is also sufficiently flexible to take into account the differences between persons and their capacity to meet certain situations and the circumstances confronting them at the time in question.id.at quoting miller,at internal quotation marks omitted.i n this context,reasonable diligence is not an absolute standard,but is what is expected from a party who has been given reason to inform himself of the facts upon which his right to recovery is premised.fine,at.demonstrating the expected diligence requires a plaintiff to establish a display of those qualities of attention,knowledge,intelligence,and judgment which society requires of its members for the protection of their own interests and the interests of others.wilson el daief,citation omitted.although there are few facts which diligence can not discover,there must be some reason to awaken inquiry and direct diligence in the channel in which it would be successful.urland merrell dow,cir quoting deemer weaver,see also debiec.
where the plaintiff has no reason to investigate,the statute will be tolled.foulke,d at citing sterling stack gallagher,cv,wl,at.however,if something exists to trigger the inquiry,then the plaintiff must demonstrate that he conducted an investigation,and despite doing so,did not discover his injury.id.
knopick argues that the statute of limitations for his malpractice action against the connelly defendants was tolled until,at the earliest,july,the date of the state court order mandating relief to dolly.he contends that he did not discover his injury until after this date.he believed everything had gone well at the hearing based on the connelly defendants assurances,both immediately after the hearing and over the succeeding months.knopick did not believe that his agreement would be set aside.knopick argues that this state of affairs affected his ability to discover his injury and that,until the court ruling he believed that the connelly defendants had handled the hearing appropriately and that he would win.hence,he had no reason to engage in an inquiry or conduct further due diligence.
knopick relies primarily on fine,one of the pennsylvania supreme court most recent iterations of the discovery rule,which is a consolidated medical malpractice case that involved a plaintiff inability to discover his injury through due diligence.in fine,defendant checcio surgically extracted fine wisdom teeth.fine experienced symptoms including pain,bleeding,infection,swelling,and numbness on both sides of his face,but considered these conditions to be normal,based on advice from checcio.all symptoms except the numbness subsided.according to fine,during his office visits with checcio in the months that followed,checcio repeatedly told fine that it would take six months for the numbness to subside.some numbness still continued on the left side of his lip and chin.when his symptoms continued a year after the surgery,fine came to believe that the persistent numbness was abnormal.
checcio moved for summary judgment based on the statute of limitations running from the time of the surgery,a motion the trial court denied without opinion.the jury returned a verdict for fine.on appeal,checcio argued that the trial court erred in denying her motion for summary judgment.the pennsylvania superior court agreed and reversed the judgment for fine.the pennsylvania supreme court reversed the superior court,finding that the grant of summary judgment was improper.responding to checcio argument that the discovery rule did not apply as a matter of law because fine was aware of the surgery and knew that his face was numb immediately after,the court found that,whether fine should have known through reasonable diligence that his numbness could have been a temporary physical consequence of and thus caused by the procedure or a manifestation of his injury remained disputed.fine,at.thus,the supreme court concluded that issues of fact existed for resolution by the fact finder 
knopick argues that,as in fine,a jury should decide whether a reasonable and diligent person should have immediately known that the failure to call witnesses at a hearing,in this context,was normal.he claims that,as a lay person,he was unable to know and understand that he had suffered an injury prior to speaking with other counsel knopick claims that he relaxed his vigilance,as did the plaintiff in fine,who was similarly reassured by his doctor that his symptoms were normal 
downey insists that the statute of limitations began to run at the time of the psa hearing on august,not when the court issued its july,order or sometime thereafter.he claims that knopick was fully aware of his alleged injury at the hearing when the connelly defendants did not call the witnesses he suggested to testify.he further claims in his brief in response,and at oral argument,that reliance on pennsylvania medical malpractice cases is improper,because medical malpractice is treated differently than legal malpractice,but offers no meaningful support for that distinction 
although we recognize that cases of medical malpractice require a different kind of trigger for a lay person to recognize an injury or its cause,and an injury nature and manifestation will differ,this does not preclude reference to,or reliance on,the application of the discovery rule,in that context,in evaluating claims of legal malpractice.
the district court below relied in part upon three district court decisions in deciding when the statute of limitations began to run at the time of the psa hearing and not when judge morrow issued her order.however,these cases did not address attorney assurances instead they involved some adverse action or ruling made by the court against the plaintiff to trigger the plaintiff awareness of injury and cause,or the alleged breach of duty or the plaintiff reaction to it was obvious enough in nature to suggest that the plaintiff should have been aware of the injury and its cause.
in the first,a district court found that the statute of limitations for malpractice,based on the attorney failure to obtain an expert witness,failure to depose witnesses,and failure to represent plaintiffs interests by demanding an additional,began on the day the plaintiffs received written notice from the attorney that the court had denied their motion to enlarge discovery to permit opinions of the expert and that they sought to cover anticipated expenses.saferstein paul,mardinly,durham,james,flandreau rodgers,no.civ.a,wl,at,aff without opinion,cir.
in that case,the court denial of counsel motion for discovery disallowing the expert,a ruling against the plaintiff,and defendants request for an additional were apparently construed by the court as being indicative of potential malpractice at the time.although that case is not binding,we can not find that the alleged conduct of malpractice in the instant case,as a matter of law,indicated injury or should have triggered investigation of injury to knopick.
the district court relied on another unpublished decision,carlise bartony,hare and edson,no.civ,wl,at,in which the court found that an attorney withdrawal of two of plaintiff claims during trial,and at a minimum the jury verdict,served as the start of the statute of limitations for plaintiff claim of legal malpractice for his attorney failure to discover and introduce a deed solidifying his property rights withdrawal of the two claims and the low amount of damages verdict.though the court did not include the entire factual background or discuss alleged attorney assurances,it concluded that the plaintiff was fully aware of each of these failures when they happened.the court discussed the discovery rule in finding that the plaintiff,at a minimum,was aware of the injuries and their cause as of the date the verdict was reached,though it did not save the late filing of his claim,more than five years after the jury verdict.
finally,the district court cited to pettit smith.there,the plaintiff asserted that the statute of limitations for her legal malpractice claim should commence when her wages were first garnished by the irs based on tax returns she signed two years earlier.she claimed that her attorneys failed to advise her that these were joint returns with her husband.although the factual recitation was brief,the court rejected that argument because it found that the plaintiff deposition testimony and brief made clear that she knew or should have known when she signed income the tax returns prepared by her attorneys that they were being filed on behalf of herself and her husband.id.at.the court in pettit also pointed to the plaintiff conversation with an irs agent at or around the same time and payment on the tax bill as evidence that she could have learned of her potential cause of action.finally,pettit does not discuss attorney assurances.the circumstances in the instant case do not support a grant of summary judgment against knopick,as occurred in these three cases.
despite the fact that the injury in fine,as a medical one,is distinguishable,the supreme court approach there relies on the same principle
