in this sealed case appellant appeals the district court order that his former counsel former counsel comply with a grand jury subpoena and the court order denying appellant motion to quash that subpoena for the following reasons,we vacate the court orders,grant appellant motion to quash the grand jury subpoena,and remand.
background 
on april,the police arrested appellant after they conducted a search of the house where he resided with his girlfriend witness and her minor child.the police acted on a complaint that drug trafficking was occurring at witness house.with witness permission to search her house,the police discovered,on an upper closet shelf,a loaded pistol,a loaded pistol clip,a bag of marijuana,money,and other drug paraphernalia.witness told police she had no idea how the pistol got into her house.the police did not arrest witness due to her surprise at the discovery.while the police were still at her house,witness called appellant and asked him to come home.when appellant arrived,he told the police that the pistol and the marijuana were his and the police placed him under arrest.
shortly after appellant arrest,witness provided a sworn,written statement to an atf agent in which she declared that she did not know how the pistol got into her house and that she was shocked to see the pistol and the marijuana.about a month later,witness testified before a federal grand jury for the middle district of louisiana that her statement to the atf agent was true and correct.on may,the grand jury returned a indictment against appellant for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon,possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number,possession with intent to distribute marijuana,and using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime.
on june,the district court appointed former counsel to represent appellant on march,shortly prior to his scheduled trial date,appellant informed the district court by a filed letter that former counsel refused to present his defense in a manner which appellant approved.appellant denied that the firearm belonged to him,asserted that former counsel would not allow him to defend himself,and stated that former counsel refused to allow the owner of the firearm to come forward.that same day,former counsel moved to withdraw.on march,the district court granted former counsel motion to withdraw.the court then appointed the federal public defender to represent appellant.
shortly thereafter,the district court received an affidavit dated march,in which witness swore she lied when she told the police that the pistol did not belong to her.in the affidavit,witness explained that she lied because she feared she would lose custody of her minor child.witness affidavit initiated an investigation to determine whether appellant and witness engaged in a conspiracy to violate the law or violated the law by obstructing justice,committing perjury,or suborning perjury.in,witness was informed of the investigation.
on april,the government issued to former counsel a grand jury subpoena for may,seeking his testimony and a ll written statements of appellant and witness and all notes,records,and recordings of interviews of appellant and witness.former counsel refused to appear before the grand jury unless he was ordered to do so by the court he alleged that the information sought was protected by the and work product privileges 
on april,witness,after being advised of her rights and waiving them,informed the assistant united states attorney ausa that the contents of her march,affidavit were false.witness stated that initially,when she met with former counsel,she told him that the firearm and the contraband found at her house did not belong to her and that she was unaware of their presence.witness admitted after she had several conversations with appellant,it was agreed she would execute an affidavit in which she would change her story and state that the firearm belonged to her.witness explained appellant and she had discussed the potential sentence that each would face.witness admitted that she had discussed with former counsel the ramifications of changing her story to claim ownership of the firearm.witness admitted that she asked former counsel about the penalty for committing perjury and of the potential sentence appellant could receive if he were convicted of the firearm charge.witness admitted that,after she learned of the grand jury investigation which had been initiated by her march,affidavit,she refused to lie about the firearm.
on april,the government filed an ex parte motion,requesting that the district court compel former counsel to comply with the grand jury subpoena.the government explained that the grand jury was investigating whether appellant and witness violated the law and whether they sought the assistance and advice from former counsel to do so.the government alleged that the exception to the and work product privileges justified an order for former counsel to comply with the grand jury subpoena.
the government supported its motion to compel with an affidavit prepared by an ausa.the ausa swore that the facts provided a strong basis for the district court to find witness had committed perjury and appellant had aided and abetted the crime.the ausa also swore that the facts indicated former counsel had refused to participate in appellant attempt to solicit perjured testimony and to perpetuate a fraud upon the court.the government also submitted as exhibits witness initial affidavit before the atf agent,a transcript of witness testimony before the grand jury,appellant letter requesting new counsel,witness second affidavit,witness waiver before the ausa,and the subpoena issued to witness to appear before the grand jury a second time.based on the ausa affidavit,the district court,in language tracking the grand jury subpoena,ordered former counsel to appear with all written statements and recordings from appellant and witness for an in camera examination in chambers.
prior to former counsel in camera examination,the ausa filed a supplemental affidavit.there,the ausa swore witness admitted to the grand jury that her original statements to the atf agent and the grand jury denying ownership of the firearm were true and correct that her march,affidavit was false and that witness and appellant agreed witness would lie by stating the pistol belonged to her,in an effort to help appellant.
the district court examined the ausa affidavits and exhibits and conducted an in camera examination with former counsel.the court found the government met its prima facie case by showing that,during former counsel representation of appellant,appellant and witness were committing or intending to commit a crime or fraud and that appellant and witness communications with former counsel were in furtherance of that crime or fraud.the district court concluded the exception applied and ordered,in language tracking the grand jury subpoena,former counsel to comply with the subpoena.the court additionally ordered that former counsel should not assert the or work product privilege as grounds for refusing to comply with the subpoena.
appellant moved to quash former counsel grand jury subpoena.appellant argued that former counsel testimony,the documents,and the other items sought by the government were protected from disclosure by the,work product,and fifth amendment privileges and were not subject to disclosure under the exception.appellant asserted that his letter regarding former counsel ineffective representation and witness inconsistent statements were not sufficient to establish the exception applied.appellant also argued that former counsel grand jury subpoena was overly broad appellant disagreed that all his communications with former counsel were subject to disclosure and were no longer protected by the and work product privileges.appellant contended that witness and his communications with former counsel,and former counsel notes of these communications,made in connection with appellant defense to the charges in the indictment were legitimate and thus protected.that is,appellant argued the government needed to identify each communication and document subject to disclosure and establish how the exception applied to the particular item.
the government opposed appellant motion to quash,arguing that appellant fifth amendment privilege against was not applicable.with respect to appellant and work product privilege arguments,the government responded that it had shown,through the documents previously submitted to the district court,that the exception applied.the government did not respond to appellant overbreadth argument.
the district court denied appellant motion to quash,finding that the government had made a prima facie showing that during former counsel representation of appellant,appellant and witness were committing or intending to commit a crime or fraud and that appellant and witness communications with former counsel were in furtherance of that crime or fraud and appellant fifth amendment privilege against would not be implicated by former counsel compliance with the grand jury subpoena the court concluded that the government established the applicability of the exception to the and the work product privileges and,in language tracking the grand jury subpoena,ordered former counsel to comply with the subpoena.the court again ordered that former counsel should not assert the or work product privilege as grounds for refusing to comply with the subpoena.
appellant timely appealed the district court orders compelling former counsel to comply with the grand jury subpoena and denying appellant motion to quash.appellant moved the district court to stay the execution of its orders pending appeal the court granted the stay.
discussion 
whether the district court finding that the government made the prima facie showing necessary to establish the exception to the and work product privileges was clearly erroneous.

the government submitted the following items in support of its ex parte motion to compel former counsel compliance with the grand jury subpoena the ausa affidavit,witness initial affidavit before the atf agent,a transcript of witness testimony before the grand jury,appellant letter requesting new counsel,witness second affidavit,witness waiver before the ausa,and the subpoena issued to witness to appear before the grand jury a second time.based on its review of the ausa affidavit,the district court found that an in camera examination of former counsel was appropriate in order for the court to determine whether the exception applied.the district court,in language tracking the grand jury subpoena,ordered former counsel to appear with all written statements and recordings from appellant and witness for an in camera examination in chambers.before the district court in camera examination,the government also submitted a supplemental affidavit by the ausa describing witness second appearance before the grand jury,where she recanted the false affidavit that appellant and she had agreed she would execute.
in united states zolin,d,the supreme court considered and countenanced the procedure by which district courts should determine in their discretion whether to hold an in camera examination in the context of the exception.id.at.before a district court engages in an in camera examination to determine the applicability of the exception,the court should require a showing of a factual basis adequate to support a good faith belief by a reasonable person.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
appellant does not argue that the government initial showing was insufficient to warrant an in camera examination he does not allege that the district court abused its discretion by conducting an in camera examination of former counsel and the statements and records he brought to the examination thus,that issue is waived 
what appellant argues is that the government ultimately did not meet its prima facie showing that any of witness or his communications with former counsel were made for the specific purpose of furthering a crime or fraud.appellant asserts that his letter,regarding former counsel ineffective assistance,and witness inconsistent statements in her affidavits and grand jury testimony are not sufficient to show their communications with former counsel were intended to further an ongoing or future crime of perjury or obstruction of justice.in response,the government argues the district court finding was not clearly erroneous.the government contends the district court finding that it made the requisite prima facie showing was proper based on the ausa affidavits and exhibits and the district court in camera examination of former counsel.
in order to invoke the exception,the party seeking to breach the walls of privilege must make out a prima facie case.int l,at.to make the necessary prima facie showing for the application of the exception here,the government must produce evidence such as will suffice until contradicted and overcome by other evidence a case which has proceeded upon sufficient proof to that stage where it will support a finding if evidence to the contrary is disregarded.id.applying prima facie definition to work product privilege and quoting in re grand jury proceedings in the matter of fine,cir applying prima facie definition to privilege.allegations in pleadings are not evidence and are not sufficient to make a prima facie showing that the exception applies.int l,at 
based on the government submitted affidavits and exhibits and the in camera examination of former counsel,the district court found that the government had made a prima facie showing that during former counsel representation of appellant,appellant and witness were committing or attempting to commit a crime or fraud and that their communications with former counsel were in furtherance of that crime or fraud.thus,the court found that the exception to the and work product privileges was established and ordered former counsel to comply with the subpoena.
a finding is not clearly erroneous if it is plausible in light of the record as a whole.edwards,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the government submitted evidence showed that appellant and witness agreed witness would make sworn statements in an affidavit contradictory to her prior sworn statements and grand jury testimony.the evidence also showed that appellant and witness obtained information from former counsel concerning the plausibility of their plan and the potential penalties each faced.thus,the district court found the government made a prima facie showing that during the course of former counsel representation of appellant,appellant and witness used former counsel to obtain legal advice which would assist them in obstructing the criminal proceedings and perpetuating a fraud.in light of the record as a whole,this court finds the district court finding that the exception applied during the course of former counsel representation of appellant was not clearly erroneous.
whether the district court overbroadly interpreted the scope of the exception.
to put this issue in context,the district court orders compelling former counsel to comply with the grand jury subpoena and denying appellant motion to quash that subpoena employed the following language,which substantially mirrored that of the subpoena at issue 
it is ordered that former counsel shall comply with the grand jury subpoena which commands him to appear and testify before the grand jury for the middle district of louisiana on may,and bring with him all written statements of appellant and witness and all notes,records,and recordings of interviews of appellant and witness,and that he shall not assert the or the work product privileges as a basis for not complying with said subpoena.
footnote added.
appellant argues,even if the exception applies,the and work product privileges were not abrogated with respect to all of witness and his statements to and communications with former counsel during the slightly longer than nine months that former counsel represented appellant.according to appellant,not all statements and communications are properly subject to the grand jury subpoena issued to former counsel because many statements and communications not subject to the exception remain protected by the privileges.appellant cites burlington northern for the proposition that the district court can not,in appellant words,paint with too broad a brush stroke to reach all statements and communications between appellant and former counsel and between witness and former counsel,but instead must narrow its focus in applying the exception to the specific purpose of the particular communication or document.at.appellant contends that the government did not establish a prima facie case each specific communication that appellant purpose in seeking the legal advice and making the communication was to further continuing or future criminal or fraudulent activity.appellant asserts the government can not establish that every communication between former counsel and him and between former counsel and witness was made to further an ongoing or future crime or fraud.thus,appellant argues that the district court orders compelling former counsel to appear before the grand jury with all written statements,notes,records,and recordings pertaining to communications with appellant and witness are overly broad and should be vacated.
in response,the government argues that the district court orders compelling former counsel compliance with the grand jury subpoena are not overly broad because,once the prima facie showing is made that the exception applies,the and work product privileges no longer exist.that is,the privileges disappear as to all communications relative to the subject of the consultation.the government asserts that the exception permits disclosure of any communications between the attorney and client if the client seeks advice from the attorney in carrying out a crime or fraud.see grand jury proceedings,at.
the privilege is recognized as the oldest of the privileges for confidential communications known to the common law.zolin,at.quoting upjohn united states,d see also edwards,at describing the privilege as most venerated.the central concern of this longstanding privilege is to encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice.zolin,at.quoting upjohn,at.clients must be free to make full disclosure to their attorneys of past wrongdoings in order that the client may obtain the aid of persons having knowledge of the law and skilled in its practice.zolin,at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.however,the reasons for protecting the confidences of wrongdoers ceas e to operate at a certain point,namely,where the desired advice refers not to prior wrongdoing,but to future wrongdoing.id.at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.zolin makes clear it is the purpose of the exception to the privilege to assure that the seal of secrecy,between lawyer and client does not extend to communications made for the purpose of getting advice for the commission of a fraud or crime.id.at.citations omitted and emphasis added.
the strong policy concerns behind the work product privilege have been similarly recognized 
the privilege exists to encourage full disclosure of pertinent information by clients to their attorneys.its protection extends to past criminal violations.the rationale for this is that the client,given the nature of our adversary system,has a legitimate interest in securing informed representation without fear of forced disclosure.
int l,at internal citation omitted.the privilege serves to protect the interests of clients and their attorneys in preventing disclosures about the case,by shielding the lawyer mental processes from his adversary,in re grand jury subpoena,cir.but a client has no legitimate interest in seeking legal advice in planning future criminal activities.int l,at.therefore,the exception comes into play if the client consults an attorney for advice that will assist the client in carrying out a contemplated illegal or fraudulent scheme.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.it is only the rightful interests of the client that the work product doctrine was designed to protect.id.citation omitted.
this is the backdrop of perpetual tension,see united states dyer,cir,against which we must answer the instant the district court has overbroadly interpreted the scope of the exception in applying it to the grand jury subpoena in this case.in grand jury proceedings,this court reversed and remanded where the challenged grand jury subpoenas broadly ordered attorneys to testify and produce all notes,memoranda,or any document pertaining to any interviews of any person pertaining to this case,at,and a ny records,notes,memoranda,or any document referencing any conversation between any employee of the attorneys law firm and any of certain specified individuals,id.first alteration added.however,there the reach of the exception was not at issue.in that case the district court had not sufficiently addressed whether the exception applied at all,and we remanded for consideration of whether the government has made a sufficient showing to overcome the work product privilege.id.at 
never before has this court specifically addressed the propriety of the scope of the exception to the and work product privileges on a record where the grand jury subpoena compels disclosure of all communications between the attorney and his client and between the attorney and a third party,written,oral,or otherwise,rather than discrete communications related to a particular issue or limited to particular media.that is,the supreme court and fifth circuit cases cited by the parties all involve the question of the applicability scope of the exception to specified documents or conversations already limited to a certain time or context,rather than a challenge to a discovery request or a subpoena seeking disclosure in toto.
certain of these cases address only the application of the exception to the privilege.see,zolin,at.considering whether two documentary tapes and partial transcripts of the tapes could be reviewed by district court in camera united states ballard,cir allowing attorney testimony in criminal case where his testimony related to fraudulent scheme to conceal defendant property,either from the tax collector or from defendant other creditors or both or continuation of that illicit plan dyer,at considering grand jury subpoenas requiring two attorneys testimony as to the circumstances surrounding the preparation and delivery of the november letter from defendant to an fbi informant and reversing district court refusal to grant defendant motion to quash as to one attorney because the government did not meet its prima facie showing matter of fine,at,vacating district court order to compel attorney to reveal unnamed client identity before grand jury because the government failed to meet its prima facie showing.one case involves only work product.see int l,at,vacating discovery order that certain documents be produced from binders containing the information developed in the accounting firm special review because plaintiffs did not make prima facie showing.one case addresses the exception in the context of both privileges.see burlington,at finding district court erred in ordering discovery of documents relating to two groups of litigation because the court did not consider whether the specific litigation activities were illegitimate.
the government relies on case language to argue that once it is established a client abused the privilege relationship by seeking advice to commit a crime,the privilege entirely disappears and all the confidences within the relationship are no longer shielded.for example,the government cites language in ballard 
a half century ago,justice cardozo wrote the privilege takes flight if the relation is abused.a client who consults an attorney for advice that will serve him in the commission of a fraud will have no help from the law.once the party seeking disclosure makes a prima facie case that the relationship was used to promote an intended criminal activity,the confidences within the relationship are no longer shielded.these precepts have since been applied consistently and have come to be known as the crime or fraud exception to the privilege.
at citing clark united states.footnotes omitted and emphasis added.the government also cites matter of fine if there is a prima facie showing that the professional relationship was intended to further a criminal enterprise,the privilege does not exist.at emphasis added.the government insists that once the privilege has disappeared,disclosure is permitted of any and all communications relative to the subject matter of the consultation.see grand jury proceedings,at t he exception permits disclosure of any communications between the attorney and the client if the client seeks advice from the attorney in carrying out a crime or fraud.emphasis added 
the government discounts appellant reliance on burlington northern for his overbreadth argument,asserting it has no application to this case because there two separate groups of lawsuits were at issue,at,while here only one criminal prosecution is at issue.in burlington northern,the plaintiffs filed an antitrust lawsuit claiming that defendant railroads conspired to prevent construction of a coal pipeline by filing and defending certain allegedly sham lawsuits.id.plaintiffs sought the discovery of documents relating to those two groups of lawsuits,and the defendant railroads resisted discovery on the grounds of the and work product privileges.id.at.the district court found that the plaintiffs established a prima facie case that the defendant railroads administrative and judicial challenges in one group of lawsuits and their defense of the other group of lawsuits were in furtherance of a larger conspiracy and ordered the discovery of documents relating to both sets of litigation.id.at.on mandamus review,this court found 
the district court erred in ordering discovery without considering whether the specific litigation activities were illegitimate.the privilege and work product immunity protect communications and papers generated when a client engages his attorney for legitimate purposes.to the extent the railroads sought out their attorneys to bring lawful suits and consulted with them in connection with such suits,they were within the scope of this protection.that the railroads might also have consulted and received the help of their attorneys in connection with other activities that are not lawful does not change this conclusion.the focus must be narrowed to the specific purpose of the particular communication or document.to the extent the document deals with a protected activity,it is immune from discovery.
id.at.the government argues this court findings in burlington northern are not relevant to appellant case because former counsel represented appellant on only one occasion and the government has made a prima facie showing that during the representation for that single prosecution,appellant was committing or intending to commit a crime or fraud.
in reply,appellant stresses that he did not secure former counsel services solely for the purpose of committing a crime or fraud.rather,the proper purpose of securing former counsel services was to defend appellant against a government indictment charging him with past wrongdoing,which defense lasted approximately nine months before former counsel withdrew from the case.appellant contends the government can not excerpt generalized case language and convincingly argue that once it is determined a client at some point communicated with his attorney for the purpose of furthering a crime or fraud,regardless of the extent or the original purpose of the relationship,the exception permits disclosure of any otherwise privileged communications.
appellant cites dyer,at,where the government subpoenaed the defendant civil attorney and his criminal attorney to the grand jury to question them about conversations they had with the defendant in connection with a letter written by the civil attorney as part of the defendant alleged attempt to obstruct justice.appellant notes that this court determined the defendant communication with his civil attorney concerning the november letter is not privileged,but the communication with his criminal attorney is.id.this court held that when the government can by competent evidence establish a prima facie case that an attorney was being used in the commission of a crime there is no privilege.id.at.but this court limited such seemingly broad holding by making clear that the defendant in dyer retains his privilege to block the testimony of his civil attorney before the grand jury except as to the events immediately surrounding the preparation of the letter at issue.id.at.thus,even though the government established a prima facie showing of the exception with respect to the civil attorney representation of the defendant,the defendant relationship with his civil attorney outside of the events connected with that one letter remained protected by the privilege.
appellant emphasizes that this circuit thus restricts the scope or reach of the exception,as evidenced in dyer,to only those communications made for the purpose of furthering an ongoing or future crime or fraud.the reach of the exception,therefore,does not extend to all communications made in the course of the relationship.appellant argues this approach is not only consistent with zolin,where the supreme court delineated the exception with respect to communications made for the purpose of getting advice for the commission of a fraud or crime,at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted,but also with the approach taken by the tenth and second circuits.
for example,the tenth circuit stated,with respect to documentary evidence,that after finding the applicability of the exception to the privilege,a district court still may be required to conduct an in camera examination of all documents subpoenaed by a grand jury if there is a possibility that some of them may fall outside the scope of the exception to the privilege.in re grand jury proceedings vargas,cir applying this analysis to both the and work product privileges.likewise,in the context of grand jury testimony,the tenth circuit stated that district courts should define the scope of the exception narrowly enough so that information outside of the exception will not be elicited before the grand jury.in re grand jury subpoenas,cir addressing the privilege.under the tenth circuit approach,it may be appropriate for the district court to examine in camera the questions to be asked of the witness before the grand jury to ensure the scope of the grand jury inquiry will not be too broad.id.citing in re richard roe,cir.
appellant also notes that the second circuit in richard roe ordered the district court on remand to examine each document and communication to determine whether the client communication or attorney work product in question was itself made with the intent to further a crime or fraud.at finding the district court incorrectly applied a relevant evidence test as opposed to the correct in furtherance test when it determined the exception applied to both privileges.in conclusion,appellant maintains that the district court orders here are overly broad because they allow the government access to all communications made to former counsel by appellant and all work product of former counsel,whether or not those communications and documents were intended to further the alleged crime or fraud at issue.
we agree with appellant that the district court orders compelling former counsel to comply with the grand jury subpoena in this case are overly broad we conclude that the proper reach of the exception when applicable does not extend to all communications made in the course of the relationship,but rather is limited to those communications and documents in furtherance of the contemplated or ongoing criminal or fraudulent conduct based upon our examination of the sealed record,including the in camera examination of former counsel,this case does not present a situation where appellant entire criminal representation by former counsel was based upon or sought for the sole purpose of perpetuating a crime or fraud the district court orders compelling former counsel compliance with the grand jury subpoena here did not in any way limit the required disclosures.the orders compel former counsel to bring all written statements of appellant and witness and all notes,records,and recordings of interviews of appellant and witness.moreover,because the court orders compel former counsel to appear and order that he can not assert any or work product privilege,no boundary exists as to the extent of his compelled testimony.the court application of the exception was overly broad because it lacked the requisite specificity to reach only communications and documents no longer protected by the and work product privileges.therefore,we find the district court orders compelling former counsel to comply with the grand jury subpoena and denying appellant motion to quash the subpoena issued in error.
we so conclude for the following reasons.first,we note that unlike the government suggests,no case stands for the proposition that,when a prima facie showing is made that a client has consulted with his attorney for the purpose of furthering a crime or fraud,the privilege entirely disappears,subjecting everything in connection with that client representation with that attorney to disclosure.while there is certain broad language employed in the cases cited by the government,again,none of those cases dealt with the instant question of the propriety of an order requiring compliance with a subpoena lacking any discernible limit on disclosure.in addition,in both grand jury proceedings,at,and matter of fine,at,despite any such broad language regarding loss of protection of the privileges,the disposition of the disclosure orders at issue was vacation and remand because the government had not sufficiently shown the exception to even apply.
further,the caselaw cited for breadth of the exception scope simultaneously stands for a sense of limitation or condition.for example,the supreme court in zolin chose to describe the seal of secrecy,that is,the privilege,as not extend ing to communications made for the purpose of getting advice for the commission of a fraud or crime.at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted and emphasis added.lack of extension to certain types of communications reasonably implies an abbreviation or an abridgement of the privilege,but not an obliteration altogether as to all communications remaining under the seal.in grand jury proceedings,this court described the permitted disclosure of communications between attorney and client by using the conditional phrase if the client seeks advice from the attorney in carrying out a crime or fraud.at.
in assessing the proper scope of the exception application to the and work product privileges,we find instructive the treatment of such by our sister circuits,which bolsters our conclusion here that the reach of the exception does not extend to all communications made in the course of the relationship,but rather must be limited to those communications made and documents produced in furtherance of the ongoing or future crime or fraud,no longer protected by the privileges.as noted by appellant,the tenth circuit in vargas,at,and later in grand jury subpoenas,at,indicated that the reach of subpoenas should be narrowly defined,so as not to extend to documents or testimony falling outside the scope of the exception to the privilege,which documents and conversations remain protected.
the second circuit also explained that the scope of the exception only extends to which,if any,of the documents or communications were in furtherance of a crime or fraud.richard roe,at see also in re grand jury subpoena duces tecum dated,cir considering the question of whether any of th e requested documents are within the scope of the exclusion for materials prepared in furtherance of a continuing or future crime or fraud and reversing in part denial of motion to quash as to the documents that retain and work product protection.in grand jury subpoena duces tecum,the second circuit separated,within the attorney single unit of representation,advice sought by the client in furtherance of a future or ongoing fraud as unprivileged and communications with respect to advice as to past or completed frauds as within the privileges.at.there,the court employed a temporal limitation to determine which documents retained protection those that followed the date of the government discovery of the fraudulent sale at issue.id.at.as to grand jury testimony,the second circuit explained that limits are required as to the scope of the examination permitted.richard roe,at.
the eighth circuit in in re bankamerica.securities litigation,cir,on mandamus review vacated the district court disclosure order where the court assumed,without any further showing by plaintiffs,that all contemporaneous communications could be construed as in furtherance of the alleged fraud.this was error.id.at.on remand,the eighth circuit directed the district court to determine whether documents authored after the bank merger or press release at issue necessarily fall outside the exception because they could only relate to prior wrongdoing and thus remain protected and not subject to discovery.id.the eighth circuit also considered the breadth of a discovery order.pfizer,lord,cir.there,the court addressed whether the masters discovery report conclusions constituted an overbroad,sweeping denial of defendants privilege,or whether they are reasonably bottomed on a review calculated to shield from discovery all communications by means of which petitioners legitimately sought or received legal advice.id.at.though it declined to issue the writ of mandamus,the eighth circuit directed the district court to continue to guard the privilege by reviewing,if necessary,all contested documents prior to ruling on the discoverability of such documents and by ordering the production to respondents only of those documents individually found to have been prepared in perpetration or furtherance of fraudulent activity.id.
finally,we note the circuit explanation once a sufficient showing of crime or fraud has been made,the privilege vanishes as to all material related to the ongoing violation.in re sealed case,emphasis added.the circuit considered whether six items covered by a grand jury subpoena fell within the reach of the exception and found that only one item did.id.at.in international systems,at,we acknowledged the dc circuit requirement in sealed case,in the context of the exception application to the work product privilege,that the court must find some valid relationship between the work product under subpoena and the prima facie violation.
despite the government attempt to distinguish burlington northern,this court general characterization of the scope of the exception replicates that found in the treatment of other the focus of the exception to only those communications falling outside the and work product privileges that do not deal with a protected activity such that they are immune from discovery.see at.
for the guidance of district courts,we now use the language we first employed in international systems and restated in burlington northern to lead us in outlining the proper scope of the exception application to both the work product and the privileges.in international systems,we indicated that meeting the prima facie test to pierce the work p
