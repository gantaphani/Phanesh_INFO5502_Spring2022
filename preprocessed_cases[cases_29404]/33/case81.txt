a.the disappearance of gail katz bierenbaum

on the evening of sunday,july,bierenbaum attended a family gathering for a nephew birthday in new jersey,without katz.bierenbaum said that she had gone out earlier in the day and had not returned to their apartment.although bierenbaum did not express any concern about his wife at the party,later that evening at a friend house he appeared distraught and called the apartment a couple of times.to his friend he related that he and katz had an argument that morning and that she had left the apartment to sunbathe in central park wearing shorts,sandals and a halter top.
close to midnight that evening bierenbaum telephoned yvette feis,one of katz friends,asking if she knew where katz was.bierenbaum told feis that they had had an argument,that she had gone to central park and not returned,and that she was still missing when he returned from a family party in new jersey.

no one,other than bierenbaum,reported seeing katz after july.
investigation 
detective virgilio dalsass from the precinct,where bierenbaum and katz resided,and detective thomas from the missing persons bureau were assigned to investigate the case.in the week after katz was reported missing,dalsass left several telephone messages for bierenbaum,none of which were returned.dalsass had numerous telephone calls from members of katz family during that same time period.on july,dalsass met with bierenbaum,his father and katz parents.dalsass asked bierenbaum to narrate specifically and exactly how he spent the weekend that katz disappeared.bierenbaum stated that he had come home from work at approximately on friday evening,that they went to a movie about and returned about midnight.he described going to work saturday morning,leaving the hospital and visiting his father,returning home around noon to go out to eat and do some shopping with his wife,including buying bras at a lingerie store and cat food at a pet supply store.katz cooked steaks that night and they had a romantic candlelight dinner.

the police searched for katz between her apartment and central park and found no trace of her.friends and family posted pictures of katz in the neighborhood.dalsass contacted several individuals whose names he had obtained from bierenbaum or katz family who might have information about katz.these included ellen schwartz,francesca beale,katz therapist sybil baran,anthony segalas and kenneth feiner.

in july,early in the investigation,dalsass asked bierenbaum if he could look around the apartment.bierenbaum said he would get back to him,but did not.in september dalsass finally secured permission to search bierenbaum apartment.bierenbaum attorney gave permission for the police to search for fingerprints and anything that might help them identify katz.although the police wished to search for any evidence that would shed light on katz disappearance,the investigators felt they did not have probable cause to obtain a search warrant.the search was thus limited to the scope of the permission given.this limited search was conducted on september nevertheless at that time dalsass looked around the apartment to see if he could detect any evidence that a crime had been committed there.he did not find anything.
in september hope martin,an investigator from the district attorney office,was assigned to investigate katz disappearance.martin learned that bierenbaum was a licensed pilot.she wanted to know whether bierenbaum had flown an airplane on the day of his wife disappearance.on october,she learned that bierenbaum had rented an airplane from mac dan aircraft rental at caldwell airport in fairfield,new jersey on july,the day katz disappeared.a forensic examination of the aircraft yielded no results.forensic tests of two automobiles that bierenbaum was driving at the time also yielded no results.

c.the evidence at trial 
in addition to the evidence detailed above,the prosecution marshaled a wealth of circumstantial evidence that,in the words of the appellate division,when attentively review ed and critically assesse d,and after applying all natural and reasonable inferences,led to the inescapable conclusion that bierenbaum murdered his wife on july,and the evidence excludes beyond a reasonable doubt any reasonable hypothesis of innocence.people bierenbaum.the evidence at trial was set forth in detail in the district court february,opinion,and we recount below only the evidence necessary to resolve the issues presented on appeal.

bierenbaum inconsistent statements 
over the years between katz disappearance and his trial for her murder,bierenbaum offered various accounts of his activities and various theories concerning her whereabouts.consistently absent from any of his accounts of his activities on sunday,july,was the fact that he rented an airplane in new jersey that afternoon and went flying.bierenbaum gave detailed statements of his activities to both investigating officers in the days following katz disappearance.he lied to both officers,telling both of them that he had remained in the apartment until approximately when he left for the party in new jersey.at he was already in new jersey,flying his rented airplane.
about three weeks after katz disappeared,bierenbaum began an affair with karen caruana,a nurse educator at maimonides medical center where bierenbaum was a surgical resident.the affair began while bierenbaum was vacationing in south hampton on long island during the month of august,and lasted about six weeks.during that period caruana and bierenbaum discussed katz disappearance.caruana testified that bierenbaum told her that his apartment and car had been searched and that he was clean as far as any police investigation was concerned.she stated that he told her this before the end of september.at that time the police had not searched his apartment or car.

bierenbaum told katz friend ellen schwartz that he had spoken with katz therapist baran,who had told him that katz was very depressed and she was concerned that katz might hurt herself.baran denied that she had such a conversation with bierenbaum and denied that katz was suicidal.two or three months later bierenbaum told another of katz friends,maryann decesare,that he thought she was waitressing by a seaside community.decesare said that bierenbaum often mentioned water,that katz was outside cooling off.
roberta karnofsky,an anesthesiologist,had a relationship with bierenbaum beginning in fall,while she was a medical student under his supervision.he told karnofsky that he had gotten into an argument with his wife one day,that she went to cool off in central park,that she had been seen one time around the area of central park,but had never been seen again.to karnofsky bierenbaum speculated that katz was in a fugue state or that she had run off with someone to the caribbean.bierenbaum told karnofsky that the police had asked him if he had removed the apartment rug or had it cleaned,and that he had answered that he had not.katz friend yvette feis was in the apartment several days after katz was reported missing,noticed that the living room rug was gone and asked about it.bierenbaum told feis that the cats had fouled the rug and that he was having it cleaned.
stephanie youngblood,a chiropractor who lived with bierenbaum from to,testified that bierenbaum told her that katz had a drug problem,was having extramarital affairs,and that he felt her death was h e felt she went to central park to hang out with her druggie friends.
bierenbaum defense 
the defense called one witness,joel davis.davis had been in a bagel shop in manhattan on second avenue in the on the afternoon of july,and he noticed an attractive woman wearing a distinctive with a word on it.when two weeks later he saw posters of katz,he identified her as the woman he had seen,and he called the police.he described her to the jury as deeply tanned,about five foot one,with a body.on davis admitted that he had told an investigator for the defense that the woman he seen was tall and statuesque,and explained that he had confused his description of the missing woman by likening her to two different women,one tall with her face and one short with her body.
the prosecution called katz sister alayne as a rebuttal witness.she provided a picture of katz from the summer of,and described her as less than five foot three,weighing approximately pounds,with an bra size.
proceedings 
on appeal to the appellate division,first department,bierenbaum argued that his guilt was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt.he also argued,among other issues,that the trial court erroneously allowed the jury to learn of the existence and nature of the letter written to katz by bierenbaum psychiatrist warning her of the danger bierenbaum posed to her allowed various people to testify about katz verbal statements to them describing bierenbaum threatening remarks and behavior and permitted the jury to watch the videotaped demonstration showing how a pilot flying solo may load a duffel bag containing a body into a cessna airplane,fly over the ocean and eject the bag.
the appellate division rejected these claims and affirmed the conviction on october.see bierenbaum,at.leave to appeal to the new york court of appeals was denied on march.see people bierenbaum.bierenbaum petition for a writ of certiorari to the united states supreme court was denied on october.see bierenbaum new york.
after bierenbaum direct appeal was concluded,he filed a motion with the trial court to set aside the judgment on the grounds that trial and appellate counsel had rendered ineffective assistance of counsel.the motion was denied on september,and leave to appeal was denied on january.bierenbaum then filed a petition for writ of error coram nobis in the appellate division contending that appellate counsel had provided ineffective assistance.the petition was denied on march.leave to appeal that decision to the new york court of appeals was denied on may.see people bierenbaum.
on march,bierenbaum filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.in his petition he alleged that he was denied his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel,and that admission of numerous hearsay statements violated his sixth amendment right to confront witnesses against him.he requested an evidentiary hearing.on february,the district court denied the petition without conducting an evidentiary hearing.see bierenbaum graham,civ,wl.this court granted a certificate of appealability on september.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court decision to deny a petition for a writ of habeas corpus,henry ricks,cir.we may not consider a state prisoner application for a writ of habeas corpus unless the applicant has exhausted available state remedies by fairly present ing his claim in each appropriate state court including a state supreme court with powers of discretionary review.baldwin reese,internal quotation marks omitted accord georgison donelli,cir see b a.a petitioner has fairly presented his claim only if he has informed the state court of both the factual and the legal premises of the claim he asserts in federal court.jones keane,cir internal quotation marks omitted quoting dorsey kelly,cir.
if a state court decision rests on a state law ground that is independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment,coleman thompson,we will not review the issue.see richardson greene,cir.the rule applies with equal force whether the ground is substantive or procedural.lee kemna.a state law ground is only adequate to support the judgment and foreclose review of a federal claim if it is firmly established and regularly followed in the state,and application of the rule would not be exorbitant.garvey duncan,cir quoting lee,at.
when a state court has adjudicated the merits of a petitioner claim,a federal court may grant an application for a writ of habeas corpus only if the adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d see also,brown alexander,cir.under d,a decision is contrary to clearly established supreme court precedent if its conclusion on a question of law is opposite to that of the supreme court or if the state court decides a case differently than the supreme court decision on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.id.quoting williams taylor.a state court decision involves an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent if it correctly identifies the governing legal principle but unreasonably applies or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to the facts of a particular case.see williams,at ramdass angelone,accord kennaugh miller,cir.
a state court determination of a factual issue is presumed to be correct,and may only be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.e see drake portuondo,f d,cir.
exhaustion 
the district court determined that bierenbaum failed to exhaust his state court remedies with regard to his confrontation clause claim,finding that he did not argue the claim in his application for leave to appeal to the new york court of appeals.the respondents argued this position below,but on further review have withdrawn their argument,agreeing with bierenbaum that he presented his constitutional claim in his letter brief submitted to the new york court of appeals on december.
on appeal to the appellate division,first department,bierenbaum presented,among other questions,the following whether bierenbaum was denied a fair trial by the improper admission of widespread testimony recounting statements purportedly made by bierenbaum,which did not satisfy any hearsay exception or the confrontation clause of the state and federal constitutions similarly,in his letter seeking leave to appeal to the new york court of appeals,he argued that leave should be granted to review the admissibility of background evidence through hearsay declarations,whether in domestic violence cases or otherwise,and to consider whether admission of such evidence denies a defendant his state and federal rights of confrontation.
the appellate division did not explicitly address bierenbaum confrontation clause claim and the court of appeals denied leave to appeal without explanation.t he question of whether a federal constitutional question was sufficiently asserted in state courts to form the basis of a federal habeas petition is a question of federal law which the federal courts must resolve for themselves.acosta artuz,cir quoting disimone phillips,cir.a state prisoner may fairly present to the state courts the constitutional nature of his claim by claim ing the deprivation of a particular right specifically protected by the constitution.daye att y of the state of,cir en banc.here,bierenbaum expressly invoked the confrontation clause to both appellate courts.t o qualify as an adjudication on the merits,a state court decision need not mention a particular argument or explain the reasons for rejecting it.dallio spitzer,cir see also brown artuz,cir finding that sixth amendment claim was adjudicated on the merits when state court dismissed it by stating defendant remaining contentions are without merit.we therefore conclude that the state courts were fairly alerted to the constitutional claim,bierenbaum has exhausted his available state remedies with respect to the claim,and we may reach the merits of the claim.see galdamez keane,cir reaching the merits of petitioner confrontation clause claim where briefs and leave application,fairly construed,raised the issue.
confrontation clause 
the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment to the united states constitution states in all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.const.amend.vi.throughout bierenbaum trial and the direct appeal of his conviction,the admission of statements by a declarant not present at trial was governed by ohio roberts,abrogated by crawford washington.under roberts,the statements of an unavailable hearsay declarant were admissible only if they bore adequate indicia of reliability,which could be satisfied by demonstrating that the evidence fell within a firmly rooted hearsay exception,or that the evidence had particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.at.
the united states supreme court decisions in crawford and davis washington,confined the scope of the confrontation clause to testimonial statements.see davis,at holding that limiting the confrontation clause to testimonial hearsay is clearly reflected in the text of the constitutional provision united states feliz,cir a fter crawford and davis,the inquiry under the confrontation clause is whether the statement at issue is testimonial.accord united states williams,cir.nontestimonial statements therefore do not implicate the confrontation clause.see feliz,at.
bierenbaum argues that the challenged statements were inadmissible under either the roberts or the crawford and davis standard that the statements were admitted for their truth,that no hearsay exception applied,that the statements showed no particularized guarantees of trustworthiness,and that the statements were testimonial.
in whorton bockting,the supreme court held that crawford announced a new rule that would not apply retroactively on collateral review.moreover,a federal court must apply the clearly established supreme court jurisprudence as of either the date of the pertinent state court adjudicat ion on the merits,or the date when the state court conviction became final.mungo duncan,cir.as of when his claim was adjudicated on the merits,and when his conviction became final,ohio roberts governed his claim.thus,bierenbaum challenge to the admission of katz statements must be evaluated under roberts.
assuming that katz statements were admitted for the truth of the matters asserted they meet the roberts standard for admissibility.the appellate division analyzed the reliability of the challenged statements under the rule for determining reliable hearsay set forth by the new york court of appeals in nucci proper,
reliability is the sum of the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement that render the declarant worthy of belief.relevant factors include spontaneity,repetition,the mental state of the declarant,absence of motive to fabricate,unlikelihood of faulty recollection and the degree to which the statement was against the declarant interest.courts have also considered the status or relationship to the declarant of the person to whom the statement was made,whether there was a coercive atmosphere,whether it was made in response to questioning and whether the statements reflect an attempt to shift blame or curry favor.
at citations,internal quotation marks and ellipses omitted.the appellate division ruled that the statements bore numerous hallmarks of reliability 
she was speaking spontaneously she repeated the statements separately to various people in her life her statements about the troubled side of their marriage were a natural consequence of corroborated facts about their marriage she was,by all indications,in good mental health there appears no reason for her to have fabricated the matters she discussed at the time of her utterances and her statements largely concerned private matters that some would be embarrassed or otherwise reluctant to disclose.furthermore,the statements were made mostly to those close to her,in contexts completely devoid of coercion,not in response to anyone questioning,nor under circumstances at all suggestive of any attempt to curry anyone favor.
bierenbaum,at.it was not unreasonable for the appellate division to conclude that the reliability of katz statements was amply supported.id.at.indeed,bierenbaum does not argue to this court except parenthetically that the challenged hearsay declarations were in fact unreliable.the passage quoted above demonstrates that the appellate division found particularized guarantees of trustworthiness in the challenged statements.this conclusion was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of the supreme court confrontation clause precedent in and.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
to show ineffective assistance of counsel under strickland washington,bierenbaum must demonstrate that his counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and affirmatively prove prejudice arising from counsel allegedly deficient representation.brown greene,cir quoting carrion smith,cir.to satisfy the first part of the must show that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment.strickland,at.the strickland standard is rigorous,bell miller,cir 
judicial scrutiny of counsel performance must be highly deferential every effort must be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight,to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel challenged conduct,and to evaluate the conduct from counsel perspective at the time a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance that is,the defendant must overcome the presumption that,under the circumstances,the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.
strickland,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
to satisfy the second part of the strickland must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different,at.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.
bierenbaum lists nine errors that he contends are objectively unreasonable failing to move to dismiss the indictment due to delay conceding that katz died on july,opening the door to testimony and argument that bierenbaum and his lawyer refused to consent to a forensic search of his apartment failing to call two witnesses who allegedly would have supported his claim that katz left the apartment on the morning of july failing to effectively a witness who minimized his use of cocaine with katz failing to object to the admission of the videotaped demonstration of the prosecution theory of how bierenbaum disposed of his wife body failing to move for a trial order of dismissal on the grounds of insufficient evidence of the element of intent to kill failing to make a timely objection to improper remarks in summation failing to request a jury charge on jurisdiction.
defense counsel did not move to dismiss the indictment for undue delay.oppressive prosecutorial delay may violate the due process clause of the united states constitution.see united states lovasco.to prevail on such a claim under federal law,bierenbaum must prove that the delay resulted in actual prejudice and that the prosecution reasons for the delay were improper.united states langella,cir citing lovasco,at accord united states cornielle,cir.
under new york law,the prosecution must establish good cause for extended delay,but a determination made in good faith to delay prosecution for sufficient reasons will not deprive defendant of due process even though there may be some prejudice to defendant.people decker,see const.art.i.i n a proper case,a lengthy and unjustifiable delay in commencing the prosecution may require dismissal even though no actual prejudice to the defendant is shown.people singer.in determining whether prosecution has been unduly delayed,a new york court will balance five factors 
the extent of the delay the reason for the delay the nature of the underlying charge whether or not there has been an extended period of pretrial incarceration and whether or not there is any indication that the defense has been impaired by reason of the delay.
decker,at quoting people taranovich.
bierenbaum argued undue delay to the state court in his motion to set aside the judgment.the state court weighed the five taranovich factors and concluded that if defense counsel had moved to dismiss the indictment,the motion would unquestionably have been denied.although the delay was substantial,bierenbaum suffered no prejudice,and he was not incarcerated prior to trial.given the seriousness of the charge,the circumstantial nature of the evidence,and no evidence of any improper motive on the part of the prosecution,the motion had no chance of success.
the state court concluded therefore that defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to move to dismiss for delay.had defense counsel moved to dismiss the indictment,the motion would not have been granted,and therefore there was no reasonable probability that the to have been different.the state court conclusion was a reasonable application of strickland.
defense counsel concession 
trial counsel conceded in his opening statement that katz died on july,l et talk about some things that are not at issue here.first of all,it is not disputed by us that gail katz bierenbaum is dead.that is not disputed.not only that not disputed by us,but that she likely died some time on july.trial tr.vol.i.in discussing the evidence he also stated 
now we will tell you that the evidence will also show that she is dead.she should have made her appointments,she should have been where she said she would be and she could have come home but she did and that why we can tell you that she is dead.
bierenbaum argues that even if it were within the range of reasonable strategic choices to concede that katz was dead,it was not reasonable to concede that she died on the sunday she disappeared.we disagree.with the benefit of hindsight,conceding that katz died on july may seem extraordinary,but at the time counsel would have had reason to believe that the jury was likely to hear from several reliable sources that she had appointments for the next day,and that she would have kept those appointments if she could have.counsel theory was that katz left the apartment on sunday,and met with foul play after she left.it was consistent with that theory to concede her death on july.it was not objectively unreasonable to do so.moreover,it was a reasonable trial strategy to establish a forthright relationship with the jury,by conceding what the defense did not have evidence to contest.
opening the door 
in his opening statement counsel told the jury you will also learn that the police conducted a forensic examination of the doctor apartment,the doctor car,his friend car that he borrowed some time that weekend,the airplane and found no evidence of blood or any other biological determinations because this case also turns on the lack of evidence.id.at.in fact,the police were not permitted to conduct a forensic search of the apartment.
the prosecution successfully argued that counsel had opened the door to allow testimony from detective dalsass that bierenbaum attorney had prevented the police from conducting a warrantless forensic search of the apartment.dalsass testified that bierenbaum attorney gave permission for the police to conduct a limited search for items that might help to identify katz.prior to that date he had not been permitted to enter the apartment.he stated that he nevertheless attempted to look for any evidence that a crime had been committed in the apartment,that he discovered no such evidence,but that he had not conducted a detailed forensic search.
the prosecution also produced the testimony of karen caruana,a woman with whom bierenbaum had a brief affair shortly after katz disappeared.caruana testified that bierenbaum told her in august or september that his apartment had been searched and that the police had cleared him.
in summation the prosecution argued that 
bierenbaum tells karen caruana,you know the cops searched my apartment.they found nothing,i been cleared,and in the time frame we talking about it clear that he telling karen caruana that the cops have cleared him before they even been inside his apartment cops had searched anything yet.one of the main reasons is because the defendant would let them search the apartment.the defendant and his attorney stopped the cops from doing a complete forensic search on the apartment.ladies and gentlemen,eyeballing the bathtub and walking around the apartment are no substitute for a complete forensic search 
trial tr.vol.iv.defense counsel made no contemporaneous objection,but after the summation and before the jury charge he moved for a mistrial on that and other grounds.the trial judge denied the motion,but offered to tell the jury that bierenbaum had no legal obligation to allow a search of his apartment,that he had a right to act on advice of counsel,and that the jury should draw no negative inference from that but that in fact the apartment was not fully searched.counsel accepted the offer and the trial judge instructed the jury 
let me also state that the defendant had no legal obligation to allow the police to search his apartment at any point,certain evidence came out concerning a search of his apartment.your recollection controls.that involved advice of counsel.i want to remind you that every individual has a right to an attorney and you can draw no negative inference from the fact that someone hires an attorney.
bierenbaum argues that the dalsass testimony was inadmissible absent defense counsel remark,and the prosecution could not therefore have used it in summation.again,we disagree.although defense counsel mistakenly referred to the search of bierenbaum apartment as a forensic search,omitting the term forensic from counsel opening statement would not have prevented the prosecution from eliciting dalsass testimony that a limited search of the apartment was conducted several weeks after katz disappeared.a strong piece of the defense was the fact that there was no physical evidence to link bierenbaum to the crime.bierenbaum does not suggest that counsel should not have stressed the lack of evidence,or should not have mentioned that searches of the apartment,cars and airplane turned up nothing.this case turns on the lack of evidence.in order to put the absence of physical evidence in context,the prosecution would have been permitted to inform the jury that the police were constrained to a limited search of the apartment several weeks after the disappearance.regardless of defense counsel error in referring to the search as a forensic search,the prosecution would also have elicited the fact that bierenbaum lied to caruana about the search.
in summation the prosecution improperly argued that bierenbaum and his attorney prevented the police from conducting a complete search.when the trial court attention was drawn to this error,it refused to order a mistrial,but offered an instruction,admonishing the jury that it could draw no negative inference from an individual acting on advice of counsel.defense counsel did not object to the instruction or request a stronger one.moreover,at that point in the summation,the prosecuting attorney was cataloguing what he termed bierenbaum dalsass,to,to caruana,and several other witnesses.he did not focus on bierenbaum having prevented a forensic search.given that the testimony was independently admissible,and the trial court gave a curative instruction in connection with the improper closing argument,defense counsel mistaken reference to a forensic search did not open the door to prejudicial comments.
failing to call two witnesses 
defense counsel did not call two individuals whom bierenbaum contends witnessed katz leaving the apartment and the building in accordance with his narrative of events on july.june sherman lived directly below the bierenbaum apartment.according to her affidavit,she was acutely aware of katz,who frequently screamed at her husband and walked around noisily in shoes.she states that on the morning katz disappeared,katz was screaming at someone.sherman heard the noise of the shoes,then she heard the door slam,and both the shouting and the sound of high heels on the floor stopped.she heard nothing more.sherman believed that katz left the apartment when the door slammed.
during the trial defense counsel unsuccessfully attempted to serve sherman,who had moved to arizona.bierenbaum faults the district court for concluding that counsel efforts to secure her testimony were diligent,and concluding that failure to present her testimony did not prejudice the defense.
regardless of whether counsel performance was deficient in failing to secure sherman testimony,bierenbaum can not show prejudice.sherman testimony would not have undermined confidence in the jury guilty verdict.sherman would have testified that she believed katz left the apartment after the door slammed.she would have had to admit that she did not see katz leave,nor could she be sure that the door was the exterior door,rather than an interior door.the prosecution would have argued that even if the jury believed sherman was testifying truthfully about what she heard,her testimony was consistent with the prosecution theory that bierenbaum killed his wife in the course of an explosive argument.
pablo alvarez was employed at the apartment building in.one of his duties was to relieve the doorman at lunchtime.according to his affidavit,on the sunday before katz parents and the police inquired about her,he relieved the doorman,edgar rivera,at approximately.at that time he saw katz leave the front entrance of the building wearing shorts and a.he did not see her return.
defense counsel decided not to call alvarez.the decision not to do so was a defensible trial strategy.bierenbaum does not dispute that alvarez told the authorities in july that he did not recall seeing katz on july,and that he did not remember how she was dressed the last time he did see her.bierenbaum contends that even if alvarez recollection was shaky,his testimony was essential to counter the prosecution argument that bierenbaum lied when he told detective that a doorman named edgar had seen katz leave the building.
detective testified that in their first conversation bierenbaum told him that a doorman named edgar had seen katz leave the building on july.when followed this up in a second conversation,bierenbaum said that edgar was now not sure whether he seen her on that or another day.edgar rivera told the police that he did not remember seeing katz on july.when rivera testified at trial,he stated that he could not remember anything about july.
had the defense called alvarez,and had he testified in accordance with his affidavit,the jury would have been presented with the testimony of the relief doorman,who remembered not only the departure of a particular tenant,but what she was wearing on an unremarkable sunday fifteen years before the trial.they would have to have ignored the fact that when asked about that sunday fifteen years ago,alvarez,like rivera,did not recall seeing katz leave the building.
under the circumstances,it was reasonable for defense counsel not to call alvarez.rivera testimony was not particularly damaging to bierenbaum case.detective testified that bierenbaum told him he made a mistake,and that rivera was sure when he seen katz.the prosecution did argue in summation that bierenbaum lied about the doorman,but the thrust of the argument was that bierenbaum never spoke with rivera at all in the days after katz disappearance the alvarez testimony,if believed,would not have countered this argument,as alvarez did not claim that he mentioned his sighting of katz to bierenbaum,or anyone else,during this period.
the decision not to call a particular witness is typically a question of trial strategy.greiner wells,cir quoting united states luciano,cir per curiam.the decision not to call alvarez was within the range of acceptable strategic and tactical alternatives.luciano,at.
failure to witness anthony segalas concerning katz use of cocaine 
anthony segalas testified at trial that he and katz used cocaine together twice.in segalas had told detective dalgass that he and katz used cocaine on numerous occasions.the police report also stated that katz phoned
