stanley teitler teitler,an attorney,was retained by rene garcia garcia and carmen vazquez alvarez alvarez together appellees,who are husband and wife,to defend them in united states benjamin ramos,against criminal charges that they participated in an international drug and money laundering conspiracy.the issue of an apparent conflict of interest created by teitler joint representation of the two defendants in that case arose early in the proceedings.the district court held a joint representation hearing pursuant to.and united states curcio,cir,and ruled that teitler would not be permitted to represent both garcia and alvarez.ultimately,teitler represented neither.
garcia and alvarez demanded a return of the initial fees paid to teitler,and teitler claimed he was owed additional fees for services rendered.following a hearing,the district court concluded that teitler had been discharged for cause and ordered him to return the retainer fees paid on behalf of garcia and alvarez.teitler now appeals that judgment,challenging the district court jurisdiction and its findings of fact,and further asserting that he was denied certain constitutional rights.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm.
background 
the following is based on the statement of background facts set forth in the july,memorandum and order of the district court we perceive no clear error in these findings.see garcia teitler,cv,wl,at july.
a.the arrest of garcia and alavarez and the retention of teitler 
on october,garcia and alvarez were arrested in norfolk,virginia,and ordered removed to the eastern district of new york.id.garcia faced charges of conspiracy and possession of narcotics with intent to distribute alvarez was charged as a lesser participant in the same conspiracy.id.
immediately following the arrest,rebeka four four a family efforts to obtain defense counsel for garcia and alvarez.after interviewing several attorneys,four decided to retain teitler.when asked which of the two he would represent,teitler informed four that the best strategy was for him to represent both and assured her that there would be no conflict of interest.in addition,teitler cautioned that separate counsel would turn garcia and alvarez against each other and increase the risk of conviction.id.at.
on november,teitler sent to four,as agent for garcia and alvarez,a single retainer agreement providing for dual representation and requiring an initial payment of plus a deposit for costs and disbursements.alvarez family,however,objected to subsidizing garcia defense,so teitler dispatched separate retainer agreements,each of which called for a retainer fee and expense deposit.both agreements were executed and teitler received a total of in retainer fees on behalf of alvarez and on behalf of garcia.four conferred with teitler a number of times and advised him that neither of his clients wanted to incur expenses litigating the joint representation issue.teitler assured her that the arrangement would be acceptable to the district court.id.at.
b.the curcio hearing 
teitler appeared before the district court at a status conference on december,although garcia and alvarez had not yet been produced in new york.the government raised the issue of teitler representation of both garcia and alvarez,and the district court deferred the matter until teitler had an opportunity to meet and confer with his clients.on december,appellees met with teitler for the first time at their arraignment,where the presiding magistrate judge expressed concern about the dual representation arrangement.because teitler had not yet discussed the indictment with his clients,a brief adjournment was allowed,during which teitler told garcia and alvarez that the government case was bullshit and that he would insist on a speedy trial.garcia and alvarez each pleaded not guilty,bail was denied with leave to,and a temporary order of detention was entered.id.at.
in a letter dated december,the government requested that the district court convene a curcio hearing to address a number of alleged actual or potential conflicts of interest arising from teitler representation of both garcia and alvarez.that application was granted,and teitler represented both garcia and alvarez at the december,hearing.the district court explained the inherent risks in joint representation and questioned alvarez in order to determine her understanding of the significance of joint representation generally and in the context of the pending prosecution specifically.when asked to explain how having appellant as her lawyer could affect her decision whether or not to plead guilty,alvarez responded i do know what to answer.alvarez response to a question about teitler ability to advise her on the issue of cooperation revealed a similar lack of comprehension.teitler insisted that the circumstances did not present an actual conflict or even the potential for a conflict,but the district court nonetheless refused to accept a waiver from either garcia or alvarez and directed teitler to inform the court within one week which of his two clients he would continue to represent id.at.
c.the fee dispute 
within days of the curcio hearing,four informed teitler that neither alvarez nor garcia desired his services.teitler threatened to withdraw as counsel and predicted that alvarez bail would be revoked.teitler further refused to return any of the retainer fees,despite earlier assurances to four that he would do so,claiming that he first needed to do a statement of billable hours for each defendant.id.at.
at a status conference on december,the district court granted teitler motion to be relieved as counsel.following a failed attempt by the parties to resolve the fee dispute,the district court held an evidentiary hearing on the matter and ruled that teitler had been discharged for cause.the district court further ruled that he had fabricated the additional billing statement in an effort to justify keeping the he had been paid,and to try to obtain another in additional fees.id.
ii.discussion 
a.the district court exercise of ancillary jurisdiction 
teitler first argues that the district court power to exercise ancillary jurisdiction in criminal matters was abolished by congress when it codified supplemental jurisdiction at.section,passed as part of the judicial improvement act of,provides in relevant part 
i n any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction,the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under article iii of the united states constitution.such supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties.
a.appellant argues that because this section applies only to civil action s,by implication,criminal ancillary jurisdiction must have been eliminated.we disagree.
it is a basic rule of statutory construction that a court begin with the plain and ordinary meaning of statutory terms.fashion boutique of short hills,fendi usa,cir.we think the statute means exactly what it says in civil cases,a court may exercise jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to the claims over which the court has original jurisdiction.a.although says nothing of criminal matters,it does not follow that a court may not exercise ancillary jurisdiction in a criminal case.indeed,a district court jurisdiction over criminal matters is defined by an entirely separate title of the united states code.see providing that the district courts of the united states shall have original jurisdiction of all offenses against the laws of the united states.in adding to the provisions of title dealing with civil jurisdiction,congress could not have intended to effect so sweeping a change to criminal jurisdiction as appellant would have us hold.
our holding is buttressed by the fact that courts have long exercised ancillary jurisdiction in criminal matters.in united states schnitzer,cir,for example,we held that the district court had ancillary jurisdiction to address a motion by a criminal defendant to have his arrest record expunged,and fingerprints and arrest photographs returned,following the dismissal of his indictment.we have also held that a district court has ancillary jurisdiction to address a motion for the return of seized property.see rufu united states,cir soviero united states,cir mora united states,cir.other courts have similarly held that a district court has ancillary jurisdiction to expunge criminal records,see,united states sumner,cir morrow district of columbia,or to entertain motions for the return of seized property,see,okoro bohman,cir thompson covington,cir united states martinson,cir united states wilson.
we should assume that congress legislated against a background of law already in place and the historical development of that law.exxon mobil allapattah,d ginsburg,dissenting.given that courts had recognized their power to exercise ancillary jurisdiction in criminal matters prior to the passage of the judicial improvement act of,we should not read so broadly as to eliminate that power.the fact that we have exercised ancillary jurisdiction following passage of the act further informs our decision not to read as a limit on a court power to exercise ancillary jurisdiction in criminal matters.see rufu,at soviero,at mora,at.
of course,this does not end our inquiry as we still must decide whether fee disputes during an ongoing criminal case,and as a result of a disqualification following a curcio hearing,fall within a district court ancillary jurisdiction powers.the boundaries of ancillary jurisdiction are not easily defined and the cases addressing it are hardly a model of clarity.see kokkonen guardian life ins.of america,d noting that t he doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction can hardly be criticized for being overly rigid or precise morrow,at at least so far as we are aware no court has ever tried to fix the limits of the ancillary jurisdiction doctrine with any degree of precision.quoting walmac isaacs,cir.
at its heart,ancillary jurisdiction is aimed at enabling a court to administer justice within the scope of its jurisdiction.morrow,at internal quotation marks omitted see also jenkins weinshienk,cir ancillary jurisdiction rests on the premise that a federal court acquires jurisdiction of a case or controversy in its entirety.incident to the disposition of the principal issues before it,a court may decide collateral matters necessary to render complete justice.without the power to deal with issues ancillary or incidental to the main action,courts would be unable to effectively dispose of the principal case nor do complete justice in the premises.morrow,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted id at the major purpose of ancillary jurisdiction is to insure that a judgment of a court is given full effect ancillary orders will issue when a party actions,either directly or indirectly,threaten to compromise the effect of the court judgment.along these lines,the supreme court has instructed that ancillary jurisdiction may be exercised for two separate,though sometimes related,purposes to permit disposition of claims that are,in varying respects and degrees,factually interdependent by a single court,and to enable a court to function successfully,that is,to manage its proceedings,vindicate its authority,and effectuate its decrees.kokkonen,at.internal citations omitted.
whatever the outer limits of ancillary jurisdiction may be,we hold that resolving a fee dispute after an attorney withdraws following a curcio hearing is within a district court ancillary powers,as it relates to the court ability to function successfully.indeed,we have long approved of the exercise of ancillary jurisdiction by district courts to resolve fee disputes arising in civil cases.in national equip.rental,mercury typesetting,cir,for example,we held that a district court had power ancillary to its conduct of the litigation,to condition the substitution of attorneys in litigation pending before it upon the client either paying the attorney or posting security for the attorney reasonable fees and disbursements.id.at.as we explained,this is because the termination of the relationship relates to the protection of the court own officers.id.at see also petition of rosenman colin freund lewis cohen,court has jurisdiction over law firm proceedings to establish a lien against judgment for the recovery of attorney fees marrero christiano,court has ancillary jurisdiction to entertain petition to fix lien for attorney fees.
in grimes chrysler motors cir,moreover,we held that a district court could exercise ancillary jurisdiction to resolve a fee dispute between attorneys in an underlying personal injury suit,as it related to the distribution of settlement funds.id.at.the distribution of the settlement funds and determination of appropriate disbursements,we explained,was clearly ancillary to the district court approval of the settlement in the underlying case.id.finally,in cluett,peabody,cpc acquisition,cir,a case in which a law firm sought attorney fees from its client for services rendered in an underlying federal action,we held that the district court properly exercised ancillary jurisdiction as the fee dispute was properly related to the main action.id.at.
in light of these decisions,appellant concedes that h ad the underlying federal case here been a civil suit,the fee dispute could have been resolved pursuant to a court ancillary jurisdiction powers.we reject appellant attempts to distinguish these cases on the ground that the present dispute arises from a criminal matter the fee dispute here was properly related to the main action,and in managing that proceeding,it was necessary for the court to resolve it.
the genesis of the present dispute was a curcio hearing,which is itself ancillary to the underlying criminal action.such proceedings are necessary,as a district court must,on the one hand,ensure that a defendant representation does not raise any conflict of interest and,on the other hand,protect a defendant sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel,which includes the counsel of one own choosing.see united states jones,cir united states perez,cir see also united states,cir discussing right of defendant to counsel of his own choosing balanced against the need of the court to administer justice.a court administrative duties,including ancillary hearings if necessary,are similarly related to legal representation for indigent defendants who have a right to appointed counsel.see united states nivica,cir citing gideon wainwright,d see also a h requiring district courts to set up a plan for the representation of indigent defendants and requiring,as part of that plan,representation of those entitled to counsel under the sixth amendment.any or all of these concerns,which a court undoubtedly has the authority and hence,jurisdiction to address,necessarily implicate attorney fees.
although both garcia and alvarez have been able to obtain new counsel,the record reflects that they are of limited means and that the funds paid to teitler may be needed to pay their new counsel.garcia teitler,wl,at.in order to guarantee a defendant right to choose his own counsel where,as here,his criminal case is ongoing,and to avoid the possibility of defendants becoming indigent and requiring the appointment of counsel,a district court must be able to exercise ancillary jurisdiction to resolve a fee dispute.see novinger dupont de nemours,cir noting that while a ttorneys fee arrangements are matters primarily of state contract law the federal forum has a vital interest in those arrangements because they bear directly upon the ability of the court to dispose of cases before it in a fair manner united states weissman,no.cr,wl,at june,exercising ancillary jurisdiction to decide whether,under an indemnity agreement,a company was required to continue to advance funds for defendant legal proceedings as resolution of the dispute might impact the conduct of the matter that gives rise to the court original jurisdiction in fact,both defendants here are currently represented by counsel provided pursuant to the criminal justice act,cja,which allows the court
