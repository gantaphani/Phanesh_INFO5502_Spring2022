during the criminal prosecution of cuauhtemoc,the district court,acting under its inherent power,imposed sanctions against joseph low,the attorney retained by the defendant,after finding he violated the rules of professional conduct.in addition to imposing sanctions against low,the district court imposed sanctions against low attorney,karl dickhaus,for dickhaus conduct in procuring the subpoena of a witness to testify at the hearing for sanctions against low.low and dickhaus appeal the sanctions imposed against them.we reverse both orders of sanctions.
we begin with the facts relevant to attorney low appeal after was charged with violating federal drug laws in the eastern district of missouri on january,his family retained texas attorney john fahle to represent him in the criminal proceeding.fahle entered his appearance in the case at detention hearing and arraignment on january.shortly after hiring fahle,contacted california attorney joseph low to discuss the possibility of retaining low to represent him in the criminal case.at request,low met with him at the jail in farmington,missouri,between january and.within ten days of this meeting,hired low.
on february,low contacted fahle and informed him that he too was representing in the criminal prosecution.prior to this conversation,fahle had heard rumors of having retained additional counsel.both low and fahle attended an evidentiary hearing before the magistrate judge on march.at this time,low had not yet entered his appearance on behalf of.initially the magistrate judge permitted low to participate in the evidentiary hearing based on low assurance he would file a motion to appear pro hac vice.at some point during the hearing,however,low was accused of violating a rule restricting the of a witness to one lawyer by passing notes to fahle.this prompted the magistrate judge to rescind the provisional approval and low was not permitted to participate in the rest of the hearing.
on march,asked fahle to stop representing him and told fahle he wanted low to be his sole attorney.low filed a motion to appear pro hac vice on march.the district court denied the motion the next day without providing oral or written explanation.low filed another application for admission pro hac vice on april.the district court denied this motion as well.
next,on april,fahle filed motions for a continuance,to withdraw,and for a show cause hearing.in the motion for a show cause hearing,fahle accused low of violating the rules of professional conduct,specifically rule of the missouri rules of professional conduct,by communicating with about the criminal prosecution without fahle permission even though low knew fahle already represented in the matter.according to fahle,would not cooperate with him because low represented to that low was his attorney.low filed a motion to strike fahle motion for a show cause hearing,which the district court denied.
a hearing was held on fahle motion for sanctions against low on june.at the hearing,fahle testified that low had met with without his permission.low testified of having met and consulted with,but only after having been telephoned by him and asking low to represent him in the criminal prosecution.low also testified he did not know was already represented during this conversation and could not recall exactly when he learned fahle was representing him.at one point during the hearing,low testified gave him fahle name but stated that he told to contact fahle himself.low told him he would contact fahle only after worked things out with fahle.
at the hearing,the district court also heard evidence submitted by tiffany becker,the assistant united states attorney who was prosecuting the case against.becker presented evidence of allegedly similar conduct by low in an earlier case which had been tried before the same district court judge,united states serrano et,jch.low testified of having not been admonished,sanctioned,or threatened with sanctions in the serrano case.
after the hearing,on august,the district court issued a memorandum and order imposing sanctions against low and awarding fahle attorney fees associated with the motions filed on april.the district court findings are summarized in the following paragraph 
the court finds that low communicated with defendant,knowing defendant was represented by fahle,without the consent of fahle.furthermore,low testimony at the june,hearing establishes that he did work on the case after he met with defendant but before he contacted fahle.thus,the court finds that his communications with defendant during that time period were regarding the subject of the representation.
the court also noted furthermore,low past conduct before this court in the serrano case demonstrates a disregard for the local rules concerning communications with represented parties.
the facts relevant to attorney dickhaus appeal are as follows on may,dickhaus entered his appearance to represent low in the june,hearing initiated by fahle motion for sanctions against low.the district court directed fahle to file a brief discussing the legal basis for his motion by june.low filed a response brief on june,and fahle filed a reply on the morning of the hearing.
in fahle brief,he made the following assertion counsel has heard that it happened at least one other time in this case when low apparently interviewed a who was represented by the federal public defender.as it turns out,the federal public defender never alleged of low speaking to her client.knowing this,dickhaus determined fahle must have been referring to a different attorney,john stobbs,who had represented one of the defendants in the serrano case.in the serrano case,stobbs had sent a letter to low,in which he copied the district court and all other counsel in the case,which implied low had tried to contact defendants represented by counsel without obtaining permission from the defendants attorneys.in the letter,dated march,stobbs directed low not to speak to his client.thus,dickhaus concluded what fahle meant to write in his brief was that low had communicated with a client represented by stobbs,not the federal public defender.
dickhaus sought to present evidence at the hearing for sanctions against low of low not having talked to defendants without their attorneys permission,including an affidavit from stobbs which stated low did not speak to stobbs client,jorge guillen,in the serrano case.it is this endeavor to obtain an affidavit from stobbs from which the sanctions against dickhaus and ensuing appeal arise.
dickhaus wrote and telephoned stobbs in an attempt to obtain an affidavit from stobbs stating low had not contacted guillen without stobbs permission.according to dickhaus,he offered the option of an affidavit out of courtesy as an alternative to subpoenaing stobbs to the hearing.after stobbs did not return dickhaus phone calls or the letter he faxed to him,on june,the day before the hearing,dickhaus caused a process server to try to serve a subpoena on stobbs at his office.later that day,stobbs secretary faxed to dickhaus office an affidavit,which stated,in relevant part 
on march,i received a telephone call from attorney joe low regarding guillen case.
prior to receiving a telephone call from low,i had been told by attorney grant shostak that he had participated in a trial where attorney low represented a.
shostak told me that low had spoken to his client without shostak authority or permission.
because of this,i became concerned that low would try to speak to guillen without my permission.
since we were having trouble speaking on the telephone,i decided to write low a letter.on march,i wrote low a letter explaining to him that under no circumstances did he or would he have my permission to speak to guillen.
i was concerned that low would have spoken to my client had i not written him specifically advising him that he could not speak to my client.
because my client began cooperating early on,i expected him to enter a plea of guilty which meant that i would not have been present at any trial where guillen testified.in the previous trial,low sprung on shostak and this honorable court that he had spoken to shostak
