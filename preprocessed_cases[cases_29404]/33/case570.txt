when,if ever,does a prosecutor advocacy of third party interests in the course of a criminal discovery dispute rise to the level of a conflict of interest justifying recusal here,the trial court concluded that a prosecutor who advocates a position of benefit to a third party in a discovery dispute effectively assumes representation of that party and thus has a conflict supporting recusal.
in two companion cases issued today,we reaffirm that the standard of review for assessing a trial court determination concerning prosecutorial recusal is abuse of discretion.haraguchi superior court may,cal th,d,wl hollywood superior court may,cal th,d,wl.this case demonstrates that that standard should not be interpreted as insulating trial court recusal orders from meaningful appellate review.where the trial court decision rests on an error of law,as it does here,the trial court abuses its discretion.as the court of appeal affirmed the recusal order,we reverse.
factual and procedural background 
on december,minor humberto was charged in a wardship petition welf,with violating penal code section,subdivision a continuous sexual abuse of a child under the age of.the petition alleged he had sexually abused his niece,samantha 
pretrial,humberto counsel issued separate third party subpoenas for samantha medical and psychotherapy records,subd.b.the third party custodian of samantha medical records disclosed them directly to humberto counsel,who opened them.the custodian of the psychotherapy records delivered them to the trial court and,on april,a referee temporarily presiding in lieu of the trial referee who had been assigned the matter directed the court clerk to provide the records,already opened,to defense counsel.although deputy district attorney timothy hu appeared for the people at the april hearing,the disclosure was done ex parte,and it appears he did not learn then of the records release.
on may,humberto counsel provided copies of samantha medical and psychotherapy records to the people.the people,represented this time by deputy district attorney kenneth chiu,objected to humberto possession of the records on the grounds that the proper subpoena procedure had not been followed and that people hammon cal th,d,limited the defense right to pretrial access to the privileged records.the court ordered humberto counsel to turn all records over to the court,ordered that the records be resubpoenaed,and continued the matter to afford the court time to review hammon and the relevant procedural rules.
that afternoon,humberto counsel represented in open court that she had spoken separately with both samantha mother and her father and that each had independently consented to disclosure as the people still challenged the propriety of the disclosures,the trial court set a further hearing for may,ordered the people to secure the presence of both parents at that hearing,and asked each side to submit written points and authorities.
on may,the defense filed a motion in support of disclosure,and the people filed a motion to quash the subpoenas,claiming that humberto had failed to comply with penal code section and evidence code section,that the records were privileged,that the privilege had not been waived by prior production of the records,and that the court could not authorize disclosure absent a hammon hearing people hammon,supra,cal th,d,which in any event could not be held pretrial.humberto objected repeatedly to the people participation in the hearing,but in each instance the trial court overruled the objection.samantha mother testified she had not consented to the people or humberto access to the records.she further testified that she and samantha father had joint and equal rights to make decisions about samantha treatment and care.samantha father did not appear.the trial court tentatively determined that the original april disclosure had violated hammon,but was uncertain whether consent by either parent would suffice to waive the privilege and permit redisclosure,and if so whether samantha father had consented.accordingly,it continued the matter to hear from samantha father.
at a further hearing on may,samantha father appeared and testified that when humberto counsel called him on may,he contacted samantha mother,who said she wanted to speak to the prosecutor she later called back and told him she had done so and everything was okay.on that basis,samantha father had consented to disclosing the records to defense counsel.he further testified that under his custody understanding with samantha mother,both parents had the right to seek medical treatment for samantha,and he wanted the records released even over her mother objection.
the court tentatively ruled that samantha father consent was sufficient to authorize disclosure of her records.deputy district attorney chiu objected,arguing that samantha mother consent was also necessary.after hearing further argument,the trial court disagreed,holding that under family code section either parent consent was generally sufficient to waive the privilege however,it continued the matter for one day so the people could determine whether a family court order existed that might specifically require joint consent.
on may,the people filed a supplemental motion to quash the subpoenas,alleging that just the previous day samantha therapist had submitted with samantha records a written objection to their release on the ground the release would be harmful to samantha continued treatment,and the father consent could not override that assertion of the privilege.see health,subd.a in re daniel d.in a dependency action,holding predecessor to health,barred conflicted father from accessing minor psychotherapist records.at the continued hearing,chiu reported to the court that no family court order existed,but argued the presumptions of family code section one parent consent ordinarily not control.the court agreed the statute was not controlling,but adhered to its tentative ruling.chiu then asked the court to appoint a guardian ad litem to assert samantha privilege,in light of the parents divided views and the possibility one or both had a conflict.see code civ.the court declined,treating the request as untimely.
the matter was continued to a final hearing on may,when the court denied the people supplemental motion.after a recess,on the request of another member of the prosecutor office,lydia boldin,the court stayed the release of the records pending appellate review.on june,the court of appeal denied the people writ petition,and thereafter the disputed records were released to humberto 
humberto thereafter moved to disqualify the los angeles county district attorney office pursuant to penal code section,contending that in opposing the disclosure motions it had effectively represented three different third parties samantha,her mother,and the custodian of records for samantha psychiatrist and thus had created an irremediable conflict of interest.the trial court partially granted the motion,holding humberto had shown that a conflict of interest exists that is so great as to make a fair trial unlikely.in this case,the conflict arose when the prosecution sought to represent interests in a juvenile delinquency proceeding.thus,the court grants the motion as to the recusal of deputy district attorney ken chiu.second,since the supervisors of the compton district attorney office were involved in the prosecution case against humberto and sanctioned the representation it is likely that the conflict has spread to other deputy district attorneys.on that basis,it also recused the supervising deputy district attorneys involved in the humberto matter along with anyone who has discussed the case,as well as the attorneys that the supervisors direct or directed,evaluate and promote because they are subject to the same consideration s barring the supervising attorneys.the effect of these rulings was to recuse the assigned trial prosecutor,timothy hu,and an indeterminate but potentially significant number of additional attorneys.however,the trial court denied humberto request that the entire district attorney office be recused,concluding such wholesale recusal had not been shown to be necessary.
the people sought writ review and a stay.after issuing an order to show cause and staying the proceedings,the court of appeal denied the petition and lifted the stay.the court of appeal concluded,the test to be applied here,in reviewing the order of the trial court,remains is there a conflict of interest and if so,is that conflict so severe as to disqualify the district attorney from acting the court of appeal acknowledged the factual scenario here was different than in other recusal cases the district attorney was not financially entangled with the victim,had no personal connection to any victim or witness,and had no personal gain at stake.nevertheless,it held,the actions of the deputy district attorneys involved in the motion practice in the trial court demonstrated a perspective on the role of the prosecution and an apparent attempt to represent the victim interest in protecting her privacy that exceeded the exercise of balanced discretion necessary to ensure a just and fair trial.the motion practice here evidenced a continuous effort,based on constantly shifting grounds,which appeared designed not to adhere to the statutory procedures to preserve the integrity of the process,but instead to block minor counsel from access to records potentially critical to the defense.had the prosecutor office ceased its efforts after samantha father consented in open court,after examination by the court,to the disclosure,the record might not have supported the order of recusal.but the efforts to block access to the records did not cease at that point instead continuing assertion of new grounds caused delay and additional hearings,impeding defense preparation for trial.this record reveals substantial evidence supporting the trial court finding,and demonstrates no abuse of discretion.
we granted review to consider the application of the recusal statute to situations involving the alleged advocacy of third party interests.
discussion 
standards for a motion to recuse 
as we have reiterated today in haraguchi superior court,supra,cal th at page,d,wl at,penal code s ection sets out the standard governing motions to recuse a prosecutor such a motion may not be granted unless the evidence shows that a conflict of interest exists that would render it unlikely that the defendant would receive a fair trial,subd.a.the statute articulates a test i is there a conflict of interest and ii is the conflict so severe as to disqualify the district attorney from acting hambarian superior court cal th,d,quoting people eubanks cal th.we also reaffirmed the general rule that motions to recuse a prosecutor are reviewed for an abuse of discretion.accordingly,we ask whether the trial court findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence,whether its rulings of law are correct,and whether its application of the law to the facts was not arbitrary or capricious.haraguchi superior court,at pp,d,wl at.critical to the resolution of this case,we note that when a trial court decision rests on an error of law,that decision is an abuse of discretion.see id.at,fn,d,wl at fn.people eubanks,at,d,people neely th,d.
ii.application 
we consider whether the prosecutorial conduct reflected in the record supports the trial court finding,and the court of appeal affirmance,of a conflict sufficient to warrant recusal of various los angeles county prosecutors.
a.the court of appeal rationale for recusal obstruction 
we begin with the unexceptionable proposition that the good faith assertion of legal argument,without more,does not establish a conflict.zealous advocacy in pursuit of convictions forms an essential part of the prosecutor proper duties and does not show the prosecutor participation was improper.people vasquez cal th,d.in an adversary system,prosecutors are necessarily permitted to be zealous in their enforcement of the law.marshall jerrico,d.so long as their zeal remains within legal limits the lawful execution of their duty does not establish as a matter of law that they have surrendered their independence and impartiality.hambarian superior court,supra,cal th at,d.the same is true of the occurrence of discovery disputes,which alone do not suggest a conflict.vasquez,at,d.
implicit in the court of appeal decision is the conclusion that the prosecution stepped beyond permissible zealous advocacy by acting in bad faith to obstruct discovery and impair defense preparation.humberto echoes this position.although the persistent,bad faith use of litigation tactics lawful in and of themselves might in some circumstances evidence an underlying conflict that renders a fair trial unlikely and warrants recusal,that is not this case.the trial court made no finding of bad faith,nor did it rest its recusal order on any such basis to the contrary,it viewed the prosecution objections as motivated by a desire to see the law followed,not a desire to obstruct discovery.as the record is susceptible of this conclusion,neither the court of appeal nor we may substitute our own assessment of the prosecutors good or bad faith in seeking to prevent disclosure of samantha medical and psychotherapy records 
the good faith assertion of nonfrivolous arguments is not a basis for recusal.accordingly,we reject the court of appeal conclusion that although the prosecution acted permissibly by initially challenging disclosure,it stepped over the line by persisting after samantha to disclosure in open court.the court of appeal chastised the prosecution for creating delay,but less than a week passed between samantha father testimony and the trial court order directing that the records be disclosed.to the extent the court of appeal conclusion rested on the additional month of delay that resulted from the prosecution declining to acquiesce in the trial court ruling and instead seeking appellate review,we reject that basis as well.as defendants may not be punished for resort to the appellate process north carolina pearce.in re bower cal d,so prosecutors need not fear that the good faith availment of writ review will lead to their recusal.
b.the trial court rationale for recusal representation of third parties 
the trial court based its recusal order on different grounds.it concluded that in this case a conflict arose when the prosecution sought to represent interests in a juvenile delinquency proceeding.the people contend this was error as a matter of law because they had independent standing to participate and to make arguments in the public interest,especially in a case where the state compelling interest in minimizing the trauma to minor victims of sexual assault is implicated.because they had standing,the people reason,they were not impermissibly representing third parties with interests potentially in conflict with the people own interests.we agree that the people were allowed to participate in the third party discovery hearings,that in doing so they did not represent third party interests,and that the trial court therefore erred as matter of law in concluding they had represented such interests and had thereby created a conflict.
generally,actions may have one of three legal statuses they may be prohibited,permitted,or protected in alford superior court cal th,d,for example,we considered whether the prosecution participation in pitchess hearings was protected that is,whether the people were entitled as a matter of enforceable right to be present and submit argument.the alford dissent on this issue concluded the people were so entitled alford,at,d,conc.dis.opn.of baxter,while the majority concluded participation was permitted,but not protected,at,d,lead opn.of werdegar,holding prosecution entitled only to notice of the date and place of the hearing,but permitting it to respond to inquiries from the trial court id.at,d,conc.dis.opn.of moreno,joining lead opinion on this point.we briefly noted but did not decide the same question with regard to third party subpoena hearings.see,at,d,lead opn.of werdegar,id.at,d,conc.dis.opn.of baxter.
likewise,we need not decide here whether prosecutorial participation in third party subpoena hearings is permitted or protected suffice it to say,as with pitchess hearings,it is not prohibited.critically,the governing statutes do not prohibit participation.penal code section,which governs the issuance of third party subpoenas,does not speak to the role if any of opposing parties.it does,however,adopt the procedures of evidence code section,subdivision b for delivery of subpoenaed documents.see,subds.b,c.it also expressly precludes application of evidence code section,subdivision e to criminal cases,subd.b.under penal code section and the principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius,the remaining subdivisions of evidence code section apply in criminal cases.see,the rules of evidence in civil actions are applicable also to criminal actions,except as otherwise provided in this code.
in turn,evidence code section,subdivision d contemplates at least some role for opposing parties,providing in relevant part unless the parties to the proceeding otherwise agree,or unless the sealed envelope or wrapper is returned to a witness who is to appear personally,the copy of the records shall remain sealed and shall be opened only at the time of trial,deposition,or other hearing,upon the direction of the judge,officer,body,or tribunal conducting the proceeding,in the presence of all parties who have appeared in person or by counsel at the trial,deposition,or hearing.evidence code section thus suggests that,as with pitchess hearings,and in accordance with the due process principles we recognized in alford superior court,supra,cal th at page,d,opposing parties have a right to notice and presence,but it leaves unanswered the degree of any further participation,neither guaranteeing nor prohibiting it.in the absence of a legislative determination that opposing parties are to be prohibited from any part in such proceedings,we may not adopt such a rule.
the courts of appeal that have considered the question are divided.in department of corrections superior court d,the court of appeal correctly acknowledged that ex parte third party discovery proceedings might be necessary to protect a defendant constitutional rights,but concluded on the record before it that the trial court had gone too far in excluding the district attorney entirely from the third party discovery proceedings at issue there.instead,the trial court should have conducted a limited in camera review of the defendant submissions in support of discovery and otherwise conducted open proceedings.id.at.in so ruling,the court of appeal emphasized that t o assure due process,open proceedings involving the participation of both parties are the general rule in both criminal and civil cases.id.at.
more recently,in smith superior court th,d,the defendant sought a similar order excluding the prosecution from participation in third party discovery proceedings directed at obtaining information from the county jury commissioner about the jury selection system.the trial court denied the motion,but the court of appeal granted writ relief,relying entirely on our opinion in alford superior court,supra,cal th,d.smith,at,d.to the extent smith read alford as not only declining to protect,but affirmatively prohibiting,opposition party involvement in a third party discovery proceeding,it misread our opinion as discussed,in alford we concluded that in the pitchess context prosecutors had no entitlement to participate,but were nevertheless entitled to notice,to be present,and to participate if the trial court so desired.thus,alford does not support the conclusion that opposing parties are prohibited from involvement in third party discovery.
consistent with the governing statutes,a canvass of the underlying proceedings in reported cases suggests trial courts regularly permit prosecutorial participation in third party discovery.see people hammon,supra,cal th at,d,people webb cal th,d,people kaurish cal d,mansell otto th,d people reber d,overruled on other grounds by hammon,supra,cal th,d,people condley d.people cohen d.these cases do not establish any prosecutorial right to participate,but they do reflect a understanding by trial courts that courts are at least permitted to entertain argument from the prosecution on third party discovery issues.we conclude that understanding is correct a trial court is permitted to entertain argument from the opposing party relating to third party discovery 
arguing against the prosecution standing claim,humberto contends the better response to concerns about the preservation of the privilege for sex crime victims is for therapists to protect the privilege and courts to act as gatekeepers.see,people superior court laff cal th,d,custodian of records has a duty to assert privilege on behalf of privilege holder rudnick superior court cal d,court has discretion to protect privilege of absent third party on its own motion.whether or not this is so,our conclusion that trial courts may permit or solicit prosecutorial participation is fully consistent with humberto suggested approach.it is undisputed that trial courts are authorized,indeed obligated,to regulate the use of subpoenas to obtain privileged third party discovery,see,people pack d.court statutorily required to assert privilege on behalf of absent victim,overruled on other grounds by people hammon,supra,cal th,d,lemelle superior court d.same people manson d.courts have inherent power to control the issuance of their own process and to preclude an abuse of the right to subpoena witnesses.in fulfilling this gatekeeping function,a court may choose to permit or solicit prosecutorial input.alford superior court,supra,cal th at,d,trial court may solicit prosecutorial input at pitchess hearing.
the trial court in this case did not just permit the prosecution participation in hearings on the third party discovery it actively and continually solicited that participation.it specifically asked the prosecution for briefing on whether the subpoenaed records could lawfully be disclosed to the defense.it directed that the people procure the parents presence at a hearing to determine whether disclosure should be ordered.it overruled multiple defense objections to the people participation.even as it announced its tentative ruling that samantha father consent authorized disclosure,it asked the people for further argument.it then invited the people to investigate whether a family court order might exist that required joint consent,and it voluntarily reserved its ruling when the people accepted the opportunity given the trial court acceptance of the prosecution initial concerns and its repeated solicitation of further argument,we conclude the prosecution stepped over no line in submitting its views.
more to the point in this recusal case,a prosecutor submission of argument at a third party discovery hearing,whether permitted or solicited by the trial court,does not amount to the representation of third party interests.in such instances,the prosecution interests and arguments may align with those of one or more third parties,but the prosecution does not thereby assume representation of those parties any more than an amicus curiae whose interests align with a party represents that party by submitting arguments that support its position.indeed,the two situations are simply two sides of the same coin as a nonparty may,with the court permission,submit argument supporting the interests of a party,so a party may,with the court permission,submit argument supporting the interests of a nonparty.
our comment in alford that a prosecutor who actively challenges defense third party pitchess discovery advance s the interests of the third party custodian and police officer alford superior court,supra,cal th at,d,should not be taken to mean that the prosecution in doing so literally represents the third party custodian or police officer as a matter of law,it does not.rather,the prosecution arguments in such circumstances simply benefit the interests of the third party custodian and police officer.
nor did the prosecution assume representation of any third party when it sought to have a guardian ad litem appointed to represent samantha interests.the scheme for appointment of guardians ad litem expressly contemplates that
