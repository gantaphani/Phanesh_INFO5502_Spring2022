we consider the applicability of legislative and official immunity to legislators,who are also practicing attorneys,when their public and private professional responsibilities conflict.our legal system has long recognized the vital role of the fiduciary duties that attorneys owe their clients.our system of government charges legislators with fidelity to the public trust in the discharge of their official duties.we affirm the vitality of both obligations.however,when these obligations conflict,we hold that legislative immunity shields from civil liability for activities within their legislative capacities.
a shareholder in a law firm,who also served as a legislator on a city council,voted in favor of an ordinance that adversely affected a firm client.the client sued the shareholder and his firm for malpractice for negligently failing to inform the client in advance of the city council meeting at which the ordinance was passed and breach of fiduciary duty arising from a failure to avoid or disclose a conflict of interest created by the shareholder support of the ordinance and his vote.we conclude,based on undisputed summary judgment evidence,that notifying the client of the council meeting was outside the agreed scope of the representation,and therefore,there was no duty to inform the client of the meeting.we also conclude that the is immune from liability for any conflict of interest arising from his support of,preparation for,and vote on the ordinance.because the client claims against the firm derive from the actions of the shareholder,the firm is not liable for failing to disclose a conflict of interest arising from the shareholder legislative and official actions.we reverse the court of appeals and render judgment in favor of the and the law firm.
factual and procedural background 
in william thau,an attorney and shareholder with the law firm of jenkens gilchrist,jenkens,began his representation of two thirty nine joint venture jv.he provided legal services for jv formation and its acquisition,development,and sale of acres of land in irving,texas.by the summer of,jv had sold all but of the acres.at the request of jv,thau reviewed a contract for the sale of the remaining acres as an apartment tract and drafted an amendment to the contract.the contract provided the potential buyer with a review period and a right to reject the contract before september.
on sunday,september,the irving city council posted a notice of a meeting to consider,among other items,an ordinance that would place a moratorium on apartment construction in irving.at the september,council meeting at which the ordinance was discussed,councilperson harry joe,also a shareholder at jenkens,moved to impose the moratorium.the ordinance imposing the moratorium passed unanimously.as a result,the potential buyer of jv acres cancelled the contract.joe had not told anyone at jenkens or jv about the meeting,its agenda,or his position on the moratorium.
on november,arthur hewett and jerry ragsdale,principals of jv,met with joe to discuss the impact of the moratorium on jv property.hewett and ragsdale explained that they felt joe should be working to support jv interest,stop providing leadership to those in favor of the moratorium,stop voting against jv and stop influencing the votes of others against jv.in a memorandum to joe,thau later described joe actions as le a d ing the charge to impose and continue the moratorium against the building of any apartment projects in certain irving neighborhoods.the parties acknowledge that joe did not agree to stop supporting the moratorium at this meeting.on december,after the moratorium initial period expired,the city council voted to extend the moratorium until may.joe voted in favor of the extension.
after the extension passed,jv began the process of seeking a waiver from the moratorium and discussed its options with thau and joe.joe indicated to jv representatives that he believed the tract would be eligible for a waiver but that to secure a waiver of the moratorium,jv would need citizen support.both hewett and ragsdale testified that after these conversations,they considered joe,as well as thau,to be jv lawyer.there is no dispute that at this time no jenkens attorney represented jv on matters before the city council.
in anticipation of a may,city council meeting at which another extension of the moratorium would be discussed,joe used the jenkens library to research the legality of extending the moratorium.although the city of irving later reimbursed jenkens for copying and paralegal expenses,as was customary,there is no evidence that the city paid jenkens or joe for any legal advice.also in anticipation of the may council meeting,joe sent two voice mails advising his fellow shareholders of the subject of the upcoming vote and asking if any clients would be affected.joe also asked the irving city attorney to provide a written opinion regarding joe potential conflict of interest.the city attorney may,opinion concluded that no conflict existed,but it was expressly predicated on joe representation that at that time jenkens was not representing any clients who had an interest in property that would be impacted by the moratorium.two days later,the city council voted to extend the moratorium by another unanimous vote,including joe.
in june,jv sought a waiver of the moratorium for the remaining tract.the application for the waiver was denied by city officials,and jv appealed to the city council.on june,the council voted to table the appeal.joe attended this meeting but abstained from the council vote.on july,the city attorney issued a second opinion at joe request concerning joe potential conflict of interest.based on joe representation that jenkens had no active file nor active work for two thirty nine joint venture in may and june,the opinion concluded that no conflict existed.however,jenkens billing records show that bill thau performed legal work for jv during that period.after the council tabled jv appeal,representatives from jv met with members of jenkens executive committee.at this meeting,jenkens shareholders promised to represent jv in obtaining a waiver at no charge and asked jv not to pursue legal action until jenkens had an opportunity to try to secure the waiver.jenkens was unable to secure the waiver for jv,but the tract eventually sold in for an amount near the contract price.
on april,jv filed this lawsuit.the live pleadings included claims that joe and jenkens owed jv a duty of ordinary care and a fiduciary duty and one of loyalty and that the actions of jenkens and joe constituted a breach of those duties.the pleadings also included a section entitled estoppel.jv described the basis of its claims as joe and jenkens failure to disclose the alleged conflict of interest created by joe involvement with the moratorium while jenkens represented jv in ongoing efforts to sell a tract of land for an apartment building and failure to disclose matters that were material to jenkens representation of jv including the council september meeting.jv claims that timely disclosure of the meeting would have allowed it to grandfather its property before the moratorium passed.
on june,joe moved for summary judgment based on official immunity.jv requested a continuance to conduct discovery,which the trial court denied.the trial court granted joe motion for summary judgment on july.over a year later,after jenkens and jv conducted discovery,jenkens filed an amended motion for summary judgment on six grounds joe was entitled to legislative and official immunity,and jenkens was entitled to assert any defenses that joe could have raised since he was responsible for all of the allegedly tortious conduct,chapter of the local government code provides jv exclusive remedy,jenkens had no duty to influence or control joe actions as a public servant,jv can not establish proximate cause as a matter of law because the moratorium and extensions may have passed without joe support,jv waived any conflict or claim for malpractice when it consented to representation by jenkens,and jv theory of damages was impermissibly speculative as a matter of law.the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of jenkens on september,and jv appealed.a divided court of appeals reversed and remanded all claims against jenkens and joe.the court of appeals reversed the trial court judgment in favor of joe because it concluded that the trial court abused its discretion in denying jv motion for a continuance to obtain discovery before the summary judgment hearing.the court of appeals reversed the judgment in favor of jenkens because a fact issue existed regarding whether joe and jenkens breached a duty to disclose a conflict of interest arising out of joe activities as a public official,jenkens did not conclusively establish that joe was immune from liability,and fact issues existed as to proximate cause,damages,and waiver of a conflict of interest.joe and jenkens petitioned this court for review.

iii.jenkens motion for summary judgment 
conflict of interest 
jv claims that it retained jenkens to assist it in selling acres and that joe leadership role,discussion,preparation,and vote regarding the moratorium created an impermissible conflict,the nondisclosure of which breached the fiduciary duty and duty of loyalty joe and jenkens owed to jv.jenkens contends that joe legislative immunity shields joe from liability for jv claims for breach of its fiduciary duty and duty of loyalty and that the potential liability that jenkens faces derives from its shareholder actions as a city councilperson.we agree that without joe actions in this case,no conflict of interest would exist on which to predicate jenkens potential liability to jv.thus,if joe is immune from liability,jenkens can not be derivatively liable for joe actions.see dewitt harris county,holding that an employer is entitled to assert any affirmative official its employee may assert accord harris county louvier,dist,no pet.see also cameron compress kubecka,writ ref respondeat superior declares the act of the servant to be the act of the master,and that which excuses or justifies the one will in like manner excuse and justify the other.we therefore initially address the parties contentions regarding legislative immunity for joe actions.
this court has recognized that individuals acting in a legislative capacity are immune from liability for those actions.in re perry.legislative immunity applies to legislators at the federal,state,regional,and local levels of city council are performing legitimate legislative functions.bogan,d stating that legislative immunity extends to local legislators tenney brandhove.noting that legislative immunity only protects actions within the sphere of legitimate legislative activity in re perry,at see,clear lake city water auth.salazar,dist,orig.proceeding leave denied see also lake country estates,tahoe reg l planning agency,d extending absolute immunity to members of a regional planning agency,which was created by two states compact and consented to by congress butz economou,d recognizing absolute immunity for department of agriculture officials when performing legislative and prosecutorial functions.
the court assumes,without deciding,that joe activities in support of the moratorium on apartment construction created an impermissible conflict with his duties to jv as a jenkens shareholder.we hold that legislative immunity shields joe from liability for any conflict of interest created by legitimate legislative functions undertaken in connection with his position as a city councilperson.we now analyze whether jenkens established as a matter of law that the actions on which jv based the alleged conflict of interest constitute legitimate legislative functions.
jv pleading claimed that joe leadership role,discussion or vote in favor of the moratorium created a conflict of interest that adversely affected jv.specifically,jv claimed that joe was the acknowledged leader of the faction of irving citizens who oppose d apartment construction.jv also alleged that joe used the resources available to him at jenkens and had legal research performed at his request and under his direction to further the interests of the citizens group opposed to apartment construction and his political goals and interests to the detriment of jv.
jenkens summary judgment evidence establishes as a matter of law that the actions that jv claims created a conflict of interest were legitimate legislative functions undertaken by joe as a councilperson.first,we consider joe vote in favor of and discussion with council members regarding the moratorium.the text of the ordinance,the city council minutes,and joe affidavit establish that the ordinance at issue was a law of general application based on concerns over zoning and commercial development facing the irving community.joe testified that he spoke in favor of the moratorium at the september city council meeting.hewett deposition testimony that i t was generally believed there was a voting block,including harry joe,that harry joe controlled does not remove joe legislative acts from the protection of legislative immunity.we hold that joe discussion,persuasion of colleagues,and vote on the ordinance were legitimate legislative functions.
we also conclude that joe alleged leadership role in supporting the moratorium and opposing apartment construction constituted legitimate legislative functions.joe testified that citizens expressed concerns that an increasing number of dwellings would impact crime,gangs,schools,and parks in the area,and he concluded that the moratorium was appropriate until irving could adopt a new comprehensive plan for development.joe testified that he communicated with several constituents regarding the moratorium and their concerns about the increased number of dwellings in the area.just as voting to impose and extend a moratorium on apartment construction constituted a legitimate legislative function,so was joe involvement with his constituents regarding a pending issue before the city council jenkens established as a matter of law that the actions on which jv bases the alleged conflict of interest constitute legitimate legislative functions.
jv claims against jenkens based on a conflict created by joe legislative actions fail because jv claims against jenkens derive from joe actions.because joe is immune from liability for any conflict of interest that may have been created by acts within the sphere of legitimate legislative activity,jenkens can not be liable for those activities or for a conflict of interest created by those activities.we conclude that the trial court properly granted jenkens motion for summary judgment because joe is immune from liability for failing to disclose a conflict of interest,and because of this immunity,jenkens can not be held derivatively liable.see dewitt,at.
we briefly address the summary judgment evidence showing that joe met with representatives from jv to discuss whether the tract would be appropriate for a waiver from the ordinance.jv claims that joe gave its representatives legal advice that jv was a good candidate to obtain a waiver.whether joe comments could be construed as legal advice does not change our analysis.jv complains that joe actions in favor of the moratorium were contrary to jv interests and therefore constituted a conflict of interest.we conclude that despite jv status as a jenkens client and joe position as a shareholder in the firm,joe is immune from liability for conflicts created by his legislative acts.thus,even if joe provided jv with legal advice,joe is immune from claims that his legislative activities created a conflict with the client interests.
scope of representation 
jv alleges that joe and jenkens committed legal malpractice by negligently failing to inform jv of a matter material to the representation,the september,irving city council meeting at which the moratorium on apartment construction passed.jv claims that timely disclosure of the impending council vote on the moratorium would have allowed it to grandfather its property under an exception to the moratorium and then consummate the pending contract on the tract.to recover on a claim for legal malpractice,the plaintiff must establish the attorney owed the plaintiff a duty,the attorney breached that duty,the breach proximately caused the plaintiff injuries,and damages occurred.peeler hughes luce.
generally,a lawyer fiduciary duties to a client,although extremely important,extend only to dealings within the scope of the underlying relationship of the parties.see rankin naftalis,see also joseph state,dist,no pet.the nature of the relationship defines an attorney duties and the professional services to be rendered.restatement third of the law governing lawyers cmt.c cmt.d a lawyer duties are ordinarily limited to matters covered by the representation.while it is true that an attorney owes a client a duty to inform the client of matters material to the representation,willis maverick,this duty to inform does not extend to matters beyond the scope of the representation.see,joseph,at noting that an attorney could not render ineffective representation to a criminal defendant on offenses for which she was not retained to represent defendant klager worthing,antonio,no writ holding that law firm did not assume a duty to supervise a client medical care despite agreeing to represent client in silicone breast implant litigation restatement cmt.d a lawyer is not liable for failing to act beyond the scope of representation.in fact,the lawyer may not act beyond the scope of the contemplated representation without additional authorization from the client.disciplinary prof l conduct restatement,cmt.c,cmt.
in this case,jv argues that joe and jenkens had a duty to inform jv of the september,meeting.viewing the facts in the light most favorable to jv,the scope of jenkens representation included thau reviewing and drafting sale documents for the tract but did not include representation of jv in matters before the irving city council.arthur hewett,a principal in jv,confirmed that jv handled its planning and zoning issues before the irving city council internally and that jenkens never represented jv in such matters.such matters were thus beyond the agreed scope of representation between jv and jenkens.moreover,the scheduling of the september council meeting was a matter of public record to which jv had access.the nature of the meeting was publicly available,as evidenced by the fact that other developers took action to grandfather their plats upon learning of the pending moratorium.because representing jv before the city council was not included in the scope of jenkens representation,jenkens had no duty to inform jv of the september,meeting.thus,the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of jenkens on jv claim that jenkens negligently failed to inform jv about the september,city council meeting on the moratorium.
iv.joe motion for summary judgment 
less than two months after jv filed this lawsuit,joe moved for summary judgment based solely on the affirmative defense of official immunity.jv filed a motion for continuance and a response to joe motion for summary judgment.the trial court denied jv motion for continuance and granted joe motion for summary judgment on official immunity.the court of appeals reversed the trial court denial of jv motion for continuance.we reverse the court of appeals and address the merits of joe motion for summary judgment on official immunity.
jv motion for continuance 
in its motion for continuance,jv argued that because the case had been on file for less than two months,jv had been deprived of an adequate opportunity to conduct discovery to respond to joe motion for summary judgment.jv also explained that its lead counsel had been in trial for approximately three weeks during the pendency of jv suit and attached an affidavit from counsel in support.the trial court denied jv motion for continuance.
the trial court may order a continuance of a summary judgment hearing if it appears from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that he can not for reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to justify his opposition.civ.g.when reviewing a trial court order denying a motion for continuance,we consider whether the trial court committed a clear abuse of discretion on a basis.bmc software,marchand.a trial court abuses its discretion when it reaches a decision so arbitrary and unreasonable as to amount to a clear and prejudicial error of law.id.we have considered the following nonexclusive factors when deciding whether a trial court abused its discretion in denying a motion for continuance seeking additional time to conduct discovery the length of time the case has been on file,the materiality and purpose of the discovery sought,and whether the party seeking the continuance has exercised due diligence to obtain the discovery sought.id.diligence and length of time on file tenneco enter.prods,materiality and purpose union fire ins.cbi,materiality state wood oil,diligence see also perrotta farmers ins,dist,no pet.using these factors to decide whether a trial court abused its discretion in denying a motion for continuance.
here,joe motion for summary judgment raised a single defense to jv immunity.official immunity protects joe from liability if the actions of which jv complains were discretionary duties,within the scope of joe authority as a city councilperson,and performed in good faith under an objective reasonableness standard.ballantyne champion builders,wl city of lancaster chambers.in its motion for continuance,jv argued that it needed additional discovery on the second element of official immunity,claiming that serious questions exist as to whether joe acted as legal counsel for the city of irving and certain of its constituents,rather than as councilman and more time was required to investigate the nature of the advice provided by jenkens and joe to the city of irving and possibly members of the valley ranch concerned citizens coalition,the faction of irving citizens who oppose apartment construction.specifically,jv contended that it needed to depose irving city council members,members of the citizens group,jenkens representatives with knowledge of the firm representation of jv,and the irving city attorney.jv attached the affidavit of arthur hewett,one of its principals,in support of these contentions.hewett affidavit stated that from information available to me and other representatives of jv,it appears that joe acted in the capacity as legal counsel to the city council of the city of irving and possibly gave legal advice to the citizens group in irving opposing apartment construction.attached to hewett affidavit was a jenkens invoice for reimbursement of research expenses regarding the moratorium,which hewett claims was sent to the city of irving,and notes from a jenkens librarian regarding research she performed on the moratorium.finally,jv attached correspondence in which attorneys for jv attempted to work with opposing counsel to schedule depositions.
we can not conclude that the trial court denial of the motion was so arbitrary and unreasonable as to amount to a clear and prejudicial error of law.see marchand,at.we acknowledge jv attempts to obtain the requested discovery in the short time the case was on file and see no indication that jv was merely trying to delay the summary judgment hearing.however,we do not agree that the discovery sought by jv was material to its response to joe motion for summary judgment on official immunity.jv describe
