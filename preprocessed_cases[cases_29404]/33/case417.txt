introduction 
gregory reyes and stephanie jensen appeal from their convictions for falsifying corporate books and records,and related charges,stemming from their participation in a scheme to reward employees with grants of backdated stock options.the options were backdated to a time when the company stock price was low,but the options were not recorded on the company books as an expense of the corporation,so the books showed the corporation to be more profitable than it was.the convictions represent the first criminal convictions for a backdating practice that was widespread in the late,particularly in the silicon valley,where the appellants company was located.
we reverse reyes conviction because of prosecutorial misconduct in making a false assertion of material fact to the jury in closing argument.we affirm jensen conviction but vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing because the sentence improperly included an obstruction of justice enhancement for which reprehensibility lay primarily with jensen lawyer.
ii.facts and procedural background 
gregory reyes was the chief executive officer ceo,and stephanie jensen was the of the human resources department,of brocade communication systems,brocade,based in san jose,california.the company is publically traded and engaged in the business of developing and selling network equipment and providing networking solutions.because of the competitive demand for qualified information technology personnel in the silicon valley,the company began the practice of offering new personnel and valued employees compensation in the nature of stock options.
a stock option is the right to purchase a share of stock from a company at a fixed price,referred to as the strike price,on or after a specified vesting date.in a rising market,stock options generally help companies recruit employees desiring to share in the company growth and help persuade employees to stay with the company so that their increasingly valuable options may vest and be exercised.
in general,companies grant options with a strike price equal to the market price on the date the options are granted.backdating stock options refers to the practice of recording an option grant date and strike price retrospectively.backdating is not itself illegal,provided that the benefit to the employees is recorded on the corporate books as a compensation expense to the corporation,in accordance with an accounting convention promulgated in referred to as accounting principles board opinion.it is not now disputed that the options in this case were not recorded in the books as having been backdated.
on august,the government charged reyes and jensen with securities fraud,falsification of corporate books and records,and violating related statutes and regulations.their cases were severed for trial and represented the first such prosecutions to go before a jury.
a.the reyes trial 
the jury convicted reyes of conspiracy in violation of securities fraud and making false filings with the securities and exchange commission sec in violation of b and,and falsifying corporate books and records in violation of b a and,and and making false comments to auditors in violation of and.
at trial,reyes principal defense was that he,as ceo and sole member of the board of directors compensation committee,signed off on the backdated options without any intent to deceive.he sought to establish reasonable doubt as to his intent by contending that brocade finance department was well aware of the backdated options and the fact that the options were not properly expensed out on the books.reyes also argued that he relied in good faith on the accuracy of the finance department documentation when he signed off on false financial statements.
the government witnesses provided evidence as to how this scheme operated and how reyes participated in the scheme.one of the witnesses,elizabeth moore,who was an employee of the finance department and who administered brocade stock options,testified that she and other members of the finance department did not know that the backdating was occurring.
other,finance department employees,however,had given statements to the fbi describing their knowledge of the backdating scheme.both prosecution and defense counsel were familiar with these statements.those employees,who were themselves subject to possible criminal prosecution and had been targets of sec civil suits,did not testify.
during trial,reyes position was that he relied on the finance department to make sure that the corporate books were accurate,and that he was not responsible for the false records.reyes counsel,in closing argument,therefore told the jury that the finance department knew about the backdating,thus supporting the defense position.the prosecutor,however,told the jury that the employees in the finance department do have any idea that the backdating was occurring.the prosecutor thereby asserted to the jury facts that he knew were belied by the statements to the fbi from responsible finance department officers,and by sec complaints that had been filed against some of the finance department employees alleging they knew about the scheme.
reyes moved for a new trial on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct.he also sought a new trial on the separate basis of what he asserted to be a recantation of elizabeth moore testimony that she did not know about the backdating.the district court denied the motions.earlier,the court had denied a motion for directed verdict for insufficiency of the evidence to establish materiality,that knowledge of the backdating would have affected the judgment of a reasonable investor.the district court sentenced reyes to months imprisonment,and imposed a million fine.this appeal followed.
b.the jensen trial 
in the jensen trial,the principal issue was whether she knew that this was a fraudulent scheme and whether she possessed a criminal intent.jensen sought an instruction that would have required the jury to find she knew what law she was violating,to find that the falsification was done with the purpose of violating a known legal duty.the district court instead instructed the jury that it must find the government proved jensen acted knowing the falsification to be wrongful.united states jensen,d.the jury convicted jensen on the two counts charged against her falsifying and aiding and abetting the falsification of books,records,and accounts in violation of b a,b,and,and and conspiracy to falsify books and records in violation of.
at sentencing,jensen also argued she was within the provision of the penalty statute that exempts a defendant from imprisonment for violating a regulation if the defendant had no knowledge of such rule or regulation.a.the district court declined to hold she was within the no knowledge clause,and sentenced her to a term of imprisonment of four months.
jensen term included an enhancement for obstruction of justice for her lawyer reliance on a declaration made by reyes.her lawyer had obtained a severance of jensen trial from reyes on the basis of reyes false declaration stating that jensen was without any culpability,that reyes had told jensen that there was no backdating,and that reyes would testify at jensen trial if the trials were severed.reyes did not testify at jensen trial.
the district court was understandably annoyed that the court had had to preside over two trials and had been misled by the false declaration.it imposed the obstruction of justice enhancement because jensen was present in the courtroom when her attorney argued the motion to sever and did not interfere with her lawyer presentation of the false declaration.the district court order on jensen sentence is published at united states jensen,d.
iii.the reyes appeal 
the reyes trial was combative.the government had to prove reyes was knowingly responsible for the false corporate records,and the stakes were high.the issue that is dispositive of reyes appeal concerns the government attorney misconduct in falsely telling the jury that the finance department did not know about the backdating,when the prosecutor knew that their statements revealed that they did.
there is a threshold issue,however,of whether the government satisfied its burden of proving that the false records would have affected the judgment of a reasonable investor.if the government failed in its burden to establish the materiality of the falsification,then the prosecution must be dismissed,and no new trial would be possible.burks united states,d.the government did not,however,fail in its burden.
materiality depends on the significance that a reasonable investor would assign to the withheld or misrepresented information.basic levinson,d.to be material,there must be a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having altered the total mix of information made available.id.at.quoting tsc,northway,d.
the prosecution did not present any witnesses who actually invested in brocade stock.the government relied on the expert testimony of three witnesses steve catricks,a portfolio manager and equity analyst at delaware investments,robert mccormick,an employee who was a proxy lawyer at fidelity investments,and john garvey,an accounting expert.although reyes now attempts to discredit the witnesses testimony because they made no personal decision to invest in brocade stock,the standard of materiality is judged from the perspective of a reasonable investor,and is therefore an objective one.see tsc,at.reyes did not contest the expertise of these witnesses to present the testimony.
mccormick testified that fidelity used guidelines for the voting of shares fidelity owned in other companies.these guidelines were designed to maximize shareholder benefit,and they instructed fidelity managers to vote against plans that permitted a company to grant any backdated options.according to mccormick,fidelity frowned upon granting backdated stock options because they result in share dilution,and they have a less incentivizing effect on employees than stock options that are not backdated.catricks testified that granting backdated options inflates net income and earnings per share figures of the company,figures that catricks stated he,as a reasonable investor,would want to know when he made his investment decisions.
mccormick and catricks testimony further established that improper accounting of backdated options presents investors with an incorrect picture of a company finances.supporting their testimony,garvey testified that brocade failure to expense more than million from backdated options resulted in brocade reporting profits in and,when it should have reported large losses.
we have recognized that information regarding a company financial condition is material to investment.sec murphy,cir surely the materiality of information relating to financial condition,solvency and profitability is not subject to serious challenge.the witnesses testimony,taken cumulatively,and in the light most favorable to the prosecution,united states,cir citation omitted,permitted a rational trier of fact to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the omissions and misstatements were material to a reasonable investor.
there is also a claim of instructional error with regard to the jury finding that misstatements to accountants were materially false.the instruction required the jury to find that the statements were capable of influencing actions of accountants,and did not expressly reference investors.in the circumstances of this case,there was no reversible error on this point.the main thrust of the government case was that the false statements were capable of misleading investors.the statements were the same as those the jury found,in other counts,capable of influencing reasonable investors.the remaining instructional challenges relate to the false entries count b a and,and.they are without merit.
we therefore turn to whether prosecutorial misconduct requires a new trial.the principal issue before the jury was one of intent.there was no question that reyes signed off on stock option grants that were priced retrospectively,and that the backdating allowed brocade to understate its compensation expenses.that was indeed the way that the alleged scheme was supposed to operate,by providing a valuable option to employees at no apparent expense to the company.
at trial,an issue as to reyes criminal state of mind was whether reyes knew the corporate records falsely stated the company financial condition by the company expenses.reyes defense was that he thought the transactions were properly accounted for,in reliance on the finance department expertise to comply with accounting principles and sec regulations.the government,however,argued that the finance department was unaware of the backdating,and thus powerless to get the accounting right.a key question therefore became whether the finance department knew that the backdating scheme was taking place.
statements made to the fbi by responsible employees in the finance department during the fbi investigation established that finance department executives knew about the backdating and that one employee had resigned as a result of it.a finance department employee,however,elizabeth moore,testified for the government that she did not know about the scheme.during closing argument,the prosecutor did not confine his argument to the evidence before the jury or reasonable inferences that could have been drawn from that evidence.the prosecutor asserted as fact a proposition that he knew was contradicted by evidence not presented to the jury.in direct contravention of the statements given to the fbi by finance department executives that they did know about the backdating,the prosecutor asserted to the jury in closing that the entire finance department did not know about the backdating,and further that the government theory of the case was that finance did not know anything.our theory is that those people did know anything elizabeth moore says finance did know.did you need everybody in the finance department to come and tell you that they did know the government even displayed for the jury a diagram explaining the prosecutor position that the finance department did not know of the backdating.the prosecutor asked the jury to assume other employees of the finance department would testify that they did not know about reyes backdating procedure when the prosecutor knew they did.
in denying the defense motion for a new trial,the district court focused not only on the prosecutor misstatements,but on defense counsel performance as well.defense counsel had told the jury that the finance department did know,and told the jury that the finance department executives would have so testified if they had been called.in the district court view,defense counsel was almost as culpable as the government because defense counsel asserted what the finance department knew about the backdating without calling finance department executives as witnesses.according to the district court,defense counsel should have sought immunity for the witnesses,and then proved,through their testimony,that the finance department did know about the scheme.
it was not,however,the defense burden to prove reyes was innocent.it was the prosecutor burden to prove he was guilty.defense counsel made no knowingly false statements.the prosecutor did.indeed,on appeal the government does not seriously dispute the falsity of the prosecutor statements or the duty of the prosecutor to refrain from making such statements.instead,it argues the misconduct was harmless.
in representing the united states,a federal prosecutor has a special duty not to impede the truth.the united states department of justice mission statement describes the government duty as one to ensure fair and impartial administration of justice for all americans.united states department of justice,about doj.
there is good reason for such a high standard.a prosecutor opinion carries with it the imprimatur of the government and may induce the jury to trust the government judgment rather than its own view of the evidence.united states young,d citing berger united states.for this reason,it is improper for the government to present to the jury statements or inferences it knows to be false or has very strong reason to doubt.united states blueford,cir citing united states kojayan,cir.
the district court,in denying the motion for a new trial,apparently did not view the prosecutor statements to be culpably false,finding that the finance department witness statements that were provided to the fbi did not put the lie to the government arguments.we are unable to agree.the fbi witness statements affirmatively assert that bob bossi,brocade controller,knew backdating was occurring regularly and that reyes was backdating stock options.the witness statements also reveal that bossi complained about fraudulent practices relating to at least one employee stock options,and that bossi eventually resigned his position at brocade.the witness statements further reveal that tony canova,a chief financial officer at brocade,also knew backdating was taking place.bossi and canova even discussed discovering specific instances of inconsistencies in stock option paperwork,and attributed the errors to reyes backdating practice.
moreover,in civil suits brought by the sec,parallel evidence was produced about the knowledge of finance department executives.for example,the sec complaint charging michael byrd,a chief financial officer at brocade,did not state that byrd was deceived regarding the stock option grant given to brocade employee richard geruson,as the prosecutor had argued during closing argument during reyes case.rather,the civil complaint charged that byrd acted with knowledge of the backdating of geruson grant.the sec complaint against canova clearly alleges that canova did know that backdating was occurring.as a joint press release emphasized,the fbi,sec,and attorney office forged a strong,cooperative relationship in pursuing civil and criminal punishment for misconduct relating to backdating brocade stock options.press release,securities and exchange commission,attorney office and sec separately charge former brocade ceo and vice president in stock option backdating scheme july.gov news press.htm.the prosecution is legally charged with responsibility for information uncovered in its civil investigations and may be required to disclose it in criminal cases that it prosecutes.see,united states wood,cir.it is charged with knowledge of the parallel sec investigation.
the record demonstrates that the prosecution argued to the jury material facts that the prosecution knew were false,or at the very least had strong reason to doubt.reyes objected below and therefore preserved the issue.both reyes and the government agree in their briefs that the error is not harmless if we conclude it is more likely than not that the misconduct materially affected the fairness of the trial.see united states mckoy,citing young,at.
although the government case was relatively strong,the jury took seven days to deliberate,and the case was complex and technical.moreover,the prosecutor statements were particularly prejudicial given that reyes defense rested on his delegating his responsibilities to others and reliance on them.at the end there was considerable focus on the issue of what the finance department knew.the prosecutor false statements went directly to this issue.moreover,the statements were made during closing arguments,both orally and visually,and closing statements from the prosecution matter a great deal.kojayan,at.deliberate false statements by those privileged to represent the united states harm the trial process and the integrity of our prosecutorial system.we do not lightly tolerate a prosecutor asserting as a fact to the jury something known to be untrue or,at the very least,that the prosecution had very strong reason to doubt.see blueford,at.there is no reason to tolerate such misconduct here.
reyes goes further on appeal and argues that the misconduct was so flagrant that the indictment should be dismissed.see united states chapman,cir noting that dismissal of the indictment may be warranted where the prosecutor actions rise to the level of flagrant prosecutorial misconduct,a defendant suffers substantial prejudice,and no lesser remedial action is available for the misconduct.although we do not agree with the district court that the prosecutor may have been innocent of deliberate false statements,we recognize there were aggressive tactics on both sides.we do not conclude the prosecutor conduct was so egregious as to require dismissal of the prosecution.reyes case must be remanded for a new trial.
iv.the jensen appeal 
jensen appeal first challenges a jury instruction given in her case.she also challenges her sentence.
jensen instructional challenge relates to the statutory term willfully.the substantive provision of the securities and exchange act of act at issue in this case requires issuers of registered securities to make and keep books,records,and accounts,which,in reasonable detail,accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer.b a.this provision was an amendment to the act enacted by the foreign corrupt practices act of.see foreign corrupt practices act of,stat.in turn,b provides that n o person shall knowingly falsify any book,record,or account described above.
the criminal penalty provision applicable to jensen case is a,which provides penalties for willful violations and false and misleading statements 
any person who willfully violates any provision of this chapter or any rule or regulation thereunder the violation of which is made unlawful or the observance of which is required under the terms of this chapter,or any person who willfully and knowingly makes,or causes to be made,any statement in any application,report,or document required to be filed under this chapter or any rule or regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in a registration statement which statement was false or misleading with respect to any material fact,shall upon conviction be fined not more than,or imprisoned not more than years,or both,but no person shall be subject to imprisonment under this section for the violation of any rule or regulation if he proves that he had no knowledge of such rule or regulation.
jensen proposed a jury instruction that would have required the jury to find that the falsification was done with the purpose of violating a known legal duty,or that the falsification was unlawful.it therefore would have required the jury to find jensen knew she was violating a securities law.the district court rejected her proposed instructions,and instructed the jury that they must find that jensen falsified or intentionally caused to be falsified books,records,or accounts,knowing the falsification to be wrongful.jensen,d at.
the supreme court has recognized that the meaning of willfully is often influenced by the context in which it is used.ratzlaf united states,d.the district court instruction in this case was in line with this court interpretation of willfully in the securities context.in united states tarallo,cir,this court interpreted the meaning of willfully in a.in upholding a conviction for securities fraud in violation of b and a,and,we held in tarallo that willfully means intentionally undertaking an act that one knows to be wrongful willfully in this context does not require that the actor know specifically that the conduct was unlawful.id.at emphasis in original.tarallo thus rejected the instruction jensen seeks.
jensen nevertheless argues that a higher scienter requirement is warranted because the substantive securities provision she violated involved books,records,and accounts.according to jensen,the knowing falsification of books,records,and accounts is not inevitably nefarious,see ratzlaf,at,and therefore a higher scienter requirement is necessary to prevent ensnaring innocent persons.jensen tries to equate a violation of b to other violations in which the word willfully requires knowledge of the law.she relies on criminal tax,see cheek united states,d,and financial structuring cases,see ratzlaf,at.
this argument is foreclosed by tarallo.tarallo observed that our circuit and others have rejected the argument that,in the context of the securities fraud statutes,willfulness requires a defendant know that he
