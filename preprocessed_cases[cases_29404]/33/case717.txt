facts and proceedings 
according to mtc original complaint,on january,mtc entered into a contract with city in which mtc agreed to provide air ambulance services for a specified fee.a basic purpose of the contract was to facilitate continuous helicopter ambulance service for patients within the general region of city.prior to entering into the agreement,false representations were allegedly made to mtc by city fire chief,michael antonucci chief antonucci,regarding the estimated number of times that air ambulance services would be utilized per year call volumes.mtc allegedly relied on these representations as to call volumes when it decided to enter into the contract with city.the complaint further alleged that city breached the contract by,among other things,failing to timely provide necessary licenses and permits required to operate the air ambulance services in kern county and a failure to provide adequate infrastructure to dispatch calls.under these facts,the original complaint included causes of action for fraud and breach of contract.later,a fourth amended complaint provided greater specificity regarding the misrepresentations as to call volumes that were allegedly made by chief antonucci.
on september,during the course of discovery in this case,the deposition of chief antonucci was taken by attorney anton on behalf of mtc.at the deposition,attorney anton inquired at length about a november meeting that attorney anton had with chief antonucci.at the time of the earlier meeting with chief antonucci,attorney anton was representing a third party,golden empire medical transport golden empire,in a federal lawsuit against kern county for antitrust violations based on kern county alleged failure to issue ambulance service permits to qualified applicants in response to attorney anton deposition questions,chief antonucci stated his recollection that the november meeting included,among other things,discussions relating to the federal lawsuit against kern county and city potential joinder therein 
on february,mtc sought leave to file a fifth amended complaint.the purpose of the amendment was to add a new cause of action entitled fraud in the misrepresentation re permit.the proposed new cause of action was based,in part,on the premise that in a prior meeting with mtc representative,attorney anton,city had been informed of the difficulty of obtaining ambulance permits in kern county.specifically,the fifth amended complaint alleged,n either city nor chief antonucci relayed to mtc,during any point of the contract negotiations that city and its representative,chief antonucci,before november,met with representatives of the golden empire in the federal court case and discussed the pitfalls and hazards the city would face from the county of kern if it pursued a permit to operate any ambulance or provide paramedic services to its citizens.
after learning of the proposed amendment,city promptly interposed its motion to disqualify attorney anton.the disqualification motion was supported by the declaration of chief antonucci.the declaration explained that in november of,chief antonucci was contacted by attorney anton regarding a federal lawsuit that attorney anton had brought on behalf of his then client,golden empire,against kern county.the federal lawsuit had alleged,among other things,that kern county was involved in anticompetitive practices by wrongly denying ambulance permits to otherwise qualified companies.chief antonucci also received a telephone call in november of from a representative of golden empire,attorney ritchie,informing him that attorney anton was very interested in meeting with him.a lunch meeting was arranged at which chief antonucci met for approximately one and hours with attorneys anton and ritchie.
according to chief antonucci declaration,d uring the course of the meeting,it became clear to me that attorney anton was interested in soliciting the city involvement in his federal lawsuit.since attorney anton discussed the suit with him and why the city should become involved as a plaintiff,it seemed clear to chief antonucci that attorney anton was offering to represent california city.chief antonucci then noted the conversation shifted to a discussion of city plans with respect to mtc,including attorney anton giving advice,which is described as follows during the course of the meeting with attorney anton,i discussed with him city plans regarding mtc and the fact that we would soon be seeking a permit.attorney anton offered a legal opinion regarding the legality of kern county conduct in relation to golden empire.attorney anton also offered his legal opinion regarding kern county procedures and what he believed would be a likely attempt to deny city a permit.besides this legal opinion,attorney anton also offered me legal advice as to the strategy city should take in applying for a permit in conjunction with mtc proposal.following my conversation with attorney anton,i reported the substance of this conversation to appropriate city officers and the city attorney.a decision was made at that time not to join in the federal lawsuit.chief antonucci summarized the meeting in the following terms throughout my contact with attorney anton,i understood that i was meeting with him in his professional capacity as an attorney offering legal advice,opinions and potential representation.
in light of the circumstances of the meeting,as described above,city motion for disqualification argued that a preliminary consultation between an attorney and a prospective client had transpired,giving rise to duties of loyalty and confidentiality to city on the part of attorney anton with respect to the subject matter communicated at said meeting.when attorney anton later exploited the meeting and the matters discussed therein as a basis for potential liability in the instant lawsuit against city,it allegedly resulted in or revealed a conflict of interest warranting his disqualification.
mtc opposition to the motion took a surprising turn.contrary to the allegations in the proposed fifth amended complaint,mtc claimed in its opposition that the date of the meeting between attorney anton and chief antonucci was not november of after all,but january,several weeks after the contract with mtc was already approved by city and executed.the later meeting date was allegedly supported by attorney billing statements.according to mtc opposition,the fact that the meeting was actually in late january of proved that no confidential information could have been exchanged,since the agreement with mtc was already a matter of public record.mtc also stressed that there had been general publicity about kern county policies regarding ambulance permits because of several newspaper articles.
moreover,the declarations of attorneys anton and ritchie in opposition to the motion stated that attorney anton was not seeking to be hired by city or to have city join his federal lawsuit,and that no advice was offered or confidential information disclosed.rather,according to attorney anton,he was merely attempting to obtain information for use in the golden empire litigation.furthermore,any opinions offered by attorney anton at the meeting were,according to attorney anton,regarding golden empire and kern county,particularly how kern county was in violation of a host of laws.he claimed that n othing in his opinions related to the subject matter of the proposed fifth amended complaint 
in its reply,city emphasized that attorney anton,throughout his questioning of chief antonucci at a deposition in this case,asked numerous questions about the november meeting and,from the nature of the questions asked,obviously believed at that time several months prior to city disqualification motion that the november date was correct.also,attorney anton was convinced the meeting was in november of when he submitted his proposed fifth amended complaint in february of.city argued this change of position significantly impacted on attorney anton credibility when it worked to his advantage,attorney anton relied on a november date to support a fifth amended complaint based on fraudulent inducement against city.now that he faces possible disqualification,attorney anton has urged a january date.additionally,city reply emphasized that prior to the meeting,chief antonucci had various phone conversations in november of with attorneys anton and ritchie regarding the federal lawsuit.thus,even assuming the meeting occurred at a later date,the earlier phone calls would according to city warrant a finding of an relationship in november of.
the motion was heard on march.the trial court did not find the date of the meeting to be significant,and instead focused on the relationship between the prior conversations and the present lawsuit the court observed,t here an awful lot here that suggests there is a substantial relationship between the conversations between attorney anton and chief antonucci and the claims that are now being made by mtc against the city with regard to chief antonucci representations and his presumed knowledge that those representations were not true.in sum,the court found there was sufficient evidence that attorney anton with help from attorney ritchie had solicited the participation of city in the federal lawsuit against kern county,which solicitation gave rise to discussions involving the very subject of the instant,the difficulty of securing ambulance permits from kern county.in view of the substantial relationship between the subject matter of the prior conversations and the instant litigation,the court concluded that disqualification was necessary.accordingly,the motion was granted.mtc timely appeal followed.
discussion 
standard of review 
generally,a trial court decision on a disqualification motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion.citations.if the trial court resolved disputed factual issues,the reviewing court should not substitute its judgment for the trial court express or implied findings supported by substantial evidence.citations.when substantial evidence supports the trial court factual findings,the appellate court reviews the conclusions based on those findings for abuse of discretion.citation.however,the trial court discretion is limited by the applicable legal principles.citation.thus,where there are no material disputed factual issues,the appellate court reviews the trial court determination as a question of law.citation.in any event,a disqualification motion involves concerns that justify careful review of the trial court exercise of discretion.citation.people ex rel.of corporations speedee oil change systems,cal th,d,speedee oil.
ii.disqualification principles 
a court authority to disqualify an attorney derives from its inherent power to control in furtherance of justice the conduct of its ministerial officers and the integrity of the proceedings before it.code civ,subd.a in re marriage of zimmerman th,d zimmerman.
where,as here,a motion for disqualification is based on an asserted breach of confidentiality or conflict of interest,the trial court must cautiously balance the competing interests.the court must weigh the combined effect of a party right to counsel of choice,an attorney interest in representing a client,the financial burden on a client of replacing disqualified counsel and any tactical abuse underlying a disqualification proceeding against the fundamental principle that the fair resolution of disputes within our adversary system requires vigorous representation of parties by independent counsel unencumbered by conflicts of interests.citations.zimmerman,supra,th at,d.ultimately,disqualification motions involve a conflict between the clients right to counsel of their choice and the need to maintain ethical standards of professional responsibility.citation.the paramount concern must be to preserve public trust in the scrupulous administration of justice and the integrity of the bar.the important right to counsel of one choice must yield to ethical considerations that affect the fundamental principles of our judicial process.citations.speedee oil,supra,cal th at,d.such important ethical considerations include the attorney duties of confidentiality and loyalty.id.at,d.
it is well established that an attorney may not do anything which will injuriously affect his former client in any matter in which he formerly represented him,nor at any time use against his former client knowledge or information acquired by virtue of the previous relationship.people ex rel.deukmejian brown cal d,zimmerman,supra,th at,d.the purpose of the rule is to protect both confidential communications and the enduring confidential relationship between attorney and client.zimmerman,supra,at,d.
in order to protect the confidential nature of the relationship from conflicts of interest,the state bar rules of professional conduct,rule e rule e,provides that an attorney may not,without the informed written consent of the client or former client,accept employment adverse to the client or former client where,by reason of the representation of the client or former client,the member has obtained confidential information material to the employment.
courts have applied rule e to a variety of situations,and different tests have been developed for determining whether disqualification is appropriate.the present case involves alleged successive representation of clients whose interests are claimed to be adverse.in successive representation cases,a party may obtain the disqualification of an attorney by establishing that the targeted attorney has actual knowledge of material confidential information or is presumed to have acquired confidential information because of the relationship between the prior representation and the current representation.faughn perez th,d,italics added.
under the substantial relationship test,w here an attorney successively represents clients with adverse interests,and where the subjects of the two representations are substantially related,the need to protect the first client confidential information requires that the attorney be disqualified from the second representation.speedee oil,supra,cal th at,d.the rationale for this rule has been explained as follows where the potential conflict is one that arises from the successive representation of clients with potentially adverse interests,the courts have recognized that the chief fiduciary value jeopardized is that of client confidentiality.thus,where a former client seeks to have a previous attorney disqualified from serving as counsel to a successive client in litigation adverse to the interests of the first client,the governing test requires that the client demonstrate a substantial relationship between the subjects of the antecedent and current representations.the substantial relationship test mediates between two interests that are in tension in such a freedom of the subsequent client to counsel of choice,on the one hand,and the interest of the former client in ensuring the permanent confidentiality of matters disclosed to the attorney in the course of the prior representation,on the other.where the requisi
