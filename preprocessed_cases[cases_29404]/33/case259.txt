this case arises out of a persistent and pervasive conspiracy among law enforcement personnel and prosecutors to convict,robert spurlock and ronnie marshall,of murder upon the false testimony of henry apple and others.tommy thompson,a state prosecutor,appeals the district court denial of his motion to dismiss plaintiffs civil rights complaint on absolute immunity grounds.for the reasons described below,we affirm in part and reverse in part the district court denial of defendant motion to dismiss.
background 
facts as alleged in the 
the complaint of plaintiffs robert spurlock and ronnie marshall the complaint alleges the following.on february,lonnie malone was found murdered in a culvert of bug hollow road in sumner county,tennessee.local law enforcement,including george farmer and danny satterfield,investigated both spurlock and marshall as possible suspects in the murder.spurlock provided an alibi,which the officers never investigated,and marshall admitted being in the company of malone on the night of the murder,although he denied involvement in the murder.investigators did not have sufficient evidence to link spurlock or marshall to malone murder.
on april,satterfield,whitley,and sumner county police officer john coarsey coerced henry junior apple,a drug dealer who was then incarcerated for failure to pay child support,into falsely implicating spurlock and marshall in the malone murder.they interrogated apple extensively,and apple,despite initially denying any knowledge of the murder,eventually agreed to implicate spurlock and marshall in exchange for release from prison.the officers provided apple with details of the murder and then recorded an interrogation of apple in which he implicated spurlock and marshall in the murder,stating,in particular,that he was in spurlock truck when spurlock returned with blood on his shirt.
on april,when the officers pressed apple to say that he had actually witnessed the murder,rather than that he merely had knowledge of it,apple told a jail guard that he was worried the officers would not keep their agreement to secure his release.this conversation was recorded.
on april,the officers recorded apple stating that he had actually witnessed spurlock and marshall murder malone,rather than merely implicating the pair as he had done in the april and april statements.on this recording,apple also stated that this was the first time that he had told anyone what he had witnessed.whitley,coarsey,satterfield,and jerry kitchen,an assistant district attorney general for sumner county,agreed to conceal apple april and april statements.
apple false statements created probable cause for the arrests and prosecutions of spurlock and marshall.spurlock and marshall were only indicted after the investigating officers secured apple statements that he had witnessed the malone murder.as the tennessee court of criminal appeals later noted 
the testimony of henry junior apple was the sole,exclusive evidence available to the prosecution to link both spurlock and marshall to the murder of lonnie malone.prior to apple revelations on april,and april,the investigating officers could not prove that their suspects,spurlock and marshall,actually murdered the victim.nor could the prosecution obtain an indictment charging the suspects with murder.the indictment in this case was returned on may,fifteen months and seventeen days after the commission of the murder and nine days after apple last statement to detective satterfield.
state spurlock.
in september and october of,apple testified falsely at the trials of spurlock and marshall,and both were convicted and sentenced to serve life in prison.
after the trials,defense counsel became aware of the april and april recordings and filed motions for a new trial.on january,at the hearing on the motion for new trial in spurlock case,whitley called satterfield as a witness.satterfield testified,on,that these two recordings of apple were maintained at the drug task force office before he took them into his own possession,and that whitley was aware of the existence of these tapes.plaintiffs motions for new trial were denied.however,on may,the tennessee court of criminal appeals reversed the convictions,finding that whitley knew of the april and april recordings and had suborned the perjury of apple and satterfield.
in september,thompson was appointed district attorney general pro tempore for sumner county,tennessee with respect to the cases of spurlock and marshall.in order to cover up the conspiracy to wrongfully convict spurlock and marshall,thompson agreed not to independently investigate the findings of the tennessee court of criminal appeals.in fact,on march,thompson sent a letter to an investigator for the tennessee board of professional responsibility,which had conducted an investigation into alleged prosecutorial misconduct following plaintiffs trial.in the letter,thompson voiced his support of whitley actions,denying that whitley had committed or had knowledge of any wrongdoing.
in,thompson plaintiffs.at spurlock trial,thompson called whitley as a witness.whitley testified falsely.on,whitley testified that the failure to produce the april and april recordings was merely oversight because he had not realized that the recordings contained jencks act statements,and that the tapes had been locked up in the task force office from the time that they were made until the some time they were disclosed to me.apple also testified,relating the same false story he told at the first trials.spurlock and marshall were convicted a second time.
plaintiffs allege that at the time of the second trial,thompson had full knowledge of the foregoing facts or,at a minimum,access to transcripts referencing these facts.on march,after an investigation into the malone murder revealed that others had confessed to the killing,plaintiffs second convictions were vacated.
in october,plaintiffs filed a civil rights suit,captioned spurlock satterfield,in federal court against whitley,kitchen,coarsey,satterfield,apple,sumner county,and the city of hendersonville,alleging a conspiracy to convict plaintiffs of murder.
during the course of an investigation by the tennessee bureau of investigations into apple testimony,apple gave a sworn statement,and later stated in an interview that he had been coerced into particular,that he was forced to testify that he had actually seen malone murder.in an october,letter responding to apple statement,thompson urged investigator ray copeland to disbelieve apple statements that he had been coerced into lying.
thompson,whitley,and perhaps other defendants,threatened apple that if he did not st i ck to his trial story that he would be prosecuted for perjury.in response to the complaint in plaintiffs first civil rights suit,apple filed an affidavit reaffirming his trial testimony.apple was not prosecuted for perjury.
procedural history 
on november,plaintiffs filed the complaint alleging that thompson violated certain of their federal civil rights,and also committed state law violations.plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages,as well as costs and fees.
on february,thompson filed a motion to dismiss the complaint based on a claimed entitlement to absolute prosecutorial immunity,among other things.on october,the district court allowed thompson motion to dismiss in part,but denied the motion with respect to plaintiff sic conspiracy claims under based on defendant alleged knowing use of false testimony to secure plaintiffs second convictions and threatened retaliation if henry apple did not continue to testify falsely.the district court also concluded that thompson was not entitled to qualified immunity for these actions.however,the district court did grant thompson absolute prosecutorial immunity for his failure to indict whitley for testifying falsely at the second trials of plaintiffs,and his failure to investigate the alleged misconduct of whitley.the district court also granted thompson absolute witness immunity for statements he made to the tennessee board of professional responsibility.the district court dismissed plaintiffs and conspiracy claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.finally,the district court denied thompson motion to dismiss insofar as it claimed that plaintiffs claims are,and granted plaintiffs leave to an amended complaint to clarify this issue.
on appeal,thompson challenges only the district court conclusion that he was not entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity with respect to plaintiffs claims that thompson knowingly used whitley false testimony to secure plaintiffs second convictions,and threatened retaliation if apple did not maintain the truth of his false testimony after the conclusion of the second trial.we exercise jurisdiction only over the interlocutory appeal of these two issues pursuant to.
ii.analysis 
we review the district court denial of a defendant claims that he is entitled to absolute or qualified immunity de novo,as that issue is a question of law.spurlock,at citing dickerson mcclellan,cir.in reviewing immunity defenses,we determine whether the facts alleged by plaintiffs,if proved,would overcome the asserted defenses.id.citing bloch ribar,cir.
absolute immunity 
a bsolute immunity is the exception rather than the rule,and has traditionally been reserved for those actors intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.id.at citing imbler pachtman,d.this court generally presumes that qualified rather than absolute immunity is sufficient to protect government officials in the exercise of their duties.id.quoting burns reed,d.the burden is on the official seeking protection to prove that absolute immunity is justified.burns,at.
in imbler,the supreme court extended absolute immunity,previously available at common law,to protect prosecuting attorneys who are sued under for alleged deprivations of a criminal defendant constitutional rights committed while the prosecutors were acting within the scope of their duties in initiating and pursuing criminal prosecutions.at.the supreme court rejected the application of qualified immunity,finding absolute immunity justified by the concern that harassment by unfounded litigation might cause a deflection of the prosecutor energies from his public duties,and the possibility that the prosecutor would shade his decisions instead of exercising the independence of judgment required by his public trust.id.at.the court noted that the remedial powers of the trial judge,appellate review,and state and federal collateral remedies are available to determine whether an accused has received a fair trial.id.at.in the same vein,the court acknowledged that 
to be sure,this immunity does leave the genuinely wronged defendant without civil redress against a prosecutor whose malicious or dishonest action deprives him of liberty.but the alternative of qualifying a prosecutor immunity would disserve the broader public interest.it would prevent the vigorous and fearless performance of the prosecutor duty that is essential to the proper functioning of the criminal justice system.
id.at.of course,as the court acknowledged,professional disciplinary actions and criminal prosecution of prosecutors are not barred by absolute immunity.id.at.
notably,a prosecutor will only receive absolute immunity for activities that were an integral part of the judicial process.id.at.because the supreme court found that the activities at issue in imbler,the knowing use of false testimony and the suppression of material evidence at imbler criminal trial,were intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process thereby triggering absolute immunity,the court did not address what other activities might also be integral.at.
since the court decision in imbler,courts have taken a functional approach to absolute immunity.see higgason stephens,cir looking to the nature of the function performed,not the identity of the actor who performed it.using this approach,courts have concluded that a prosecutor is protected in connection with his duties in functioning as a prosecutor.id.accordingly,prosecutors are absolutely immune from many malicious prosecution claims.burns,at.citing yaselli goff.likewise,absolute immunity is appropriate for claims based on the prosecutor appearance at a probable cause hearing and before a grand jury.id.at.absolute immunity applies to acts includ ing the professional evaluation of the evidence assembled by the police and appropriate preparation for its presentation at trial or before a grand jury after a decision to seek an indictment has been made.buckley fitzsimmons,d.preparation of witnesses for trial is protected by absolute immunity.higgason,at discussing imbler conclusion that an effort to control the presentation of a witness testimony was entitled to absolute immunity because it was fairly within the prosecutor function as an advocate modifications in original omitted.as the court concluded in imbler,even the knowing presentation of false testimony at trial is protected by absolute immunity.at.see also buckley,at.noting the seventh circuit conclusion that p resenting fabricated evidence to the grand jury and trial jury are actions protected by absolute immunity.citing buckley fitzsimmons,cir.
however,prosecutors are not entitled to absolute immunity for investigative or administrative acts.see burns,at.see also holloway brush,cir en banc.thus,prosecutors are not entitled to absolute immunity for the act of giving legal advice to police.burns,at.finding qualified immunity sufficient.prosecutors have only qualified immunity for authorizing warrantless wiretaps in the interest of national security.see mitchell forsyth,d.a prosecutor is not entitled to absolute immunity for statements made in an affidavit supporting application for arrest warrant.see kalina fletcher,d.similarly,statements made by a prosecutor at a press conference are administrative acts not entitled to absolute immunity.buckley,at.
as this court has explained,the analytical key to prosecutorial immunity,therefore,is the actions in question are those of an advocate.holloway,at.thus,the critical inquiry is how closely related is the prosecutor challenged activity to his role as an advocate intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.id.
knowing use of false testimony 
prosecutorial decisions regarding witness testimony,including what witnesses to use at trial,and what questions to ask them,are activities intimately associated with the judicial phase of a criminal trial and,therefore,are protected by absolute prosecutorial immunity.see imbler,at.buckley,at.here,as in imbler,thompson decision,as prosecuting attorney,to have whitley and apple testify falsely at spurlock second criminal trial,even if done knowingly,is protected by absolute immunity.thus,the district court judgment denying thompson absolute immunity on this claim must be reversed 
coercion and threatened retaliation if apple did not continue to testify falsely 
thompson was not acting as a legal advocate when he threatened or coerced apple more than a year after the second criminal trial had been completed.therefore,thompson is not entitled to absolute immunity for this conduct.when thompson coerced apple by threatening him to st i ck to his trial story or be prosecuted for perjury,thompson sought to coerce apple into maintaining the false testimony he gave during spurlock and marshall first and second criminal trials to cover up the wrongdoing of himself and others during those trials.these threats and coercion occurred after the conclusion of the adversarial proceedings relating to the second criminal prosecution of spurlock and marshall.specifically,this conduct occurred during the course of an administrative investigation into the use of false testimony at plaintiffs trials and around the time plaintiffs filed their first federal civil rights suit,which implicated all those involved in the conspiracy except thompson.
in particular,after plaintiffs initial convictions were vacated,thompson spurlock in,and obtained a conviction based in significant part on the false testimony of apple and whitley.in,after this trial and during the course of an investigation into his testimony,apple gave a sworn statement that he had been coerced into lying on t
