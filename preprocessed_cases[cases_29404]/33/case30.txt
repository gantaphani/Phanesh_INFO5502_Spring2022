this case,arising from defendants convictions on charges of violating and conspiring to violate the export administration act of eaa and its implementing regulations,is before us for the third time.the facts and earlier procedural history are recounted in united states lachman,cir lachman ii united states lachman,cir lachman i and united states lachman,d.we first describe briefly what happened and elaborate where necessary below.
the defendants are fiber materials,fmi and materials international,mi,a wholly owned subsidiary of fmi collectively,the corporate defendants walter lachman lachman,chairman and principal owner of fmi and president of mi and maurice subilia subilia,president of fmi.all were convicted by a jury of exporting and conspiring to export a control panel for a large hot isostatic press hip without the export license required by the eaa and its regulations the underlying facts,in the light most favorable to the jury posture for sufficiency challenges,see united states,cir,cert.denied sub nom.united states,d are as follows.
defendants,acting through fmi united kingdom subsidiary,contracted in with the indian government defense research and development laboratory drdl to supply a hip with an diameter cavity,along with a control panel.however,they could not obtain a license to export such a large hip under united kingdom regulations,which like united states regulations required a license to export hips with a cavity five inches or larger.the larger hip can produce densified material useful for ballistic missiles.
so,in january,the parties amended their contract to provide for the export,from the united states,of a smaller hip,just under the limit required for a license,and a control panel.on the same day,subilia signed a letter to the indian government stating that the control panel to be exported with the hip would have added capacity to provide for future expansion to larger vessel size.in march,defendants contracted with the indian government to provide a larger hip and then arranged to have the components of that hip manufactured by third parties in switzerland and england and shipped directly to india.
both plans were carried out.the control panel shipped to india in april with the diameter hip could be used with that hip but was designed so that it could also control a hip with a diameter larger than five inches.in particular,the control panel had controllers not just for the two heating zones contained in the hip but also for an additional three heating zones that would be employed for a much larger hip,and it also had a switch that permitted the disabling of the three additional zones.
in april,after the components of the larger hip had been delivered to india,defendants engineers traveled to india,assembled the larger hip and connected to the larger hip the control panel that had been shipped with the hip.after warning the indians of the impracticality of trying to operate both the larger hip and the smaller hip with the originally provided control panel,the defendants contracted with india to provide a smaller control panel for use with the smaller hip.
in july,the defendants were indicted for exporting the control panel without a license and for conspiring to do so.the government theory was that the control panel fell within the category of components,accessories and controls that had been specially designed for the larger hip and that,while the larger hip had been made outside the united states,the control panel was in fact intended for use with the larger hip and therefore covered by the statute and the regulations.see note,above.
after a jury trial in march,all four defendants were convicted both on the illegal export count and the conspiracy count.in july,the district court granted defendants motion for acquittal on the ground that the regulations were unconstitutionally vague,lachman,d at,but,in october,this court overturned that decision and reinstated the guilty verdicts,subject to the district court disposition of a yet undecided defense motion for a new trial.lachman ii,at.
on remand,the district court denied defendants motion for a new trial,which rested on claims of newly discovered evidence and government of evidence in violation of brady maryland,d.previously,the district court had denied lachman separate motion for a new trial on the ground that he was prejudiced by the district court failure to inquire,under.c,about the potential conflict of interest arising from his joint representation,with the corporate defendants,by a single law firm.
the district court sentenced lachman to three years of probation,the first year to be served in home detention.subilia also received three years of probation,with the first six months to be spent in community confinement followed by one year in home detention.fines of were imposed on fmi and each of the individual defendants.all of the defendants appealed,and the government,challenging the leniency of the sentences.the government and subilia thereafter withdrew their appeals.
now before us are lachman claims that the jury verdict was not supported by sufficient evidence of his scienter and that the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial based on the alleged rule c violation.in addition,lachman and the corporate defendants appeal from the denial of their motion for a new trial based on their proffer of newly discovered evidence,including the supposed brady evidence.we discuss the sufficiency claim first,then the new evidence and brady issues and finally the claim based on rule c.
the familiar standard that applies to challenges requires that a reviewing court determine whether,after assaying all the evidence in the light most amiable to the government,and taking all reasonable inferences in its favor,a rational factfinder could find,beyond a reasonable doubt,that the prosecution successfully proved the essential elements of the crime.united states dwinells,cir quoting united states,cir,petition for cert.filed.
here,the jury was instructed that the government was required to prove two kinds of that defendants acted knowingly,that they knew what was being exported,and that they acted willfully,that they intended to violate the law in the sense that they were aware that their conduct was unlawful lachman primarily argues that the government failed to introduce sufficient evidence that he knew,in any detail,about the nature of the control panel that was being exported.if he did not know what was being exported,it follows that he could not be guilty of intending to violate the law by exporting the item in question.
the government presented sufficient evidence for a jury to find that lachman knew that the control panel exported with the hip was intended to be used with a hip having an internal working diameter of five inches or more and that it had the capacity to perform this role.this,as we held in lachman ii,at,would make the control panel one specially designed to be used with the larger hip and therefore one requiring an export license.
the evidence is admittedly circumstantial.lachman did not testify subilia who did agreed only that he had regular discussions with lachman,and no witness testified that lachman had discussed or admitted to knowledge of the precise characteristics of the control panel ultimately exported.but purely circumstantial evidence can support an inference of knowledge,see united states mousli,cir and here several different elements form a pattern that permitted even if they did not compel the jury inference.
specifically,in addition to lachman overall supervision of the companies employees,particularly subilia,the government offered evidence as to lachman of which the following are examples 
that at the start of the project lachman told the drdl that he would himself handle the export license requests 
that lachman and subilia talked daily about the project and that lachman gave subilia direction and that lachman knew what we were doing via monthly reports from the engineers and the daily conversations with subilia 
that lachman was personally involved in the decision to provide a smaller hip with an accompanying control pa
