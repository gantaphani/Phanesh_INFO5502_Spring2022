this appeal represents a lawyer nightmare.a sophisticated law firm,with what it thought was a sophisticated system to determine and calendar filing deadlines,missed a critical one the time period in which to file a notice of appeal under federal rule of appellate procedure a a.the rule,however,provides for a grace period of days within which a lawyer in such a fix may ask the district court for an extension of time,and the court,in the exercise of its discretion,may grant the extension if it determines that the neglect of the attorney was excusable.here an experienced trial judge found excusable neglect,and the appellee asks us to overturn that ruling.
the underlying dispute began in when laffit pincay,and christopher mccarron pincay sued vincent andrews,robert andrews,and vincent andrews management andrews for financial injuries stemming from alleged violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico and california law.in,a jury returned verdicts in pincay favor on both the rico and the california counts.pincay was ordered to elect a remedy,and he chose to pursue the rico judgment.this judgment was reversed on appeal on the ground that the rico claim was barred by the federal statute of limitations.pincay andrews,cir.on remand,pincay elected to pursue the remedy on his california law claim.judgment was entered in his favor on july.
andrews notice of appeal was due days later,but a paralegal charged with calendaring filing deadlines misread the rule and advised andrews attorney that the notice was not due for days,the time allowed when the government is a party to the case.see fed.a b.andrews counsel learned about the error when pincay relied upon the judgment as being final in related bankruptcy proceedings,and andrews promptly tendered a notice of appeal together with a request for an extension within the grace period.by that time the matter had been in litigation for more than years.everyone involved should have been well aware that the government was not a party to the case,and any lawyer or paralegal should have been able to read the rule correctly.the misreading of the rule was a critical error that,had the district court viewed the situation differently,would have ended the litigation then and there with an irreparably adverse result for andrews.the district court,however,found the neglect excusable and granted the motion for an extension of time to file the notice of appeal.
pincay appealed to this court,and a majority of the panel concluded that andrews attorney had improperly delegated the function of calendaring to a paralegal,and held that the attorney reliance on a paralegal was inexcusable as a matter of law.pincay andrews,cir.it ordered the appeal dismissed.the dissent would have applied a more flexible and deferential standard and affirmed the district court.id.at kleinfeld,dissenting.
a majority of the active judges of the court voted to rehear the case en banc to consider whether the creation of a per se rule against delegation to paralegals,or indeed any per se rule involving missed filing deadlines,is consistent with the united states supreme court leading authority on the modern concept of excusable neglect,pioneer investment services brunswick associates.partnership,d.we now hold that per se rules are not consistent with pioneer,and we uphold the exercise of the district court discretion to permit the filing of the notice of appeal in this case.
the pioneer decision arose in the bankruptcy context and involved the bar date for the filing of claims.the court in pioneer established a balancing test for determining whether there had been excusable neglect within the meaning of federal rule of bankruptcy procedure b.the court also reviewed various contexts in which the phrase appeared in the federal rules of procedure and made it clear the same test applies in all those contexts.the pioneer factors include the danger of prejudice to the party,the length of delay and its potential impact on judicial proceedings,the reason for the delay,including whether it was within the reasonable control of the movant,and whether the moving party conduct was in good faith.at.
in this case,the district court analyzed each of the pioneer factors and correctly found there was no prejudice,the length of delay was small,the reason for the delay was carelessness,and there was no evidence of bad faith.it then concluded that even though the reason for the delay was the carelessness of andrews counsel,that fact did not render the neglect inexcusable.the district court relied on this court decision in marx loral,cir,in which we affirmed an order granting an extension of time in a case that involved an attorney calendaring error.
because the panel majority decided the case in part on the issue of delegation of calendaring to a paralegal,we consider that issue first.this issue was not presented to the district court,and it was raised sua sponte by the panel.
in the modern world of legal practice,the delegation of repetitive legal tasks to paralegals has become a necessary fixture.such delegation has become an integral part of the struggle to keep down the costs of legal representation.moreover,the delegation of such tasks to specialized,may well ensure greater accuracy in meeting deadlines than a practice of having each lawyer in a large firm calculate each filing deadline anew.the task of keeping track of necessary deadlines will involve some delegation.the responsibility for the error falls on the attorney regardless of whether the error was made by an attorney or a paralegal.see model rules of prof l conduct cmt.this rule does not prohibit a lawyer from employing the services of paraprofessionals and delegating functions to them,so long as the lawyer supervises the delegated work and retains responsibility for their work.we hold that delegation of the task of ascertaining the deadline was not per se inexcusable neglect.
the larger question in this case is whether the misreading of the clear rule could appropriately have been considered excusable.resolution of that question requires some effort to try to distill any principles that have evolved in the years since pioneer.in pioneer itself,the court adopted a broader and more flexible test for excusable neglect.a narrower test existed in many circuits before pioneer that limited excusable neglect to situations that were beyond the control of the movant for an extension as,for example,the messenger being hit by a truck on the way to the court clerk filing desk.see pioneer,at.
the district court followed our decision in marx,where we acknowledged that pioneer had worked a change in our circuit law as to what constitutes excusable neglect.at.as we explained in marx,our strict standard,which required both a showing of extraordinary circumstances that prevented timely filing and injustice resulting from denying an extension,id.at citing pratt mccarthy,cir,gave way to an equitable determination that involves consideration of the four pioneer factors.id.at.we therefore affirmed the district court grant of an extension of time to file a notice of appeal in marx because the district court correctly considered the pioneer factors.we found that the district court did not abuse its discretion,and we said the district court analysis of the pioneer inv.factors in this case,although considerably lenient to the plaintiffs,was not a clear error of judgment.id.
our court,in other cases,has also described pioneer flexible approach,saying,for example,we will ordinarily examine all of the circumstances involved rather than holding that any single circumstance in isolation compels a particular result regardless of the other factors.briones riviera hotel casino,cir see also bateman united states postal,cir.
we seemed to take a more narrow approach in kyle campbell soup,cir.in that case our court reversed the district court finding of excusable neglect.we emphasized the fact that the attorney had made a mistake in interpreting rules that were not ambiguous and we focused on the particular facts of pioneer,including a dramatic ambiguity in the notice of the filing deadline at issue.id.at.
our circuit confusion is not isolated.the authorities interpreting pioneer in a number of circuits are in some disarray.in fact,the confusion begins with pioneer itself,and various subsequent circuit opinions have cited similar portions of pioneer to support their respective but differing conclusions.the key passage in pioneer,having a little something for everyone,is as follows 
although inadvertence,ignorance of the rules,or mistakes construing the rules do not usually constitute excusable neglect,it is clear that excusable neglect under bankruptcy rule b is a elastic concept and is not limited strictly to omissions caused by circumstances beyond the control of the movant.

the experience of the seventh and fifth circuits is instructive.the seventh circuit in prizevoits indiana bell telephone,cir,dismissed an appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice was not filed within the days required by the rule.in that case the attorney had missed the deadline for filing a motion under federal rule of civil procedure e to alter or amend the judgment and filed a motion to extend the time.the district court denied this motion because no extension is allowed under rule.the time for filing a notice of appeal expired,however,while the motion was pending before the district court,and so the attorney moved for an extension under rule.the district court granted the extension of time to appeal,but the seventh circuit reversed.id.at.the prizevoits majority cited pioneer for the proposition that excusable neglect is not limited to situations where the failure to timely file is due to circumstances beyond the control of the filer,id.at quoting pioneer,at,but limited the reach of pioneer to such things as plausible misinterpretations of ambiguous rules.id.the majority then concluded here the rule is crystal clear,the error egregious,the excuses so thin as to leave the lapse not only unexcused but inexplicable.if there was excusable neglect here,we have difficulty imagining a case of inexcusable neglect.id.
judge eschbach dissent also relied on pioneer and criticized the majority choice not to address the impact of pioneer on our past decisions.id.at.the dissent said in pioneer,the court held that attorney negligence may,in certain circumstances,constitute excusable neglect,considerably liberalizing its meaning and prescribing a new analytical test.id.
in the fifth circuit,a majority relied on prizevoits in midwest employers cas.williams,cir,over a strong dissent by judge garza.judge garza cited authority,seemingly contrary to the majority,from both the fifth and seventh circuits,interpreting the equitable factors of pioneer.id.at.he cited united states evbuomwan,cir unpublished opinion reported at table case where the court found that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that a good faith misinterpretation of plain rules was excusable neglect.he also cited lackey atlantic richfield,cir,where the court found that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding excusable neglect because the attorney obvious error was mitigated by the lack of prejudice to the nonmovant and the shortness of the delay.finally,he cited united states brown,cir,where the seventh circuit affirmed the district court finding that an attorney confusing of state rules with federal rules amounted to excusable neglect.id.at.the seventh circuit said pioneer made clear that the standard is a balancing test,meaning that a delay might be excused even where the reasons for the delay are not particularly compelling.id.at.
the eleventh circuit seems to have set forth a more categorical test.in advanced estimating system,riney,cir,the court stated the ancient legal maxim continues to apply ignorance of fact may excuse ignorance of law does not excuse.accordingly,appellant counsel misunderstanding of the law can not constitute excusable neglect.id.at citations omitted.that decision seemed to move the eleventh circuit back toward the approach it had taken before pioneer,and which pioneer rejected,excusable neglect is limited to matters beyond the control of the attorney.see in re analytical systems,cir reciting the eleventh circuit standard for establishing excusable neglect pioneer,at.citing in re analytical as an example of a court that had taken a narrow view of excusable neglect.in pioneer,the supreme court rejected a rule of the sort embraced by some courts of appeals,erecting a rigid barrier against late filings attributable in any degree to the movant negligence as irreconcilable with our cases.at.
despite this confusion,there appears to be general agreement on at least one principle the standard of review.we review for abuse of discretion a district court decision to grant or deny a motion for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal.marx,at see also pioneer,at.to be sure,were there any evidence of prejudice to petitioner or to judicial administration in this case,or any indication at all of bad faith,we could not say that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in declining to find the neglect to be excusable.kyle,at silivanch celebrity cruises,cir midwest employers cas,at advanced estimating,at.we must therefore affirm unless we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the lower court committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached after weighing the relevant factors.marx,at.
in this case the mistake itself,the misreading of the rule,was egregious,and the lawyer undoubtedly should have checked the rule itself before relying on the paralegal reading.both the paralegal and the lawyer were negligent.that,however,represents the beginning of our inquiry as to whether the negligence is excusable,not the end of it.the real question is whether there was enough in the context of this case to bring a determination of excusable neglect within the district court discretion.
we therefore turn to examining the pioneer factors as they apply here.the parties seem to agree that three of the factors militate in favor of excusability,and they focus their arguments on the remaining factor the reason for the delay.appellee andrews characterizes the reason for the delay as the failure of a carefully designed calendaring system operated by experienced paralegals that heretofore had worked flawlessly.appellant pincay,on the other hand,stresses the degree of carelessness in the failure to read the applicable rule.
we recognize that a lawyer failure to read an applicable rule is one of the least compelling excuses that can be offered yet the nature of the contextual analysis and the balancing of the factors adopted in pioneer counsel against the creation of any rigid rule.rather,the decision whether to grant or deny an extension of time to file a notice of appeal should be entrusted to the discretion of the district court because the district court is in a better position than we are to evaluate factors such as whether the lawyer had otherwise been diligent,the propensity of the other side to capitalize on petty mistakes,the quality of representation of the lawyers in this litigation over its history,and the likelihood of injustice if the appeal was not allowed.had the district court declined to permit the filing of the notice,we would be hard pressed to find any rationale requiring us to reverse.
pioneer itself instructs courts to determine the issue of excusable neglect within the context of the particular case,a context with which the trial court is most familiar.any rationale suggesting that misinterpretation of an unambiguous rule can never be excusable neglect is,in our view,contrary to that instruction.t he right way,under pioneer,to decide cases involving ignorance of federal rules is with an elastic concept equitable in nature,not with a per se rule.pincay andrews,cir kleinfeld,dissenting.
we are also mindful that rule itself provides for leniency in limited circumstances.it could have been written more rigidly,allowing for no window of opportunity once the deadline was missed.many states rules provide for an extension of the time for filing a notice of appeal under few,if any,circumstances.see.providing f
