petitioner,richard harley greenway,was convicted and sentenced to death in for the murders of lili champagne and her daughter,mindy peters.after the arizona state courts denied greenway petition for relief,he filed a petition for federal habeas relief under,which the district court denied.on appeal,greenway is seeking relief on a number of different claims,but we affirm the denial of all except those relating to ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and on direct appeal.
greenway most colorful claim is that the trial judge should have been disqualified from hearing the case because the trial judge himself once briefly worked with the man who had been the husband of victims lili champagne and the father of mindy peters.the evidence greenway presented shows,at best,however,that the judge may have had a brief working relationship eighteen years before the trial,with the man who had,by the time of trial,been dead more than eleven years.we agree with the district court that there was no showing of any impropriety or appearance of impropriety.
we affirm the denial of the claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing because we conclude they lack merit.we agree with the district court that the state courts adequately considered all mitigating evidence in sentencing greenway to death,and therefore affirm denial of that claim as lacking merit as well.
the record with respect to the claims of ineffective assistance at trial and on appeal is procedurally complex,but we conclude those claims are not procedurally barred and remand for the district court to consider their merits.after the state trial court denied greenway initial petition,the supreme court of arizona declined to accept jurisdiction of greenway petition for special action to consider those claims,but it did so without prejudice to greenway filing a motion with the trial court for reconsideration.greenway then went back to the trial court to file the motion and to amend his initial petition to include additional claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and on direct appeal.the trial court,however,denied the motion and declined to consider these additional claims on the ground that they had been offered too late and were barred by waiver.the district court held this was an adequate and independent state ground justifying dismissal of the claims.the relevant state rule,rule a of the arizona rules of criminal procedure,however,provides for waiver of claims not raised in previous collateral proceedings.since greenway was still pursuing his first petition when,in accordance with the suggestion of the state supreme court,he sought to amend his first petition,there was no previous collateral proceeding.hence,there was no adequate and independent state ground supporting the trial court refusal to hear the claims of ineffective assistance at trial and on direct appeal.we therefore remand only those claims for consideration by the district court.
facts and procedural background 
a.the crimes 
the facts surrounding the murders of lili champagne and mindy peters are contained in the arizona supreme court opinion.state greenway.we summarize them here.
on march,pima county sheriffs found a burned porsche,which officials determined belonged to frank and lili champagne.a deputy went to inform the champagnes at their home and discovered the bodies of lili champagne and her daughter,mindy peters.lili had been shot once behind the knee and once between the eyes.mindy had been shot twice,once in the jaw and once behind the ear.id.at.
following a news bulletin asking for information regarding the victims or the porsche,greenway sister notified homicide detectives that greenway knew something about the incident.after detectives picked up greenway at his sister house,greenway told detectives that he had met a man named red at a eleven convenience store,and that red had given both greenway and his,chris lincoln,a ride in a white porsche.id.at.
the detectives then took greenway and lincoln to the police station for questioning.greenway and lincoln were questioned separately.lincoln confessed to stealing and burning the porsche,and he implicated greenway.during further questioning,lincoln confessed to participating in the killings and again implicated greenway.greenway and lincoln were then both arrested and charged with several counts,including the murders of lili and mindy.
greenway was placed in a cell with anthony schmanski.schmanski,according to his trial testimony,asked greenway why greenway was in jail,and greenway answered,well,i just blew two people away because they had seen my face.id.at.further investigation revealed that greenway had attempted to sell the victims car stereo to brian mize,greenway.according to mize trial testimony,greenway told mize that greenway went to the victims house and after taking some stuff from the house,greenway sent his out and then shot the victims.greenway told mize that,after he shot the older lady,her body rolled over and blood gushed out of her head.id.
there was also evidence that greenway knew the victims.he met mindy late in at a local jack in the box fast food restaurant,and met lili soon after,when greenway went to lili house to return mindy wallet.id.
trial and sentencing proceedings 
greenway was charged with two counts of first degree murder,one count of first degree burglary,one count of armed robbery,one count of theft by control,and one count of arson.prior to trial,the trial court ordered a mental examination of greenway.ronald david,a psychiatrist,interviewed greenway about his past history,his family background,drug use,the circumstances surrounding the crimes,and asked greenway questions in order to ascertain his mental status.david also asked harry saslow,a psychologist,to conduct a psychological evaluation of greenway.
greenway trial began on march,and judge william scholl presided.the guilt phase lasted only three days,and the jury returned a guilty verdict on all counts on march.in accordance with arizona law at the time,the trial judge made the life or death sentencing decision after an hearing.in this case,that hearing took place on may,and extended over a period.
the defense originally wanted to call david to testify at the sentencing hearing,because he was familiar with greenway mental deficiencies,social problems,and miserable family background.david,however,was also familiar with greenway admissions about how he committed the crimes,so the trial court ruled that if david were called,he could be on greenway incriminating statements.the defense therefore chose not to call david,and instead made a proffer that david would have testified that greenway was low,that he had an immature personality,that he was not a psychopath or sociopath,and that he could be rehabilitated.the defense actually called the other medical expert who had examined greenway,saslow,to testify along with the defense investigator and lay witnesses,including greenway mother,former,and childhood friend.
on june,judge scholl found one mitigating factor,greenway age,which was nineteen at the time of the crimes,and three statutory aggravating factors the murders were committed for pecuniary gain the murders were committed in a cruel,heinous,or depraved manner and the defendant had been convicted of another homicide,which was committed during the commission of each homicide offense.greenway,at.
the judge sentenced greenway to death on the two first degree murder counts.on direct appeal to the arizona supreme court,greenway challenged his convictions,the constitutionality of arizona death penalty statute,and his capital sentence.greenway could not bring any claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal,because in arizona,ineffective assistance of counsel claims should be raised in relief proceedings pursuant to rule,arizona rules of criminal procedure.lambright stewart,cir.
on december,the arizona supreme court affirmed greenway convictions and sentence.greenway,at.with respect to the death penalty,it concluded that the arizona death penalty statute was constitutional and the death sentence was imposed in a fair and impartial manner.after an independent review,it found that a death sentence was an appropriate punishment.id.at.
proceedings 
greenway filed his pro se preliminary petition for relief under rule of the arizona rules of criminal procedure rule petition in state court in august.judge scholl appointed counsel and ordered counsel to file an amended petition by february.counsel then filed a short,untimely petition raising only one issue of ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing,and greenway asked for a change of counsel that his attorney did not oppose.no further pleadings or proof were entered by counsel pending the change of counsel ruling.the trial judge,however,in january,summarily denied the petition in a minute order,without ruling on the request for change of counsel.the trial court subsequently granted greenway motion to proceed in propria persona and allowed him to file a motion for reconsideration.
in april,greenway,with new counsel,moved to vacate the denial of the inadequate petition,but the trial court denied that motion as well.greenway then filed a petition for special action with the arizona supreme court.although the arizona supreme court declined to accept jurisdiction of greenway petition,it stated that it did so without prejudice to greenway filing a motion with the trial court for reconsideration of the denial of relief.
before greenway filed a motion for reconsideration,his counsel learned through a juror that judge scholl,during the trial,had told a juror that when the judge was working for law enforcement,he had a colleague who had earlier been married to lili champagne and had fathered mindy peters.in december,greenway filed a motion to disqualify judge scholl,but in january,the motion was denied as moot because judge scholl was no longer on the bench.
the case was reassigned to a different judge in january.greenway then filed the motion with the trial court seeking reconsideration of its denial of his petition.the motion also sought leave to amend the initial petition to add additional facts to support his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing,additional claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at other stages of the litigation,including at trial and on direct appeal,and a claim of judicial bias.the new state court judge found greenway claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing precluded by arizona rule of criminal procedure a because they had already been raised and denied on the merits.the judge also concluded that greenway additional claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at other stages of the litigation were waived under rule a because they had not been raised when the initial petition was filed.the court denied the judicial bias claim as moot in light of the state supreme court independent review of the sentence.
greenway again petitioned the arizona supreme court to order the trial court to consider the amended petition.on october,the supreme court entered an order purporting to decline review of the state trial court denial of the motion for reconsideration,but also granting the request for leave to amend the petition.after sparring between the parties,however,in which each interpreted the order differently,the arizona supreme court,on january,vacated the portion of that order granting the request for leave to amend the petition.the court then amended its order to deny the requested relief in its entirety.
this habeas petition in federal district court followed in.in september,after a number of interim rulings,the district court eventually denied the petition.during much of the intervening period,proceedings were stayed while the district court awaited exhaustion of claims relating to the constitutionality of greenway death sentence.see ring arizona,holding unconstitutional the arizona statute allowing a trial judge,sitting without a jury,to impose the death penalty.in addition,during the interim period,the court decided atkins virginia,which held that executions of mentally retarded criminals violate the eighth amendment.greenway therefore filed a successive petition in state court alleging that he was entitled to a new sentencing under ring and that he was mentally retarded.
the united states supreme court in ruled that ring did not apply retroactively.schriro summerlin.with respect to the atkins claim,greenway expert eventually concluded in the state proceedings that greenway did not meet the criteria for mental retardation,thus paving the way for the district court to consider the remaining claims.
in its denial of greenway habeas petition,the district court dismissed as procedurally barred the claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during trial and on direct appeal.it held that the state court ruling that the claims were waived was an adequate and independent state ground supporting denial.it also dismissed,as barred,the claim that counsel failed to investigate and present mitigating evidence during the sentencing hearings.the district court dismissed on the merits greenway ineffective assistance of counsel claims relating to psychological evidence,and,also on the merits,dismissed greenway judicial bias claim.finally,the district court found that the arizona state courts properly considered all the mitigating evidence that was presented during the sentencing phase.
greenway timely appealed the district court denial of his habeas relief petition.on appeal,greenway asserts that the district court erred by not reaching the merits of his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and on direct appeal because he contends the procedural rule that the state court relied upon is not an independent or adequate bar to federal review.greenway also challenges the district court ruling that his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel relating to mitigating evidence was barred.as for his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel relating to psychological evidence,greenway contends the district court erred on the merits and that his counsel performance was deficient.lastly,greenway posits that the district court erred by denying greenway an evidentiary hearing on his judicial bias claim and by finding that the state courts properly considered and gave effect to mitigating evidence in sentencing greenway to death.
ii.discussion 
aedpa applicability 
because greenway filed his petition for writ of habeas corpus after april,the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa applies.lindh murphy.under aedpa,we may disturb the state court rulings only if they were contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the united states supreme court.d.on appeal,however,we review de novo the district court denial of a petition for habeas corpus relief.see scott schriro,cir.
ineffective assistance of counsel during trial and on direct appeal 
the district court concluded that all of greenway claims of ineffective assistance of counsel,both at trial and on direct appeal,were procedurally barred by arizona criminal procedure rule a,which the district court found was consistently and regularly followed in arizona and therefore constituted an independent and adequate ground upon which a procedural default may be found.
federal courts will not review a question of federal law decided by a state court if the decision of that court rests on a state law ground that is independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment.see coleman thompson.to constitute an independent and adequate state procedural ground creating a procedural bar to consideration of claims in the federal court,a state rule must be clear,consistently applied,and wellestablished at the time of a petitioner purported default.see scott,at.
the general arizona rule governing all procedural bars is rule,which provides 
preclusion.a petitioner will not be given relief under this rule based upon any ground 
still raisable on direct appeal under rule or on motion under rule 
finally adjudicated on the merits on appeal or in any previous collateral proceeding 
knowingly,voluntarily and intelligently not raised at trial,on appeal,or in any previous collateral proceeding.
pre emphasis added 
the state trial court and the district court relied upon rule a,which bars claims not raised in previous proceedings.the state trial court denied greenway attempts to reopen and amend the initial rule petition to include these ineffective assistance claims on the ground that the claims should have been brought in that petition when it was originally filed.yet,rule a does not provide that petitions as originally filed can not be amended.indeed,arizona has a procedural rule,rule d,which permits amendment of a rule petition even if the petition has already been dismissed.see scott,at.rule a expressly bars only claims not brought in a previous collateral proceeding.in this case,greenway was trying to amend his first petition,and there had been no earlier petition or collateral proceeding.we therefore conclude there was no previous collateral proceeding in which these claims should have been brought,because greenway first petition for relief remained in state court proceedings while he sought to include additional claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.
we trace the procedural history of this case to illustrate that petitioner did what he could,and,indeed,what the state supreme court effectively told him to do,in order to litigate the claims in the first petition.greenway,with new counsel,first moved to vacate the trial court denial of his original rule petition,and to obtain leave from the trial court to amend that petition.when that motion was denied,greenway filed a petition for special action with the arizona supreme court,asking that court to order the trial court to allow the filing of an amended petition.the arizona supreme court declined jurisdiction of the special action,but did so without prejudice to greenway seeking reconsideration of the denial of the petition before the state trial court,presumably in order to amend it.the state supreme court thus appeared to authorize greenway to seek relief in the trial court by amending his first and only rule petition.
greenway did go back to the trial court to seek reconsideration and leave to amend his first petition to include,among other claims,claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and on direct appeal.greenway argued that the counsel who filed his initial petition was ineffective because she missed one deadline after another,conducted no investigation to see if other meritorious claims could be raised,never met with greenway to discuss his case,and even directed a investigator to write the entire petition,to which counsel then made no additions or modifications.
as we recently recognized in scott,arizona rules specifically allow the filing of an amended petition upon a showing of good cause,even after the trial court has already dismissed that petition.at citing arizona rule of criminal procedure d.in this case,however,instead of determining whether greenway had good cause to amend his petition,the state trial court,citing rule a,denied those claims as procedurally barred because they had not been raised earlier.the state trial court thus failed to recognize the availability of the state procedural rule allowing the filing of an amended petition upon a showing of good cause.since arizona has a procedure for amending relief petitions,the dismissal of claims as barred under a different rule,rule a,can not constitute an independent and adequate state ground barring the district court consideration of these claims.
our opinion in scott is instructive and controlling in key respects.in scott,the original petition for relief from scott conviction and capital sentence raised a single issue of ineffective assistance at sentencing.scott,at.while this petition was pending,scott,like greenway,sought to replace his counsel.the trial court summarily denied the petition for relief in a minute order,without a hearing with respect to the request for new counsel,just as the trial court did in this case.see id.
scott then filed a motion to represent himself and the court appointed new counsel.with new counsel,scott,like greenway,then filed motions to vacate the denial of the petition and for leave to file an amended petition,arguing that his previous counsel had been ineffective.see id.at.the state court denied the motions.in an order remarkably similar to the trial court ruling on the ineffectiveness claims sought to be added in this case,the court said it had no authority under arizona rule of criminal procedure d to allow the filing of an amended petition because the motion to amend was filed after the original petition had been denied.id.at.scott then filed a petition for review with the arizona supreme court,which was summarily denied.see id.
the federal district court then dismissed scott subsequent federal habeas petition,just as the district court dismissed greenway claims,because it found that the state court denial of relief was based on an adequate and independent rule of state procedure.see id.
on appeal to this court,however,we reversed and remanded for a determination on the merits,holding that rule d was not an adequate bar to federal review because the rule was not clear,nor consistently applied in arizona.id.at.we reviewed its history and concluded it had never been consistently applied to bar postdismissal amendments to rule petitions.at least one arizona appellate court had interpreted rule d to allow the filing of an amended petition upon a showing of good cause,even if the trial court had already dismissed the original petition.id.at citing state rodriguez.indeed,we found that the arizona supreme court had subsequently followed rodriguez and issued orders allowing defendants upon a showing of good cause to file amended or supplemental petitions even after their first petitions had been denied.scott,at n.we therefore concluded that reliance on rule d was not an independent and adequate state ground that barred scott claims.
in this case,as in scott,the state court held that the new claims were brought too late without considering whether there was good cause to amend the petition.here,the state court relied on rule a to bar greenway claims,a provision that,on its face,applies only where there has been a prior proceeding.there was no such prior proceeding in greenway case,for greenway,like scott,was trying to amend his first petition after it had been dismissed.the state supreme court itself effectively told greenway to return to the trial court to seek amendment of his first petition when it declined to accept jurisdiction of his special action.therefore,rule a bar of claims not raised in an earlier petition can not constitute an adequate and independent ground sufficient to support a finding of procedural default,and particularly in light of rule d provision allowing for amendments to rule petitions.see also lambright stewart,cir holding rule a does not bar federal habeas review of claims not raised in direct appeal in light of another arizona rule prohibiting claims from being raised on direct appeal when they rely on evidence outside the record.
the state cites a number of cases in which we recognized reliance on rule a to have been an independent and adequate state ground for the state courts dismissal of claims.yet none of those cases involved an attempt to amend a first rule petition.in those cases,the petitioner had filed an earlier rule petition that had been conclusively ruled upon and become final.thus those petitioners were trying to bring new claims before the state court in a successive petition.in ortiz stewart,cir,for example,we held that additional claims raised for the first time in petitioner third petition were procedurally defaulted.in martinez villareal lewis,cir,we determined that claims were barred because they were raised in second and third petitions.
the state cites no case in which we concluded rule a to be an independent and adequate state ground barring claims sought to be raised in state court through amendment of a first petition.arizona has not consistently recognized any such bar,and its rules permit amendment.the district court erred in holding that rule a was an independent and adequate state ground that bars the consideration of greenway claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at the guilt phase of trial and on direct appeal.
greenway claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during trial and on direct appeal of the state court proceedings are therefore remanded to the district court for consideration on the merits.on remand,the district court should consider those claims de novo because there is no state court determination on the merits to which the district court can defer.scott,at stating that when a state court has not reached the merits of a properly raised issue,we must review it de novo quotation marks and citation omitted.
ineffective assistance at sentencing 
greenway claims with respect to ineffective assistance at sentencing raise two principal issues whether counsel adequately investigated and presented mitigating evidence,and whether counsel was ineffective in declining to call david to testify,and relying instead upon the testimony of saslow.because we conclude these claims lack merit,we affirm the district court dismissal of them.
failure to investigate and present mitigating evidence 
greenway argues that his trial counsel was ineffective at sentencing because he failed to investigate and present mitigating evidence.his federal habeas petition alleged that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to investigate greenway and his family background,including abuse,medical history,drug usage,chaotic upbringing,and learning disabilities.
the district court dismissed this claim for failure to exhaust,holding that it was never fairly presented to the state court.under aedpa,a federal habeas petitioner must exhaust his claims in state court before coming to federal court.b.a petitioner satisfies the exhaustion requirement by fully and fairly presenting each claim to the highest state court.scott,at.full and fair presentation requires the petitioner to provide the factual and legal basis for the claim to the state court.id.
the district court concluded that this claim was never fairly presented to the state court because greenway did not include the operative facts alleged in the habeas petition in his original state relief petition.what the district court did not adequately take into account,however,was that greenway motion to amend his first petition included these facts.that motion,filed after the state supreme court denied his petition for special action without prejudice to filing such a motion,sought to add allegations that included the following mitigating circumstances 
emotional abuse,physical abuse,possibility of sexual abuse,effects of drug usage on petitioner,effects of strict religious upbringing jehovah witness,chaotic childhood,why petitioner was on his own as a teenager,why petitioner lived with his sister rather than his parents,learning disabilities,sibling rivalries,why petitioner ran away at,history,effects of living in a draining ditch as a teenager,lack of paternal affection,psychological abuse by family members and friends,potential character disorders not diagnosed and therefore not treated,parental history 
the state trial court declined to consider these additional facts on the ground that it had already considered and dismissed,on the merits,greenway claim of ineffective assistance as to mitigation.in his petition for review to the arizona supreme court,greenway included in the appendix a copy of the amended relief petition he sought to file in the state trial court and requested the supreme court to allow the claims raised in the amended petition to proceed in the lower court.the supreme court denied his request.
we have held that this is enough to satisfy the fair presentation requirement.in scott,petitioner asked the arizona supreme court to allow the claims in his amended relief petition to proceed in the lower court and attached the amended petition,which included the operative facts and law,in the appendix.at.we held that petitioner exhausted those claims because the claims were fairly presented to the arizona supreme court.id.at.here,greenway claim of ineffective assistance of counsel relating to mitigation evidence was fairly presented to the arizona supreme court because greenway provided the factual and legal basis for the claim in his amended relief petition.the arizona supreme court knew exactly which claim greenway sought to present and chose to decline review of it.as we recognized in scott,a ll exhaustion requires is that the state courts have the opportunity to remedy an error,not that they actually took advantage of the opportunity.id.accordingly,we hold that greenway fairly presented his ineffective assistance of counsel claim relating to mitigating evidence and the district court therefore erred in holding the claim unexhausted.see also cone bell.when a state court refuses to readjudicate a claim on the ground that it has been previously determined,the court decision does not indicate that the claim has been procedurally defaulted.to the contrary,it provides strong evidence that the claim has already been given full consideration by the state courts and thus is ripe for federal adjudication.
we may nevertheless affirm the district court on any ground supported by the record.holley yarborough,cir.we therefore look at the merits of the claim,and we determine it should have been denied on the merits.
under supreme court precedent,to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,greenway must show that counsel performance was deficient and that the deficiency prejudiced the defense.strickland washington.the inquiry under strickland is highly deferential,and every effort must be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight,to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel challenged conduct,and to evaluate the conduct from counsel perspective at the time.id.at.
greenway claims that his trial counsel failed to investigate for mitigating evidence,including emotional,physical,and possibly sexual abuse drug use living in a drainage ditch strict religious upbringing chaotic childhood sibling rivalries lack of paternal affection learning disabilities and potential psychological disorders.all of the matters that greenway now claims were not investigated were,in fact,brought out at the hearings.there,his trial counsel presented a total of eight witnesses,including his mother,childhood friend,and saslow.greenway contends that the sentencing court did not hear testimony that greenway was raised in a very strict environment by his father who was an ardent jehovah witness and who beat greenway with a belt and later with his fists.greenway mother,however,testified that she and her husband were jehovah witnesses and that they made greenway go to church.additionally,his mother and his testified that greenway father beat him with a belt and later with his fists.
greenway mother also testified that greenway did not graduate from the seventh grade,he had problems in school,and he had learning disabilities.she acknowledged that she criticized greenway,and that greenway older brother ridiculed greenway.she recalled an occasion when greenway father and brother bought him baby food when he was.she also testified that greenway ran away from home and was living in a drainage ditch,and that greenway older brother was his father favorite.greenway testified that her parents abused her and greenway,but treated his older brother l ike he could do no wrong.she also testified that greenway did poorly in school and that he could not read.greenway childhood friend testified that greenway and his brother did not get along well,and that greenway told him that he received corporal punishment from his father.we therefore conclude that greenway counsel adequately investigated and presented mitigating evidence relating to his family background.
greenway also claims that his counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and develop on information obtained by the psychiatrist,david,which greenway alleges revealed tantalizing indications of mental health issues,physical and mental abuse,and past drug abuse.greenway,however,has never explained how such indications would have led to specific and material evidence.indeed,david himself noted in his interview worksheet that with regard to greenway mental status examination,greenway related well to the interviewer and spoke quietly with relatively good verbal skills throughout the interview although he was obviously anxious,it did not seem overwhelming or to interfere with his behavior or thought processes.furthermore,greenway was oriented,had a good recent and remote memory,and t here was no evidence of a gross psychotic thought disorder,but he did have difficulties explaining both on proverbs and similarities.
to satisfy any remaining doubts,david asked a psychologist,saslow,to conduct a psychological evaluation of greenway,because david felt that there may be some question with respect to greenway intellectual functioning and for the possibility of the presence of a learning disability.saslow subsequently interviewed greenway on two separate occasions,and conducted four psychological and intelligence tests on him.
at the hearing,saslow testified that greenway was a,which he characterized as borderline functioning.saslow stated that although the tests he performed did not indicate any sign of sociopathology,he described greenway mental functioning as akin to that of an or year old,which made him more prone to impulsiveness than someone who was mentally older.on crossexamination,saslow acknowledged that he was not suggesting that greenway suffered from any organic brain damage or that he was incapable of making judgments.saslow testimony thus developed the nature of greenway limitations.
in addition to presenting witnesses,defense counsel also prepared two sentencing memoranda arguing that greenway age and immaturity constituted statutory mitigating factors.his counsel further argued that greenway mental retardation,learning disability,remorse,prior good deeds,good behavior while in custody,lack of significant criminal history,lack of violent propensity,and potential for rehabilitation constituted additional mitigating factors.counsel pointed out that greenway was not raised in a supportive environment,noting that his mother mistook his learning disability for laziness and that his father and brother constantly belittled and criticized him.
the record shows that greenway counsel investigated and presented mitigating evidence at the state sentencing proceedings.his performance was not deficient.accordingly,we conclude that the state court denial of this claim was not an objectively unreasonable application of strickland.we therefore affirm the district court denial of this claim.
failure to call david to testify 
the district court denied on the merits greenway claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to call david to testify.we agree that counsel performance was not ineffective.greenway counsel initially intended to call david to testify at the sentencing hearing,and counsel asked the trial court to exclude incriminating statements greenway made to david about the murders.when the trial court declined to limit the of david,defense counsel decided not to call him.
this was a reasonable strategic decision.in his interview with david,greenway told david that he and his were discussing committing a burglary in the weeks leading up to the murders because they were out of work and needed money.greenway admitted that he shot the victims in the head.he also described the murders as a big adventure,and that he felt like he was the master.had david testified,the state would have crossexamined him about these inculpatory statements,and such testimony would have been highly prejudicial to the defense.our precedent has repeatedly recognized similar decisions as being a reasonable strategy.see wong belmontes,i t is necessary to consider all the relevant evidence that the jury would have had before it if defendant had pursued the different path not just the mitigation evidence defendant could have presented,but also the murder evidence that almost certainly would have come in with it.emphasis in original bonin calderon,cir stating that it was reasonable for defense counsel to forego expert testimony because it would have opened the door to precisely the type of crossexamination that defendant sought to avoid by refusing to call psychiatric experts.
moreover,david testimony would not have added much to greenway case.defense counsel proffered that,david would testify that in his opinion greenway had a low,that greenway had developed an immature personality,but that greenway did not fit within any kind of characterlogical sic disorder such as a psychopath or sociopath.he went on to say that david would agree with saslow that greenway was functioning at an or year old level,and would testify that greenway could be rehabilitated.thus,much of david potential testimony would have been cumulative of the testimony provided by saslow,while the drawbacks of calling david were substantial.defense counsel was therefore not ineffective by his strategic decision not to call david.see also raley ylst,cir holding that a strategic choice not to call an expert will not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel if that choice was reasonable under the circumstances.
failure to prepare saslow 
greenway contends that his trial counsel was ineffective by failing adequately to prepare saslow because counsel had not done enough background investigation.greenway claims counsel did not have sufficient background information to provide saslow before he testified.
yet greenway does not allege what specific facts or information counsel should have provided to saslow.saslow testimony related principally to his own testing and interviews of greenway.saslow testified that he was given the information garnered by the defense investigation concerning greenway background,but he testified that his conclusions concerning greenway mental status and mental functioning were predicated primarily on the psychological tests he performed.greenway has never alleged,much less demonstrated,what more counsel should have known or discovered.greenway cursory and vague claim can not support habeas relief.see james borg,cir conclusory allegations which are not supported by a statement of specific facts do not warrant habeas relief.
for the reasons stated,we conclude that the state court was not objectively unreasonable in denying greenway claims that his counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence,for failing to call david to testify at the sentencing hearing,and for failing properly to prepare saslow.we therefore affirm the district court denial of those claims.
judicial bias 
the claim of judicial bias came to light in december when counsel for greenway learned from an alternate juror that the trial judge,judge scholl,had mentioned his prior working relationship with vince peters,lili late husband and mindy father.as a result of this new information,greenway filed a motion for a change of judge and requested discovery in order to further investigate judge scholl ties to the victims.the new state court judge granted greenway discovery motion and ordered the tucson police department tpd to provide greenway with records about judge scholl and vince peters.
the tpd record demonstrates that scholl was employed by tucson police department from july until september.he was on military leave from october until march.vince peters was employed by tpd from april until july.the tpd record does not indicate whether or not judge scholl and vince peters worked together.however,the tpd discovery response states that the time period that they could have worked together would be limited to the period from march,when judge scholl return ed from military leave,to may,when vince peters transferred to narcotics.
at a status conference in august,greenway attorney stated that she spoke with judge scholl and judge scholl admitted that he knew vince peters but he did not have any recollection of lili.greenway attorney also claimed that she was in the process of contacting kurt jackson,a colleague of both judge scholl and peters.although the attorney was unable to reach jackson,her investigator
