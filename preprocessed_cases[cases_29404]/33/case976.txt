this case is before the court for review of the decision of the first district court of appeal in thompson state thompson ii,so d dca.the district court certified that its decision is in direct conflict with the decisions of the fourth district court of appeal in goines state,so d dca,and second district court of appeal in kleppinger state,so d dca.thompson ii,so d at.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.the question before this court concerns the appropriate standard for determining prejudice with regard to an ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on counsel failure to disqualify the presiding judge.we hold that the test set forth by the united states supreme court in strickland washington,d,is the proper standard for evaluating such claims,and we quash the decision of the first district in thompson ii.
below,we review the facts of this case and the conflict in the district courts.next,we discuss the ineffective assistance of counsel standard enunciated by the united states supreme court in strickland and addressed in lockhart fretwell,d.then,we explain our reliance on the strickland standard in evaluating a claim based on counsel failure to disqualify the presiding judge.finally,we apply the strickland standard to the facts of this case.
factual and procedural background 
melvin thompson was charged by information with sexual battery with a deadly weapon count i,burglary of a dwelling while armed count ii,aggravated assault with a deadly weapon count iii,and false imprisonment count iv.
prior to trial,thompson attorney filed a motion to withdraw as counsel.in support of this motion,the attorney asserted that thompson had orally threatened to physically harm counsel and his family.at a subsequent hearing on this motion thompson counsel stated that thompson had threatened,if convicted,to kill defense counsel,members of counsel family,anyone associated with his case,and then himself.thompson himself denied counsel assertions.the trial judge then asked counsel what charges thompson faced,and the following exchange took place 
greenberg defense counsel in the offenses are sexual battery with a deadly weapon,a life felony burglary of a dwelling while armed,a first degree punishable by life aggravated assault with a deadly weapon,a third degree felony and false imprisonment,a third degree felony.
the court okay.so if convicted in that case,he will be spending the rest of his life in prison 
greenberg perhaps if that what the guidelines call for.
the court with a first degree punishable by life,i do think we need to be worrying about the guidelines.so his threat is that when he gets out of prison,he going to make you pay for it and kill you and kill me and poitinger and murrell and the families and everybody.
the trial court then denied counsel motion to withdraw,explaining 
if there has been a threat made,the court concludes that it was a threat that could never be carried out.if he convicted,which was the condition of his threat,if he convicted,he will be in prison for the rest of his life and he could do physical harm to you or poitinger or murrell or me or anyone else.
subsequently,thompson counsel filed a motion to disqualify the trial judge which alleged,in part,that thompson feared that he would not receive a fair trial because the trial judge comments at the prior hearing indicate the court has determined the sentence to be imposed in this case prior to trial and indicate the court will not be inclined to consider any mitigating circumstances if the defendant is convicted of these offenses and is predisposed to sentence the defendant to the maximum possible sentence.the trial court denied this motion as untimely because the motion was filed some fourteen days after the earlier hearing,whereas the criminal rules provide that a motion for disqualification of a trial judge must be made within ten days after the discovery of the facts constituting the grounds for disqualification.
thereafter,thompson case proceeded to trial,and a jury found thompson guilty as charged of sexual battery with a deadly weapon count i,burglary of a dwelling with a specific finding of while armed and with a person assaulted count ii,aggravated assault with a deadly weapon count iii,and false imprisonment count iv.a presentence investigation report was prepared in anticipation of sentencing,and it contained a sentencing scoresheet that showed a permissible sentencing range of months to months in state prison.however,the trial court sentenced thompson to life imprisonment on count i and five years concurrent imprisonment on counts iii and iv.the court also sentenced thompson to life probation on count ii,to run consecutively with his prison sentences.
thompson appealed his convictions and sentences and asserted,among other claims,that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to timely file the motion for disqualification of the trial judge.however,the first district affirmed thompson convictions and sentences,without prejudice to appellant to file a timely motion for postconviction relief based upon ineffective assistance of trial counsel for failure to timely file appellant motion for disqualification of trial judge.thompson state thompson i,so d,dca.the first district observed that the motion to disqualify the trial judge was legally and facially sufficient to require disqualification and the trial judge would have been required to disqualify himself had it been timely filed.id.at.because the record was silent as to any possible reason for counsel tardiness and inconclusive as to any resulting prejudice,the first district determined that the issue of ineffectiveness could be best addressed in postconviction proceedings.id.at.the district court held that any postconviction proceedings on this issue should be conducted before a different trial judge.id.at.
thompson then filed an amended motion for postconviction relief which alleged that trial counsel was ineffective for not timely filing a legally sufficient motion to disqualify the trial and sentencing judge.after holding an evidentiary hearing,the postconviction court denied thompson motion for postconviction relief.
when thompson again appealed to the first district,the district court affirmed the denial of postconviction relief based upon thompson ineffective assistance of counsel claim.thompson ii,so d at.the first district noted its disagreement with the decisions of the second district in kleppinger and the fourth district in goines,which the first district characterized as requiring all ineffective assistance of counsel claims to be reviewed to determine whether the result of the proceeding was fundamentally unfair or unreliable,even when a defendant can not show that the result at trial or the sentence imposed would have been different.thompson ii,so d at 
in goines,the fourth district also addressed a postconviction claim based on defense counsel failure to disqualify the presiding judge.so d at.the court concluded that in the absence of a reasonable tactical decision not to do so,it constitutes ineffective assistance not to seek disqualification on the grounds revealed in this case,which plainly show a reasonable fear of judicial bias.id.at.the district court explained that the prejudice component of strickland is concerned with whether counsel deficient performance renders the result of the trial unreliable or the proceeding fundamentally unfair.goines,so d at quoting lockhart,at.the court rejected the state argument that in order to demonstrate prejudice under strickland the defendant was required to demonstrate that the outcome would have been different if counsel had secured disqualification and the proceedings were then presided over by another judge.goines,so d at.similarly,the second district in kleppinger rejected an standard for prejudice and held that t he finding of prejudice under strickland turns on whether disqualification would have been required,not on whether the outcome of a new trial would have been different.kleppinger,so d at citing goines,so d at.
strickland 
as recognized by the united states supreme court,the sixth amendment right to counsel exists in order to protect the fundamental right to a fair trial.strickland,at.a fair trial is defined as one in which evidence subject to adversarial testing is presented to an impartial tribunal for resolution of issues defined in advance of the proceeding.id.at.because the purpose of the right to effective assistance of counsel is to ensure a fair trial,t he benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial can not be relied on as having produced a just result.id.at.
in strickland,the united states supreme court established a standard for determining whether counsel provided ineffective assistance warranting postconviction relief 
a convicted defendant claim that counsel assistance was so defective as to require reversal of a conviction or death sentence has two components.first,the defendant must show that counsel performance was deficient.this requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment.second,the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.this requires showing that counsel errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial,a trial whose result is reliable.unless a defendant makes both showings,it can not be said that the conviction or death sentence resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable.
id.at.in defining the prejudice prong of the standard,the court stated that t he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.at.the court emphasized that the ultimate focus of the inquiry must be on the fundamental fairness of the proceeding whose result is being challenged.id.at.importantly,the court took care to explain that the prejudice component was not an test and there was no requirement to show that counsel deficiency actually altered the outcome of the case.id.at.the court explained that while i t is not enough for the defendant to show that the errors had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding,a defendant did not need to show that counsel deficient conduct more likely than not altered the outcome in the case.id.
in lockhart,a case relied upon by the fourth district in goines,the united states supreme court decided the issue of whether counsel failure to make an objection in a state capital sentencing objection that would have been supported by a decision which was later prejudice within the meaning of strickland.lockhart,at.the court held that it did not constitute prejudice,b ecause the result of the sentencing proceeding was rendered neither unreliable nor fundamentally unfair as a result of counsel failure to make the objection.id.after quoting from strickland,the court clarified that an analysis focusing solely on mere outcome determination,without attention to whether the result of the proceeding was fundamentally unfair or unreliable,is defective.lockhart,at.the court subsequently explained that its holding in lockhart denying relief did not modify or supplant the strickland analysis.see glover united states,d see also williams taylor,d cases such as nix whiteside,d,and lockhart fretwell,d,do not justify a departure from a straightforward application of strickland when the ineffectiveness of counsel does deprive the defendant of a substantive or procedural right to which the law entitles him.
adherence to strickland 
just as the united states supreme court continues to apply the traditional strickland analysis to claims of actual ineffective assistance of counsel,we,too,use strickland as the standard for evaluating such claims.see cottle state,so d,describing strickland as the primary guide for ineffective assistance claims.as we recently explained in carratelli state,so d,a defendant claim that his counsel offered ineffective assistance at trial,for whatever reason,must be analyzed under the standard the supreme court enunciated in strickland.carratelli,so d at.in that case,we addressed the standard that courts should apply in deciding whether counsel failure to preserve a challenge to a potential juror constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.id.at.we examined and compared the standards for demonstrating reversible error on appeal and demonstrating prejudice in the postconviction context.id.at.we noted that while the standard for obtaining a reversal upon the erroneous denial of a cause challenge was relatively lenient a defendant need only show that an objectionable juror sat on the jury,the standard for prejudice in postconviction claims was more restrictive.id.at.we found that applying the standard used on direct appeal in the postconviction context disregarded the fundamental differences between review on appeal and review on postconviction.see id.at.hence,we concluded that a postconviction claim must be evaluated under the more rigorous standard of strickland.see carratelli,so d at.
similarly,we reject thompson claim that a defendant is automatically entitled to postconviction relief simply by demonstrating that the denial of a motion for disqualification,if one had been properly filed by counsel,would have been reversed on appeal.under florida law,the legal sufficiency of a motion to disqualify depends on whether the facts alleged would place a reasonably prudent person in fear of not receiving a fair and impartial trial.livingston state,so d.the legal sufficiency of a motion is purely a question of law.mackenzie super kids bargain store,so d.when a trial court fails to act in accord with the law governing motions to disqualify,an appellate court will vacate a trial court judgment that flows from the error.see wisotsky,so d.
in contrast to this relatively low threshold for obtaining relief on appeal,a defendant claiming ineffective assistance of trial counsel in postconviction proceedings may only obtain relief by showing that counsel deficient performance actually prejudiced the defense.see strickland,at.thus,an error that may justify reversal on direct appeal will not necessarily support a collateral attack on a final judgment.witt state,so d,quoting united states addonizio,d.as in carratelli,we hold that the strickland standards for deficiency and prejudice apply to a postconviction claim predicated upon defense counsel failure to file a timely motion to disqualify a trial judge.
application of the strickland standard 
having confirmed that the strickland standard is the appropriate standard to analyze a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on counsel failure to timely act to disqualify the trial judge,we now apply the standard to the facts of this case.
first,to establish the deficiency prong of strickland,a defendant must show that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.at.we find that counsel failure to timely file the motion to disqualify constituted deficient performance.the first district expressly held in its initial opinion that the motion to disqualify was facially sufficient and that the judge would have been legally required to disqualify himself had the motion been timely filed.thompson i,so d at.florida law supports the district court previous conclusion.the florida rules of judicial administration provide for the disqualification of a judge on the ground that the party fears that he or she will not receive a fair trial or hearing because of specifically described prejudice or bias of the judge.jud.admin.d formerly.jud.admin.d.furthermore,the legal sufficiency of a motion to disqualify depends on whether the facts alleged would place a reasonably prudent person in fear of not receiving a fair and impartial trial.livingston,so d at.in particular,judicial comments revealing a determination to rule a particular way prior to hearing any evidence or argument have been found to be sufficient grounds for disqualification.see
