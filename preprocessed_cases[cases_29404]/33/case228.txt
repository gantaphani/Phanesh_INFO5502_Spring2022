we granted en banc review to decide an important constitutional question if so,under what criminal defense attorney renders deficient performance under strickland rubric by failing to preserve a argument in the hope that the supreme court will strike down the existing law while that defendant case is still pending on direct appeal.
but,because this particular defendant can not prevail on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in any event,inasmuch as he can not demonstrate the necessary prejudice,we find that we need not decide this broader constitutional question.see,pearson callahan,d citing the older,wiser judicial counsel not to pass on questions of constitutionality unless such adjudication is unavoidable quotation and editorial marks omitted united states elkins,cir courts should avoid unnecessary constitutional questions.bowman.valley,cir w e follow the longstanding practice of the supreme court in declining to decide questions of a constitutional nature unless absolutely necessary to a decision of the case.quotation marks and citation omitted tower realty city of east detroit,cir it is the duty of federal courts to avoid the unnecessary decision of the constitutional questions.
this defendant only claim of prejudice is that he was denied the benefit of booker change in the law that is,he missed the opportunity to be under a,advisory guidelines scheme.but,as it turns out,the only way this defendant could have obtained the benefit of booker change in the law was by petitioning the supreme court for certiorari,which he did not do this prejudice is therefore the direct and sole consequence of the failure to petition for certiorari.because defendants are not constitutionally entitled to the assistance of counsel in preparing petitions for certiorari,see ross moffitt,d,this defendant can not attribute this prejudice to any constitutionally deficient performance by his counsel.we must therefore affirm the district court judgment denying the defendant motion to vacate his sentence.
on april,a federal grand jury indicted carlton smith and thomas nichols,the appellant here,on and firearm charges.their joint trial began on may.ten days later may,the jury returned a guilty verdict and the court ordered a presentence investigation report psr.the district court sentenced each of them in october.
by the time of their sentencing,the supreme court decision in apprendi new jersey,d,had been of record for more than two years.in apprendi,a majority had held that,o ther than the fact of a prior conviction,any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.emphasis added.in addition,a different group of five justices the four dissenters and a concurring justice suggested,without so holding,that this principle could not be limited to the breach of statutory maximum sentences,but would necessarily extend to all schemes in which the length of a defendant sentence,even within the statutory range,turns on specific factual determinations,the f ederal sentencing guidelines.id.at,dissenting,joined by rehnquist,and kennedy and breyer,jj.id.at.thomas,concurring.thus,the combined opinions in apprendi cast some legitimate doubt on the future validity of the federal sentencing guidelines 
shortly after the apprendi decision,this circuit on september,considered and rejected an challenge to the federal sentencing guidelines,explaining 
appellant makes the novel argument that apprendi also should apply to federal sentencing guideline enhancements even where the statutory maximum is not exceeded,and that these enhancements are questions that should be decided by a jury,not a trial judge.the holding in apprendi,however,does not remove this discretion from a district judge,and therefore,appellant argument is without merit.
united states schulte,cir.by september,this same challenge had been raised and rebuffed several times,and our established rule was that it had no merit 
in this circuit,apprendi has been held to apply when the district court determined a fact that caused the defendant sentence to exceed a statutory maximum or,under some limited circumstances,that required a statutorily mandated minimum sentence,without a jury determining the fact beyond a reasonable doubt.apprendi has never been held to apply to every fact that increases the defendant sentence within the rubric of the federal sentencing g uidelines.
united states chapman,cir decided,emphasis added see also united states copeland,cir decided,noting that this court has held that apprendi does not remove the discretion of the district judge in determining sentencing enhancements,so,this argument is without merit such was the state of our case law at the time nichols counsel was preparing for the sentencing hearing.
on october,nichols counsel submitted a sentencing memorandum in which he raised numerous objections,both legal and factual,to the sentencing enhancements and calculations recommended in the psr,and also argued for a downward departure.notably,he did not cite apprendi or raise any argument.on october,counsel for smith filed his own objections to the psr and also moved for a downward departure 
on october,the district court held a sentencing hearing,during which it rejected nichols counsel arguments and adopted the psr recommended guidelines offense level of and a criminal history category of iv,which resulted in a guidelines range of months to life.the court imposed a sentence of months in prison for count one and months for count two to run concurrently with each other and with a separate sentence that nichols had received from the eastern district of tennessee.the court imposed an identical sentence on smith.
each defendant filed a notice of appeal that same day,october,and though nichols and smith proceeded with separate counsel,we consolidated the two appeals.smith raised several claims,challenging both his conviction and sentence,though he did not raise any challenge.see united states nichols.cir.nichols raised only one claim,challenging a jury instruction,and made no mention of apprendi.id.at.the panel heard argument on january,and filed its opinion on june,affirming the district court.
on june,two weeks after the panel filing of its opinion june,and one day before the expiration of fed.a period to seek rehearing of that decision june,the supreme court issued its decision in blakely washington,d,holding that the statutory maximum for apprendi purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.on july,smith attorney belatedly moved the panel to stay the mandate so that he could petition for rehearing on the basis of blakely,but the panel summarily denied the motion without explanation.nichols attorney did not move the panel to stay the mandate or move for any rehearing,and the mandate issued on july.
because the panel had entered judgment on june,nichols and smith had until september,days to petition the united states supreme court for certiorari.see.the time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari runs from the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to be reviewed,and not from the issuance date of the mandate.nichols counsel did not petition for certiorari,and,in fact,took no further action on nichols behalf.meanwhile,smith attorney did petition for certiorari on september,arguing that the sentence was improper because blakely should apply to the federal sentencing guidelines.
elsewhere,on july,the seventh circuit had applied blakely to invalidate the federal guidelines,see united states booker,cir,and by july,the government had petitioned for certiorari and expedited review.the supreme court granted certiorari on august,and heard argument on october.meanwhile,on august,we had issued an en banc decision,united states koch,cir,in which we held that blakely does not compel the conclusion that the federal sentencing guidelines violate the sixth amendment,and noted that the supreme court would be considering the issue in the coming months.on january,the court issued united states booker,d,in which it held that the mandatory guidelines did violate the sixth amendment.
in light of booker and the nature of smith claim,the supreme court granted smith petition for certiorari and remanded his case for resentencing.see smith united states,d.on remand,the district court sentenced him to months in prison which was nine months less than his original sentence.smith appealed and a panel of this court affirmed the new sentence.smith petitioned for certiorari and the supreme court denied his petition.
meanwhile,on march,nichols,acting pro se,filed a motion to vacate his conviction and sentence,asserting two claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.one claim pointed to his trial counsel failure to challenge the indictment and jury instruction,which,according to nichols,did not charge him with the necessary specific mens rea.the other claim pointed to his counsel failure to raise apprendi at sentencing and blakely on direct appeal in opposition to the sentencing court use of guidelines enhancements,premised on facts not found by the jury,to increase his sentence above the to range corresponding to the base offense level.recall,however,that at the time of his sentencing in october,this apprendi argument wa s without merit under the law of this circuit.see copeland,at.recall as well that the opinion disposing of nichols appeal had been of record for two weeks since june,by the time blakely was issued june,and,therefore,so far as blakely is concerned,nichols was really arguing that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing either to move the panel to reconsider the opinion or to petition the supreme court for certiorari.
the district court summarily denied nichols motion in a opinion,finding that b oth allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel are without merit.the district court explained that the first claim was without merit because a s pecific charge of mens rea is not required,warner zent,cir.the district court denied the second claim by explaining that nichols appeal was decided against him on june,united states booker was not decided until january,and t he sixth circuit decided in humphress united states,cir,that booker was not retroactive.therefore,nichols complaint regarding enhancements is also without merit.
nichols obtained a certificate of appealability coa on a single issue whether nichols was denied the effective assistance of counsel by his attorney failure to argue that it was improper to enhance his sentence based on facts that had not been proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.in his pro se brief to the panel,nichols actually raised three claims regarding the sentencing enhancements,arguing in his own words 
had nichols counsel raised the objections at sentencing under the principles set in jones,supra,and apprendi,supra,to the sentence enhancements and followed the objections up on direct appeal with supplemental objections under blakely,and certiorari to the supreme court,then a different outcome of the proceedings is shown,because just as carlton smith sentences were vacated,nichols sentences also would have been vacated.
the government responded with a brief,explaining that this circuit had already held,in united states burgess.cir,that the failure of an attorney to perceive or anticipate the supreme court decision in booker was not ineffective assistance of counsel.
in burgess,we had indeed rejected burgess pro se argument that,in september,his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to anticipate booker,based on apprendi and blakely,and correspondingly failing to argue that the mandatory nature of the federal sentencing guidelines was unconstitutional.judge clay,writing for a unanimous panel,explained 
burgess trial counsel can not be deemed constitutionally ineffective for failing to anticipate the supreme court june,holding in blakely the supreme court had not even agreed to hear the appeal in blakely until october,over a month after burgess sentencing.nor can counsel be deemed ineffective for lacking the additional prescience to anticipate that the eventual holding in blakely would lead to the supreme court january,decision in booker,particularly because the blakely opinion makes clear that it expresses no opinion on the continuing validity of the f ederal g uidelines.
id.at certain citations omitted.in his reply brief,nichols countered burgess by insisting that he was not arguing that his counsel should have anticipated booker counsel had but to raise the arguments and then even ignorantly reap the benefit of booker 
t he government keeps trying to keep this c ourt from noticing that the question before it is,if nichols counsel had raised objections at sentencing under apprendi and pursued them on direct appeal including certiorari to the supreme court under the principles set in blakely,then there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of these proceedings would have been different.
the panel accepted nichols argument and granted him relief,holding that he had indeed been denied his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel.nichols united states,cir,reh g en banc granted and opinion vacated.
the government moved for en banc review,claiming that the panel had committed error s of exceptional public importance.see sixth cir.c see also fed.a.we granted the motion,vacated the panel opinion,and ordered.whereas nichols was formerly pro se,he now has counsel who,in their supplemental en banc brief,have framed the appeal in terms of blakely and booker,rather than apprendi,to wit 
this case presents the issue of whether nichols counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to challenge united states sentencing guidelines enhancements based upon facts that had not been found by a jury,particularly at a time when countless other defendants had raised the issue in view of the supreme court decision in blakely washington,d,and,later,in view of the supreme court grant of certiorari in united states booker,d granting certiorari.
elsewhere in the brief,nichols en banc counsel argue 
b ecause nichols original trial and appellate counsel ignored the decision in blakely,the grant of certiorari in booker,and the actions taken by other lawyers involved in nichols codefendant virtually identical case,nichols counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.
consequently,the focus of the en banc argument is substantially different from what the panel considered,namely,that by failing to raise apprendi at sentencing,on direct appeal,and in a petition for certiorari,nichols counsel provided ineffective assistance.as if to emphasize their break from nichols former pro se theory,nichols new counsel offer this very frank concession 
had nichols conviction actually been final on june,before blakely was decided,this would be a different case.as discussed,however,many events after june,including the blakely decision,the lower courts holdings that blakely had invalidated the type of enhancements applied to nichols sentence,the supreme court grant of certiorari in booker,and smith sixth circuit and supreme court filings demonstrate the ineffectiveness of nichols lawyer for failing to raise the issue during the three months following the blakely decision.
the government counters that after june,nichols no longer had a constitutional right to counsel and,consequently,he had no constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel.therefore,none of the events that transpired after june,in the three months following the blakely decision,can render nichols counsel constitutionally ineffective.
nichols pro se arguments,together with these new arguments to the en banc court,identify a sentencing through direct which nichols claims he was repeatedly denied the effective assistance of counsel as guaranteed by the constitution.but,as we will explain,there exists a sharp line of demarcation on this continuum,before which a defendant has a constitutional right to counsel,and after which that same defendant does not.nichols can not prove ineffective assistance of counsel because he can not link the two pieces of the performance and the same side of the demarcation he can not show prejudice at any point at which he had a right to counsel,and he can not show a right to counsel and,hence,deficient performance at any point at which he could show prejudice.
the sixth amendment guarantees that at trial and on direct first tier appeal every criminal defendant will have access to a lawyer to assist with his or her defense.see halbert michigan,d.but,the constitution does not entitle a defendant to the assistance of counsel for a discretionary appeal,a petition for certiorari.ross,at.t his court has followed a consistent policy of denying applications for appointment of counsel by persons seeking to file jurisdictional statements or petitions for certiorari in this court.and,where there is no constitutional right to counsel there can be no deprivation of effective assistance,coleman thompson,d citation omitted,so the failure to file for such review can not amount to constitutionally ineffective assistance.see wainwright torna,d holding that because the defendant had no constitutional right to the assistance of counsel in pursuit of state supreme court certiorari,he could not be deprived of the effective assistance of counsel by his retained counsel failure to file the certiorari application timely.
at trial and on stages at which the defendant does have a constitutional right to constitutional right to counsel means the right to the effective assistance of counsel.mcmann richardson,d emphasis added.
but,the sixth amendment does not guarantee an excellent lawyer.it does not even guarantee a good lawyer.instead,the sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel entitles the criminal defendant to nothing more than a reasonably competent attorney whose performance falls within the wide range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.
moran trippett,table,wl,at cir citation and quotation marks omitted see also yarborough gentry,d noting that even if an omission of an issue is inadvertent,relief is not automatic because t he sixth amendment guarantees reasonable competence,not perfect advocacy judged with the benefit of hindsight.
an habeas petitioner seeking to convince a reviewing court that his or her counsel assistance was constitutionally ineffective must prove both prongs of a test 
first,the petitioner must show that counsel performance was deficient.this requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment.
second,the petitioner must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.this requires showing that counsel errors were so serious that those errors deprive d the petitioner of a fair trial,a trial whose result is reliable.
strickland washington,d paragraph break inserted.because the petitioner must satisfy both prongs,the inability to prove either one of the of which the reviewing court of any duty to consider the other.see id.at.
to demonstrate the first prong,the petitioner must point to specific errors in counsel performance,united states cronic,d,and the reviewing court must subject the allegations to rigorous scrutiny,determining whether,in light of all the circumstances,the identified acts or omissions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance,strickland,at.the court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct was reasonable and might be considered sound trial strategy.id.at.citation and quotation marks omitted.j udicial scrutiny of a counsel performance must be highly deferential and every effort must be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight,to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel challenged conduct,and to evaluate the conduct from counsel perspective at the time.bell cone,d citation and quotation and editorial marks omitted.
a petitioner demonstrates second showing that counsel errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial,a trial whose result is reliable.strickland,at.a reviewing court does not speculate whether a different strategy might have been more successful,but instead focuses on the question of whether counsel deficient performance renders the result of the trial unreliable or the proceeding fundamentally unfair.lockhart fretwell,d.unreliability or unfairness does not result unless the ineffectiveness of counsel deprive s the defendant of a substantive or procedural right to which the law entitles him.id.otherwise stated,the petitioner must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.williams taylor,d quotation marks omitted.
at the furthest point of his temporal continuum,nichols claims that his appellate counsel was,consequently,rendered ineffective he failed to petition the supreme court for certiorari after we affirmed his sentence on june.as mentioned earlier,nichols claims is,in fact,his only claim of the basis that he was denied the benefit of booker change in the law,under a,advisory guidelines scheme,a benefit he would have received had he petitioned for,with a pending petition for certiorari,his conviction would not have become final before the supreme court decided booker.see united states barnett,cir.so,it certainly appears that nichols can show prejudice on this claim,and the question is whether his counsel failure to petition for certiorari amounts to constitutionally deficient performance.
the simple answer is no.as the supreme court has made clear,the constitution does not entitle a criminal defendant to the assistance of counsel for the filing of a petition for certiorari,so counsel failure to file that petition can not amount to constitutionally ineffective assistance.see ross,at.torna,at.pennsylvania finley,d since respondent has no underlying constitutional right to appointed counsel in state proceedings,she has no constitutional right to insist on the anders procedures which were designed solely to protect that underlying constitutional right.because nichols had no right to the assistance of counsel for the filing of his petition for certiorari,if there was an error in failing to file that petition,we must attribute that error to nichols himself,not his counsel.bell,cir t here is no constitutional right to an attorney in collateral proceedings,so any errors of a attorney,acting as the agent for his client,are attributable solely to that client.citing coleman,at.see also pena united states,cir steele united states,cir.
nichols en banc counsel appear to have at least constitutional aspect of this claim,and appear instead to argue some type of general ineffectiveness 
although nichols claim does not depend on his having a right to counsel at the petition for certiorari stage t here is no question that nichols was entitled to effective counsel who would continue to represent him throughout the pendency of his appeal,including the time after the appeals court had issued its judgment.
nichols en banc counsel base this assertion on sixth circuit rules a g in which we have imposed certain obligations on counsel who appear in this counsel must continue representation on appeal until specifically relieved by this c ourt,id.at a,and losing appellate counsel must petition for certiorari,under certain circumstances,id.at g.
but nichols claims relief under,and a prisoner seeking relief under must allege as a basis for relief an error of constitutional magnitude a sentence imposed outside the statutory limits or an error of fact or law that was so fundamental as to render the entire proceeding invalid.pough united states,cir quotation marks omitted see also hill united states,d.nichols claims a constitutional error.therefore,absent a constitutional right,nichols has no claim.this circuit procedural rules,standing alone,do not create a constitutional right or impose a constitutional duty.even if we accept nichols claim that his counsel performed deficiently under our procedural rules,that performance would not be constitutionally deficient solely because of a failure to comply with our procedural rules.see steele,at see also chalk kuhlmann,cir.without a constitutional right to counsel,we do not even reach the question of deficiency under strickland.see miller keeney,cir.
we conclude that,because nichols had no constitutional right to counsel at the stage,he can not state a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel due to his counsel failure to petition for certiorari.the importance of this conclusion can not be overstated because the failure to petition for certiorari negates any prejudice that may have resulted from nichols trial or appellate counsels allegedly deficient performance.that is,nichols sole claim of prejudice hangs on his inability to receive the benefit of booker the benefit that smith did receive in the form of a and a sentence reduction,but nichols could only have received the benefit of booker if he had petitioned for certiorari,which he did not do.
nichols fares no better with his claims that his counsel were ineffective at the trial and appeal stages.regardless of whether those attorneys raised and preserved the apprendi or blakely arguments,nichols could not have benefited from booker subsequent change in the is,obtained a new sentencing hearing under a,advisory guidelines he petitioned the supreme court for certiorari,which he did not do.hence,the outcomes of the trial and appeal would have been the same whether or not nichols counsel performed as he contends they should have,see williams,at,and their alleged errors have not deprived him of any right to which the law entitles him,see lockhart,at.
finally,nichols en banc counsel emphasize that his appellate counsel was ineffective because he failed to move the panel for reconsideration or the court for a rehearing en banc 
m any events after issuance of the appellate opinion on june,including the blakely decision,the other federal courts holdings that blakely had invalidated the type of enhancements applied to nichols sentence,the supreme court grant of certiorari in booker,and smith sixth circuit motion for rehearing and supreme court petition for certiorari demonstrate the ineffectiveness of nichols lawyer for failing to raise the issue during the three months following the blakely decision.
nichols en banc counsel theory is that,even after the entry of judgment in his appeal june,his appellate counsel was still obligated to assist with further motions on appeal 
this possibility raises a series of questions is a motion for rehearing part of the appeal,a motion within the appeal,or is it a separate review does a defendant have a right to the assistance of counsel on a motion for rehearing of an appellate decision if so,is counsel obligated to file such a motion at the defendant request,or would some type of anders approach apply is counsel constitutionally obligated to file such a motion even absent a request by the defendant as nichols en banc counsel argue here and,if so,under what circumstances 
but we need not decide these questions because,as with counsel conduct at trial and on appeal,even if we were to assume that nichols original appellate counsel performed deficiently by failing to move this court for rehearing of nichols appeal in light of blakely,nichols can not show any resulting prejudice.as we made clear in koch,at,our view at that time was that blakely d id not compel the conclusion that the federal sentencing guidelines violate the sixth amendment.therefore,nichols can not show any probability that a rehearing petition,without something more,would have delayed the date of finality of his conviction for an additional three months or more,until the supreme court issued its decision in booker.
nichols himself,the original panel,and nichols en banc counsel have all taken the position that nichols situation is perfectly analogous to that of his former,carlton smith albeit smith did move for a rehearing on the basis of blakely and did petition the supreme court for certiorari.we denied smith motion for rehearing,which might well indicate that we would have denied nichols equivalent motion,had he filed one,but that is beside the point.the point is that although neither smith nor nichols actually had a rehearing before this court,smith still obtained the relief he petitioning the supreme court for certiorari.
the filing of a motion for rehearing before this court is not a prerequisite to the filing of a petition for certiorari,see.see also schiavo ex rel.schindler schiavo,cir a petition for rehearing or suggestion for rehearing en banc is not,of course,required before a petition for certiorari may be filed in the united states supreme court,and hence,the failure to file that motion had no effect on nichols ability to petition for certiorari.counsel failure to move for reconsideration or rehearing en banc did not prejudice nichols.to the extent that nichols suffered prejudice,that prejudice was the result of his failing to petition for certiorari,a failing he can not attribute to counsel.nichols can not demonstrate constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel and his motion to vacate his sentence must fail.
nichols has not shown that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to anticipate or foresee a change in the law and raise an challenge at sentencing or on direct appeal,for failing to move the appellate court for reconsideration on a claim in proceedings,or for failing to petition the supreme court for certiorari based on booker.for the reasons discussed in this opinion,we affirm the district court judgment.
in october,thomas albert nichols received a sentence of months of imprisonment under the united states sentencing guidelines.nichols guidelines range was enhanced based on facts found solely by the sentencing judge.even though,at the time of nichols sentencing,the constitutionality of the guidelines had been called into serious question by a majority of the justices in apprendi new jersey,d,nichols counsel made no apprendi objection before the sentencing court.even though,while nichols direct appeal was still pending,the supreme court granted certiorari in blakely washington,d,to determine whether apprendi applied to determinate statutory sentencing schemes,nichols counsel failed to raise any apprendi argument during nichols appeal.finally,even though nichols could have filed a timely petition for rehearing when the supreme court decided blakely,nichols counsel failed to file either a petition for rehearing in this court or a petition for certiorari.as a result of his counsel failure to make any argument at any point that nichols was sentenced in violation of the sixth amendment,nichols sentence became final before the supreme court held in united states booker,d,that increasing a defendant mandatory guidelines range based on facts violates the sixth amendment right to a jury trial.the attorney for nichols codefendant carlton smith,on the other hand,did file a petition for rehearing and a petition for certiorari in light of blakely,and smith sentence was reduced on remand.
nichols now argues that,based on apprendi,blakely,and the supreme court grant of certiorari in booker,his counsel should have raised sixth amendment challenges to the sentencing enhancements at various stages of his trial and appeal.because this case presents a unique combination of circumstances in which apprendi,followed by the supreme court grant of certiorari in blakely,cast the constitutionality of the guidelines into serious doubt,and where the enhancements to nichols guidelines range directly presented circumstances that were called into question by apprendi and blakely,i conclude that nichols counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to preserve a sixth amendment challenge to nichols sentence.
claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are analyzed under the familiar test set forth in strickland washington,d.first,the defendant must show that counsel performance was deficient.id.at.second,the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.id.
nichols argues that his counsel performed deficiently by failing to argue either at his sentencing or on appeal that the enhanc
