a federal jury in maine found that a lawyer and her law firm had simultaneously represented murray keatinge and another person with interests adverse to murray his son kent and then compounded the problem by suing murray on behalf of kent.for this breach of an attorney duty of loyalty and care,the jury awarded damages of.the defense of attorney elizabeth biddle and the firm of strout payson was that they had never represented murray keatinge rather,they had only represented kent they had represented kent in the exercise of the power of attorney granted by murray,in both the sale of murray house and the management of murray business.defendants contended that an attorney representation of the holder of a power of attorney can never establish an relationship with the grantor of that power.
the maine law court,in an answer to a question certified after the jury rendered this verdict,disposed of that contention by holding that the issue of the existence of an relationship is one of fact.there is no rule in maine that an attorney in such a position is never in an relationship with the grantor of the power and no rule that such an attorney is always in an relationship.estate of keatinge biddle,me.
on appeal the defendants now argue that the trial court earlier jury instruction,given without the benefit of the law court later opinion,was potentially misleading to the jury.we too have concerns about the instruction.but that gives the defendants no remedy they failed to preserve the issue as required by,they do not meet the plain error criteria,and we do not think a corrected jury instruction would have changed the outcome.defendants also argue that they were entitled to certain jury instructions which they did request but which were not given.the instructions requested would not have been appropriate on the facts of this case and were quite properly rejected.we affirm.
we take the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict,save for a neutral recitation of whether the plaintiff evidence warranted the instructions requested.see gray genlyte group,cir evidence offered by either side may be pertinent to assessing the appropriateness of jury instructions.
the story of this,son,and back in time.murray keatinge and elisabeth keatinge married and had a son,kent.during the marriage they acquired a house,greyrocks,in camden,maine in.two days before she died in,elisabeth made a will,naming her husband executor,and created the keatinge revocable trust with her husband.on her death,her half interest in greyrocks poured into the revocable trust.in turn,in,murray transferred elisabeth interest in greyrocks to a marital trust of which he was trustee.the marital trust,of which murray was the sole beneficiary,was set up under the revocable trust.there was also another trust under the revocable trust the family trust,whose sole beneficiary was kent.under the terms of the revocable trust,murray,as trustee,was obligated to fund the family trust in the amount of within six months of the death of the first of the grantors of the revocable trust,elisabeth.he did not do so.
it is undisputed that murray owned at least half of greyrocks.in any event,greyrocks was held by murray both individually and as trustee of the revocable trust marital trust.the jury could have concluded that murray was the sole owner of greyrocks.
murray also had a business,the norumbega bed and breakfast b b.as of at least early,half of the record title was held by murray personally and half was held by the revocable trust marital trust before late,kent had been involved in the management of the b 
in august,biddle brought an action in the maine probate court seeking to put murray and his assets into a guardianship and conservatorship.biddle had been retained to do so by kent,who said he was concerned about the oversight of his father health care and businesses after his father had multiple surgery.kent was appointed temporary guardian and conservator september.during that proceeding,biddle necessarily familiarized herself with murray assets.the purpose of the conservatorship was to protect the estate and assets of the allegedly incapacitated person,here murray,as well as to protect kent interest in his mother estate,administered by murray.ann.tit.murray,represented by different counsel,opposed kent petition for conservatorship on september.murray said he opposed appointment of either a guardian or conservator and that even if there were an emergency,he had given cecelia cole a health care power of attorney and his businesses were run by competent managers.he also said that kent had a conflict of interest which would render him inappropriate to be guardian or conservator and that kent temporary appointment should be terminated.indeed,kent,represented by attorney clark byam not at strout payson,had just threatened to sue to remove murray as a trustee of a family trust.in the fall of,kent had biddle withdraw the petition after a resolution was apparently worked out by agreement.on november,apparently as part of the agreement,murray appointed kent to be a of the revocable trust.biddle also asked that her firm fees for the work done on the conservatorship be paid out of murray estate 
pursuant to the resolution of the probate matter,biddle prepared a power of attorney for murray to execute,authorizing kent to exercise certain powers.this work apparently was also part of the fee application.murray executed the durable power of attorney on november.it gave kent full power and authority to conduct murray business and affairs.included among these was the power to borrow money,which kent ultimately did employ.kent authority under the power of attorney went beyond the powers he had previously held while helping to manage the b b.there are limits to a durable power of attorney.the holder is not entitled to use the grantor money or property for his own benefit or to make gifts to himself or others unless the power of attorney so specifies.id.b.this power of attorney did not give kent such authority.
that power of attorney was replaced on march,by a new durable power of attorney drafted by another lawyer.though broadly consistent with the old power of attorney,the new document provided much more detail regarding the scope of kent authority.it specifically empowered kent to use his father income and principal for murray support and to conduct murray estate planning in conformance with his father wishes.at the same time,it specifically forbade kent from making transfers to himself not necessary for his health,education,support,or maintenance receiving compensation for services rendered under the power of attorney or disregarding certain provisions of any living will or related document murray executed.murray also executed a simple will on march.
kent called murray lawyer,james elliott,who had drafted the new durable power of attorney and will and asked him to send both documents to biddle.on march,elliott sent them to biddle with a cover letter saying that murray wished only to have a simple will in effect while he gave thought to a more extensive estate plan.elliott also wrote that he assumed biddle would handle any further estate planning for murray and that she should advise him if that was not the case.biddle did not reply other than to acknowledge receipt.she did retain the originals of the second durable power of attorney and the will in her files.
using the first power of attorney,kent retained biddle to do work regarding the b b and greyrocks.that work was done from november to september.in march,biddle analyzed the financial situation of the b b in order to secure a line of credit for it from the gardner savings institution.the equity line of credit was to be secured by a third mortgage on both the b b and greyrocks.biddle worked on this project with james ayers,an accountant whom kent had hired in his capacity as holder of the power of attorney,to do work for the b b.it can be inferred that from the bank point of view,biddle work on the b b was being performed for murray,and not for kent in his own capacity.in early biddle also handled two employment questions and a liquor license issue for the b 
on may,the issue of the meant to be put into the family trust for kent benefit was apparently addressed when biddle proposed,by letter to murray lawyer,that the revocable trust execute a note and mortgage to the family trust for secured by a mortgage on greyrocks and the b b.the letter said she was acting for kent keatinge and asked that murray execute the note,mortgage,and an affidavit that he was represented by separate counsel.murray did so and his lawyer returned the documents on june.murray lawyer had earlier expressed to biddle his concerns about the facts that kent had been appointed while the conservatorship for murray was pending and that biddle had unofficially raised doubts about the marital trust.
in july biddle restructured the b b to transfer its ownership into a new subchapter s corporation,hammond,which she had incorporated.both murray and kent appear to have been shareholders of hammond.it also appears that biddle structured matters so that murray owned half of hammond in one of his capacities and kent,in some capacity,owned the other half.one of murray theories in the case was that this restructuring was not necessary for the management of the b b and was done in order to take away murray ownership interest.it was biddle intent that murray would transfer his ownership interest in the b b to hammond and that hammond would own the b 
indeed,in an august,memorandum,biddle concluded that all of elisabeth keatinge estate should have gone to the family trust and none to the marital trust.she also concluded that the transfer of elisabeth half interest to the marital trust was invalid.these conclusions were obviously contrary to murray interests.based on these conclusions,she named murray and the three trusts as the grantors of greyrocks in the warranty deed.she did not call to murray attention the issue on which there was conflict.
the bulk of plaintiff complaint dealt with biddle handling of the sale of greyrocks.greyrocks and norumbega were through gardner savings institution biddle had represented to the bank that murray would invest of the proceeds from greyrocks in the b biddle also told the bank that murray and kent are entitled to these proceeds from the sale of greyrocks in equal shares,but did not copy murray on the letter.a jury could find that murray had not authorized that representation or the transfer of the from the greyrocks proceeds.biddle also represented to the bank that murray needed some of the proceeds to pay for his retirement and capital gains taxes.
there is no dispute that murray owned at least half of greyrocks outright at the time of the sale.indeed,at the september,closing,biddle signed in the space for the seller signature as follows elizabeth biddle,for murray keatinge.she communicated with murray both before and after the sale.before the sale she sent him documents for him to sign and return to her.he did so.after the sale,biddle spoke with murray about the questioned her over the telephone about the closing statement and its legal fees and the accounting statement.murray asked for an itemized statement biddle never sent one.this was the only direct contact between biddle and murray.
there was reason for murray to be concerned about the bill.biddle had taken from the closing proceeds for her legal fees.but no more than of the legal fees were attributable to the closing.the discrepancy is not explained by work done for the b b that was billed separately.the bill did include fees for work directly against murray interests that is,work for legal research on whether murray had adequately funded a trust established for kent benefit,work going back to march.
the conflict of interests between kent and murray was made explicit by biddle in a september,letter to murray,after the closing.the letter said that biddle had represented kent since the guardianship proceedings the prior summer and that through this work and the sale of greyrocks biddle had become familiar with murray and elisabeth estate planning.murray,biddle wrote,had deprived kent of the benefits he should have received and kent wanted to resolve the outstanding financial issues between the two of them.
biddle,representing kent,sued murray in october in superior court in maine on claims that murray had failed as trustee to adequately fund a trust established for kent benefit.biddle used information against murray which she had obtained in the course of the prior representation.
that lawsuit was settled.as part of the settlement,murray gave up his ownership in hammond,which owned the b b some of murray other property was transferred to kent murray assumed any tax liability from the sale of greyrocks and murray and kent executed a mutual release.the lawsuit was apparently,for murray,the last straw which led to the federal litigation.the costs of that settlement and the attorneys fees paid to defend himself became a major component of murray damages claim in the federal litigation.
murray brought the federal litigation on october,under the court diversity jurisdiction.discovery was completed,including murray deposition,when murray died on august.his estate subsequently became the plaintiff.
the complaint based its legal malpractice claim on allegations that biddle did not disclose to murray her conflict of interest diverted for nefarious reasons proceeds from the greyrocks closing and failed adequately to represent murray interests ultimately,the jury would be instructed that if an relationship existed between murray and biddle,then there was a breach of biddle duties to murray.there is no question that there was a breach of the duty of loyalty and due care if an relationship existed between murray and biddle.there is also no claim about damages in this appeal.
the trial took four days.after deliberations,the jury returned a verdict finding that the defendants were in breach of their duties to murray and that the breach had caused murray in total damages.the jury also found that murray had not negligently caused his damages.
after the verdict,on a motion by defendants,the federal district court certified questions to the maine law court the law court replied 
in ordinary circumstances,when the holder of a power of attorney retains counsel to assist him in fulfilling his duties,the lawyer has an relationship with the holder only.in order to effectively exercise the powers granted to him,the holder of a power of attorney may often need to retain counsel.for example,the holder of a power of attorney is not authorized to appear pro se on behalf of the grantor.
thus,the mere retention of counsel by the holder does not by itself create an relationship between the attorney and the grantor.there must be some other agreement or arrangement to create the separate relationship between the attorney and the grantor.to hold otherwise would leave the attorney hired to represent the holder of a power of attorney in the untenable position of being subject to professional responsibilities and create the reality of conflicting loyalties.

the district court then rejected the motion for a new trial and for judgment as a matter of law,holding 
i instructed the jury that they could find an relationship only if they found,among other things,that the lawyer s knew or should have known that murray keatinge was relying upon them for legal counsel.on the evidence,the jury did not have to reach that conclusion,but it certainly could.among other things,murray keatinge had talked directly to attorney biddle about the size of her bill,and attorney biddle had direct correspondence with him in connection with a real estate closing.

on the question whether murray keatinge had an relationship with the lawyers,the plaintiff cecelia cole bears the burden of proof.to proceed,she must show each of the following three things by a preponderance of the evidence
