kern county superior court appeals the district court grant of kevin little little petition for habeas corpus relief from his criminal conviction for contempt imposed by judge romero moench of that court.kern county contends that the district court erred when it found insufficient evidence to support the conviction we affirm,but on different grounds.
factual and procedural background 
appellee kevin little represents terry adam doan and julie ann blind doan the doans in a number of cases in kern county,california.the doans are rather controversial figures in that community,and they are currently engaged in a civil rights action arising out of the alleged misconduct of two police officers of the city of taft.the doans allege that a taft officer sexually assaulted julie while she was in custody,and that along with his partner,the officer harassed her on a number of subsequent occasions.
the contempt charges arise out of little representation of the doans in their april nolo contendere pleas to misdemeanor child endangerment.little was substituted as counsel for the doans on the child endangerment case on march.the case was before the honorable romero moench,the presiding and only sitting judge in the kern county superior court,south division,taft branch.on the day the alleged contempt occurred,little was appearing before judge moench in a hearing to revoke the probation the doans received on account of their april plea to child endangerment.the revocation proceedings were initiated after the doans were arrested on a number of charges of violating their probation.
little filed his first motion to disqualify judge moench on march,pursuant to california code of civil procedure,and the motion was denied on may,
little filed a second motion to disqualify judge moench on january.this motion alleged that judge moench public statements that he was skeptical of those who claimed that the kern county criminal justice system was corrupt showed that he was biased against the doans judge james cloninger,of the superior court of ventura county,issued an order denying the motion approximately three months later the order stated that all but one of the allegations in this second motion had already been adjudicated in the first motion.judge cloninger found that the one remaining moench alleged bias on the basis of his public groundless.the order stated that little arguments were silly and that judge cloninger did not believe that the motion was filed in good faith.
little filed his third motion to disqualify judge moench approximately two weeks later.this motion alleged that little had obtained copies of scatological political satires that contained depictions of,and purported to criticize,the judge little asserted that he had knowledge that the doans were being investigated for disseminating the satires,and that judge moench must have known that the doans were thought to be responsible for their creation and distribution.therefore,little contended,judge moench would be unable to be fair to the doans,the people who had victimized him.little filed the motion with the clerk in the courtroom,as required by judge moench rules,and the clerk then handed it to the judge.the satires were attached to the motion and not sealed.
judge moench reviewed the motion and continued the proceedings for four days to allow little time to file additional information regarding when he received the material,in order that he might show that instead of being a dilatory tactic,the motion was filed in as timely a manner as possible.when the proceedings resumed,judge moench determined that the motion to disqualify would have to be heard by another judge and continued all other matters related to the case until after its resolution.for reasons the parties have not made clear to us,the motion was eventually reviewed by the kern county counsel who,in a memorandum dated approximately five months after the motion was filed,declared it to be frivolous and lacking foundation little withdrew the motion shortly thereafter.
on january,almost months after the withdrawal of the motion,little appeared before judge moench for the completion of the stayed probation revocation proceedings.at the end of the hearing,and without any prior notice,judge moench conducted a summary contempt proceeding,in which he found that,eight months earlier,little had committed direct contempt under california code of civil procedure a and a as the revocation proceedings were concluding,judge moench said to little,y ou still have some problems left with you.he then referred to little allegedly contemptuous conduct in filing the third disqualification motion and asked for confirmation that he was supposed to use a script to do this.thereafter judge moench went on for eight transcript pages describing little prior disqualification motions,and stating that the cartoons submitted by little in support of the latest motion were obscenities and offensive in the extreme.thereupon,he found little in contempt.only following the making of his contempt finding did judge moench ask if little had anything to say.when little responded briefly,stating that having been given no notice he could only respond in part to the charges by reasserting that his motion had been filed in good faith,judge moench entered the judgment of contempt and sentenced little to serve four days in jail and to pay a four hundred dollar fine little was immediately taken into custody and judge moench denied his request for bail,despite the fact that the statute provides for an automatic stay of any sentence against an attorney under this section.c.
little appeals through the state court system were unavailing,except for his obtaining of a stay order.both the california court of appeal and the california supreme court dismissed his habeas corpus petitions with denials 
little filed for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court the district judge found that the factual findings in the judgment of contempt were vague and that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate contempt beyond a reasonable doubt.accordingly,the district court held that little due process rights had been violated and granted the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
ii.standard of review 
because the state courts provided no reason for their denial of little habeas petition,we are required to perform an independent review of the record to determine whether those courts erred in their application of controlling federal law.see delgado lewis,cir see also van tran lindsey,cir.we must then determine whether any error was objectively unreasonable,and finally whether any such error had a substantial and injurious effect on the outcome of the proceeding.thomas hubbard,cir delgado,at.in determining whether a state court decision constituted an unreasonable application of the law,we must look primarily to supreme court cases.thomas,at quoting fisher roe,cir.
iii.due process analysis 
a.the requirements of notice and.clearly established supreme court precedent establishes that notice and hearing are required for delayed summary contempt proceedings.
among his arguments,little asserts that judge moench violated his due process rights by failing to give him specific notice of the contempt charges and the time of the hearing,and depriving him of a fair opportunity to be heard on the merits of the charges.we agree.in goss lopez,d,the supreme court held that,at a minimum,due process requires both notice and the right to be heard before any deprivation of life,liberty,or property by adjudication.id.at.quoting mullane central hanover trust.clearly established supreme court precedent specifically requires that notice be given of contempt proceedings,even in instances of direct contempt,when there is a delay between the time that the contempt occurred and the proceedings themselves.see united mine workers of america bagwell,d if a court delays punishing a direct contempt until the completion of trial,due process requires that the contemnor rights to notice and a hearing be respected.codispoti pennsylvania,d taylor hayes,d harris united states,d.
in taylor,at,the supreme court held that,although summary
