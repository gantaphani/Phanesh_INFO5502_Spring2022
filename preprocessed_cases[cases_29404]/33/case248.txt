background 
on march,officers of the taylor county,kentucky sheriff office went to osborne residence near campbellsville,kentucky after receiving information that marijuana was being grown there.when the officers knocked at the door,both of the osbornes were present and invited the officers into the home.smelling marijuana,the officers requested permission to search the residence,and osborne consented in writing.a search of the home revealed marijuana plants,several bags of processed marijuana,and various items of drug paraphernalia.the officers also discovered two rifles and a revolver in osborne bedroom.
following the search of osborne home,the officers proceeded to osborne residence and conducted a search of his home.during this search,the officers discovered an additional marijuana plants growing in osborne basement.during a later search of the residence of osborne mother,the officers found several other firearms.
in october,the grand jury returned an indictment charging the osbornes with conspiring to manufacture marijuana plants count aiding and abetting each other in the cultivation of the plants found at osborne residence count aiding and abetting each other in the cultivation of the plants found at osborne home count and aiding and abetting each other in the possession of grams of marijuana with intent to distribute it count.osborne was also charged with possession of the three firearms found at her residence count.
on october,the osbornes and a third defendant appeared before a magistrate judge.the magistrate judge informed all three defendants of their right to be represented by counsel.the magistrate judge instructed the defendants that if they could not afford counsel,an attorney would be appointed to represent them.the defendants told the magistrate judge that they all intended to be represented by the same attorney,danny butler.the magistrate judge expressed his concern about such an arrangement and informed the defendants that 
at some point in time you may need separate counsel simply because you may have a conflict of interest with respect to your various defenses in this case where it would be inappropriate for one attorney to represent the best interests of all three of you.

during the course of the proceedings,the magistrate judge continued to warn the defendants of the potential for a conflict of interest and encouraged them to discuss this problem with their attorney.the magistrate judge even addressed osborne directly on this point,stating a gain,be advised that there may be a conflict of interest involved.at.each time the magistrate judge broached the issue,however,he assured the defendants that any potential for conflict was something to be explored in the future when their attorney was present.
despite their statements during their initial appearance,the osbornes retained defense counsel thornton to represent them.at the osbornes arraignment,the magistrate judge asked thornton whether he had discussed with his clients the potential for a conflict of interest.thornton answered that he had engaged in a brief discussion with the osbornes about the matter.at.he further explained that although he not yet obtained a waiver from the osbornes,he would be happy to have them execute one.at.following this exchange,the magistrate judge then ordered that further proceedings be held prior to trial in order to obtain an execution of waiver of dual representation or appointment of separate counsel or retention of separate counsel,whichever is more appropriate.at.
further proceedings to address thornton joint representation of the osbornes were then held before the magistrate judge on november.at these proceedings thornton produced a waiver of dual representation signed by osborne.the executed document,entitled waiver of duel sic representation,states that 
malicia lyn taylor now osborne having reviewed said arraignment order and having being advised of her right to have separate counsel and having been instructed of same by the court as well,i,malicia lyn taylor now osborne,knowingly and voluntarily waive my right to have sep a rate counsel and understand that steven thornton is representing both me and my husband,james barry osborne and waive any conflict which may exist by appearance sic or in fact.
after thornton produced the executed waiver,the prosecutor informed the magistrate judge that he would soon file a motion challenging thornton dual representation of the osbornes.as a result,the magistrate judge appeared reluctant to accept osborne waiver,because the judge believed that the issue should be appropriately taken up by the trial judge.at.the magistrate judge decided that he would 
g o ahead and accept this waiver of dual representation being signed off on by both osborne in this case and osborne.again,of course,if the united states has some problem with that,i would suggest to the united states that it take it up with the trial judge by presentation of motion to the trial court in this case.
at emphasis added.
the magistrate judge then read the waiver aloud and questioned osborne as to whether he understood the content of the waiver that his defenses may be inconsistent with osborne defense and that he had a right to separate counsel which he was giving up by signing the waiver.after osborne acknowledged that he understood the significance of the waiver,the magistrate judge engaged in a dialogue with osborne 
the court osborne or taylor,malicia lyn taylor osborne,same questions to you.you signed off on the same kind of document 
defendant malicia taylor osborne yes,your honor,i understand.
the court do you understand your right to have separate counsel in this situation,and you at least for the present time are giving up that right,is that correct 
defendant malicia taylor osborne that correct,your honor.
the court this is your signature on this document 
defendant malicia taylor osborne yes,your honor.
at.at the conclusion of the proceedings the magistrate judge stated that he would accept the waiver for the time being but reiterated that government and defense counsel could take up whatever motions they believe are appropriate with the trial court in this situation.at.the magistrate judge then entered an order accepting osborne waiver.
less than a week after these proceedings,the government filed a motion in district court to disqualify thornton based upon a conflict of interest.the government was concerned that thornton joint representation of the osbornes might inhibit thornton performance during plea negotiations and trial based on the osbornes differing levels of culpability.the government alleged that it had discussed with thornton the possibility that either of the osbornes could obtain a lesser sentence by agreeing to cooperate with the government against the other.the government posited that,because the osbornes were represented by the same defense counsel,a serious conflict of interest would arise if either of the osbornes wished to cooperate with the government.despite the government concerns and the magistrate judge earlier assurances that the district court would address any potential conflict of interest,the district court summarily denied the motion as moot on the grounds that the magistrate judge had already conducted a hearing and had accepted each defendant waiver.
prior to trial,the osbornes both decided to accept a plea agreement from the government.pursuant to her plea agreement,osborne agreed to plead guilty to counts and of the indictment.in exchange,the government agreed to move for a dismissal of counts,and and to refrain from opposing a sentence reduction for acceptance of responsibility.the plea agreement also listed the penalties attached to each offense,most importantly that count carried a prison sentence of not less than five years.a change of plea hearing was then held where the magistrate judge questioned osborne to ensure that her guilty plea was knowing and voluntary.upon completion of this questioning,the magistrate judge recommended that the district court accept osborne guilty plea.the district court then accepted osborne guilty plea.
at sentencing,thornton moved for downward departure,asserting that osborne should be sentenced based on the sentencing guidelines recommendations and not pursuant to count sentence.the district court concluded,however,that it lacked the authority under the circumstances to impose a sentence below the statutory.osborne was then sentenced to five years of imprisonment on count and five years on count,with the sentences to be served concurrently.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
the district court legal conclusions that no conflict of interest existed and that osborne guilty plea was constitutionally valid are reviewed de novo.united states jackson,cir united states walker,cir.the underlying factual bases upon which the district court conclusions rest are reviewed for clear error.jackson,at.
osborne did not allege in district court that her defense counsel possessed a conflict of interest which violated her sixth amendment rights.on the contrary,it was the prosecutor who sought to disqualify thornton based on his concern that a serious potential conflict of interest existed.this factual scenario may suggest that osborne failed properly to preserve this issue in district court and thus may only prevail on appeal if the conflict of interest represents a plain error.see united states olano,d.the standard is inapplicable in this case,however,based on the legal distinction the supreme court has created between forfeiture and waiver.whereas forfeiture is the failure to make the timely assertion of a right,waiver is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.id.at.quoting johnson zerbst.the standard applies only when the defendant has forfeited a right,not when the defendant has waived that right.
the standard is inapplicable under the circumstances of this case.osborne did not forfeit her sixth amendment rights by failing to assert them in district court.instead when the issue was raised,she executed a document which purported to waive her right to counsel.therefore,we do not consider whether the district court committed plain error in determining that no conflict of interest exists.instead,we must ask whether osborne waiver was knowing,intelligent,and voluntary.united states straughter,cir.if the waiver was properly executed in district court,we may not address osborne claim that a conflict of interest makes her guilty plea invalid.if,however,the waiver is unknowing or involuntary as osborne asserts,then we may consider whether her conviction should be reversed.
federal rule of criminal procedure c dictates the proper procedure for a district court to follow where joint representation of creates a potential for a conflict of interest.the rule requires that t he court must promptly inquire about the propriety of joint representation and must personally advise each defendant of the right to the effective assistance of counsel,including separate representation.c.then,u nless there is good cause to believe that no conflict of interest is likely to arise,the court must take appropriate measures to protect each defendant right to counsel.id.appropriate measures include obtaining a waiver of the right to counsel from the defendant.c advisory committee notes amendment.
if a court decides to remedy any concerns over a potential conflict of interest by obtaining a waiver from the codefendants,then rule and its advisory notes dictate the type of waiver which the court should secure.primarily,the court must be convinced that the defendants understand the rights being waived and the consequences of the waiver of those rights.c advisory committee notes amendment.the court must personally address each defendant and inform him or her of the potential hazards of representation by a single attorney,as well as his or her right to separate representation.id.the court must assure itself that the defendants understand the nature and consequences of joint representation.
most significantly,the court should seek to elicit a narrative response from each defendant that he has been advised of his right to effective representation,that he understands the details of his attorney possible conflict of interest and the potential perils of such a conflict,that he has discussed the matter with his attorney or if he wishes with outside counsel,and that he voluntarily waives his sixth amendment protections.
c advisory committee notes amendment citation omitted.
the rule c hearing conducted in this case failed to comport with the rule requirements in several respects.first,the osbornes were never informed of the particular types of conflict of interest which might arise from joint representation in their case.the waiver document executed by osborne merely stated that she agreed to waive any conflict which may exist.at.the waiver document did not inform osborne of the types of potential hazards which joint representation could create.similarly,the magistrate judge failed to explain the risk that thornton representation of both spouses might present.the only explanation provided by the magistrate judge was that there may be a conflict of interest with respect to your various defenses.at.at no time did the magistrate judge inform osborne that joint representation could limit her ability to obtain a favorable plea agreement or result in a lengthier sentence.osborne was provided inadequate information as to the nature of the right she was purportedly waiving and the potential consequences of that waiver.
we have no means of knowing whether osborne was provided with information regarding the nature of her rights by thornton prior to her signing the waiver.the magistrate judge failed to question osborne as to whether she had been fully informed by thornton of the potential concerns raised by his joint representation of the osbornes.instead,the magistrate judge merely verified that osborne had signed the submitted waiver and understood its contents.the magistrate judge should have investigated further to confirm by means of a narrative response that osborne understood the details of her attorney possible conflict of interest and the potential perils of such a conflict.c advisory committee notes amendment.
most troubling,however,is that the hearing left ambiguity as to whether the magistrate judge accepted the waiver only provisionally.the magistrate judge stated during the hearing that he would accept the waiver for the time being,but that the determination should be made by the district court.at emphasis added.these statements suggest that the rule c hearing did not result in a conclusive waiver of osborne right to counsel.this ambiguity was then compounded by the district court failure to address the potential conflict of interest despite the magistrate judge earlier assurances that the issue would be resolved by the district court.additionally,the district court erred in denying the government motion for disqualification as moot because the district court had an ongoing obligation to monitor and address potential conflicts as they arose.see.c advisory committee notes amendment united states salado,cir noting that the obligation placed upon the court by rule c is a continuing one quotation marks and citation omitted united states solomon,cir,cert.denied,d t he mere fact that a rule c inquiry was conducted in the early stages of the case does not relieve the court of all responsibility in this regard thereafter.quotation marks and citation omitted.
based on these critical flaws,we must question the validity of
