james charles poe iii was convicted of conspiracy to possess counterfeit checks and of possession of implements for making counterfeit checks,in violation of a,b.poe contends his conviction must be vacated because the district court permitted a codefendant,kendrick bankhead,to testify against poe despite an alleged conflict of interest of bankhead defense counsel,who had represented poe in an unrelated state criminal case six years before this case.agreeing with the district court that no conflict of interest harmed poe,we affirm.
on march,a federal grand jury indicted bankhead and mario thurman for conspiracy to make and possess counterfeit checks.the indictment also listed two counterfeiting counts against bankhead and seven counterfeiting counts against thurman.attorney john stratford represented bankhead.with stratford assistance,bankhead entered into a plea agreement with the government on may.under the plea agreement,bankhead agreed to plead guilty to the conspiracy charge in exchange for the dismissal of the other two counts.bankhead also agreed to testify as a government witness as needed.on june,bankhead pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge on august,the district court entered judgment against bankhead and sentenced him to months imprisonment.
on may,the grand jury issued a superseding indictment,adding poe as a member of the conspiracy to make and possess counterfeit checks.the superseding indictment also charged poe with possession of implements for making counterfeit checks.on july,poe made his initial appearance.herbert wright was appointed to represent poe,but the relationship deteriorated and wright moved to withdraw from the representation.
on november,the district court held a hearing on wright motion to withdraw.before the hearing,stratford notified the government that he had represented poe in a state criminal case years before he began his representation of bankhead in this case.at the beginning of the hearing and at the government urging,the district court addressed the potential conflict of interest involved in stratford representation of bankhead,poe codefendant in this case.stratford informed the court that he had represented poe six or seven years ago in a state court forgery case that pretty unrelated to this type of case.tr.of hearing at.stratford added,i do really know anything that would have hurt poe.id.at.when asked when he began his representation of bankhead,stratford replied,s ix,seven,eight months,i think,before poe was even indicted.id.at.based on this information,the district court stated that stratford had absolutely no conflict for quite some time,because he was representing bankhead when poe was not even a part of this case.id.at.the district court then asked stratford whether he was going to have anything more to do with this case now that we already sentenced your client,bankhead.id.at.stratford responded,no.id.at.
when asked about objections,wright replied,i ca form any objection of stratford it appears that his involvement bankhead was resolved prior to my client,poe,coming into the picture and as long as he not going to be providing any information on his previous representation of poe to the united states,i see no problem.id.at.recognizing that stratford prior representation of poe,his current representation of bankhead,and poe late addition to the conspiracy charge created an awkward situation,the district court nonetheless concluded there was no problem because of the time involved and because the offenses are apparently not connected.id.at.after the hearing,the district court granted wright motion to withdraw.
jeffrey rosenzweig was then appointed to represent poe.from may to,poe charges were tried to a jury.on may,rosenzweig contended stratford prior representation of poe resulted in a conflict of interest when stratford negotiated a plea agreement for bankhead in this case.rosenzweig argued that the proper remedy for the conflict of interest was to prohibit bankhead from testifying against poe.rosenzweig presented evidence that poe,while represented by stratford,pled nolo contendere in the state court case on april.the district court once again held that no conflict of interest prohibited bankhead from testifying against poe,explaining that poe state court conviction was six years earlier and none of the parties involved in that case other than poe were involved in this case.the court allowed rosenzweig to question stratford,however,to determine whether his prior representation of poe benefitted bankhead in this case.
the district court particularly was concerned with admitting evidence against poe that arose out of stratford representation of him in.see.b discussing the admissibility of evidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts.thus,stratford was asked whether he had discussed with bankhead anything from poe case.stratford responded,no.and really the only thing i remember about poe case is that he came to me later trying to get his record expunged,which made me think even more that he was going to get in any more trouble.trial tr.at may.
the district court then explained that at the time of the november hearing,the court had been focused only on the fact that bankhead had already been found guilty and sentenced.the court admitted that it was not then focused on bankhead introducing rule b evidence about poe conviction while being represented by stratford.although the district court still concluded that no actual conflict of interest existed,the court stated it was inclined to require the government to withdraw the rule b evidence or not to allow bankhead to testify against poe it seems to me that if stratford client,bankhead,is testifying against poe in this case,and also the government is using against poe a conviction of record in which stratford represented poe,that just might be too much.id.at.stratford again was asked whether he provided bankhead with any information from his representation of poe that could be used in this case.stratford responded that he absolutely had no such information.
later that afternoon,the government asked to revisit the issue of bankhead testimony against poe.the district court noticeably was concerned that stratford is put in an awkward position of having his client bankhead testify against former client poe,and at the same time former client poe conviction at the time of stratford representation is in evidence.id.at.arguing that stratford testified he gave no privileged information to the government or to bankhead,the government asked the district court to allow bankhead to testify that he gave counterfeit checks to certain individuals including poe.refusing to decide the issue at the time,the court asked counsel to return the next morning with authority on the issue,noting,i do have any authority on this conflict.id.at.
the next day,the district court allowed the government to call bankhead as a witness,but only allowed him to testify that he supplied poe with counterfeit checks in.the jury heard no evidence about poe state court conviction.but the jury heard evidence about the conduct underlying the state court conviction,because the government introduced evidence regarding a federal conviction poe had in arising out of the same conduct.stratford did not represent poe in the federal case.
the jury convicted poe of both counts.on december,the district court sentenced poe to concurrent sentences of sixty months imprisonment on the conspiracy charge and months imprisonment on the possession charge.on appeal,poe contends his conviction must be vacated because the district court erroneously allowed bankhead to testify against poe despite stratford conflict of interest in representing bankhead.
recognizing this case presents an unusual variation on the issue of attorney conflict of interest and the ramifications which derive from the conflict,poe asserts that the relevant legal questions are whether there is an actionable conflict of interest and whether poe was prejudiced by the presentation of bankhead testimony in this format.poe brief at.to answer these questions in the affirmative,poe invokes the sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of
