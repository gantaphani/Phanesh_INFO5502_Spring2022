the louisiana state board of dentistry,a civil administrative board,sustained charges against doctor randall mark schaffer,a practicing dentist,revoking his dental license and assessing the costs of the proceeding.although by statute the board could assess a fine in addition to costs,it declined to do so.a parish court adopted the board decision and entered a judgment against the dentist for the costs,who then filed for bankruptcy.the bankruptcy court held the costs to be nondischargeable,and the district court affirmed.
in,the louisiana state board of dentistry brought a disciplinary action against randall mark schaffer,a licensed dentist.ann.a then authorized the board to appoint an examining committee to hear charges against a dentist,dental hygienist,or unlicensed person practicing in the dental profession,and.ann,authorized assessment of costs against the dentist or hygienist charged in the proceeding.the latter statute had two paragraphs,both referring to the same costs.ann.provided,
should the committee after due hearing find that the charges filed against the licensee or the unlicensed person are sustained by the evidence,it may revoke,suspend,restrict,fine,place on probation,reprimand,or admonish,or any or all of the above,the licensed dentist or licensed dental hygienist.the board may levy an administrative fine and assess all costs of the committee,including but not limited to attorney fees,investigative fees,and stenographic costs against the unlicensed person,and may seek any and all equitable and injunctive relief allowable under the law 
section provided,
the fine shall not be less than five hundred dollars nor more than five thousand dollars for each offense.in addition,the unlicensed person,the licensed dentist,or licensed dental hygienist shall pay,not later than the thirtieth day after the day the decision is made by the committee,all costs of the committee proceedings,including but not limited to stenographer fees,attorney fees,investigative fees and expenses,and witness fees and expenses,and the per diem and expenses of the committee members.if,for any reason,the money portion of the committee decision is not paid within thirty days,then legal interest shall be charged and added thereto as calculated in civil code article b,until said sum is paid in full 
following committee proceedings against schaffer,the board found that schaffer had,inter alia,defrauded and deceived the public,acted contrary to prevailing acceptable dental standards,and exhibited dental incompetence.the board issued a revised decision revoking schaffer license and assessing against schaffer the costs of the proceedings,a total of.it did not impose an administrative fine as defined by it did use the word fine in one portion of its decision,but that term referred to the assessed costs of the proceeding and not a fine as used in the statute.the board required that 
schaffer pay,not later than the thirtieth day after the decision is made by the committee,all costs of the committee proceedings,including,but not limited to,stenographer fees,attorneys fees,investigative fees and expenses,and witness fees and expenses and the per diem and expenses of the committee members.if,for any reason,the money portion of the committee decision is not paid by the respondent within thirty days,legal interest shall be charged and added to the money portion as calculated in civil code article b,which interest shall accrue until the sum is paid in full.additionally,if respondent fails for any reason,including bankruptcy,to pay the entire amounts within thirty days of this decision becoming final,the board shall not consider any reapplication for license by schaffer for the period that the fine remains unpaid.
the board hearing committee issued a revised opinion revoking schaffer license and ordering him to pay for the expenses of the proceeding.the judicial district court for the parish of jefferson incorporated the decision into its judgment,rendering the costs executory,and also ordered payment of future costs for interest that accrued from september.in august of,schaffer filed for chapter bankruptcy and named the board as a creditor.after schaffer filed for bankruptcy and the board brought an adversary proceeding,the bankruptcy court granted schaffer a discharge and closed the main case.the board and schaffer then filed for summary judgment to determine the dischargeability of schaffer debt to the board.the bankruptcy court denied schaffer motion and granted the board motion.that court held the costs nondischargeable pursuant to a,rendering a debt nondischargeable 
to the extent such debt is for a fine,penalty,or forfeiture payable to and for the benefit of a governmental unit,and is not compensation for actual pecuniary loss,other than a tax penalty 
a relating to a tax of a kind not specified in paragraph of this subsection or 
b imposed with respect to a transaction or event that occurred before three years before the date of the filing of the petition.
schaffer appealed to the district court.the district court affirmed 
in reviewing cases originating in bankruptcy,we perform the same function,as did the district court fact findings of the bankruptcy court are reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard and issues of law are reviewed de novo.a debt is not dischargeable in bankruptcy when the debt is owed to a governmental unit is a fine,penalty,or forfeiture and is not compensation for actual pecuniary loss.whether the costs that the board assessed against schaffer are dischargeable presents a mixed question of fact and law that we review de novo.the parties agree that debt is owed to a government unit they dispute whether the costs are a fine,penalty,or forfeiture,or actual compensation for pecuniary loss.
schaffer argues that instead of assessing a fine,the board revoked schaffer license and assessed costs.the board argues that although the costs are not a fine,they are a penalty because the board has discretion to assess costs only on a finding of guilty in the administrative proceeding.in other words,the three measures available to the board that arise from a finding of wrongdoing are all part of the penalty that the board could have assessed against schaffer.the board argues that while it chose only two measures of the costs and license costs are punitive.at oral argument,the board cited to our holding in in re hickman that the word penalty is an elastic term and that c entral to the definition of penalty is punishment imposed on a wrongdoer.
the district court,in examining the true nature of the debt incurred by the board assessment of costs,held that the 
board assessed costs against schaffer because of his misconduct wrongdoing.as such,the assessed costs constitute a penalty for wrongdoing,rather than the type of debt resulting from a typical relationship because the board did not extend credit to schaffer.further,while the assessed costs may result in reimbursement to the board for expenses incurred,it can not be said,after reading the board revised decision,that compensation was the primary objective of the board.
we first look to the text of the statute and then to the purpose of the costs assessed.because a is ambiguous we must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence,but by the provisions of the whole law,and to its object and policy.
under the text of the statute,the costs assessed are not a fine,penalty,or forfeiture.the statute provides,in addition to the power and duties granted in subparagraph a of this paragraph,the board may,in its discretion,impose a fine against any person licensed under this chapter.the statute also plainly separates assessment of costs from a punitive fine by permitting the board to levy an administrative fine and assess all costs of the committee.the board chose to do the latter by assessing costs.the district court recognized this in finding that the committee did not assess a fine against schaffer within the meaning of.ann.b,but concluded that its purpose was to assess a punitive fine.
although the statute only permits assessment of costs if the board charges against a dentist are sustained,it does not follow that the costs are a penalty under.even where a debt bears a label that fits within a definition of dischargeable debts,we have looked to the nature and purpose of the debt and declined to declare it nondischargeable.in hickman,a bail bondswoman filed for bankruptcy when she could not pay the bonds entered against her by the court for defendants failure to that were labeled as forfeiture debt.we held that the debt did not fall under definition of nondischargeable debt,stating,
construing forfeiture in light of the accompanying terms in a,a as a whole,and the basic policy and object of the bankruptcy code,we hold that a excludes from discharge only those forfeitures imposed because of misconduct or wrongdoing by the debtor.hickman debt arising from her failure to fulfill her contractual obligation to the state as a surety on a criminal bail bond is not the sort of punitive or penal forfeiture rendered nondischargeable by a 
that said,we also explained in hickman that 
t he definitions of penalty and fine reflect the traditional understanding of the these terms as punitive or penal sanctions imposed for some form of wrongdoing.their inclusion in a implies that congress intended to limit the section application to forfeitures imposed upon a wrongdoing debtor 
furthermore,the hearing committee language in the revised decision indicates that it may have intended for the costs to be punitive the board linked its revocation of schaffer punitive to his payment of the costs,ordering that 
if respondent fails for any reason,including bankruptcy,to pay the entire amounts within thirty days of this decision becoming final,the board shall not consider any reapplication for license by schaffer for the period that the fine remains unpaid.
read another way,however,the language suggests that the board anticipated that schaffer costs might be discharged in bankruptcy.
on balance,we find that the plain text of the louisiana statute presides.in permitting the assessment of costs in addition to a fine,a plain reading of the text suggests that the costs are not a fine,penalty,or forfeiture under a.the board could have assessed a fine under the statute express language but did not do so.finding the board assessment of costs to be punitive forces it into the category of the fine that the board chose not to levy.but all of these on the other hand possibilities make plain the want of sure footing,and that is determinative here.in hickman we emphasized that c onsistent with the code basic purpose of relieving the honest debtor from the weight of oppressive indebtedness and permitting him to start afresh,exceptions to discharge are to be construed narrowly.reading the assessed costs as a fine or penalty under,in light of the louisiana statute express provision for a fine,is not a narrow reading of the bankruptcy code.
it is true that criminal and civil cases in the supreme court,other circuit courts,and bankruptcy courts have held that certain costs not labeled as a fine or penalty nevertheless fit within definition of fines or penalties that are nondischargeable debts.we begin with the supreme court decision in kelly,a criminal case,and conclude that the reasoning for nondischargeability in criminal cases does not wholly apply to civil administrative decisions.we then look to the civil cases.although several cases in other circuits hold that the goal of preventing the discharge of costs associated with criminal activity should apply equally in the civil context,these cases differ substantially from the facts here.none of those cases involved a unitary statute with language providing for the imposition of a fine and costs.
in kelly,a connecticut statute allowed courts to order a defendant to make restitution of the fruits of his offense or make restitution for the loss or damage caused thereby the connecticut superior court ordered that a defendant convicted of larceny make restitution to the state probation office the court determined that when congress enacted the new bankruptcy code it did so against the background of an established judicial exception to discharge for criminal sentences,including restitution orders,and that in writing the bankruptcy code,congress did not abrogate this exception to discharge.the court also expressed comity concerns associated with federal discharge laws,finding that w e do not think congress lightly would limit the rehabilitative and deterrent options available to state criminal judges.furthermore,the court found,on its face a creates a broad exception to dischargeability for all penal sanctions,whether they be denominated fines,penalties,or forfeitures.because kelly reasoning rests on a hesitation to interfere in state criminal matters,its aptness for civil proceedings is dubious.as we held in hickman,
the court in kelly did not decide a applicability to civil,debts.thus,while the court analysis and approach in kelly are instructive,its holding does not compel the result that debts incurred in a civil capacity are dischargeable 
we turn to the more relevant civil cases.
in in re cillo a bankruptcy court held that a florida supreme court judgment requiring an attorney to pay the state bar for the costs of its disciplinary proceeding against was not a judgment for actual pecuniary loss and was nondischargeable under a.the bankruptcy court rested on its reasoning in an earlier criminal case,in re garvin and held,
the costs of a disciplinary proceeding assessed by the florida supreme court against the debtor whose license to practice law had been suspended,were in the nature of a fine,penalty or forfeiture payable to or for the benefit of a governmental unit,and is not compensation for actual pecuniary loss.even though garvin arose in the context of criminal proceedings,the ultimate goal of both criminal and attorney disciplinary proceedings is to protect the public.sanctions imposed against the offender,whether as part of an attorney disciplinary proceeding or a criminal proceeding,promote the state penal and rehabilitative interests 
because the bar had not sought restitution or fines in court,the bankruptcy court reasonably interpreted the florida supreme court requirement that the attorney pay the costs of the case as an alternative means of sanctioning the attorney.
in in re haberman,the board of attorneys professional responsibility bapr for wisconsin,an arm of the wisconsin supreme court primarily responsible for investigating complaints against members of the bar and making recommendations to the wisconsin supreme court regarding appropriate disciplinary actions,brought an action in the supreme court against haberman.the supreme court ordered him to pay costs to the bapr.the bankruptcy court held these costs to be nondischargeable under a,reasoning that 
the ultimate goal of both criminal proceedings and attorney disciplinary proceedings is to protect the public.sanctions imposed against an offender,whether as part of attorney disciplinary proceedings or criminal proceedings,promote the state penal and rehabilitative interests 
the court also relied on that fact that wisconsin case law as developed reflects a policy of treating assessed costs as penal in nature,and that the rule providing for assessment of costs against disciplined attorneys was primarily intended to deter attorneys from engaging in improper conduct and to convey the message to attorneys and to the public alike that the practice of law is closely scrutinized.most relevantly,the court concluded,
the words misconduct and types of discipline as used in scr the rule permitting cost assessment,license suspension,and other remedies indicate that the purpose of the rule is more akin to punishment than to compensation for actual pecuniary loss 
in haberman,the rule providing for assessment of costs listed costs as a type of discipline.specifically,that rule provided,
misconduct is grounds for one or more of the following types of discipline 
revocation of license to practice law disbarment.
suspension of license to practice law,including the imposition of conditions upon seeking reinstatement of the license.
monetary payment.
public or private reprimand.
