facts and procedural history 
a.the employment dispute 
between april and november,plaintiff worked for permanente as a cytotechnologist.in that capacity,she examined slides from pap smears to determine whether the tests revealed any cellular irregularities.she worked under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement the agreement between permanente and the union,in which the parties agreed to resolve disputes through procedures that ultimately led to binding arbitration.the union pursued claims on behalf of its members.
as a matter of course,whenever a patient had a positive pap smear,permanente reviewed all negative slides from the immediately preceding five years for that patient.during one or more of those regular reviews,permanente discovered four misreadings by plaintiff.she had deemed the slides within normal limits but,in fact,the slides revealed abnormalities.the four misreadings occurred between september,and november.
on november,upon discovering those four misreadings,permanente terminated plaintiff employment.plaintiff grieved her discharge under the procedures provided for in the agreement and,ultimately,the dispute was submitted to an arbitrator.
at arbitration,the union conceded that the four identified slides had been misread and that certain documents could be admitted in evidence.among the stipulated documents were two written counseling memoranda that permanente had issued after plaintiff misread slides on two additional occasions.one memorandum was sent shortly after plaintiff was hired in,and the other was sent in september of.the union contended that plaintiff had improved in response to the september counseling memorandum and argued that permanente did not have just cause to terminate her for errors in slides read years earlier.
the arbitrator agreed with the union.he noted that permanente had no evidence of unsatisfactory work after september date of the last counseling memorandum.the arbitrator reinstated plaintiff because,in his opinion,permanente evidence did not meet the just cause standard.however,he concluded that permanente evidence was sufficient to raise a legitimate question about plaintiff competence.the arbitrator declined to award back pay on the ground that it was necessary to impress upon plaintiff the seriousness of the mistakes she had made,and the serious consequences of those mistakes.
procedural background 
plaintiff was not satisfied with the result of the arbitration.she filed an action for disability discrimination against permanente under the americans with disabilities act and the parallel state statute.
at plaintiff deposition,her counsel gave permanente a letter asking its consent to an amendment of the complaint.counsel wanted to add a claim against permanente and the union under of the relations act.specifically,plaintiff wanted to allege that the union breached a duty to her by stipulating to the admission of the counseling memoranda,by failing to argue for a limitation on permanente ability to consider errors,and by failing to argue that permanente should have disclosed certain documents in the arbitration,including statistics assessing other terminations.also,plaintiff sought to claim that permanente had failed to comply with the agreement because it terminated plaintiff employment for errors that occurred more than one year earlier.
permanente counsel would not agree to the amendment because he thought that the additional claims were frivolous.permanente counsel explained to plaintiff counsel that one can not overturn an arbitration merely by alleging one union erred in its handling of the grievance if what plaintiff counsel was describing could even be characterized as errors.permanente counsel asked plaintiff not to amend the complaint and told plaintiff counsel that,if he chose to do so,he would have to seek leave from the district court.plaintiff counsel explained that he did not want to seek leave to amend because he had been denied leave to amend in an earlier case.he told permanente counsel that,if counsel did not agree to the amendment,he would file a separate action and then seek to have it consolidated with the action.permanente counsel objected and sent a letter to plaintiff counsel stating that,if plaintiff did file a second and separate action,permanente would seek rule sanctions.
undeterred,plaintiff counsel filed this second,separate action.after yet another attempt to persuade plaintiff counsel to withdraw this action,permanente sent a letter to plaintiff counsel informing him that permanente would seek rule sanctions if the complaint were not withdrawn.finally,in compliance with the rule,permanente served a motion for sanctions on plaintiff counsel on march.
as grounds for sanctions,permanente argued that any reasonable lawyer would know that the facts alleged in the second complaint do not give rise to a claim under.even if all the allegations are taken as true,the facts do not support a breach of the duty of fair representation under established supreme court precedent.
further,permanente argued that plaintiff counsel made allegations in the second complaint that he knew were false.specifically,the complaint alleged 
plaintiff is informed,and based upon such belief alleges that despite the continuing request of plaintiff,and persons acting on her behalf,that the union obtain statistical records from permanente which would have demonstrated that no one employed at permanente sherman way reference laboratory had ever been terminated as a result of the types of errors which plaintiff had allegedly made between july of and september,it made no attempt to either obtain or use those records to attack her wrongful termination.
plaintiff is informed,and based upon such belief alleges that despite the continuing request of plaintiff and persons acting on her behalf that the union obtain statistical records from permanente which would have demonstrated that no one employed at permanente sherman reference laboratory had ever been terminated on similar grounds,the union failed and neglected to do so.
emphasis added.
in fact,plaintiff counsel represented a cytotechnologist who had been terminated on similar grounds,that is,for errors in reading slides.because of this prior representation of a similarly situated plaintiff,permanente contended that plaintiff counsel must have known that the allegations in this complaint were false.
district court rulings 
pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,permanente moved to dismiss the complaint.even though he already had been served with the sanctions motion,plaintiff counsel filed papers opposing the motion to dismiss.initially,the district court set a hearing date of april to rule on the motion to dismiss.however,on april the court canceled the hearing and dismissed the complaint because of its patent meritlessness.truesdell cal.permanente med.group,d.thus,the court ruled days into the day period provided by rule.
