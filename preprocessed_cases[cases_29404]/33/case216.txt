pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,the district court sanctioned paul minor,an attorney,for obtaining a writ to execute judgment.the primary reason for our en banc review is to decide whether the district court abused its considerable discretion in imposing sanctions for minor violation of rule b improper purpose in obtaining writ of execution.the district court acted within its discretion.affirmed.
in may,the district court entered an approximate million judgment for minor clients against kmart corporation in an action arising out of heinous acts by two individuals not associated with kmart their abduction of a mother and her daughter from a kmart parking lot in jackson,mississippi,and the subsequent rape of the mother.a jury found kmart negligent in failing to provide adequate parking lot security.see whitehead food max of,cir.
at trial,minor was sanctioned for violating,during his closing argument,an earlier warning by the district court.id.at.this followed minor refusals during trial to follow other court instructions.see id.at.
in june,shortly after entry of judgment,kmart moved for a remittitur or,alternatively,a new trial.see fed.civ.in addition,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,it requested a stay of execution of judgment pending resolution of those motions.that stay motion was not decided,however,until august,when the rule motions were denied.the accompanying stay motion was then dismissed as moot.that same day,the district court denied minor request to reconsider the sanctions imposed at trial.
three days later,using a handwritten request he had signed,minor obtained from the district court clerk a writ of execution for the judgment the writ.in addition,minor notified the media about the pending execution.with media representatives and two united states marshals,minor entered the kmart the abduction had occurred in its parking lot and attempted to execute the judgment by seizing currency in the cash registers and vault.the seizure was delayed to allow kmart employees a chance to consult with their management and attorneys shortly thereafter,it was stayed by the district court.no cash was seized.
while at the kmart,minor was interviewed by the media news reports about the,including minor extremely hyperbolic,intemperate,and misleading comments improper comments,were,among other media,broadcast in at least three television reports.minor characterized kmart actions as arrogan t and outrageous and asserted kmart wo uld no t pay the judgment claimed kmart had been warned before the abduction that an event like that was going to happen but did care charged his clients had been twice victimized by kmart,once by being abducted there and once by kmart not paying a just debt and proclaimed he was there to ensure kmart did what it was supposed to do 
that same day,the district court held a teleconference with the parties kmart was directed to submit a supersedeas bond it later did so and kmart advised it would seek sanctions against minor.kmart soon moved for sanctions,pursuant,inter alia,to rule.
kmart charged minor had violated an automatic stay of execution of judgment,claimed to be in effect pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure f,which incorporated mississippi rule of civil procedure a.federal rule f provides 
stay according to state law.in any state in which a judgment is a lien upon the property of the judgment debtor and in which the judgment debtor is entitled to a stay of execution,a judgment debtor is entitled,in the district court held therein,to such stay as would be accorded the judgment debtor had the action been maintained in the courts of that state.
fed civ.f emphasis added.mississippi rule a provides in part 
automatic stay exceptions.except as stated herein or as otherwise provided by statute or by order of the court for good cause shown,no execution shall be issued upon a judgment nor shall proceedings be taken for its enforcement until the expiration of ten days after its entry or the disposition of a motion for a new trial,whichever last occurs.
civ.a emphasis added.
kmart maintained pursuant to mississippi rule a,a stay is automatic in state court after disposition of a new trial motion therefore,application of that rule,through federal rule f,resulted in a stay from the august denial of kmart new trial motion.kmart also asserted minor,with numerous newspaper reporters and television interview teams,and without justification,paraded through kmart in full view of customers and employees orchestrat ing damage to kmart,its business and goodwill and his improper purpose proscribed by rule b was obvious from these actions.provided with the motion were copies of two articles from newspapers in jackson and another city in mississippi and a videotape of television broadcasts about the attempted execution.these items included minor improper comments.
minor responded following denial of the new trial motion,kmart had not moved,pursuant to federal rule f,for the mississippi rule a automatic stay therefore,no stay had been in effect.nothing in the record indicates minor contended in district court that the judgment did not constitute a lien against kmart property one of the prerequisites for a federal rule f stay.
minor also contended seeking to obtain a portion of the judgment was not an improper purpose proscribed by rule b and,where counsel action has a reasonable basis under the law,a court will not find an improper purpose minor affidavit stated he attempted execution in order to obtain a portion of the judgment because kmart had not returned his telephone calls concerning potential settlement and he was concerned that kmart,which he believed to be,had not posted a supersedeas bond.
the district court apparently delayed ruling on the sanctions motion pending kmart appeal from the judgment in the underlying action.for that appeal,our court held the jury had been influenced by passion and prejudice resulting from minor closing argument the action was remanded in early for a new trial on damages.see whitehead,at.that march,in the light of extensive briefing,oral argument january,and painstaking analysis of the authority construing federal rule f,the district court ruled on the sanctions motion.
in a opinion,the court concluded a motion is not a prerequisite to a stay under federal rule f and kmart was protected by the stay against the attempted execution.whitehead kmart,d.concomitantly,the court concluded that minor had failed to make a reasonable inquiry into the law governing execution of judgments id.at.the court also ruled minor was seeking to embarrass kmart and call attention to himself as a tireless laborer of the bar attempting to obtain justice for his client when,in fact,there was no basis whatsoever in fact or in law for the actions taken id.at.
minor was ordered to pay kmart approximately attorney fees for opposing the execution.id.although kmart had requested a public apology by minor,the district court determined,and kmart agreed,that publication of the sanctions opinion would suffice.id.the opinion was published in,after rendition of the panel opinion for this appeal.
following the on damages,minor appealed the rule sanctions.in january,a divided panel reversed them.whitehead food max of,cir,vacated by cir en banc.the panel majority included a district judge and judge henry politz,who authored the opinion.judge politz died prior to our deciding to review this appeal en banc.
regarding rule b objective reasonableness of inquiry concerning existing law,the panel majority held as a matter of law,federal rule f does not afford the stay provided by state law unless the judgment debtor files a motion claiming the stay accordingly,no stay was in effect and the record did not support a conclusion that,before requesting the writ,minor failed to make a reasonable inquiry into the governing law.id.at.
concerning rule b improper purpose,the panel majority held minor intentional use of publicity for the purpose of embarrassing an adversary was patently inappropriate but,absent exceptional circumstances,an ulterior motive should not be read into a document filed for a legitimate purpose and any consequences that flow ed from such behavior was a decision for the state bar.id.at emphasis added.
the dissent urged that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding independent subparts b and were each violated.id.at barksdale,dissenting.regarding subpart b,the dissent stated it was not necessary to decide,as the majority had,whether a motion is required to trigger a federal rule f stay at issue was whether minor actions were objectively reasonable in the light of then existing legal authority and,they were not.id.at.as for subpart b,the dissent stated minor improper purpose provided a separate basis for the sanctions and they were appropriate in the light of minor,precisely the type of conduct rule is designed to remedy.id.at.
kmart petitioned for panel rehearing.in september,our court decided sua sponte to review en banc,thereby vacating the panel opinion.cir en banc.
rule b provides in pertinent part 
by presenting to the court whether by signing,filing,submitting,or later advocating a pleading,written motion,or other paper,an attorney is certifying that to the best of the person knowledge,information,and belief,formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances,
it is not being presented for any improper purpose,such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation and 
the claims,defenses,and other legal contentions therein are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension,modification,or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law 
fed.civ.b emphasis added.each obligation must be satisfied violation of either justifies sanctions.see,walker city of bogalusa,cir.and,in determining compliance vel non with each obligation,the standard under which an attorney is measured is an objective,not subjective,standard of reasonableness under the circumstances.childs state farm mut.auto.ins,cir.
rule sanctions are reviewed only for an abuse of discretion,lulirama,axcess broad,cir,including reviewing factual findings only for clear error,crowe smith,cir.this abuse of discretion standard is necessarily very deferential,for two reasons.
first,based on its f amiliar ity with the issues and litigants,the district court is better situated than the court of appeals to marshal the pertinent facts and apply the legal standard mandated by rule.lulirama,at quoting cooter gell hartmarx,d emphasis added.see also mercury air group,mansour,cir the imposition of sanctions is often a inquiry,for which the trial court is given wide discretion emphasis added.
second,the district judge is independently responsible for maintaining the integrity of judicial proceedings in his court and,concomitantly,must be accorded the necessary authority.see,cooter gell,at.nasco,calcasieu television and radio,cir discussing inherent power of court,aff sub nom.chambers nasco,d.
it was for these reasons that our court,in thomas capital security,cir en banc,established abuse of discretion,rather than in part de novo,as our standard of review for rule sanctions.this was confirmed by the supreme court in cooter gell,partly with reasoning that rings true here 
rule policy goals also support adopting an standard.the district court is best acquainted with the local bar litigation practices and thus best situated to determine when a sanction is warranted to serve rule goal of specific and general deterrence.deference to the determination of courts on the front lines of litigation will enhance these courts ability to control the litigants before them.such deference will streamline the litigation process by freeing appellate courts from the duty of reweighing evidence and reconsidering facts already weighed and considered by the district court it will also discourage litigants from pursuing marginal appeals,thus reducing the amount of satellite litigation.
at.emphasis added.
for this deferential review,the district court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.id.at.generally,an abuse of discretion only occurs where no reasonable person could take the view adopted by the trial court.friends for am.free enter.ass stores,cir internal quotation omitted emphasis added.
subparts b and of rule provide independent bases for sanctions.the district court concluded minor violated each subpart therefore,it is only necessary to decide whether he violated one.
regarding subpart b objective reasonableness of inquiry concerning existing law,minor affidavit in opposition to sanctions stated he relied upon van huss landsberg.dictum minor had cited this opinion earlier in opposing kmart motion for federal rule b stay pending resolution of its motions wright,miller kane,federal practice procedure motion for federal rule f stay should,not must,be filed and the district court earlier denial as moot of kmart request for the federal rule b stay.the district court ruled that this authority,when juxtaposed against the plain language of the rules,did not support an objectively reasonable belief that no stay was in effect.see whitehead,d at.
along this line,the panel majority focused on whether,as a matter of law,a motion is required to invoke the stay it held that it was and that,as a result,no stay was in place to protect kmart from execution.instead,the panel should have addressed whether minor belief was objectively reasonable at the time he requested the writ.see,thomas,at proper focus is snapshot of instant when document signed.in any event,because subparts b and provide independent bases for sanctions,it is not necessary to decide whether the district court abused its discretion concerning subpart b.for purposes of deciding whether sanctions could be based on subpart b,we will assume minor did not violate subpart b.
after determining minor failed to make a reasonable inquiry violating subpart b,whitehead,d at,and then addressing why rule safe harbor provision subpart c a did not shelter minor,id.at,the district court stated 
additionally,kmart has submitted to this court several of the articles and news reports which were generated in the local press by the improper execution of judgment in the instant case.it is clear from these unchallenged submissions that minor was seeking to embarrass kmart and call attention to himself as a tireless laborer of the bar attempting to obtain justice for his client when,in fact,there was no basis whatsoever in fact or in law for the actions taken on august.thus,this court is persuaded that the imposition of appropriate sanctions in this case is justified and proper.
id.at emphasis added.as discussed infra,this subpart b improper purpose ruling is sufficient to sustain the sanctions.
minor insists we must decide the subpart b issue,asserting that the subpart b improper purpose ruling is inextricably intertwined with whether,under subpart b,he had an objectively reasonable belief that a stay did not exist.he claims i f there was authority that even arguably supported what he did,there was no basis for the sanctions motion.in support,minor notes that the district court improper purpose ruling states there was no basis whatsoever in fact or in law for minor actions id.at 
it is true that,generally,district courts do not sanction attorneys who make nonfrivolous representations.a district court may do so,however,where it is objectively ascertainable that an attorney submitted a paper to the court for an improper purpose.b.see,sheets yamaha motor,cir ass of gov t employees,fed of fed.employees,cir.
sheets,for instance,held filing excessive motions could constitute harassment proscribed by rule,even if the motions were in law or fact.at.filing otherwise legitimate documents that use abusive language toward opposing counsel could also violate the rule,coats pierre,cir,cert.denied,d,as could filing a valid pleading or motion without a sincere intent to pursue it,cohen virginia power,cir.
we conclude that the district court improper purpose ruling was independent from its inquiry concerning existing law ruling.we base this upon the following factors the parties having squarely placed the improper purpose issue before the district court its earlier citation to subpart b in quoting all of rule b in its order,whitehead,d at its subsequent specific enumeration of rule bases,including improper purpose,id.at minor presented to this court a request certifying a that to the best of his knowledge,information,and belief,formed after a reasonable inquiry that the request was proper and b that the letter requesting the writ of execution was not being presented for any improper purpose,such as to harass emphasis added its then concluding minor failed to make a subpart b reasonable inquiry into the law,id.at and its then discussing rule safe harbor provision,id.at,before making its subpart b improper purpose ruling,id.at.to conclude otherwise would render the improper purpose portion of the opinion superfluous.moreover,the two subparts concern quite different considerations.and,again,the improper purpose ruling can be sustained even if as we assume for our analysis there were a basis in law for minor obtaining the writ.the two bases were not intertwined.
a district court may sanction an attorney for presenting a paper to the court for any improper purpose,such as to harass.b emphasis added.although a district court is not to read an ulterior motive into a document well grounded in fact and law,it may do so in exceptional cases,such as this,where the improper purpose is objectively ascertainable.see sheets,at.
the district court found minor had two improper purposes for requesting the writ to embarrass kmart and to promote himself.whitehead,d at.part of our abuse of discretion review is to determine whether the district court ruling was based on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.cooter gell,at.pursuant to the standard of review for clear error vel non,we may disturb factual findings,which often involve credibility choices,only if a review of all the evidence leaves us with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.tulia feedlot,united states,cir,cert.denied,d.
in maintaining he had legitimate,not improper,purposes,minor offered two reasons to the district court for obtaining the writ obtaining part of the judgment for his clients and trying to force settlement.the factual findings related to these two reasons were not clearly erroneous.
obviously,there would not have been enough cash at one local kmart to satisfy the million judgment.in addition,the execution was unnecessary to secure the judgment the judgment constituted a lien against kmart property in mississippi.again,nothing in the record indicates minor disputed in district court that the judgment constituted such a lien.see,ann.see also.f.minor notes that kmart is currently in bankruptcy this,of course,is irrelevant to minor purpose at the time in question august.in any event,even if minor purpose were only to obtain a portion of the judgment,the district court did not clearly err in finding minor also had separate,improper purposes.
assuming arguendo that attempting to force settlement is proper,but see,elster alexander,attempt to coerce settlement not proper,minor offered the following explanation to the district court he had attempted to contact kmart,but it had refused to return his telephone calls or speak to him about the case therefore,he was forced to take this drastic measure to open lines of communication.
the record,however,contains only one letter from minor requesting settlement discussions june,shortly before kmart filed its motions.that letter does not reflect how many calls were made by minor.in any event,his claim that kmart refused all communication is belied by his letter i am sorry we have been missing each other and i appreciate you returning my phone calls.emphasis added.
minor letter states he was attempting to ascertain whether kmart wished to engage in settlement discussions before posting an appeal bond.at the time of the letter,through,kmart motions for a new trial were pending.after the court ruled on the motions,minor gave kmart only three days before attempting to execute.there is no evidence that minor attempted to contact kmart during this period.accordingly,it was not clearly erroneous for the district court to reject minor claim that he was forced to obtain the writ in order to initiate settlement discussion.
in addition,it was not clearly erroneous for the district court,by implication,to find that neither of these claimed purposes explained either minor presence at the execution or his collateral media play.the execution did not require minor to accompany the two united states marshals to the kmart especially where,as here,the involved property was,open,and obvious.see fed.civ.see also moore federal.and,the execution certainly did not require the media presence at the kmart or the improper comments minor made there to the media.
in fact,minor does not dispute that he intended to embarrass kmart or that he was seeking personal recognition.most regrettably,he contends that these are far from being evidence of an improper purpose in obtaining the writ,a lmost everything an attorney in litigation does is designed to embarrass an opponent in one way or another establishing a reputation for success in the representation of clients is the most professional way for a lawyer to build a practice.it was not clearly erroneous for the district court to find that each of minor intended goals was evidence of an improper purpose.
claiming a purpose to embarrass is different than one to harass,minor seems to contend that,because rule explicitly refers to harassment,and because that was not his purpose,his admitted intent to embarrass can not be an improper purpose under the rule.on this record,there is no meaningful distinction between these two purposes,especially in the light of our deferential standard of review.see,flaherty torquato,using harass and embarrass interchangeably in context of rule improper purpose discussion,aff by cir.regardless,minor misreads rule.
even assuming that minor purpose to embarrass kmart was not,in essence,a purpose to harass,rule list of improper purposes is only illustrative to harass is but one of the possible improper purposes.fed.civ.b any improper purpose,such as to harass emphasis added.
the media event orchestrated by minor,in particular,constitutes objective evidence of his improper purpose in obtaining the writ.see,ivy kimbrough,cir no abuse of discretion in imposing rule sanctions,where,inter alia,conduct was aimed at the media and primarily for local media consumption kramer tribe,aff without opinion,cir,cert.denied,d imposing rule sanctions because,among other things,giving misleading reports to media demonstrated improper purpose motives including intent to embarrass.again,the district court had an unchallenged videotape of,inter alia,minor improper comments.the district court finding i t clear from the unchallenged newspaper articles and videotape that minor had an improper purpose,whitehead,d at emphasis added,is a classic example of minor being h oist with his own petard.william shakespeare,hamlet act,sc.minor improper comments,preserved by the very entity he enlisted to embarrass kmart and promote himself were,instead,arguably the best evidence of his improper purpose in obtaining the writ.
before our en banc court,minor raises,for the first time,first amendment considerations with regard to his improper comments.no authority need be cited for the rule that,because the record does not reflect that minor raised these points in district court,we will not consider them on appeal.in any event,the improper purpose in obtaining the writ,not the vehicle such as the media used to implement that improper purpose,is what is decided by the sanctioning court and reviewed on appeal.in other words,under subpart b,minor attempted execution is not the issue his underlying improper purpose in obtaining the writ is.the collateral media play simply constitutes objective evidence of that improper purpose.
finally,minor asserts that,although his conduct may not have been civil,it is not sanctionable.he maintains civility is aspirational and beyond the power of the law and if our court wants to impose civility rules,we should adopt them.along this line,minor takes issue with any suggestion in the vacated panel opinion that his conduct was unethical.see whitehead,at.he further contends even if his conduct were unethical,the appropriate remedy would be referral to the state bar for possible discipline,not imposition of rule sanctions.this issue is also raised for the first time on appeal.because the vacated panel opinion addressed the issue in part,see,we will consider it.
minor again understates the severity of his conduct and overlooks both the district court broad authority to impose rule sanctions and our deferential standard of review.whether minor conduct violated civility and ethics rules is for others to act upon in any event,his conduct violated rule.
these categories are not mutually exclusive.for example,the rules advisory committee has recognized that some overlap exists between state bar discipline and rule sanctions its notes to rule state that one possible sanction for a violation of rule is referral to a state bar authority.see also kramer,imposing sanctions and referring matter to state bar.district courts have an independent duty to maintain the integrity of the judicial process and may impose rule sanctions where necessary,regardless of whether state bar discipline is concurrent.
rule limits sanctions to what is sufficient to deter repetition of such conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated.c.in addition to publishing its sanctions opinion,the district court limited the sanctions to the reasonable attorneys fees and other expenses incurred as a direct result of the violation,id.minor does not challenge this aspect of the order.
in sum,there was no abuse of discretion.the district court spoke with counsel,including minor,on the day of the incident and was quite familiar with the parties and litigants.minor execution attempt followed his improper conduct at trial.see whitehead,at see also fed.civ.advisory committee note whether sanctionable conduct was part of a pattern of activity,or an isolated event is a proper consideration.
generally,for the purpose of satisfying a judgment is proper.minor conduct,however,was exceptional.although it was only three days after disposition of motions,with significant time remaining for kmart to appeal the judgment and post a supersedeas bond,minor,after obtaining the execution writ invited the media to one of kmart places of business to execute judgment in plain view of kmart customers and employees and made improper comments to the media regarding the case,kmart,and kmart willingness to satisfy the judgment.
the district court found,based in part on the videotape,that minor had improper purposes in obtaining the writ to embarrass kmart and advance his personal position.the district court,of course,is in a far better position than we to balance the considerations underlying rulings on rule sanctions,most especially the concomitant factual findings including credibility choices.obviously,this is why we review its decision under a very deferential abuse of discretion standard.for the subpart b improper purpose ruling the record does not support these findings being clearly erroneous nor was there an erroneous view of the law.see cooter gell,at.
minor moves for summary reversal and imposition of sanctions against kmart,or for remand for and such sanctions,contending kmart caused the attempted execution by earlier,false responses during discovery that it was and,had minor known of insurance covering the judgment,he would not have attempted to execute.it appears kmart was partly,with umbrella coverage.
the relief sought by minor motion was requested,for the first time,while this appeal was pending.in his motion,minor stated this claim was neither known,nor confirmed,until well after his appeal was filed.the panel majority did not address the motion,in the light of its reversing the sanctions.whitehead,at.
minor fails to connect how his understanding of kmart status justified his conduct.kmart discovery responses do not affect the considerations underlying whether minor purpose in obtaining the writ was proper.we express no opinion on whether minor can seek relief in district court based on the challenged discovery responses.
for the foregoing reasons,the sanctions are affirmed minor motion for summary reversal or remand is denied.
sanctions affirmed motion denied.
the majority,appellate judges all,are plainly exercised about lawyer paul minor efforts to collect his clients judgment against kmart.in their effort to declare the kind of behavior that will not be accepted by this court,they have the inquiry mandated by rule and our own case law,with potentially consequences.i respectfully dissent.
in evaluating a district court imposition of sanctions under rule b,this and other circuits generally look first to the district court findings on whether the filing at issue was warranted by existing law or a nonfrivolous argument for a change in the law as required by rule b look next to the findings on whether the filing was presented for an improper purpose under rule b look next to the findings on whether the filing was also presented for a legitimate purpose and finally look to the district court evaluation of whether any improper purpose is sufficient under the circumstances to support sanctions under rule b.if the district court has correctly found a legitimate purpose for the filing,this and other circuits have been reluctant to approve the imposition of sanctions for an improper purpose under rule b.here,by contrast,the majority presents the two relevant subparts of rule as not intertwined for purposes of assessing rule b sanctions.the majority then goes on to credit the district court with making crucial findings on both legitimate and improper purposes that the district court plainly did not make.the majority winds up by affirming the district court conclusion that sanctions are warranted under rule b where it is not at all clear that the district court concluded as much.this entire method of evaluating sanctions assessed under rule effectively eviscerates what were,up until this point,critical aspects of the rule framework.
analysis of the framework for sanctions under rule b a.the interrelation of rule b and b 
rule b explicitly requires that an attorney submit a paper to the court only after forming a reasonable belief that it is warranted by existing law or a argument for a change in the law and rule b explicitly precludes an attorney from submitting a paper for certain improper purposes.the subsections thus appear to be quite discrete textually.however,our case law demonstrates that the subsections are actually interrelated in at least one situation when a paper is well grounded in fact and warranted by existing law,only under unusual circumstances should the filing of the paper constitute sanctionable conduct.calhoun,cir emphasis added quoting sheets yamaha motors,cir.this circuit has extended this logic in concluding that a lthough the filing of a paper for an improper purpose is not immunized from rule sanctions simply because it is well grounded in fact and law,only under unusual as the filing of excessive the filing constitute sanctionable conduct.sheets,at emphasis added.
what this precedent says is that a favorable finding regarding rule b should influence a district court conclusion regarding the existence of an improper purpose sanction under rule b,and only in the most exceptional circumstances will this court uphold sanctions under rule b when a paper satisfies the rule b requirements.
here,the majority first concludes,correctly,that the two subparts rule b and rule b concern quite different considerations but then concludes,incorrectly,that they need not be intertwined in the rule b inquiry.our precedent does not support that.in the interest of bypassing an evaluation of the district court possibly incorrect finding under rule b,the majority has announced a rule that the rule ll b and b inquiries need not be intertwined in a situation where rule b sanctions are to be imposed that is directly at odds with our precedent.in my view,that is a serious mistake,now bad law 
b.the necessary predicate to impose sanctions under rule b 
our case law makes clear that the next step in the framework for imposing improper purpose sanctions is the consideration by the district court of legitimate and improper purposes the litigant or party may have had for submitting the relevant paper.in its quest to uphold the district court imposition of sanctions,the majority attributes findings to the district court regarding this legitimate purpose step that the district court clearly did not make,and attributes a legal conclusion to the district court regarding whether sanctions are warranted independently under rule b that the district court may not have even made.
assuming the district court finds a legitimate purpose or purposes for the relevant filing,then it must weigh the legitimate purposes against any illegitimate purposes and evaluate whether the illegitimate purposes are sufficient in themselves to independently support sanctions under rule b.as we stated in national association of government employees,national federation of federal employees,cir 
we do not condone litigation instituted for ulterior purposes rather than to secure judgment on a complaint in which the plaintiff sincerely believes.yet the rule injunction against harassment does not exact of those who file pleadings an undiluted desire for just deserts t he court must focus on objectively ascertainable circumstances that support an inference that a filing harassed the defendant or caused unnecessary delay.as judge schwarzer has stated if a reasonably clear legal justification can be shown for the filing of the paper in question,no improper purpose can be found and sanctions are inappropriate a plaintiff must file a complaint in order to vindicate his rights in court.we find no indication that the filing here was unnecessary,for the defendants had refused to retract the alleged defamatory statement.under the circumstances,the plaintiff had a proper interest in suing to attempt to vindicate its reputation.
id.at internal footnote omitted and emphasis added.thus,as interpreted by our court,before a district court can impose sanctions under rule b,it must consider any legitimate or proper purposes the litigant or attorney may have had in presenting a paper to the district court.before today,we were loath to find that an attorney or litigant illegitimate purpose could independently support sanctions where a legitimate purpose for filing the relevant paper also existed.
here,paying lip service to the required inquiry into legitimate purposes,the majority upholds as not clearly erroneous factual findings rejecting minor proffered legitimate purposes for seeking the writ of execution to satisfy part of the judgment for his client in order to pay medical bills and to encourage settlement.however,though i have thoroughly searched the district court order,i find no mention,much less discussion,of any possible legitimate or proper purpose.this necessary predicate is simply not there.
the fourth circuit case of in re kunstler,cir,discusses the importance of the critical step omitted by the district court 
rule defines the term improper purpose to include factors such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the costs of litigation.the factors mentioned in the rule are not exclusive.if a complaint is not filed to vindicate rights in court,its purpose must be improper.however,if a complaint is filed to vindicate rights in court,and also for some other purpose,a court should not sanction counsel for an intention that the court does not approve,so long as the added purpose is not undertaken in bad faith and is not so excessive as to eliminate a proper purpose.thus,the purpose to vindicate rights in court must be central and sincere in other words,it is not enough that the injured party subjectively believes that a lawsuit was brought to harass,or to focus negative publicity on the injured party.
id.at emphasis added.kunstler holding accords with our circuit precedent.if an illegitimate purpose does not engulf an individual legitimate purpose,sanctions under the improper purpose section of rule can not stand.because the district court overlooked this important inquiry,our court has no place upholding findings that are not even there.
in addition to attributing factual findings to the district court that it did not make,the majority jumps to the support of a legal conclusion that the district court may not have even made.the majority points to a single paragraph in the district court order that references minor desire to embarrass kmart and to gain publicity for himself as indisputably demonstrating an intention on the part of the district court to sanction minor independently under rule b.however,it is not clear,much less indisputable,from this single paragraph that the district court intended to sanction minor under rule b as independent from rule b,especially as this paragraph expressly states that there was no basis whatsoever in fact or in law for the actions taken on august.whether there is a basis in law is clearly the relevant inquiry under rule b,not rule b.further,the district court does not use any of the descriptive language found in rule b list,such as harass.while this is not required,i would expect to see some discussion regarding a comparison between harass and embarrass if the district court truly intended as the majority assumes to use the terms interchangeably and to sanction minor independently under rule b at a minimum,i would expect the district court to have at least mentioned either the subpart dealing with improper purpose or the term improper purpose itself in this paragraph,particularly given the extent of the discussion regarding rule b.
in the past,when an order imposing sanctions contained such shortcomings,we refused to supply the necessary findings and conclusions on appeal because we,as appellate judges,must not become fact finders.see,calhoun,cir we have long held that a district court,in applying sanctions,may have to make a detailed explanation for its legal reasons the purpose of creating such a record is simple in order to guard against the application of hindsight by district courts who have sat through long,complicated,and often contentious proceedings,we must not be put in the position of having to guess what unwarranted factual or legal errors were the basis of the sanctions.united states alexander,cir the district court here did not cite any unusual circumstances that warranted sanctions.the court merely asserted the view that the claim was filed for an improper purpose.even though detailed findings are not required to uphold an award of sanctions,there must be some record to review.today the majority from this precedent to,indeed,even credit the district court necessary factual predicate omitted by the district court and to supply a legal conclusion that may not have been made by the district court.i can not subscribe to this technique.
the unusual or exceptional circumstances requirement 
our precedent is clear.even assuming the district court had made appropriate factual findings on whether minor had a legitimate purpose for obtaining the writ of execution here,in situations where an attorney or party submits a paper that is in law under rule b as the majority assumes arguendo to be the case here improper purpose sanctions may be imposed by a district court only in unusual or exceptional circumstances.i disagree with the majority implied finding that this case presents such unusual circumstances.
to date,we have not found a case with such unusual circumstances to merit upholding an improper purpose finding where as is assumed to be the case here the filing of the paper satisfies the rule b requirements.see,calhoun,at sheets,at of gov t,at in this spirit,i disagree with the majority that this case should serve as the benchmark for district courts imposing improper purpose sanctions in the future.with only a finding by the district court of an intent to embarrass one opponent and an intent to gain publicity for quite common characteristics in a judgment or debt collection
