fridoon zalbeg rawshan nehad rawshan petitions for review of an order denying his motion to reopen removal proceedings on the basis of ineffective assistance of his counsel,pieter speyer.this is an atypical claim,inasmuch as counsel alleged ineffectiveness derived not from the giving of incompetent advice,but from pressuring his client into accepting voluntary departure under threat of counsel withdrawal.for the reasons that follow,we will grant the petition for review and remand with instructions to the board of immigration appeals bia to reopen petitioner case.
facts and procedural history 
rawshan is a citizen and native of afghanistan and a lawful permanent resident of the united states.he fled afghanistan in at age to avoid military service and settled in germany.in,he immigrated to the united states as a lawful permanent resident to live with other members of his family.he has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder,and,when not properly medicated,he experiences hallucinogenic episodes.
in june,the government served rawshan with a notice to appear alleging that he was removable under a e i as an alien convicted of a crime of domestic violence.rawshan retained attorney pieter speyer to represent him in removal proceedings.in july,the government lodged an additional charge that rawshan was removable under a e ii as an alien convicted of violating a protective order.in support of these charges,the government submitted california court documents reflecting that,in february,rawshan pleaded guilty to one count of battery in violation of california penal code and one count of violating a protective order in violation of california penal code a.the documents of conviction do not detail the circumstances of these charges.according to an affidavit submitted by rawshan sister,benazeer roshan,she and other family members obtained the protective order in response to one of rawshan psychotic episodes.they were,at the time,unaware of rawshan mental illnesses.roshan further attests that had they realized his episode was the product of mental illness,they would not have requested the order.how rawshan violated the protective order is not reflected in the record.
at a master calendar hearing in december,the immigration judge ij issued a preliminary ruling sustaining the a e ii charge for violating a protective order and rejecting the a e i charge for a crime of domestic violence.the record does not contain a transcript of the hearing or anything else detailing the reasons underlying the ij decision.
following these preliminary rulings,the december hearing was continued to allow rawshan to prepare an application for asylum and similar relief.the next hearing was set for february,and rawshan was expected to file any applications for relief from removal at that time.
on february,shortly before rawshan was scheduled to appear before the ij,he met with speyer to finalize his asylum application.according to rawshan account of the meeting,speyer announced that he would not be able to continue representing rawshan beyond that day hearing because of a personal issue and because rawshan case was complicated.in addition,rawshan attests that speyer suggested that his claim for asylum was weak.approximately two hours before the hearing,speyer proposed that,in lieu of filing an asylum application,rawshan accept voluntary departure,which,speyer told rawshan,would preserve rawshan rights to return to the united states in the future.at the hearing that day,rawshan agreed to voluntary departure and was given days to leave the united states.
days before his deadline for leaving the united states,rawshan,through new counsel,filed a motion to reopen based on speyer ineffective assistance.rawshan primary argument was that speyer acted improperly by presenting him with a proposal and a threat to withdraw as counsel just two hours before a scheduled hearing.rawshan further argued that he was prejudiced by this impropriety because,in agreeing to voluntary departure,he waived a meritorious appeal on the issue of removability and forewent the filing of a meritorious application for asylum and related relief.in support of his motion,rawshan submitted an affidavit in which he testified to speyer conduct.he also submitted a complaint against speyer filed with the california bar association by his sister,benazeer roshan,and an affidavit from her as well,both of which enlarged upon the testimony in rawshan affidavit in support of his motion to reopen,rawshan included speyer brief response to the bar complaint,in which speyer stated that he perceived a conflict between roshan plan for resolving this case and her brother,fridoon rawshan,own wishes,and that seeking voluntary departure appeared to reconcile everyone wishes.
the ij denied rawshan motion,ruling that the evidence submitted did not establish that speyer sought to withdraw from the case for personal reasons.the ij observed that speyer had not moved to withdraw,and that speyer had completed rawshan asylum application,which,according to the ij,suggested that speyer was prepared to file an asylum request had rawshan wanted him to do so.the ij essentially credited speyer explanation that there was some conflict between rawshan and his sister,and inferred that speyer followed his client wishes by requesting voluntary departure.the ij further found that rawshan conduct during the february,hearing suggested that rawshan fully understood the consequences of accepting voluntary departure 
rawshan appealed to the bia,and the bia affirmed,adopting the ij view and adding its own.in his appeal to the bia,rawshan also requested reopening on the ground of changed country conditions and reconsideration of his removability.the bia concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over both supplemental requests.
rawshan petitions this court for review of the bia affirmance of the ij denial of his motion to reopen,as well as the bia refusal to consider his supplemental requests for reconsideration and for reopening on the basis of changed country conditions.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction under a.
where,as here,the bia expressly adopts the reasoning of the ij and adds some of its own reasoning,we review both decisions.nuru gonzales,cir.we review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion.perez mukasey,cir.any findings of fact made in the course of the decision are reviewed for substantial evidence.jie lin ashcroft,cir as amended.the bia decision not to consider a motion on jurisdictional grounds is reviewed de novo.lin gonzales,cir.
iii.discussion 
we begin with the denial of rawshan motion to reopen on account of ineffective assistance of counsel.litigants in removal proceedings have no sixth amendment right to counsel their counsel can,however,be so ineffective as to deprive them of their fifth amendment right to due process of law.blanco mukasey,cir.the immigration and nationality act gives litigants in removal proceedings a right to retain private counsel.i f an individual chooses to retain counsel,his or her due process right includes a right to competent representation.hernandez mukasey,cir quoting ray gonzales,cir emphasis in original.representation by competent counsel is particularly important in removal proceedings because t he proliferation of immigration laws and regulations has aptly been called a labyrinth that only a lawyer could navigate.biwot gonzales,cir.thus,we have recognized that litigants in removal proceedings rely heavily on their attorney advice.see hernandez,at.
ineffective assistance of counsel amounts to a violation of due process if the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.mohammed gonzales,cir citations omitted.to make out an ineffective assistance claim,an immigrant must show that counsel performance was deficient,and that counsel deficiency caused prejudice.id.at.prejudice only results when counsel performance is so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings.ortiz ins,cir.
whether speyer performance was deficient 
the focus of rawshan petition is not that speyer advice recommending voluntary departure was per se incompetent,but that speyer violated his duties of loyalty and competence by presenting this recommendation under improperly coercive circumstances.in particular,rawshan argues that it was improper for speyer to,in effect,threaten to withdraw from the case if rawshan refused to accept voluntary departure.
at the outset,we note that it is unclear what the ij thought happened at the february,meeting between rawshan and speyer.the ij found as follows the respondent rawshan has not established that attorney speyer requested voluntary departure on the respondent behalf for his own personal reasons and out of a desire to withdraw from the case.this statement is unhelpful,because it is does not explain whether the ij disbelieved that speyer intended to withdraw at all,or merely disbelieved that speyer recommendation was tainted by his desire to withdraw from the case.no matter.we accept petitioner testimony as true unless the ij makes an express finding that the testimony is not credible.kataria ins,cir.because the ij made no such finding here,we must assume that rawshan account of the february,meeting is accurate.
for completeness sake,we further observe that nothing in this record suggests that rawshan account of his meeting with speyer was inaccurate.the ij cited three pieces of evidence that could have been thought to undercut rawshan testimony,but,on close examination,none of them can fairly be read to do so.
for one,the ij noted that rawshan father,khodarahm roshan nehad khodarahm submitted an affidavit that made no mention of the february,meeting in which speyer allegedly announced his plans to withdraw as counsel.this,according to the ij,was a problem because rawshan testified that khodarahm was present at that meeting,and thus could have testified to its proceedings.before us,the government relies on this inconsistency between rawshan affidavit and khodarahm affidavit to argue that rawshan account was properly discounted.but khodarahm affidavit was submitted and cited by rawshan in his reply to the government opposition to his motion to reopen solely to address the government argument that rawshan did not have a fear of persecution at the hands of the taliban.in his affidavit,khodarahm attested that he served the united states government as a translator at guantanamo bay,and that his service would lead the taliban to view his son rawshan as a political enemy.khodarahm affidavit was not written to address any facts related to speyer performance rather,it was written to offer testimony on a subject about which only khodarahm could reliably testify his employment and its relationship to his son fear of persecution.no rule of law required rawshan attorney to craft the affidavit to discuss the issue in addition to the issue,so it is inappropriate to label this omission an inconsistency,or to draw an inference against rawshan testimony on this basis.
second,the ij observed that speyer did not make a formal motion to withdraw,seeming to imply that this fact somehow undercut rawshan testimony.to the contrary,the lack of any formal motion to withdraw is entirely consistent with rawshan story.according to rawshan,speyer announced his intention to withdraw if rawshan proceeded with his asylum claim.because rawshan agreed to voluntary departure,speyer did not move to withdraw.
third,the ij seemed to rely on speyer response to rawshan bar complaint.in that letter,however,speyer did not deny rawshan allegations.instead,he stated that i n view of new counsel acceptance of the case,and rawshan position expressed in his declaration,i do not believe rule of the california rules of professional conduct governing withdrawal applies here.what point speyer was trying to make is obscure,but there is little question that his statement did not expressly deny or rebut the basic allegation that he intended to withdraw from the case if it progressed beyond the february,hearing.since speyer response did not address whether he planned to withdraw as counsel,it can not constitute substantial evidence in rebuttal of that proposition.
before us,the government relies on its trial counsel affidavit to the effect that speyer did a worthy job on behalf of his client.given the nature of this declaration,it seems,at best,deserving of minimal weight and,indeed,the ij did not address it.perhaps more importantly,while the government affiant stated that speyer was zealous and that he unsuccessfully sought the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in his client behalf with vigor at an early stage of the removal proceedings,the affiant said nothing about the events at the center of this dispute whether speyer threatened to withdraw as counsel if rawshan proceeded with his asylum application.indeed,the affiant could not address that issue,as only speyer,rawshan,and khodarahm were present when withdrawal was discussed.
as stated,it is not clear what factual findings the ij intended to make.to whatever extent the ij found that speyer did not announce any intention to withdraw from the case,that finding is not based on substantial evidence.nothing in the record contradicts rawshan affidavit,the only account of what transpired between attorney and client.we proceed under the assumption that rawshan account of his meeting with speyer is accurate.
taking rawshan testimony as true,on february,speyer presented rawshan with his inability to continue with the representation beyond that day hearing,without any explanation of how rawshan might obtain new counsel or even that he could likely obtain a continuance to do so a new negative assessment of the merits of rawshan claim and an offer of voluntary departure,without any exploration of other options,asking for a continuance to obtain new counsel,requesting voluntary departure at the conclusion of removal proceedings,all within hours of a scheduled hearing.these circumstances are coercive.it is unsurprising that rawshan concluded that he had no real option but to accept voluntary departure as far as he knew,the only other option was to proceed pro se,which,understandably,seemed untenable.crediting rawshan account,speyer presentation misrepresented the situation by failing to explain to rawshan that speyer could only be released from his obligation to represent rawshan by the immigration court,and that speyer had a duty to withdraw,if the ij were to permit withdrawal,in a way that would not cause rawshan prejudice,which would include giving rawshan reasonable notice and time to secure new counsel.these omissions left rawshan with a grossly inaccurate understanding of his options,and effectively coerced him into accepting voluntary departure.
in rejecting the conclusion that speyer conduct constituted ineffective assistance,the bia and ij seemed to rely primarily on speyer response to rawshan bar complaint citing a conflict between rawshan and his sister over litigation strategy.it is unclear from the two opinions what precise question of fact speyer letter was thought to resolve,but it appears that the ij and bia concluded that speyer suggested voluntary departure in good faith to resolve some conflict between rawshan and his sister.we can not approve drawing any such conclusion from speyer letter.the letter is delphic at best it does not offer an account of the february,meeting,nor does it explain the reasoning that undergirded advising rawshan to accept voluntary departure.while the letter asserts disagreement with rawshan bar complaint,it lacks additional substance.though the letter states that speyer perceived a conflict between rawshan and his sister,it explains neither the content of that conflict nor how the conflict played into speyer decision to advise voluntary departure.in addition,the letter asserts that speyer thought that voluntary departure would accord with everyone wishes,but it is devoid of any reasoning or explanation that might support that assertion not to mention the fact that speyer duty was to rawshan,not to anyone else.in short,because the letter lacks any explanatory details,it can not serve as substantial evidence for any factual determination that speyer recommendation was
