opinion of the court 
a distinguished judge of the united states bankruptcy court for the district of new jersey found that petitions filed seriatim under chapter and chapter of the bankruptcy code,and quickly dismissed,were filed in bad faith in a blatant abuse of the bankruptcy code and the bankruptcy court.refusing to allow the court to be used as a litigation tool,sanctions were imposed under on a finding that the reprehensible conduct of counsel fell well within that statute by having multiplied the proceedings unreasonably and vexatiously.
we will shortly turn our attention to the specific conduct which led to the imposition of sanctions,and simply note at this juncture that any suggestion that sanctions were not warranted or should not have been awarded would be absurd.the question before us,however,is not as simple as whether sanctions were in order rather,the question before us is this did the bankruptcy court err when it reversed itself after it came to believe that we would invalidate the award under our pensiero supervisory rule and more about that the motion seeking sanctions was not filed until after the entry of final judgment.although convinced that sanctions were warranted,the bankruptcy court regretfully vacated the award,and the district court affirmed.
we have not in a precedential opinion addressed certain of the issues the bankruptcy court and the district court so thoughtfully addressed.because we have not done so,it is not surprising that those courts did not accurately predict what we would do.we will vacate the order of the district court and remand for further proceedings.
on may,a mere eight days after it was formally incorporated as a business entity,appellee schaefer salt recovery,ssr filed a bare bones petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of new jersey.ssr only assets were mortgages on three properties as to which tax lien foreclosure actions brought by appellant carol segal segal were pending in the superior court of new jersey.ssr vice president and counsel,appellee nicholas khoudary khoudary,advised segal counsel that the foreclosure actions were stayed as a result of the filing and concomitantly filed notices of bankruptcy filing in segal foreclosure actions.presumably the automatic stay was one of the reasons why khoudary advised segal counsel that segal was skunked.
on june,segal moved to dismiss the chapter petition for cause pursuant to b and a,arguing that the petition had been filed for the sole purpose of frustrating segal efforts to conclude the pending foreclosure actions.by order dated july,the bankruptcy court granted the motion,dismissing the petition on a finding that it had been filed in bad faith,but striking language in the proposed order that would have barred ssr from filing another petition for one hundred and eighty days.
following the dismissal,the foreclosure actions were reinstated in the superior court.on august,in response to what segal describes as this latest stalling tactic,br.at,the superior court granted segal motion to strike ssr answers,finding that they set forth no genuine issue of material fact and no legally sufficient defense,and ordered the foreclosure actions to go forward as uncontested matters.that same day,ssr filed a new petition in the bankruptcy court,this time pursuant to chapter,for no apparent reason other than to cause the automatic stay to again kick in.
on august,segal filed a motion to dismiss the chapter petition for cause pursuant to a and a.in support of his motion for a short return date,segal argued that ssr had no creditors and no assets other than the purported mortgages,and that this latest filing was nothing more than a transparent litigation strategy to delay the foreclosure actions then scheduled to take place in three days.
a hearing date was set for august.on that date,khoudary advised the bankruptcy court that ssr consented to the dismissal of the chapter petition and that he saw no need to appear.the court placed its ruling on the record in the presence of segal counsel.
we received some calls from khoudary indicating that he would voluntarily dismiss the bankruptcy proceeding due to his health and so on,that he could be here.now i have no problem accepting that offer,with this proviso in light of the dismissal of the case by the court not quite eight weeks ago.
i n light of the timing of the most recent filing,i am going to do a court order which dismisses the case and imposes a day bar on the filing of any petition under any chapter of the bankruptcy code.i found the last filing to be a bad faith filing.i warned the parties and indeed i indicated i expected that knowing the court position khoudary well knew the law and would not be so foolish as to file a case that did not meet the requirements of a good faith filing so i struck the day bar order language in the prior order while the old adage,fool me once,shame on you,fool me twice,shame on me,is that to be put into effect here.i take a voluntary dismissal,i reflect that in my order that i imposing a day bar order.i will not allow this bankruptcy court to be used as a litigation tool by a party who in truth has not so much a reorganizational intent,but intends to use the bankruptcy court as an offensive weapon.that kind of use,frankly,offends not only the court but the bankruptcy code.
the court promptly entered an order granting the motion to dismiss,noting that ssr consents to dismissal,and prohibiting ssr from filing another petition under the bankruptcy code for one hundred and eighty days.
nine days later,on september,segal moved under rule of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure and the court inherent power for costs and attorneys fees against ssr and khoudary for filing successive,frivolous bankruptcy petitions.on september,the court heard argument,and concluded that although it had some question as to whether rule applie d given that the matter is already adjudicated,that did not end the matter.
w hat frustrates me about this case is on its face,in my view,both the filing and most particularly the filing were,in fact,abuse of the bankruptcy process.
of bankruptcy petition is a proper defensive weapon both for a debtor to preserve an asset and to insure payment to creditors.it not an offensive weapon,and in both instances that what schaefer salt recovery did.let us not forget that schaefer salt recovery was rapidly created to hold this mortgage,filed the first without the benefit of counsel,notwithstanding it a corporation,and indeed filed this second filing.it not clear to me whether you,khoudary,was sic acting as the counsel for your own corporation or not,but it strikes me that this falls well within the purview of the statute dealing with vexatious litigation where the filings are designed and do,in fact,unreasonably multiply litigation that has resulted not only in the consumption of bankruptcy court resources but a back and forth in the state court.
the court,therefore,awarded attorneys fees and costs against khoudary under,but only for the unnecessary return trip to bankruptcy court in the context of the chapter because the court did not believe that the statute would cover the earlier filing.the court directed counsel for segal to submit a certification of fees and costs,and counsel did so,but the certification inexplicably fell through the cracks and an order granting sanctions in a specific amount was not entered.
by opinion and order dated august,the bankruptcy court reversed the award of sanctions,having determined,after further review,that the request for sanctions was first made after the entry of final judgment and thus was untimely under the supervisory rule we adopted in mary ann pensiero,lingle,cir,for violations of rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.the bankruptcy court,relying on a opinion of this court which held that the pensiero supervisory rule applies to bankruptcy court proceedings even where a de minimis period of time had elapsed after final judgment,found that the supervisory rule was a bright line rule from which,nine days after final judgment,the second not appropriate the bankruptcy court concluded that it would be reasonable to expect us to view sanctions under in the same manner as we viewed rule sanctions and sanctions under a court inherent power.
segal moved for reconsideration,a motion the bankruptcy court regretfully denied.the court explained 
b elieve me,schaefer salt and the attorney,khoudary richly deserved a sanction,the problem is,the timing with which it was done i was thinking,frankly,when i awarded sanctions as to whether i was within the scope of my authority to do so,because frankly i was so aggravated at the blatant,blatant misuse of the bankruptcy code,that i did think about the fact that as i put it before,that i do have this unlimited equity wand.
i t was not a voluntary dismissal.the matter came on in front of me on a shorten time motion to dismiss brought by your client.the hearing that i held was based on the motion by your client.ca even imagine what led khoudary to finally in his skirmishing,file this letter voluntarily withdrawing the schaefer salt bankruptcy.it does matter what he was thinking.the court held a hearing on the motion of siegel sic,the court issued an order based on siegel sic motion.that the court order i not free to ignore third circuit case law.believe me,i would like to ignore it.i find,frankly,the conduct and i looking directly at khoudary to be unprofessional and particularly inappropriate for someone who is not unfamiliar with bankruptcy practice.at a minimum,i think probably a couple of rpcs were violated,which i probably should have noted for the appropriate parties,but in light of the third circuit supervisory rule,i ca issue the sanctions.i wish i could.
segal appealed both the denial of the motion for sanctions and the denial of the motion for reconsideration to the district court.the district court concluded that although we had not yet extended the supervisory rule to sanctions under bankruptcy rule or,it saw no reason why rule and sanctions should be treated differently than sanctions under rule and a court inherent power.accordingly,the district court affirmed the orders of the bankruptcy court,carefully explaining why 
we applaud the careful consideration given this case by the bankruptcy court and the district court,and turn to the issues before us.in determining whether the district court erred in its disposition of segal appeal from the bankruptcy court,we review the bankruptcy court orders applying the standard it was appropriate for the district court to apply.see universal minerals,hughes,cir.because the bankruptcy court denial of sanctions and denial of segal motion for reconsideration were based on statutory interpretation and legal analysis only,our review is plenary.
the purpose of rule is to deter litigation abuse that is the result of a particular pleading,written motion,or other paper and,thus,streamline litigation.in pensiero,concerned with the appropriate time for the filing and disposition of.motions,we crafted a supervisory rule that all motions requesting rule sanctions must be filed in the district court before the entry of a final judgment where such motions arise out of conduct that occurred prior to the final judgment.at.the district court had granted summary judgment to the defendant and the case was on appeal.while the appeal was pending,the defendant moved for sanctions against the plaintiff under rule,and the district court granted the motion.on plaintiff appeal of the award of sanctions,we reversed,concluding that,in the context of rule sanctions,a supervisory rule was justified to eliminate piecemeal appeals and to deter further violations of rule later in that proceeding.we have since extended pensiero to a district court sua sponte imposition of sanctions,concluding that the court should decide the issue prior to or concurrent with its disposition of the case on the merits,simmerman corino,cir,and to sanctions awarded under a court inherent power,prosser prosser,cir in simmerman,the sanction we invalidated was imposed three months after entry of the final order in prosser,the sanction we invalidated was imposed more than thirty months after the final order.most recently,albeit in dicta,we observed that a n obvious corollary to requiring parties to file their rule motion prior to final judgment and requiring district courts when imposing sanctions sua sponte to do so prior to or contemporaneously with final judgment is that district courts must resolve any issues about imposition of sanctions prior to,or contemporaneously with,entering final judgment.gary braddock cemetery,cir.in accordance with the pensiero line of cases,district courts and bankruptcy courts have been applying,with some regularity,the supervisory rule to sanctions sought under rule,a court inherent power,and bankruptcy rule,rule being in most respects a twin of rule tweaked for the bankruptcy setting.
we have not decided in a precedential opinion whether the pensiero supervisory rule applies to bankruptcy court proceedings.that having been said,preventing piecemeal appeals and deterring future abuse are,like mom and apple pie,good things whatever the court,and so it would seem,at least at first blush,that the supervisory rule should apply to proceedings in the bankruptcy court as well as to those in the district court.certainly,district courts and bankruptcy courts in the third circuit believe that to be so.see,in re tobacco,lp,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,applying supervisory rule to bankruptcy rule after finding it likely that third circuit would do so in re brown,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,noting that pensiero rule applies to rule sanctions as well as rule sanctions raymark,baron,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.june,although third circuit has yet to rule on issue,rationale for supervisory rule applied to rule sanctions is same for rule sanctions in re hsr,motion for sanctions under rule untimely under pensiero.
for the following reasons,we need not decide whether,given the facts of this case,the supervisory rule applies to sanctions sought in bankruptcy court under rule,bankruptcy rule,or a court inherent power.it is well established,and we recognized in pensiero,that a district court,after the entry of final judgment and the filing of a notice of appeal,retains the power to adjudicate collateral matters such as sanctions under rule.pensiero,at.indeed,citing pensiero and as relevant here,we have held that a district court has jurisdiction to impose sanctions under rule even though the motion seeking the sanctions was filed after the filing of a notice of voluntary dismissal under rule a i.schering vitarine,cir.
to hold that a district court has no power to order sanctions after a voluntary dismissal is to emasculate rule in those cases where wily plaintiffs file baseless complaints,unnecessarily sap the precious resources of their adversaries and the courts,only to insulate themselves from sanctions by promptly filing a notice of dismissal.

in schering,we did not even mention the supervisory rule and the prudential reasons underlying that rule,much less did we find that sanctions were barred even though the motion for sanctions was filed almost one and months after the filing of the notice of dismissal.presumably we did not find the supervisory rule worthy of mention because where there is a voluntary dismissal,there is no danger of piecemeal appeals and no future conduct to deter,the predominant justifications for the rule.
it is,thus,fair to say,given schering,that even if the supervisory rule were to apply to bankruptcy court proceedings,a bankruptcy court would not run afoul of that rule if it were to impose sanctions,at least under rule,following,as here,a voluntary dismissal of one or both of the underlying bankruptcy petitions moreover,we have held,albeit before the amendments to rule and the amendments to bankruptcy rule,that rule is the equivalent sanctions rule under title to rule.see stuebben gioioso in re gioioso,cir landon hunt,cir.rule,it is clear,discourages in bankruptcy proceedings the same conduct proscribed by rule or advocating to the court a paper that violates the certification standard of the the purpose of both rules being to deter baseless filings.accordingly,there appears to be no reason,at least with reference to a voluntary dismissal,to come to a different conclusion under rule.
we have just referred to the amendments to rule and the amendments to bankruptcy rule.the revisions were substantial,particularly the addition of safe harbor provisions which explicitly place greater restrictions on the imposition of sanctions,including a significant change in the timing of and decision on rule and rule motions.under amended rule and amended rule,a party can not file a motion for sanctions or submit such a motion to the court if the challenged paper,claim,defense,contention,or denial is withdrawn or corrected within days after service of the motion on the offending party.c fed.c.if the day period is not provided,the motion must be denied.the purpose of the safe harbor is to give parties the opportunity to correct their errors,with the practical effect being that a party can not delay serving its rule motion or,we suggest,its rule motion until conclusion of the case or judicial rejection of the offending contention.advisory committee notes to amendments.we wonder,then,whether the supervisory rule,which we adopted in t o carry out the objectives of expeditious disposition,pensiero,at,retains much if any viability following the and amendments to rules and as has been noted with reference to rule,t his safe harbor has had the salutary effect of reducing rule volume while at the same time accomplishing the goal of the litigation by eliminating abuses proscribed by the rule.it has the merit of doing so without burdening the court.gregory joseph sanctions the federal law of litigation abuse a,at ed 
and we wonder whether,at least in one important respect,bankruptcy rule is really the equivalent sanctions rule to rule.bankruptcy proceedings are unique,witness,for example,the automatic stay.under the bankruptcy code,the filing of a petition for bankruptcy operates,with some exceptions,as a stay of the commencement or continuation of certain judicial,administrative,or other actions or proceedings against the debtor,enforcement of judgments against a debtor or the property of the estate,and other acts by creditors against debtors.a.the purpose of the automatic stay is to afford the debtor a breathing spell by halting the collection process.it enables the debtor to attempt a repayment or reorganization plan with an aim toward satisfying existing debt.in re siciliano,cir.it also benefits creditors by preventing certain creditors from acting unilaterally to obtain payment from the debtor to the detriment of other creditors.maritime,united jersey bank,cir.
congress addressed the serious consequences of the automatic stay by adding an exception to the safe harbor provision in the amendments to bankruptcy rule when the offending paper is a petition for bankruptcy,something it did not do in the amendments to rule in fed.c a.this,of course,renders meritless appellees argument that because the chapter petition was voluntarily dismissed within the day safe harbor period of rule,segal received the relief he had demanded and could not,therefore,seek sanctions.congress explained the reason for the bankruptcy petition exception 
the filing of a petition has immediate serious consequences,including the imposition of the automatic stay under of the code,which may not be avoided by the subsequent withdrawal of the petition.in addition,a petition for relief under chapter or chapter may not be withdrawn unless the court orders dismissal of the case for cause after notice and a hearing.
fed.advisory committee notes to amendments.the exception evidences a concern that a party subject to an automatic stay would be forced to choose between seeking sanctions,which would require it to wait up to days before seeking dismissal of the petition,and the immediate filing of a motion to dismiss the bad faith petition.without the exception,a party would be forced to abandon its request for sanctions in order to seek dismissal of the petition as quickly as possible.
fortunately,we are able to leave these interesting issues to another day,and move to,the statute on which the bankruptcy court based its award of sanctions against khoudary,only to later reverse itself anticipating that we would do so if it did not.unlike rule and bankruptcy rule,which are lengthy and impose specific procedural requirements with which a party seeking sanctions must comply,is short and clear

the bankruptcy court and the district court both believed that we would apply the supervisory rule with its rule foundation to sanctions under given how the supervisory rule had been reaffirmed and,in fact,extended by us in simmerman,prosser,and gary.but there are distinctions between rule and bankruptcy rule and,distinctions which make a difference.importantly,for example,explicitly covers only the multiplication of proceedings that prolong the litigation of a case and likely not the initial pleading,as the proceedings in a case can not be multiplied until there is a case 
the tenth circuit discussed our supervisory rule,but essentially dismissed it,and concluded that a motion under is not untimely if made after final judgment.
although the third circuit has adopted a supervisory rule that sanction issues under rule and the inherent power of the court must be decided before or concurrent to the final judgment,we see no reason to extend such a rule to in this circuit.unlike rule,the application of may become apparent only at or after the litigation end,given that the inquiry is whether the proceedings have been unreasonably and vexatiously multiplied.even the third circuit seems to recognize that rule does not require such a protracted scrutiny,because rule focuses only on a challenged pleading or written motion.sanctions are also capable of a narrow focus,as the inquiry is whether a person has abused the judicial process by acting in bad faith,vexatiously,wantonly,or for oppressive reasons.but we need not decide whether that capability necessarily allows a court to reach abusive conduct earlier through its inherent power than through.we simply conclude that sanctions are not untimely if sought or imposed after final judgment.
