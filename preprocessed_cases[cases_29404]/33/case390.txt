brent wilkes appeals his convictions on multiple counts of conspiracy,honest services wire fraud,bribery,and money laundering.this case centered around the political corruption of former california congressman randall duke cunningham,who provided lucrative government defense contracts to wilkes and others in exchange for expensive meals,lavish trips,a houseboat in washington,and mortgage payments for his dollar home in san diego county.wilkes appeals his convictions.
brent wilkes,a san diego native,worked as an accountant in the early.in,he became a lobbyist for audre,a san diego based software company.as audre lobbyist,wilkes met with members of congress to sell audre document conversion system to government agencies.wilkes left audre in.in,wilkes drafted a congressional proposal for a program to convert documents into electronic format,which he named automated data conversion systems adcs program.wilkes then started his own company named after that program,adcs,adcs.in may,wilkes hired his nephew,joel combs,to work as a software person for adcs.wilkes later hired a consultant,mitchell wade,to assist adcs in obtaining government contracts.michael williams was also hired as vice president of operations for adcs.
from adcs inception,wilkes traveled from san diego to washington,to meet with congressmen cunningham and duncan hunter to secure the appropriation of federal funding for the adcs program.in,cunningham was appointed to the house appropriations committee,which had the power to add money to the president budget.to solicit his support for adcs programs,wilkes expended tens of thousands of dollars on meals for cunningham,treated the congressman to trips,and devised a plan to give cunningham over disguised as payments for wilkes purchase of the kelly c,the houseboat on which cunningham lived while in washington.in return for the benefits he gave cunningham,wilkes received government contracts worth millions of dollars through cunningham earmarks.
in,with cunningham support,adcs received a government contract to scan documents in panama for the department of defense dod.wilkes regularly billed the government for poor work,work never done,and equipment he supposedly bought for the government.when government officials expressed their concerns about adcs,wilkes used cunningham influence to pressure them to continue to fund contracts for the company.
in,wilkes and cunningham began seeking government funding through another document scanning and conversion program called the global infrastructure data capture program gidc.when the dod decided to redirect millions of dollars from wilkes scanning project to another use,wade,acting on wilkes behalf,threatened to have a dod official fired.cunningham intervened,and government officials caved in to his pressure by diverting to wilkes millions of dollars from funds.
in,wilkes and wade shifted their focus from contracts for document conversion to contracts to supply equipment and software for the office of the secretary of defense osd.wade testified that,with cunningham support,he and wilkes marked up by as much as the price of equipment they sold to the government.despite the high profit margins on the supply contracts,wilkes and wade failed to deliver the equipment that was requested by the government.
by,wade also began building his own relationship with cunningham and made various secret payoffs to the congressman.in,wade had managed to insert his own company,mzm,in place of adcs,as the prime contractor for the osd contract.cunningham made additional appropriations requests for mzm.
in august,seeing that wade earmarks were getting bigger,wilkes treated cunningham to a lavish hawaiian vacation filled with a variety of diversions including fine dining,scuba diving,and evenings with prostitutes.in return,cunningham earmarked million for wilkes and wade as part of the gidc program the following month and listed gidc as one of his two top priorities in.
in,cunningham was responsible for securing millions of dollars in appropriations for wilkes and wade benefit.in exchange,wade paid off a first mortgage in cunningham residence in the amount of and,through a complicated series of financial transactions among multiple companies,wilkes paid off on cunningham second mortgage.
in,the san diego union tribune published an article exposing wade bribery scheme.wade began cooperating with prosecutors.in august,adcs offices were searched,and wilkes business records and computers were seized.
on february,a federal grand jury returned a count indictment against wilkes.on may,a federal grand jury returned a count superseding indictment against wilkes.wilkes jury trial commenced on october.at trial,wilkes requested immunity for defense witness michael williams,who he contended would offer testimony that contradicted the testimony of several immunized prosecution witnesses.the district court denied wilkes request based on its conclusion that it could not compel a defense witness immunity absent a finding of prosecutorial misconduct.
on november,after four days of deliberation,the jury found wilkes guilty on thirteen counts one count of conspiracy,ten counts of honest services wire fraud and,one count of bribery of a public official,and one count of money laundering a b i.after the district court discharged the jury,it imposed criminal forfeiture against wilkes in the amount of.the district court also imposed a fine against wilkes in the amount of.
the district court issued its written judgment on february.wilkes timely filed his notice of appeal on february.the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to.this court has jurisdiction to review the district court final judgment pursuant to.
wilkes challenges his convictions on multiple grounds.first,he argues that his fifth and sixth amendment rights were violated when the district court declined to compel use immunity for defense witness michael williams.having reviewed this issue de novo,we remand in part for an evidentiary hearing regarding whether the district court should have granted williams use immunity pursuant to united states straub,cir,a case decided by this court after the district court declined to grant use immunity to williams.
wilkes also argues on appeal that his fifth and sixth amendment rights were violated when prosecutors failed to comply with the mandates of brady maryland,and giglio.united states,when prosecutors committed misconduct by engaging in improper closing arguments and,when the district court refused to grant wilkes request to continue the trial to allow time for him to prepare.wilkes further contends that there was insufficient evidence of honest services fraud,bribery,and money laundering to support his convictions,and that the jury was misinstructed on those offenses.he also maintains that the recent holding in skilling united states.compels reversal on all counts because the prosecution relied on multiple honest services fraud theories,including the theory later invalidated in skilling.finally,wilkes asserts that the criminal forfeiture judgment violates the sixth amendment since the jury did not return a verdict on that charge.we affirm because we conclude the district court did not commit reversible error in its rulings on these issues.
wilkes argues that his fifth and sixth amendment rights were violated when the district court declined to compel use immunity for defense witness williams.the question of whether a district court erred by refusing to compel use immunity is a mixed question of law and fact that we review de novo.factual findings underlying the district court ruling are reviewed for clear error.straub,at citing united states alvarez,cir.
wilkes maintains that the district court should have compelled the prosecution to grant use immunity to defense witness williams because had he been granted immunity,his testimony would have corroborated wilkes testimony and directly contradicted the testimony of immunized government witnesses.the government contends that wilkes was not entitled to compelled use immunity for williams because wilkes failed to provide a valid offer of proof of williams testimony in the presence of the witness counsel and counsel for the government.wilkes ex parte proffer to the district court was thus meaningless,the government argues,because there was no reason to believe williams would have testified as wilkes proffered.
at trial,the district court concluded that wilkes had demonstrated williams would invoke his fifth amendment privilege if called to testify,and that the exercise of that privilege would be valid.over the objection of the government,the district court allowed the defense to make a proffer as to williams testimony at an ex parte sidebar conference.the transcript of the proffer was filed under seal.the government did not have access to defense counsel proffer to the district court until we granted its motion to have those portions of the record unsealed just prior to oral argument in this appeal.the transcript of the sidebar conference indicates that williams would testify that 
in he began working with adcs as part of his employment.he began managing and overseeing all major projects,especially and including the panama project.he oversaw all the work.there was real work being performed.he would testify about adverse conditions that work was being done sic,the timetable and the fact that the employees were working long hours.he would testify about the equipment that wilkes purchased on his own and brought to panama.the dispute about the barcoding of the equipment and he would also be greatly important to the relationship between the prime contractor to that which was mcsi he can speak to joel combs and what combs did or did do,even though combs readily admits he is a ball dropper g iven the proper context,williams can explain this gentleman intent to go off on his own which is going to be central to the defense.
the district court concluded that g iven the proffer of wilkes counsel at sidebar,i find that williams would have admissible relevant testimony to offer.it would not be cumulative.and given the proffer,as i said,it would be exculpatory.er.the district court stated 
i have to tell you the proffer i have as to what this fellow can offer strikes me as material and relevant evidence that the defense would want to present to counter some of what been presented by the united states through immunized witnesses.
the court,having fully heard all counsel,denies the motion to convey use immunity.here,as i said,unless it somehow tethered to the suggestion of prosecutorial misconduct,i do think it appropriate for the court to make determinations of who gets immunity and who does.
in the first instance,under our system of government,that a prosecutorial decision.and unless i can find that the way in which discretion was exercised was unfair so as to deny the defendant a due process right,then it not appropriate for me to substitute my judgment for that of the prosecutor.i do have a concern about the effect of not granting immunity in this case,but i would have the same concern if it was a different privilege implicated over which i have no authority to pierce the privilege and order a witness to testify,any number of other privileges.so it an effect that the criminal justice system lives with and accommodates.and that alone,contrary to a broad reading of westerdahl,is not sufficient to authorize me to exercise authority to grant use immunity pursuant to.
after wilkes was convicted,this court clarified the test by which the defendant may seek to compel the prosecutor to grant use immunity as a matter of due process.in straub,we held that a district court can compel a defense witness immunity absent a finding of prosecutorial misconduct,where in exceptional cases,the process may be so distorted through the prosecution decisions to grant immunity to its own witness while denying immunity to a witness with directly contradictory testimony that the defendant due process right to a fair trial is violated.straub,at.under the clarified test,the defendant must first show that the defense witness testimony was relevant.id.at.second,the defendant must show either that 
a the prosecution intentionally caused the defense witness to invoke the fifth amendment right against with the purpose of distorting the process or b the prosecution granted immunity to a government witness in order to obtain that witness testimony,but denied immunity to a defense witness whose testimony would have directly contradicted that of the government witness,with the effect of so distorting the process that the defendant was denied his due process right to a fundamentally fair trial.
id.at.the relevance requirement is minimal,and t he defendant need not show that the testimony sought was either clearly exculpatory or essential to the defense.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.moreover,the test requires only that the proffered defense testimony directly contradict s the government witness testimony on a relevant issue,not that the testimony would have compelled the jury to exonerate the defendant.id.t estimony satisfies the test for directly contradictory where the testimony,if believed by the jury,could have supported a finding that the testimony directly contradicted that of the government witness.id.
here,the district court concluded that wilkes had proffered testimony by williams that would have been material and relevant evidence that the defense would want to present to counter some of what been presented by the united states through immunized witnesses.the district court also repeatedly expressed its concern that not granting williams immunity would have the effect of distorting the process.the court nonetheless refused to compel use immunity because it concluded that it was powerless to do so absent a finding of prosecutorial misconduct.
the government argues on appeal that there was no distortion of the process because williams testimony would not directly contradict the testimony of immunized government witnesses.thus,the government maintains,the refusal to immunize williams did not distort the process in any away whatsoever,let alone to such an extent as to deny wilkes a fundamentally fair trial.the district court concluded,however,that the proffered testimony would counter the testimony presented by the prosecution through immunized government witnesses,and the government did not challenge that finding as clearly erroneous.
in view of this court ruling in straub that a finding of prosecutorial misconduct is not required to compel use immunity,this matter must be remanded to the district court for an evidentiary hearing so the trial court can gather greater detail about williams proposed testimony and the immunity agreements the government gave to its other witnesses to determine whether compelled use immunity was constitutionally required.straub,at internal quotation marks omitted.
wilkes argues that his fifth and sixth amendment rights were violated when prosecutors failed to disclose evidence about cooperating witnesses as required under the holdings of brady,and giglio.he also argues that prosecutors committed misconduct by unlawfully disclosing grand jury information before the commencement of the trial.wilkes further contends that the prosecution committed misconduct by making improper arguments in summation.alleged brady and giglio violations are reviewed de novo.united states blanco,cir.prosecutorial misconduct is reviewed for plain error where,as here,a defendant fails to object at trial.united states moreland,cir citing.b.

there are three elements of a violation the evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused,either because it is exculpatory,or because it is impeaching that evidence must have been suppressed by the state,either willfully or inadvertently and prejudice must have ensued.id.at quoting united states williams,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also strickler greene.wilkes has not established any violations under brady or giglio because he has not shown prejudice.the evidence about cooperating witnesses that wilkes alleges was improperly withheld did not contain any new impeachment information and would therefore be unlikely to have altered the verdict.brady,at giglio,at.
at trial,the prosecution explained that the decision to grant combs immunity was the result of months of based on proffers.er.the proffer sessions,however,were not provided to the defense.wilkes contends that giglio united states,required disclosure of combs proffer sessions,not merely his fbi interviews.appellant br.wilkes maintains that suppression of the proffer sessions undermined confidence in the verdict because prosecutors told jurors that combs had no incentive to lie,while withholding evidence casting doubt upon his credibility.appellant reply br.
wilkes has not cited any authority,and we have found none,holding that the government must disclose all proffers irrespective of whether the proffers contain information subject to disclosure under brady or giglio.while evidence that impeaches a witness credibility falls within the brady principle when the reliability of the witness may well be determinative of guilt or innocence,giglio,at,wilkes has failed to establish that the disclosure of the proffer sessions would have served to impeach combs credibility.he has also not demonstrated that any impeachment value would not have been cumulative.
this court has held that evidence is material if it is of a different character than evidence already known to the defense.kohring,at holding that evidence of a key witness prior sexual misconduct was material because it would have shed light on the magnitude of allen incentive to cooperate with authorities and would have revealed that he had much more at stake than was already known to the jury.evidence is cumulative,however,if the grounds for impeachment are no secret to the jury.id.at.here,the jury knew that combs had immunity and was also aware of combs involvement in the cunningham bribery scheme.
moreover,the government case did not hinge on combs testimony.while combs may have been a significant witness,the government presented over other witnesses and extensive documentary evidence of wilkes guilt.compare maxwell roe,cir finding brady violation where the jury assessment of the witness credibility was crucial to the outcome of the trial because the prosecution itself admitted that the evidence against the defendant was weak and if the jury had not believed the witness,the defendant may not have been convicted with heishman ayers,cir holding that there was no likelihood that the suppressed evidence,including proof of perjury,criminal activity and cooperation with the government,would have changed the jury verdict because it was similar to and cumulative of the extremely thorough impeachment during the witness.accordingly,wilkes has not demonstrated that there is a reasonable likelihood that the withheld information concerning combs proffer sessions would have changed the verdict.see giglio,at we do not automatically require a new trial whenever a combing of the prosecutors files after the trial has disclosed evidence possibly useful to the defense but not likely to have changed the verdict.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
five days after wade testified at wilkes trial but before the jury reached its verdict,wade settled his federal election commission fec criminal and civil liability in a conciliation agreement which imposed a fine upon him.wilkes contends that the government failure to disclose information concerning wade negotiation of criminal and civil liability with the fec undermined confidence in the verdict because the withheld evidence casts doubt upon wade credibility.wilkes argues that the fact that wade agreed to pay the fine within days reveals that wade had ready access to at least which could come from his admitted criminal activity fertile ground for cross examination denied to wilkes.appellant br.
t here is never a real brady violation unless the nondisclosure was so serious that there is a reasonable probability that the suppressed evidence would have produced a different verdict.strickler,at.wilkes has failed to establish that there is a reasonable probability that information concerning wade negotiation of criminal and civil liability with the fec would have altered the verdict.the jury was well aware of wade gains.both the government and wilkes elicited extensive testimony from wade that he made a great deal of money from his crimes,including tens of millions in appropriations for his own benefit and million through the sale of his business.the jury also heard argument from the government that mitch wade learned his lessons from brent wilkes.did he take it to another level you bet he did.is he a crook you bet he is.er.thus,there is no reasonable likelihood that the evidence of wade negotiation with the fec could have changed the jury verdict because it was similar to and cumulative of the extremely thorough impeachment during wade.see heishman,at a witness may be so thoroughly impeached that even evidence of perjury at trial is merely cumulative quoting united states polizzi,cir.
wilkes maintains that the prosecution pretrial unlawful disclosure of grand jury information compromised the grand jury independence and constituted structural error.to obtain reversal based on prosecutorial misconduct,a defendant must establish both misconduct and prejudice.united states wright,cir.a finding of prejudice requires that the conduct have some impact on the outcome of the proceeding,a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different or that it so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.hein sullivan,cir.
the district court found that before the february,indictment was issued,at least three newspaper articles were published identifying wilkes as a target of the grand jury probe and predicting that he would be indicted.the trial judge concluded that the public interest was at least temporarily compromised in this case by the irresponsible and illegal actions of one or more government agents who leaked secret grand jury information to news reporters,but that wilkes was not prejudiced by the alleged governmental misconduct in this case,and that it had no material e ffect on the verdict.doc.
as the government correctly asserts,grand jury leaks are the kind of errors that are rendered harmless by the trial jury verdict.see polizzi,at if a grand jury is prejudiced by outside sources when in fact there is insufficient evidence to indict,the greatest safeguard to the liberty of the accused is the petit jury and the rules governing its determination of a defendant guilt or innocence.quoting silverthorne united states,cir.wilkes does not contend,nor has he established,that the petit jury that convicted him was at all affected by information that was improperly leaked before the indictment issued.accordingly,wilkes has failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the leaking of secret grand jury information.
wilkes contends that prosecutors committed misconduct in their summation by making false and improper arguments.he maintains that the prosecutor argument that they did not call former congressman cunningham as a witness because they did not want to give him a sentence reduction was both improper and false.wilkes also maintains that prosecutors falsely argued that its witnesses had no motives to lie and improperly shifted the burden by informing the jury that in order to find wilkes not guilty,they had to believe his testimony.wilkes further argues that the prosecution improperly appealed to jurors passions and prejudices by repeatedly urging them to vindicate their rights and convict wilkes because he used their money.er.
in determining whether a prosecutor comment rendered a trial constitutionally unfair,this court considers the following factors 
whether the comment misstated the evidence,whether the judge admonished the jury to disregard the comment,whether the comment was invited by defense counsel in its summation,whether defense counsel had an adequate opportunity to rebut the comment,the prominence of the comment in the context of the entire trial and the weight of the evidence.

in closing argument,wilkes counsel stated to the jury why did the prosecution put congressman cunningham on they can say what they want.the fact that they did call him speaks volumes about the fact that they did believe him.er.in response,the government told the jury that it was not going to put the most corrupt politician in the history of this country on the witness stand and give him a chance to get a break in his sentence.er appellee br.wilkes contends that the prosecutors remarks to the jury concerning their reasons for not calling cunningham as a witness constitute prejudicial misconduct that violated his due process rights.appellant br.wilkes argues that the remarks were improper because they did not constitute evidence and prosecutors may not supply facts not in evidence as they may be given undue weight.see,united states kerr,cir a prosecutor has no business telling the jury his individual impressions of the evidence.wilkes further argues that the prosecutors purported reason for not calling cunningham that they did not want to give cunningham a reduction in his sentence was false.appellant br.wilkes points to a letter from cunningham,which reveals that he was waiting at court to testify but was told the judge rulings about the scope of rebuttal did permit it.appellant br.er.
the government argues that it has never used cunningham as a witness in any proceeding and that wilkes expressly invited the government to answer why cunningham was not called as a witness.appellee br.it further maintains that one of the reasons the government did not call cunningham at trial was because prosecutors did not trust him to refrain from fabricating testimony that he believed would help the prosecution and thus enhance his chances for a reduced sentence.id.the government notes that,although years before wilkes trial,the government had recommended a guidelines reduction for cunningham substantial assistance,that assistance was limited to waiving protections under the speech or debate clause and making phone calls to tommy kontogiannis,nothing requiring cunningham testimony.appellee br.
in united states young,the supreme court explained that courts should examine rebuttal arguments in the context of the arguments that they rebut.the court held that although the prosecutor expression of personal opinion as to the defendant guilt was improper,any potential harm from this remark was mitigated by the jury understanding that the prosecutor was countering defense counsel repeated attacks on the prosecution integrity and defense counsel argument that the evidence established no such crime.id.at.the court reasoned that the overwhelming evidence presented by the prosecution eliminates any lingering doubt that the prosecutor remarks unfairly prejudiced the jury deliberations or exploited the government prestige in the eyes of the jury.id.at.
here,as in young,wilkes invited the government to answer why it did not call cunningham as a witness.in addition,the government presented substantial evidence of wilkes conspiracy,fraud,bribery and money laundering,thereby eliminat ing any lingering doubt that the prosecutor remarks unfairly prejudiced the jury deliberations.id.
wilkes cites to united states kojayan,cir,which held that while the invited response doctrine from young may excuse certain arguments that would normally be reversible error,it ca sanitize the prosecutor misstatements to the jury.id.at.in kojayan,this court reversed the defendant conviction based on a prosecutor misstatement that the government was powerless to compel a witness to testify when,in fact,the witness had entered into a plea agreement with the government and had promised to testify at trial.id.at.wilkes,however,has failed to demonstrate that the prosecutor reasons for not calling cunningham as a witness constituted misstatements.while cunningham may have offered assistance to the government,he did not testify at any trial.in addition,prosecutors offered other legitimate reasons for not calling cunningham to the stand,including the fact that they did not think he could testify truthfully.
the district court in this case repeatedly instructed the jury that comments by counsel are not evidence.for instance,the court admonished the jury remember this should be engraved in the front of your foreheads now things that the lawyers say are not evidence.ser.this same admonishment was also included in the jury instructions sent into the jury room.see wright,at improper statements rendered harmless by court instruction that arguments by lawyers are not evidence.
wilkes expressly invited the government to explain its reasons for not calling cunningham as a witness.accordingly,the government statements were not improper and given the overwhelming evidence against wilkes in this case,wilkes has not demonstrated that these statements resulted in any prejudice.
wilkes contends that the prosecution improperly argued that their witnesses had no motive to lie.he asserts that this argument was clearly false in light of combs and wade criminal exposure,but also false as to the dod officials and lobbyists who faced possible repercussions for interactions with cunningham,or by signing off on certain contracts.appellant br.wilkes also maintains that the prosecutors vouched for combs credibility,telling the jury that his immunity agreement obligates him to tell the truth and querying why in the world,what incentive does he have to get up there and lie about his uncle there nothing.er.
vouching consists of placing the prestige of the government behind a witness through personal assurances of the witness veracity,or suggesting that information not presented to the jury supports the witness testimony.united states necoechea,cir.this court has found that vouching is especially problematic in cases where the credibility of the witness is crucial.id.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.prosecutors may,however,argue reasonable inferences based on the evidence,including that one of the two sides is lying.id.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.furthermore,prosecutors are permitted to respond to defense counsel attempts to impeach the credibility of government witnesses.see id.at finding the prosecutor did not improperly vouch by eliciting testimony about the truthfulness provision of a witness plea agreement because it was offered in response to defense counsel attacks on the witness credibility.thus,statements made by the prosecution do not constitute improper vouching where the argument that witnesses had no motive to lie is a permissible response to the defense counsel earlier attacks on the witnesses credibility.
here,wilkes counsel repeatedly offered his personal opinion that witnesses for the prosecution were lying and trying to mislead the jury throughout his closing argument.for example,defense counsel argued that,in his opinion,prosecution witness frank collins lied when he testified because frank collins has an ax to grind.er.defense counsel also told the jury that in his opinion,prosecution witness joel combs certainly tried to mislead you.er.further,defense counsel stated his opinion that one of the biggest problems in this case is that the prosecutors have consistently tried to mislead you,er by doing a a slight of hand during this trial and during their closing argument yesterday.er.
in rebuttal to defense counsel summation,the prosecution asked the jury 
do you think,ladies and gentlemen,over a dozen witnesses with absolutely no dog in this fight got up on the witness stand and lied to you or,ladies and gentlemen,do you think the defendant got up on the stand and lied to you the defendant,the man with more incentive,more motive to lie than all of the other witnesses combined of course he did.he had no choice.he was looking at a mountain of evidence.
er.the prosecutor argument that its witnesses told the truth,rather than wilkes,was not vouching but was simply an inference from evidence in the record.necoechea,at explaining that a prosecutor improperly vouches where he makes statements that bolster a government witness credibility by referring to facts not in the record,such as explaining why a witness did not testify against codefendants.in direct response to defense counsel express statements to the jury that government witnesses were lying,the prosecutor here merely argued that its witnesses were telling the truth an argument the prosecutor had to make in order to convict wilkes.id.that argument did not imply that the government had personal knowledge of or was assuring the veracity of its witnesses,and did not reflect the prosecutor personal beliefs.id.
moreover,wilkes has failed to establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of the alleged vouching.this was not a close case.while combs testimony may have significantly helped the government case,prosecutors also presented over other witnesses and extensive documentary evidence of wilkes guilt.see necoechea,at finding that even improper vouching did not require reversal because the witness testimony was thoroughly impeached,the jury was instructed that an attorney statements are not evidence,and,while the witness provided the strongest direct evidence of a crucial element in the prosecution case,there was significant circumstantial evidence that connected the defendant with the conspiracy.the government statement in closing argument that wade immunity obligated him to tell the truth was information the jury had already heard when defense counsel wade about his immunity and wade responded that it was only predicated on the truth.er see also er.
wilkes contends that prosecutors improperly told jurors that in order to find wilkes not guilty,they had to believe his testimony.appellant br.er you have to believe that preposterous charade to believe wilkes is not guilty.wilkes also maintains that it was impermissible for prosecutors to argue that each government witness,if you think about their testimony and what they told you,you either have to believe all of those people or you believe brent wilkes.that the choice before you.you ca believe both.er.
wilkes argues that united states perlaza,cir supports his contention that the government engaged in improper.in perlaza,this court reversed the defendant convictions because the prosecution erroneously told jurors that the presumption of innocence is going to vanish when you start deliberating.and that when the presumption of guilt is going to take over you.at emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.a misstatement of the government correct burden of persuasion is not,however,comparable to a prosecutor statement that the jury had to believe the defendant to believe he was not guilty.
the prosecution made the alleged improper statement after explaining at length to the jury what it had to prove in order for the jury to find wilkes guilty.in this context,such a statement is considered to be nothing more than an isolated moment in a day trial.see moreland,at not improper where the prosecution had reviewed the legal elements of what the jury would have to find in order to convict the defendant and statement was an isolated moment in a day trial internal citations omitted.in a case that essentially reduces to which of two conflicting stories is true,it may be reasonable to infer,and hence to argue,that one of two sides is lying.united states molina,cir see also moreland,at finding that the prosecution did not commit misconduct when it asked jurors to assess a witness credibility and once you conclude they not credible,case is over.
wilkes citation to united states stanfield,cir is equally unpersuasive.in stanfield,this court reversed because of improper statements by the trial judge where the judge undertook to make the opening statements for each side to the jury.by asking the jury,to look as you hear the evidence for what you will think in your own mind is the truthful version,this court found that the judge statements obscured the correct standard for jury consideration of evidence in a criminal case.id.at.unlike in stanfield,the statement that wilkes challenges was made by the prosecutor at closing argument,after the evidence had been presented to the jury.accordingly,the statement can not be said to have obscured the correct standard for jury consideration.wilkes has not established that the prosecutors engaged in improper,and has also failed to demonstrate that prejudice resulted from these statements.
wilkes argues that prosecutors improperly appealed to jurors passions and prejudices,repeatedly urging them to vindicate their own rights and convict wilkes because he used their money.er er.the government grounded its arguments in the instructions and proof,as indicated in the following statements,which wilkes now challenges 
if paying prostitutes to sleep with a congressman with whom you have business going on is not cheating us out of our rights to that congressman honest services,then our rights mean nothing.they worth nothing.but,you know,ladies and gentlemen,from the instructions,our rights do exist.they mean something.you will vindicate those rights here.
er.wilkes reliance on united states,cir is inappropriate because the statements in that case did not speak to the question of defendant guilt,but rather were clearly designed to encourage the jury to enter a verdict on the basis of emotion rather than fact.id.at.there,the government argued that c onvicting the defendant is gon na make you comfortable knowing there not convicted felons on the street with loaded handguns,that there not convicted felons carrying around semiautomatic id.at.moreover,unlike in weatherspoon,the government presented a strong case against wilkes and any harm that may have resulted from the above statements was mitigated by jury instructions stating that attorney statements are not evidence.id.at finding that improper vouching presented a strong possibility of prejudice where the case was not particularly strong and there was no adequate curative jury instruction.
wilkes has failed to show that the government improperly appealed to juror passions and prejudices.in light of the government strong case against wilkes and the court curative jury instruction,wilkes has also not demonstrated any prejudice.
wilkes maintains that this court should analyze the overall cumulative impact of all errors upon the fundamental fairness of the trial.appellant br.he contends that the violations,the grand jury violations,and the false and improper arguments,separately and cumulatively require reversal.appellant br.
in some cases,although no single trial error examined in isolation is sufficiently prejudicial to warrant reversal,the cumulative effect of multiple errors may still prejudice a defendant.united states frederick,cir.w here the government case is weak,a defendant is more likely to be prejudiced by the effect of cumulative errors.id.our court is particularly sensitive to allegations of prejudice where,as here,the convictions are based on largely uncorroborated testimony of a single accomplice or.united states wallace,cir.
