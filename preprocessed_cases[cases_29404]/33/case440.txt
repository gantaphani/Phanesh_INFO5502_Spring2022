defendant basho elliot is charged with cocaine offenses.at jury trial,during of a defense witness,an apparent conflict of interest arose involving elliot lead counsel,who appeared to have previously represented one of the defendant key witnesses in connection with relevant matters.elliot and his counsel refused to acknowledge whether or not a conflict existed and generally declined to assist the court in its effort to untangle the surprising and unusual situation.at the same time,elliot insisted upon continuing with the same lawyer and objected to the ordering of a mistrial,while refusing to waive his right to representation.after thorough consideration,the district court concluded that the performance of elliot counsel was hindered by conflict,and that,if elliot was convicted,this conflict would make reversal on appeal almost certain.over elliot objection,the district court ordered a mistrial based on manifest necessity.elliot now contends there was no conflict of interest,and he moved to dismiss,arguing that the double jeopardy clause bars his further prosecution because there was no manifest necessity justifying the mistrial.we disagree and affirm the district court denial of elliot motion to dismiss.
background 
in a federal express hub in california on may,a narcotics interdiction task force identified a suspicious package which,after a search warrant was obtained,was found to contain two kilograms approximately four and pounds of cocaine.a controlled delivery of the package was arranged.a few days later,an undercover police officer delivered the package to the address on the parcel,which was the home of john meston in lahaina,maui,hawaii.after receiving the package,meston then delivered it to elliot at elliot home,also in lahaina.shortly thereafter,the police arrested them both.elliott was indicted and put on trial on two counts alleging violation of a and one count of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute grams or more of cocaine,and one count of attempted possession with intent to distribute grams or more of cocaine.
at elliot trial meston testified as a government witness that elliot gave him to receive the package,as elliot had done on prior occasions.during the defense case,sergio hevia was called as a witness by elliot to contradict meston testimony.in response to an evidentiary objection early in hevia testimony,elliot lead counsel,richard gordon,explained to the district court that he expected hevia to testify that meston had himself called hevia and asked him to mail the package containing the cocaine to hawaii.the court became concerned that hevia might be incriminating himself and asked gordon whether hevia had an attorney.gordon replied,in what turned out to be a less than forthcoming fashion,n ot here,no,your honor.the district court then informed hevia of his fifth amendment rights and his right to counsel,but hevia waived his rights,saying he did not want to speak to an attorney.hevia proceeded to testify that meston called him and asked hevia to pick up a box from a man named randy and send it via federal express.hevia further testified that he called meston a few weeks after mailing the package but that meston sounded strange,telling hevia that something had happened and not to call anymore.
on,hevia was asked if he ever learned what was in the package.he responded that he found out through attorney gordon.he testified that a few months after his strange phone call with meston,he contacted gordon out of concern over meston behavior.he also explained that gordon had been his attorney in connection with some prior traffic violations.
a discussion then ensued out of the presence of hevia and the jury.the district court,previously unaware of any relationship between hevia and gordon,asked gordon to explain how he had come to represent elliot in a matter about which he had previously obtained confidential information from and given legal advice to hevia.gordon refused to answer the court questions about his relationship with hevia.i do think i can answer any of that,your honor i think i have issues of confidentiality,and i ca ca go into that at all.on inquiry by the district court concerning gordon apparent simultaneous representation of elliot and hevia in the same matter,gordon admitted that he did not have a written conflict waiver from either elliot or hevia.
the court expressed concern that in waiving his rights,hevia might have been influenced by gordon presence,thinking that he had his own counsel present.the value of hevia testimony to gordon was to indicate that meston,not elliot,was the organizer of the drug delivery.since in his capacity as elliot defense counsel gordon would be encouraging hevia to make statements,the court indicated that it had become very concerned and was inclined to appoint counsel for hevia.
hevia returned and the court questioned him about his relationship with gordon.hevia testified that he sought legal advice about the parcel at issue in this case when he called gordon about meston.upon hearing this,the court appointed counsel for hevia.
after consulting with his new attorney,hevia invoked his fifth amendment rights and declined to testify further,which prevented the government from finishing its.the court then proposed that hevia testimony be stricken due to the lack of.gordon objected on behalf of elliot,noting that hevia testimony is relevant and tends to exonerate the defendant.gordon was unresponsive to the court inquiries about the basis of his objection or why the court should ignore the fact that the government had not had its chance to hevia.the court called the jury back into the courtroom and struck hevia testimony,instructing the jury not to consider it.
at that point,the trial was about to be recessed for four days for a break that had already been planned.before proceedings ended on the day hevia testimony was stricken,gordon indicated that he would be moving on behalf of elliot for a mistrial but would research the matter further during the interim.ultimately,elliot did not file such a motion.when elliot opted not to seek a mistrial,the government sent a letter to the court urging it to declare a mistrial sua sponte.on the day before the trial was set to resume,the court faxed a letter to both attorneys posing a series of questions relating to gordon conflict of interest,the effect of striking hevia testimony,and the possibility of a mistrial the government responded to these inquiries,but gordon did not.
at a conference on the day the trial was to resume,elliot objected,through his attorney gordon,to declaration of a mistrial.in sum,elliot maintained that he wished to continue the trial with gordon as his counsel,that he was not waiving any of his rights including the right to counsel,and that he was not taking a position as to whether or not gordon had a conflict of interest.the court extensively questioned gordon and elliot regarding the conflict.gordon stated that elliot was not waiving anything and that he was reserving all his rights.the court asked specifically whether elliot was waiving any conflict of interest that gordon may have created,to which gordon replied,elliot is specifically not waiving anything.
the court repeatedly inquired as to elliot position on whether or not gordon had a conflict of interest,but gordon refused to answer the question.the court asked if a potential conflict of interest could justify a mistrial or whether an actual conflict was required,and elliot refused to take a position on that question,either.the court pointedly asked how elliot wanted to go forward with the trial if he insisted on exercising his right to counsel.again,gordon failed to explain his position,which rights elliot was reserving,and whether gordon had a conflict.ultimately,elliot took no position on whether a conflict existed and what effect,if any,striking hevia testimony had on declaring a mistrial.
the court tried to clarify gordon position,stating so you are not admitting nor are you denying that you are in a position,to which gordon replied,i not taking a position that correct.the court then expressed concern that gordon,for his client,want ed to have his cake and eat it too.the court continued 
you want to go forward with the trial.if,in fact,elliot is convicted,then elliot will then declare that you were in a conflict of interest and take an appeal.this is a waste of the court time,a waste of valuable jurors time,and i really feel like there just a ton of right now.
the court ultimately concluded that there was manifest necessity for a mistrial,orally declared a mistrial,and discharged the jury.soon thereafter,the court filed a written order which explained its reasons for declaring a mistrial.the order stated that the court found a manifest necessity to declare a mistrial in order to ensure that elliot,who had not waived his objection to any conflict of interest,would be represented by counsel,avoid the undermining of public confidence in the integrity of the legal system,and avoid a waste of the resources of the court,the jurors,and the parties.it observed that gordon obligation to defend elliot was compromised not only by the conflict presented by his prior representation of hevia but also by his interest in protecting himself against charges of unethical conduct.the court expressly noted that gordon refusal to respond to the court inquiries or to take clear positions may have been primarily motivated by a desire to protect himself,to his client detriment.the order concluded that if the trial proceeded and elliot was found guilty,he would appeal on grounds and a retrial would almost certainly be ordered.the order also noted the court overall concern about the defense case in chief,observing that the testimony of the three allegedly percipient witnesses offered by defendant was utterly implausible.if the trial continued,it is apparent that the district court expected it to result in a conviction,especially after the striking of hevia testimony.
gordon thereafter voluntarily withdrew as counsel and elliot hired a new attorney.a new trial date was set,and elliot filed a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds.the district court denied the motion to dismiss,concluding that elliot arguments had been waived and that there was manifest necessity for declaring a mistrial at elliot first trial.elliot appealed.
ii.discussion 
denial of a defendant pretrial motion to dismiss an indictment on double jeopardy grounds is immediately appealable as a collateral order under.see richardson united states,d obviously,this aspec t of the guarantee protections would be lost if the accused were forced to run the gauntlet a second time before an appeal could be taken i f a criminal defendant is to avoid exposure to double jeopardy and thereby enjoy the full protection of the clause,his double jeopardy challenge to the indictment must be reviewable before that subsequent exposure occurs.citing abney united states,d see also united states hickey,cir reiterating the court interlocutory appellate jurisdiction over colorable double jeopardy claims.
double jeopardy 
the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment protects a defendant right not to be placed in jeopardy twice for the same offense.arizona washington,d.in a jury trial,jeopardy attaches when the jury is empaneled and sworn.see crist bretz,d.a criminal defendant has the right to have the jury first empaneled to try him reach a verdict.united states bonas,cir citing united states bates,cir.a jury had already been empaneled and sworn in elliot first trial,but that does not mean that another jury can never be empaneled for a retrial.the defendant right must be subordinate,in some instances,to the public interest in fair trials designed to end in just judgments.united states jorn,d see thomas municipal court of the antelope valley,cir balanced against the defendant right,however,is the right of society to be protected against those guilty of crimes by enabling society to retry the accused under certain circumstances.
when,as here,a mistrial is ordered over a defendant objection,retrial is permitted only if there was a manifest necessity for a mistrial.washington,at.a reviewing court must determine whether such a manifest necessity existed at the time a mistrial was declared by the district court.in so doing,we should consider that t he words manifest necessity do not describe a standard that can be applied mechanically or without attention to the particular problem confronting the trial judge.thomas,at internal quotations omitted.rather than a strict standard,the supreme court has described a general approach to be taken by trial judges considering a mistrial.if an error would make reversal on appeal a certainty,it would not serve the ends of public justice to require that the government proceed with its proof illinois somerville,d.
b.the district court approach 
we have also been directed to consider the manner in which the district court made its decision.the supreme court and appellate courts have relied on four indicators in determining whether the trial court abused its discretion.has the trial judge heard the opinions of the parties about the propriety of the mistrial,considered the alternatives to a mistrial and chosen the alternative least harmful to a defendant rights,acted deliberately instead of abruptly,and properly determined that the defendant would benefit from the declaration of mistrial bates,at.if a district court engages in this type of effort,it is much more likely to have exercised sound discretion in concluding that manifest necessity for a mistrial existed.see id.at.
we start with the approach taken by the district court,because in this case it weighs very heavily in favor of the court determination.the court proceeded deliberately and made every effort to draw out the views of the parties,particularly the defendant,on the situation.elliot now argues on appeal that there was no conflict of interest,at least not after hevia testimony was stricken,and that a reversal of any conviction on appeal was far from a certainty.we do not agree and will deal with those arguments below,but it can not be overlooked that elliot did not take those positions at the time,let alone argue for them.
at that point in time it appeared to the district court that elliot defense was in disarray,with the testimony of his main witness stricken and his other key witnesses offering testimony which appeared utterly implausible to the court.it is not surprising that the court came to conclude that the defense was deliberately covering the risk of an adverse verdict by trying to set up an issue for appeal,an approach which motivated elliot and his attorney to be unresponsive and unhelpful in dealing with the situation.nonetheless,the court continued to invite comments and suggestions from elliot and gordon,to no avail.
facing a confusing situation,the court received no help from elliot and his attorney.if elliot did not like how the situation was resolved,he must accept responsibility for failing to respond to the court inquiries when he had the opportunity.the district court careful and deliberate approach to the problem was laudable and supports its conclusion.
conflict of interest and certainty of reversal 
the sixth amendment guarantees each criminal defendant the right to assistance of counsel unhindered by a conflict of interests.thomas,at quoting united states wheat,cir,aff on other grounds,d.a conflict of interest can arise in cases of simultaneous or successive representation.id.at.typically,in order to obtain a reversal of conviction a d efendant must show that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer performance,united states crespo de llano,cir citing cuyler sullivan,d.
during,hevia testified that he had sought and received gordon legal advice regarding the package at issue in this case.at this point it became clear to the district court that there was,at a minimum,a potential conflict of interest arising from gordon successive representation of two clients in the same matter.hawaii rule of professional conduct a forbids a lawyer who has represented one client in a given matter from representing another client in the same or a substantially related matter in which that person interests are materially adv
