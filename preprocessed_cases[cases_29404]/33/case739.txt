this is a companion case to haraguchi superior court,no,d,wl haraguchi.in this death penalty case,jesse james hollywood,petitioner,seeks a writ of mandate directing the respondent trial court to grant his motion to recuse the office of the district attorney of santa barbara county.in the alternative,petitioner seeks a writ of mandate directing the trial court to conduct a full evidentiary hearing on the recusal motion.petitioner contends that,because of the role of the assigned prosecutor,ronald zonen zonen,role in the making of a film about the case,that prosecutor has demonstrated a bias and conflict of interest warranting recusal.based on the lack of evidence that the district attorney was unaware of the prosecutor disqualifying conduct,petitioner also contends that the entire prosecutorial office should be recused.
we originally summarily denied the petition.the supreme court granted review and directed us to issue an order to show cause.we now conclude that the trial court erred by denying the recusal motion as to zonen,but correctly denied recusal as to the entire santa barbara district attorney office 
factual and procedural background 
on october,the district attorney of santa barbara county hereafter district attorney filed a indictment against petitioner and four codefendants ryan hoyt,william skidmore,jesse rugge,and graham pressley.count charged them with the murder of nicholas markowitz,subd.a.it alleged as a special circumstance that the defendants had committed the murder during the commission of a kidnapping in violation of section,subd.a b.count charged the defendants with kidnapping markowitz for the purpose of ransom or to commit extortion in violation of section,subdivision a.
in their return to the order to show cause,the people summarize the facts underlying the crimes as follows 
in brief,evidence before the grand jury revealed that petitioner was a drug dealer in the san fernando valley area of los angeles and ben markowitz ben,the older of nicholas nick markowitz was one of petitioner distributers sic for several years.ben and petitioner had a over a debt ben owed petitioner from the sale of a quantity of ecstacy sic supplied by petitioner,and the enmity between them escalated.
on sunday,august,petitioner,jesse rugge and william skidmore were driving in a van to the home of ben markowitz parents in the san fernando valley,intending to break out the windows of that residence in retaliation for ben act of breaking the windows of petitioner residence.on the way they spotted nick markowitz standing on a street corner near his home.they stopped and forced the boy into the van.they then proceeded,with nick in their custody,to the home of a friend to pick him up for a trip to santa barbara,to attend the annual fiesta celebration in that city and to party there.
on the way to santa barbara,petitioner made threats to nick markowitz,such as,if your brother thinks he going to kill my family,he has another think coming.your brother is going to pay me money right now,and if you run,i break your teeth.
nick markowitz was detained in the santa barbara home of richard hoeflinger,another friend of petitioner.initially,nick was bound hand and foot with duct tape and was blindfolded.he later was freed of those restraints but remained with rugge and pressley,either out of fear or in the belief he was not in personal danger as long as he did as he was told.
on tuesday,august,rugge,with nick in tow,rented a room at a motel in santa barbara.in los angeles,petitioner gave hoyt a automatic machine pistol and sent him back to santa barbara with instructions to kill nick markowitz.hoyt and pressley first drove up highway to a trailhead called lizard mouth atop the mountains separating santa barbara and the santa ynez valley and dug a shallow grave.late that evening,rugge,pressley,hoyt and skidmore drove young markowitz to the trailhead and marched him to the gravesite.he was bound with duct tape and blindfolded.hoyt hit him over the head with a shovel and then shot him with a nine round burst from the.hoyt and rugge buried him and the four defendants returned to santa barbara.
on august,markowitz body was discovered by law enforcement officials.within hours after the discovery,petitioner four codefendants hoyt,skidmore,rugge,and pressley were in custody.petitioner,on the other hand,became a fugitive.he was arrested in brazil in march and deported to the united states.
petitioner codefendants were prosecuted by zonen.in march,after zonen had obtained convictions against all four codefendants,he was contacted by nick cassavetes.cassavetes was a film director and screen writer who wanted to make a film,alpha dog,based on the markowitz murder.cassavetes asked zonen if he could provide any assistance or materials to help create a screenplay,including trial transcripts,witness contacts,according to zonen,he agreed to turn over materials to nick cassavetes and act as a consultant in cassavetes preparation of alpha dog.
declarations in the recusal moving papers 
zonen stated that the court should assume that all relevant material in the case against petitoner was turned over to the film makers sic,including all reports,tapes and photos.zonen further stated that all of those materials are already in petitioner possession,or will soon be the disclosed materials included both police and probation reports.the police reports contained the names,phone numbers,and addresses of witnesses.zonen may have unintentionally disclosed rap sheets containing criminal offender record information.zonen declared that he gave boxes of materials to the filmmakers and would not have turned over rap sheets if he had known they were in the boxes.
zonen never asked for and was not given any monetary consideration for his assistance.zonen declared that he decided to cooperate with cassavetes because he believed alpha dog would be the last opportunity to get the kind of widespread publicity necessary to locate petitioner and bring him to justice.zonen stated i asked only that petitioner picture be shown at the conclusion of the film along with a phone number to call with information as to his whereabouts.i asked that the audience be told that petitioner remains a fugitive and that there is a reward for his arrest.zonen also asked that the film be accurate.
zonen declared that he had been informed that the film would be a realistic recounting of the crime,with real names and accurate facts,to be shown nationally and internationally.he believed that t he national and international forums were important,given that it was likely that petitioner had fled the country and was beyond the reach of conventional american television.however,after zonen had given the case materials to cassavetes,he was informed that the names and locations would be changed because of liability concerns and difficulty in obtaining insurance.petitioner name in the movie is johnny truelove.at the end of the movie,a caption states that truelove was finally arrested in paraguay after five years as a fugitive and is waiting trial in california.
cassavetes declared the alpha dog movie could have been made without zonen cooperation,but it would have been made worse.either i would have had to go around him and do a lot more diligent work or i would have had to make it up.this particular version could not have been made.zonen took cassavetes and his assistants to the location where the murder of markowitz had occurred.zonen helped cassavetes contact witnesses.cassavetes asked zonen for his opinions on certain participants in the case.cassavetes specifically recall ed zonen describing ryan hoyt family life and ryan hoyt mother.zonen told cassavetes overall he felt that these were a bunch of stoned,dumb guys.cassavetes a t times used zonen assistance for his opinions of character specifics.
according to cassavetes,zonen was cooperative and never said no to any request he made.cassavetes characterized zonen attitude towards him and the creation of the movie as enthusiastic.heather wahlquist,who assisted in the creation of alpha dog,declared that zonen appeared to be and eager to assist the.
cassavetes also declared that,during his first meeting with zonen,zonen said he was very interested in finding petitioner.he asked whether cassavetes intended to identify petitioner at the end of the film and if cassavetes intended to show his photograph.zonen never requested that cassavetes do so.cassavetes told zonen he was just the writer,that no film was yet made,and that there were no plans whatsoever.cassavetes also informed him that cassevetes was not interested in making a minute version of america most wanted.
the motion to recuse 
on september,petitioner filed a motion to recuse the entire district attorney office.in support of the motion,petitioner counsel declared that,on august,he had attended the first and only public screening to date of alpha dog.counsel alleged that the film portrays petitioner in an extremely inflammatory manner,as extremely manipulative,vicious,selfish,and without any redeeming character traits whatsoever.the jesse james hollywood character was described by several of the public movie viewers as a monster.at the conclusion of the film,special thanks are given to the santa barbara sheriff department and to ron zonen.
petitioner counsel also declared that michael mehas,a researcher and associate producer for alpha dog,had refused to speak with him because of zonen interference.according to counsel,mehas was the who had the greatest amount of contact with zonen.counsel stated that mehas had initially provided information about his contacts with zonen.mehas described his access,with permission,to the santa barbara district attorney office file room where all the case materials were located.mehas stated he was provided access to computer disks,photographs,audio recordings,video recordings,still photographs,law enforcement evaluations,probation reports,and criminal history reports,among other items of evidence.mehas stated these items of evidence were stored in boxes,which he was permitted to remove without supervision from the santa barbara district attorney office.the materials received by mehas included a psychological report regarding hoyt.in addition,zonen gave mehas zonen trial notebook for the prior trial of the charged herein.this notebook includes witness statements,prosecutorial impressions,and zonen handwritten notes.
petitioner counsel declared that mehas cooperation with the defense ceased after zonen telephoned him and expressed anger that mehas had spoken to counsel.zonen also expressed concern that he would be criminally prosecuted for his conduct,and that the information mehas provided could assist in that prosecution.
petitioner contended that the prosecutor unprecedented misconduct in acting as a consultant to and providing them with unfettered access to his files and evidence qualifies as conduct warranting disqualification.petitioner argued that the prosecution misconduct can only be described as representing a bias against petitioner.the publicity in which the prosecution engaged can not be credibly characterized as the dissemination of information necessary to aid in the apprehension of a fugitive it serves solely to create an inflammatory and prejudicial depiction of petitioner and to aggrandize the prosecution.petitioner requested that the trial court conduct an evidentiary hearing regarding the full nature and extent of the prosecution consultation as well as the specific details regarding improper dissemination of relevant materials.
hearing on the motion to recuse 
on november,the trial court conducted a hearing on the recusal motion.petitioner conceded that there was not any impropriety in reference to finances.the trial court accepted zonen explanation for assisting the filmmakers there is no declaration from any person,in my view,that undermines,or raises any question about zonen assertion and declaration that his sole interest in providing information to the filmmakers was to promote the interests of law enforcement in apprehending petitioner.that interest is obviously a lawful and justifiable interest and creates no legal conflict of interest.the court further stated there a suggestion that zonen might have been star struck by his association with the filmmakers,or that he took some psychic pleasure in assisting in the production of a movie.even assuming that that true,i do see that that a legally cognizable conflict.finally,even assuming one were to take the view that there was a conflict,i can conceive of no likelihood that it would prevent the petitioner from receiving a fair trial.
the trial court stated that it had viewed a digital video disc made by the filmmakers.the disc shows the filmmakers conversing among themselves immediately after their first meeting with zonen.one of the filmmakers stated,zonen wants you to make this movie and he wants you to make this movie as accurate as you can so he can portray petitioner for what he is so that he can catch that bastard.the trial court said that the filmmaker statement corroborates what zonen has been saying in his declarations,which is not really controverted by anything in the defense declarations.on the disc the filmmaker also said that zonen had stated i retiring in seven years.i got to get this guy before i go.
at the end of the disc,a filmmaker apparently cassevetes said that zonen had stated that anything that we needed he would give us but we have to come to the markowitz woman susan markowitz,the victim mother first and if anything came out i have to say that the markowitz woman told me.the trial court asked zonen to explain the filmmaker comment.zonen said,i do remember a conversation where we talked about crediting information to susan markowitz.however,if there information that would have come from both of us i could very well have said,credit it to susan markowitz.i prefer not to be quoted i would not have told them to quote her something she knew nothing about,that would have been foolish.
the court decided to conduct an evidentiary hearing,but it limited the scope of that hearing to the issue of whether zonen had improperly influenced mehas decision to stop talking to the defense.the court declared only one movie person has been identified as now being unwilling to talk to the defense,and the timing of that is such that it raises a concern in the court mind.and so it seems to me that a limited evidentiary hearing with mehas as a witness is relevant to the question of whether or not there been some improper coercion which might in turn reflect a bias that would be legally significant.
mehas testified at the evidentiary hearing.his testimony was as follows he was involved in two projects.the first project was to assist cassavetes in writing the screenplay for alpha dog.the second was to write a book on the markowitz murder.zonen told mehas that he planned to write a book as well.later,however,zonen said that he could do a book,that it would be improper with petitioner case still outstanding 
mehas met with zonen approximately to times over a period.mehas would come into zonen office and pepper him with questions.mehas would give him mehas theories of what happened,zonen would give mehas his theories,and mehas would tell zonen why he thought zonen theories were wrong.mehas considered zonen to be a friend.
there was an understanding between zonen and mehas that mehas would disclose the case materials only to persons working with him on the film.it was also understood that mehas would talk about any of the stuff he got from zonen.he would not even tell people that zonen had turned those documents over to him 
after petitioner was apprehended,mehas had two telephone conversations with zonen.during the second conversation,zonen asked if he had given rap sheets to mehas.mehas believes he told zonen that he had rap sheets,but when he went through everything he did have the rap sheets.zonen said that he was concerned that he would be criminally prosecuted because of allegedly giving mehas documents that he should have.zonen never told mehas not to cooperate with petitioner counsel or anyone associated with petitioner.nor did he tell mehas not to reveal to anyone any of mehas prior conversations with zonen.
petitioner counsel asked mehas for a
