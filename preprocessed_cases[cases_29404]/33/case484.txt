this appeal is from the district court denial of a state prisoner petition for habeas corpus relief brought under.the district court granted a certificate of appealability on three issues.appellant sandoval raises as a fourth issue the denial of an evidentiary hearing in the federal district court.we have jurisdiction under c.
sandoval challenges in these proceedings his conviction in new mexico state court on charges of aggravated battery and shooting at a motor vehicle,two of the four charges he had faced at trial the appellate court affirmed the convictions on those two counts,and the supreme court of new mexico denied review.sandoval then brought further proceedings in the trial court.first he filed a pro se application for writ of habeas corpus,followed by a second application brought with the assistance of counsel.in each of those proceedings,the trial judge denied relief and the supreme court of new mexico denied a petition for certiorari.
sandoval then filed his petition under section in the federal district court,assisted by counsel.the case was assigned to a magistrate judge for report and recommendation.the magistrate judge issued a carefully considered report and recommended that the district judge deny relief.the district judge adopted the report and recommendation and dismissed the petition.as noted,the judge later granted a certificate of appealability.
the following summary of the trial evidence is taken from the opinion of the court of appeals of new mexico.we note at the outset that no trial transcript has been provided for our review,nor was one provided for the benefit of the federal district court as best we can discern.under rule c,rules governing section cases,the state should have included in its answer information regarding the availability of transcripts or tapes of the state trial and other proceedings.this apparently was not done,but sandoval does not appear to have raised any issue about the sufficiency of the record in the federal district court,nor does he on appeal 
the victim of the aggravated battery,a man named parra,had an ongoing feud of sorts with the sandoval family.the origin of the feud was the alleged rape of appellant daughter by parra.that alleged offense was not prosecuted.but parra and appellant son,david sandoval,had a history of fighting as a result.
on easter sunday evening in,parra and a companion,bruhn,were driving in appellant neighborhood.about a block from appellant house,they encountered sandoval,and his cousin,daniel jimenez.a quarrel ensued and soon moved to the front of appellant house,at which point daniel jimenez ran inside and announced that parra and bruhn were outside.when sandoval saw parra car,he ran upstairs and got his wife rifle.sandoval testified at trial that parra had repeatedly threatened the sandoval family,and that he consequently believed that parra had come to kill his family.sandoval admitted,however,that at first he had not seen any weapon in parra hands.
from this point forward in the chronology,the testimony at trial was sharply conflicting.defense daniel jiminez,appellant himself,appellant son,and at least one other that parra went back to his car and emerged brandishing a gun and advancing on appellant son.when appellant saw parra with a gun,he tried to shoot him,but the rifle safety was still on.as he released the safety lock,he testified,he saw parra look up at him and taunt him with an obscenity.appellant also testified that he heard his son yell,no,dad,no by this time,sandoval had emerged from a window to the balcony.parra and bruhn turned to run,but sandoval started shooting,hitting parra.parra fell to the ground but then got back up and made it to his car.
appellant testified that he then decided to shoot at the car to disable it,so that parra would not be able to dispose of his weapon before police came.he said that as he resumed firing,the smell of the gunpowder and the shouting caused a flashback in which he believed that he was back in vietnam fighting against the viet cong.he kept firing until his clip was empty,but he testified that he had no recollection of that.
the prosecution evidence was that parra and bruhn were unarmed and only verbally quarreling with appellant son when appellant started shooting.bruhn was able to avoid getting hit by getting behind a car.parra was hit three in the back and then,after he got into the car and was trying to get away,he was hit once in the hand and once in the knee.several other bullets went into the car,shattering windows and blowing out two tires.in spite of that,parra and bruhn were able to leave the scene in the car.
within two to four minutes,the victim car was stopped by a police officer as bruhn tried to take parra to a hospital.there was disputed evidence from different police officers about whether the route they were on was the shortest route to the nearest hospital.no weapon was found in the car when they were stopped,nor was any weapon that parra might have had ever recovered.
when officers arrived at the sandoval home,sandoval quickly admitted the shooting.he said that he had shot parra for harassing his family.at that time he apparently did not say that parra had been carrying a gun,nor did other witnesses report that at the scene,although several later testified to that effect.
we have noted that sandoval was convicted at trial on three counts with conviction of one count having been reversed on direct appeal and acquitted on a fourth.we will briefly note other developments at trial that are significant as context for this appeal.the victim,parra,did not appear at trial.the prosecution moved for admission in evidence of parra testimony from the preliminary hearing,informing the court that it had tried for a period of one year to locate parra to secure his attendance at trial,but had been unsuccessful.counsel for sandoval told the judge that it was essential to the defense to have the opportunity to parra in front of the jury the prosecution then summarized the efforts it had made to locate parra and informed the court and defense counsel that it was prepared to present testimony to establish the extent of those efforts.at this point,defense counsel decided to stipulate that the state had made adequate efforts to locate parra for appearance at trial.this stipulation cleared the way for parra testimony from the preliminary hearing to be admitted at trial under an exception to the hearsay rule.
the attorney who represented sandoval at trial and who stipulated to the admission of parra testimony from the preliminary hearing was the second attorney to represent sandoval in the trial court.the of parra at sandoval preliminary hearing had been conducted by sandoval first appointed attorney.that lawyer later was replaced by a second attorney after he failed to maintain contact with sandoval and could not be located by the state.he was later disbarred and was revealed to have had a substance abuse problem.
appellant sandoval testified in his own defense at trial,and his attorney called several other witnesses who had been present at the scene of the shooting.the defense also called a psychotherapist,evelyn sandeen,who had treated sandoval for stress disorder.the defense lawyer had failed,however,to give advance notice of the proposed expert testimony as required under new mexico court rules.consequently,the trial judge limited sandeen testimony to the general nature of stress disorder and did not permit her to testify that sandoval had been diagnosed with the disorder,had been treated for it,and had been rated disabled by the veterans administration based on this condition.nor was sandeen allowed to give her opinion that sandoval did experience symptoms of the disorder at the time of the incident in question 
on direct appeal,the new mexico court of appeals addressed two of the issues that are now before this court.the appellate court held that the trial court had not abused its discretion in admitting parra testimony from the preliminary hearing in view of defense counsel stipulation that the state had made a reasonable effort to locate parra and have him appear at trial.the appellate court rejected sandoval contention that his defense had been prejudiced by the lack of an opportunity to parra about medical tests that showed the presence of alcohol in his bloodstream after the shooting.the court found that sandoval had failed to show that he had preserved that issue for review.
the state court trial judge was also the judge who reviewed and rejected sandoval two applications for habeas relief from the state courts.as noted,the new mexico supreme court denied certiorari review each time.the only substantive ruling from the state court habeas proceeding is a order issued by the state trial judge in denying sandoval second petition on which he was represented by current counsel.the ruling is so succinct that we it here almost in its entirety.the state habeas judge held 
the factual assertations sic contained in the petition and including sic supplemental affidavits are inconsistent with evidence introduced at trial and in each instance are not necessarily probative of the defense theories advanced by petitioner or are merely cumulative to evidence heard and reviewed by the trier of fact herein.
the hypothesis of self defense or defense of others propounded by petitioner herein,is inconsistent with the petitioners sic own testimony at trial and is self contradictory sic with the post traumatic stress syndrome defense now asserted.
petitioner herein has utilized four different attorneys,all having scrutinized the performance and competence of his sic predecessor based upon inconsistent theories of defense or justifications for the acts of petitioner which are not in dispute.
all of the factual,procedural and ancillary questions now raised by the petitioner were available to petitioner prior to direct appeal herein and in fact were presented as the basis therefore sic.
the court concludes petitioner has not stated a legal claim for relief and further,that the record herein conclusively evidences that petitioner is not entitled to the relief sought this matter is therefore dismissed.
under the and effective death penalty act aedpa,a federal court may not issue a writ of habeas corpus with respect to any claim adjudicated on the merits in state court unless that adjudication 
was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
as to the unreasonable application standard,we have held that 
only the most serious misapplications of supreme court precedent will be a basis for relief under.in our view,a decision is objectively unreasonable when most reasonable jurists exercising their independent judgment would conclude the state court misapplied supreme court law.it is not enough that the decision is clearly wrong or that the reviewing court would have reached a contrary decision t he state court decision must be at such tension with governing supreme court precedents,or so inadequately supported by the record,or so arbitrary as to be unreasonable.

finally,as a more general matter,this court has held that deference to a state court decision on the merits of a federal claim is appropriate even when the state court does not expressly articulate a rationale for its decision.
w e must uphold the state court summary decision unless our independent review of the record and pertinent federal law persuades us that its result contravenes or unreasonably applies clearly established federal law,or is based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.this independent review should be distinguished from a full de novo review of the petitioner claims.our review is in fact deferential because we can not grant relief unless the state court result is legally or factually unreasonable.

sandoval asserts that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel at trial,raising several allegations of deficient performance by his lawyer.he argues that counsel failed to conduct a reasonable investigation,failed to interview several potentially helpful witnesses,and failed to consult and adequately prepare the psychologist,sandeen,who did testify.sandoval contends that he is entitled to relief under strickland washington,d,and that the state court denial of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was contrary to or an unreasonable application of that precedent.
under strickland,sandoval must show that counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness as measured against prevailing professional norms,and he must show that there is a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different but for counsel inadequate performance.at.establishing a reasonable probability of a different outcome requires something less than a showing that counsel deficient conduct more likely than not altered the outcome in the case.id.at.instead,a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.at.
sandoval first allegation is that counsel failed to conduct an adequate investigation.that the duty to provide effective assistance includes the duty to conduct an investigation that is reasonable under the circumstances of the case is clearly established law,being the specific claim raised in strickland itself.as for the circumstances of this case,sandoval contends that his attorney performed virtually no independent defense investigation of the charges in this case and did not prepare adequately to present sandoval only potential,meritorious defense.brief in chief at.sandoval goes on to say that counsel apparently did little more than review the discovery provided by the prosecution and then appear in court at sandoval side.id.
more specifically,sandoval alleges that counsel failed to investigate and present evidence of his fear of parra and bruhn based on their previous threats against his family failed to conduct any pretrial interviews with the prosecution witnesses did not review parra medical records before the trial and did not even interview defense witnesses until the night before their testimony.we note,however,that several defense witnesses testified that parra had been armed and threatening sandoval son.probably the impact of this evidence was undercut by the fact that none of the witnesses,not even sandoval himself,told the police immediately after the incident that parra had been armed the state court conclusion that more,essentially cumulative,evidence on this point would not likely have affected the outcome easily passes muster under aedpa standard the conclusion is not unreasonable under the circumstances.
for reasons discussed further below,we do not think that the medical evidence pertaining to parra had the potential to affect the outcome of the trial as sandoval claims.most importantly as to this point,the assertion that the nature of the wound to parra hand could support an inference that he was gripping something hard at the time his hand was hit,even if accepted,falls far short of proving that the object may have been a pistol.it is mere conjecture that this evidence would have had persuasive force in supporting the claim that the victim was armed.because the jury evidently disbelieved four or more witnesses who testified that parra had been armed perhaps because,as just noted,none of the witnesses so stated during the initial investigation,counsel failure to investigate parra medical records and his resulting inability to use this evidence seems highly unlikely to have had any effect on the jury findings.
sandoval contends that his trial counsel failure to timely identify sandeen as an expert witness resulted in the trial judge limiting her testimony to general comments about stress disorder and excluding any testimony from her about her examination and treatment of sandoval and her opinions regarding sandoval.the state does not dispute the factual basis for this claim.we have no hesitation in saying that the trial lawyer performance on this specific task fell below the standard of objective reasonableness.the issue,then,is whether this deficiency in counsel performance caused prejudice to sandoval defense.
first,we must consider sandoval proffer as to the testimony sandeen might have given had counsel properly given notice that she would be testifying as an expert.in support of his petition for habeas relief both in state court and in the federal district court sandoval offered a letter from sandeen that briefly set out her views.we note as a preliminary matter that the state did not object to the form of this proffer or at least does not do so on appeal.
in her letter,sandeen said that she first met sandoval shortly after the incident and had known him for several years as a psychotherapy patient.sandeen letter is dated about four years after the incident.sandeen refers to sandoval severe,stress disorder in the letter.sandeen states that she believes,based on sandoval account of the incident,that he really did feel that he and his family were threatened and that he shot parra for that reason.then sandeen says that much has been made in this case of the fact that the young man was also shot in the back.she responds to this by opining that 
sandoval,when faced with the extreme stress of being threatened as well as the visual and olfactory cues of handling and smelling a weapon being fired,had a flashback to his vietnam combat experiences.at that point,he was no longer in contact with reality and did fire upon the young man back,seeing him as an enemy combatant.
sandeen letter makes no reference to sandoval own testimony at trial.
in addressing the issue,we must first determine if the state court ruled on this claim.we conclude that it did.the order issued by the trial judge on his later consideration of sandoval second state petition for collateral relief in which he was represented by counsel was,as previously noted,quite terse.the order does not specifically mention sandeen or even expert testimony.but it does refer to the factual assertions in the petition and accompanying affidavits generally.as to those factual matters,the judge said they were inconsistent with evidence introduced at trial and either not necessarily probative of the defense theories advanced or merely cumulative to evidence produced at trial.in another part of the order the judge referred to criticism of sandoval previous attorneys,a rather obvious reference to the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.there again the state judge referred to inconsistent theories of defense or justifications for sandoval acts.
we conclude that the state judge decided this aspect of sandoval ineffective assistance claim on the merits.we note that sandoval has not contended otherwise.although the state court conclusions were stated starkly,they are not impervious to analysis.w e owe deference to the state court result,even if its reasoning is not expressly stated.aycox lytle,cir emphasis in original.we therefore will examine the state court conclusions with the deference required under aedpa.
on this point we can not improve on the sound reasoning of the federal magistrate judge who painstakingly examined the issue.that analysis focused on the discrepancies between sandeen opinion and sandoval own description of the incident in his trial testimony.as the magistrate judge pointed out,sandoval did not testify that he experienced a flashback to vietnam before he began shooting at parra.nor did he testify that the flashback began before he started shooting at parra car.he testified that he believed that parra and his companion meant to do him and his family harm and that he fired on parra for that reason.he had fired at least three times before he began shooting at the car.he testified that the flashback to vietnam did not begin until he had begun firing at the automobile,which he did hoping to prevent parra and his companion from leaving the scene and disposing of the weapon parra had brandished.at that point,he testified,the flashback began and he emptied the rifle clip.as far as our record reveals,sandoval never testified that he perceived parra to be an enemy soldier in vietnam.
as the magistrate judge concluded,the discrepancies between sandoval account and sandeen account held the potential to confuse and distract the jury about sandoval decisions,his state of mind,and his actions as he was shooting.because of the discrepancies,there is not a reasonable probability that sandeen testimony would have led to a different verdict.the state court conclusion that sandoval defense was not prejudiced by the limitation of sandeen testimony is a reasonable one.
sandoval claims that his sixth amendment confrontation clause rights were infringed by the admission in evidence of the preliminary hearing testimony of parra.the state points out that in the federal district court sandoval based an ineffective assistance of counsel claim on the same facts and did not directly contend that he had suffered a confrontation clause violation.sandoval had alleged in his federal habeas petition that counsel had performed inadequately in stipulating to the reasonableness of the state efforts to locate parra and serve him with a trial subpoena,a stipulation that led to the decision to admit his prior testimony.although sandoval brief focuses on the argument that his right of confrontation was infringed,it also includes assertions that point toward an ineffective assistance claim on these facts.out of an abundance of caution,we will review the claim both as a direct claim of violation of the constitutional right of confrontation and as another basis for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
on appeal,sandoval cites the fundamental importance of the right of confrontation and the interests it safeguards.but it is well established that prior testimony may be used against an accused in a criminal trial where the accused had the opportunity to the witness at the earlier proceeding and the state has shown that the witness was unavailable for trial.see crawford washington,d testimonial statements of witnesses absent from trial have been admitted only where the declarant is unavailable,and only where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to.
on direct appeal,the new mexico court of appeals held that the trial judge had not abused his discretion in admitting the testimony because sandoval counsel had stipulated to the reasonableness of the state efforts to serve parra,the only predicate for admission of the testimony that had been challenged.although the state court did not mention the doctrine of invited error,its holding seems clearly to be an application of that principle.the confrontation clause claim was thus waived not forfeited in the state court.we do not consider issues that have been defaulted in state court on an independent and adequate state procedural ground,unless the petitioner can demonstrate cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice.hickman spears,cir.here,sandoval does not address the procedural bar directly and has not presented any ineffective assistance of the cause and prejudice requirements to overcome the effect of waiver.see brown sirmons,cir,cert.denied,thus,taken on its face as a claim of denial of the right of confrontation,this claim can not even be considered because it was waived in state court.we turn,then,to consider whether the counsel stipulation that the state effort to locate parra was itself an instance of ineffective assistance of counsel that could be the basis for federal habeas relief.
taken as a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,sandoval allegations about the admission at trial of parra previous testimony from the preliminary hearing has two main first contending that the of parra at the preliminary hearing was lacking,and the second challenging whether parra was truly unavailable for the trial.as to the adequacy of the,sandoval criticism is mostly speculative.because of the problems that later developed with the performance
