this is a lawyer disciplinary proceeding.the respondent,valerie glover tonwe glover,is a pennsylvania attorney who has never been admitted to practice law in delaware.in,when the office of disciplinary counsel odc learned that she was maintaining an office and practicing law in delaware,glover consented to the entry of a cease and desist order.in,the odc filed a petition alleging that glover has been violating the cease and desist order,and that her activities in delaware constitute the unauthorized practice of law.a panel of the board on professional responsibility board issued its report recommending,among other things,that glover be declared permanently unfit for admission to the delaware bar.glover objected to the board findings and recommendations.after careful consideration,we conclude that glover must be disbarred.
glover graduated from law school in and was admitted to the ohio bar shortly thereafter.she moved to delaware a few years later.in,glover was admitted to practice in pennsylvania and the district of columbia.she took the delaware bar examination,but did not pass.in,glover opened a law office in her home in milford,delaware.glover practice included federal immigration law and personal injury cases.
in,the odc discovered that glover was representing delaware residents,in connection with personal injury claims,from her delaware office.glover entered into a statement and order of voluntary compliance the cease and desist order,which was approved by this court on december.the cease and desist order provided,in relevant part,that glover had been actively engaged in the practice of law in milford,delaware and that glover shall immediately cease and desist from the performance of any and all legal services in delaware for a fee,or for no fee,including,without limitation,the offering and providing of assistance in legal matters,until such time as she is properly admitted to practice as a member of the bar of the state of delaware 
the odc first learned about glover delaware legal practice as a result of an ongoing federal investigation.in,glover was convicted of bribing a federal immigration official,and served months in prison.following her conviction,glover was disbarred in pennsylvania,ohio and the district of columbia.she was reinstated in pennsylvania in.
shortly after she was reinstated,glover claims that she contacted the pennsylvania ethics hotline to find out whether she could conduct meetings with delaware clients who had personal injury claims arising from delaware accidents.louise lamoreaux,the person who would have responded to such a call,did not have any records showing whether glover had called.lamoreaux explained that she would have advised glover to contact the appropriate delaware authorities.lamoreaux also would have advised glover that meetings with delaware clients would not violate the pennsylvania rules of professional conduct as long as the pennsylvania lawyer was not appearing in delaware tribunals.
glover never contacted anyone in delaware to determine whether she could provide any legal services to delaware clients.instead,over the next few years,glover developed a sizeable delaware clientele.glover claims that she never solicited business from delaware residents,and that her delaware practice grew because she was involved in church groups and other civic activities.in june,after following up on information provided by a delaware lawyer,the odc notified glover of its concerns about her delaware activities.shortly thereafter,she transferred more than delaware files to delaware lawyers.in all,the odc established that,from glover represented more than delaware residents in delaware matters.glover agreed that the following description of her activities was correct 
y ou had a reasonable portion of your practice,and so forth,derived from the citizenry of delaware and accidents that occurred here 
there were definite arrangements.this was a one shot deal or a two shot deal for the year.it was an ongoing thing,month in,month out,new people were coming in the state of delaware to you and you had a system for that 
board proceedings and decision 
in the summer of,the board held a hearing on the odc petition for discipline.after considering the testimony of witnesses,as well as the parties legal memoranda,the board determined that glover violated rules c and b of the delaware lawyers rules of professional conduct the rules.the board evaluated the aggravating and mitigating factors,and recommended that glover be declared permanently unfit for admission to the delaware bar.in addition to the entry of an immediate cease and desist order,the board recommended that this court request and recommend disbarment by the supreme court of pennsylvania.
supreme court review 
glover filed objections to the board report and its recommended sanctions.the standards of review in a disciplinary matter are well settled 
with or without objections,this court has an obligation to review the record independently and determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the board factual findings.we review de novo the board conclusions of law.we also will review the board recommendation on the appropriate sanction,which,while helpful,is not binding on the court.in fact,the court has wide latitude in determining the appropriate form of discipline.we will review the sanction to ensure that it is appropriate,fair and consistent with out prior disciplinary decisions 
glover first argues that the board lacked jurisdiction to consider her alleged misconduct.she contends that,under rule of the rules of the board on the unauthorized practice of law the upl rules,the odc was required to file a contempt proceeding to enforce the cease and desist order.in addition,glover argues that the board lacked jurisdiction under rule a because she did not provide legal services in delaware.these arguments lack merit.
first,nothing in upl rule limits the odc authority to institute a disciplinary proceeding against a lawyer who engages in professional misconduct.upl rule provides,in relevant part 
whenever it shall come to the attention of the disciplinary counsel that a respondent is or may be in violation of an order of the court,disciplinary counsel shall initiate an investigation of the matter if after investigation disciplinary counsel concludes that the matter should not be dismissed,disciplinary counsel shall draft a petition to the court for a rule to show cause why the respondent should not be found in contempt 
we agree with glover,that the odc could have relied on upl rule to seek enforcement of the cease and desist order.but,in this case,the same conduct that would have supported a finding of contempt under upl rule,also would constitute knowing disobedience of a court order in violation of rule c.the odc,in a proper exercise of its discretion,elected to proceed under the lawyer disciplinary rules.
glover also argues that jurisdiction can not be predicated on rule,which provides in relevant part 
a disciplinary authority a lawyer not admitted in this jurisdiction is also subject to the disciplinary authority of this jurisdiction if the lawyer provides or offers to provide any legal services in this jurisdiction 
b choice of law in any exercise of the disciplinary authority of this jurisdiction,the rules of professional conduct to be applied shall be as follows 
for any other conduct,the rules of the jurisdiction in which the lawyer conduct occurred,or if the predominant effect of the conduct is in a different jurisdiction,the rules of that jurisdiction shall be applied to the conduct.a lawyer shall not be subject to discipline if the lawyer conduct conforms to the rules of a jurisdiction in which the lawyer reasonably believes the predominant effect of the lawyer conduct will occur.
glover says that she did not provide legal services in delaware because she worked out of an office in pennsylvania.moreover,because she reasonably believed that the predominant effect of her legal work was in pennsylvania,she should be protected by the safe harbor provision in rule b.
glover argument fails for several reasons.first,the record establishes that o
