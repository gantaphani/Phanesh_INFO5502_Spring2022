in these cases we are asked to determine whether a public defender whose office has previously represented a witness for the prosecution is subject to automatic or virtually automatic disqualification for conflict of interest.although we can not establish a rule,we do hold that disqualification is not mandatory whenever the situation arises further,that disqualification in one of the two cases before us was clearly improper.
the facts of the two cases are similar,although not identical.
petitioner rhaburn was arrested on october.after the usual proceedings and several continuances,a trial date of may,was set.the case continued to trail into july,and on july,the prosecutor filed a trial brief that included a request that the public defender office be disqualified because that office had represented witness cary barnett,in a criminal proceeding in.although the brief was not very illuminating,at the hearing held that date the prosecutor explained that cary had originally been charged with a crime of moral wit,misdemeanor spousal abuse under penal code section but had eventually been convicted only of disturbing the peace.the prosecutor correctly pointed out that the conviction,as a misdemeanor,could not be used to impeach cary,on impeachment by felony convictions.however,he reasoned that the underlying conduct could be used for impeachment if it involved moral turpitude.see people wheeler cal th,d.he further informed the court that,in fact,cary,had pushed and shoved the victim so that the offense did involve moral turpitude,and therefore argued that the public defender would have a conflict in using information about the offense against cary 
objecting,the public defender informed the court that office records of cases were kept in a location that i not even aware of where it is.his supervisors had instructed him to make no inquiry about the files.he did not join the riverside public defender office until.finally,he indicated that he did not feel that the fact that his office had previously represented cary,would have any effect on his.
the public defender also informed the court that his client strenuously objected to the delay in trial that would be necessitated by the change in attorney.questioned by the court,rhaburn indicated that he felt there was no conflict and he wanted to go to trial.however,the court granted the prosecutor request and disqualified the public defender.
as an attachment to the petition filed in this court,deputy public defender richard myers declares that he had personally obtained and reviewed the file relating to cary,and that it contained no secrets or confidences pertaining to him.he also declares that the deputy who handled cary,case was employed by the office for less than six months in and has not returned.
in the baez case,petitioner noel baez is charged with the attempted kidnapping of elizabeth,as well corporal injury on a,subd.a and violating a protective order,subd.a,both with respect to elizabeth baez was arrested on august,and the complaint was filed on september of that year.after various proceedings and a number of continuances,the matter was finally set for trial on july,and trailed thereafter.
on july,the district attorney filed a motion to disqualify the public defender.this motion cryptically listed three criminal case numbers,and asked the court to take judicial notice of various pieces of information.from the are all that we appears that these cases involved charges against the victim in the current case,elizabeth c.the docket indicates that she faced numerous charges,including forgery,grand theft,receiving stolen property,and the transportation or importation into the state of a controlled substance for sale,former,subd.health,subd.a.she was represented at most not a member of the public defender office.these proceedings terminated in early,at which time elizabeth was found in violation of probation with respect to new charges,and sentenced to prison.
baez attorney objected to the delayed filing of the motion to disqualify.he also stated that his office representation of elizabeth would not affect his trial performance or strategy.however,after brief proceedings,the trial court agreed with the prosecutor and relieved the public defender.it also,on july,declined to consider formal opposition prepared by the deputy public defender,or to allow him to present additional argument.it was similarly unmoved by the representation that petitioner objected,stating that you were relieved.you no longer represent baez.petitioner had not personally been present on july,due to the fact that he had executed a waiver of personal appearance under section he had not,of course,been aware that the prosecutor would attempt to disqualify the public defender on that date 
the opposition prepared for the trial court did not include any declaration by the deputy public defender.however,he subsequently executed a declaration stating that he had not reviewed any of elizabeth criminal files.
discussion 
first,we must dispose of issues not directly related to the one that has prompted our plenary pretrial review of these cases.
that the prosecutor has a practice of withholding potential disqualification challenges until the last minute,either to cover up his unreadiness for trial,or to interfere with the defendant speedy trial rights and choice of counsel such are not established by competent only remotely germane to the primary issue before us.insofar as the petitions seek the relief of dismissal for violation of petitioners speedy trial rights,we decline to reach the issues.however,we will direct the trial court to reconsider rhaburn motion to dismiss in light of the views expressed in this opinion baez is free to bring such a motion upon remand.
next,real party objects to petitioners petitions insofar as they offer new material not provided to the trial court.that is,in the rhaburn case,the declaration of deputy district attorney myers to the effect that he has reviewed the file relating to cary,and has determined that it contains no secrets or confidences pertaining to him and that the attorney who handled the case left the office shortly thereafter and in the baez case,the declaration of trial counsel in which he states that he has not reviewed any of the victim files,as well as myers declaration that he has reviewed the only available file relating to the victim and that it too contains no secrets or confidences.
we recognize,of course,that as a rule a reviewing court is limited to considering the record which was placed before the trial court.see doers golden gate bridge.dist.cal d,at fn,cal.court rules,rule a c,briefs must provide a summary of the significant facts limited to matters in the record.there is,however,considerable merit to petitioners argument that,due to the procedures followed by real party,they had no realistic opportunity to collect factual evidence before the trial court ruled we also note that the trial court refused to accept the written opposition proffered in the baez case one day after the hearing 
on the other hand,it was incumbent upon the public defender at least to make as full an oral record as possible however,we find it is unnecessary formally to consider the new matter.we do note that although factual assertions contained in the briefs on appeal alone,or otherwise not presented to the trial court,may not be the basis for our decision,it can be appropriate for a reviewing court to consider such assertions or presentations in order to assess the likely future course of the case if an order is reversed.this is especially true if evidence has been effectively excluded by the trial court.see taylor s m lamp d.
as a third point,we must emphasize that,although there was some discussion at oral argument on the matter,these petitions neither require nor permit us to prescribe procedures the public defender must follow in analyzing the possibility of conflict.the system depends on the willingness of attorneys to comply with their ethical duties and to bring close calls to the attention of the court.all we do in this opinion is attempt to provide some guidance for recognizing what is,and is not,a close call.
we proceed now to the merits.
it is well established that in considering a motion to disqualify counsel,the paramount concern is the preservation of public trust in the scrupulous administration of justice and the integrity of the bar.jessen hartford casualty ins.th,d jessen.on review,the standard is abuse of discretion.id.at,d.the party resisting disqualification bears the burden of establishing the facts making disqualification inappropriate,and we accept as correct all of the trial court express or implied findings supported by substantial evidence.city national bank adams th,d.
the people position in these cases is that because the public defender office previously represented a witness victim,and now represents the charged defendant,there is an inherent conflict of interest and the current representation is adverse to the former client.the people maintain that there is an irrefutable presumption that the public defender is in the possession of information acquired from the witness in confidence in the course of the previous representation and that the information is of such a nature that it could be used adversely to the witness in this case.
the foundation of the people argument is rule e of the california rules of professional conduct,which provides that an attorney may not without the informed consent of the client or former client,accept employment adverse to the client or former client where,by reason of the representation of the client or former client,the member has obtained confidential information material to the employment.interpreting the rule in the context of the public defender,consistent with the predecessor of this rule,the state bar issued an opinion to the effect that the public the entire be disqualified from representing a defendant if a previous client is also involved in the case as a potential witness.state bar standing com.on responsibility conduct,formal opn.
we recognize that the rule against the successive representation of adverse interests has two purposes to prevent clients from being placed in a precarious position,and as well to preclude the honest practitioner from putting himself in a position where he may be required to choose between conflicting duties,or be led to an attempt to reconcile conflicting interests,rather than to enforce to their full extent the rights of the interest which he should alone represent.citation.american airlines,sheppard,mullin,richter hampton th,d.thus,it is not only the interest of the former client that is to be considered,but the conscience of the attorney it is the intent of the rule to if attorney from the path of temptation.see anderson eaton cal,cited in flatt superior court cal th,d.
the application of the rule against successive representation,of course,presupposes that there is the possibility of temptation.the people argue that where the two matters are substantially related,it is conclusively presumed that the attorney acquired confidential information from the first client.global van lines,superior court d.this presumption protects the former client,who can never know or prove what is in the mind of his former attorney.ahmanson salomon brothers,d.it also serves the public interest by preserving public trust in the integrity of the bar and the judicial system.comden superior court cal d.the result of this presumption is that the attorney must be disqualified upon the demand of the previous client.henriksen great american savings loan th,d.furthermore,the people argue,when an attorney possesses or is deemed to possess confidential information acquired from a client as to whom he is now in an adverse position,the entire firm must be disqualified.id.at,d.
however,a rigid rule of disqualification can create hardship to the new client and can also be abused as an improper tactical maneuver.river west,nickel d.more recent civil cases have taken a more pragmatic view,and declined to order disqualification of a firm if the challenged attorney is unlikely in fact to have acquired confidential information from the former client.in jessen,supra,th,d,plaintiff sued his insurer over a denial of coverage.his attorney had previously worked for a firm that had represented defendant in numerous coverage actions.rather than apply a rule of automatic disqualification,however,the appellate court directed that disqualification would only be required if the attorney,by reason of the nature of his work for the insurer,had a direct and personal relationship with the client.if he did,the presumption of possession of confidential information would be applied.if the attorney involvement with the client was peripheral or attenuated,however,the court would be obliged to examine the particular circumstances of the matter to determine whether in fact it was likely to have acquired confidential information.if not,disqualification would not be mandatory.jessen,supra,th at,d.
a similarly flexible approach was taken in goldberg music,th,d goldberg.there,six years earlier the plaintiff had consulted informally with attorney x,then a member of a firm.three years later,attorney x left that firm.plaintiff action involved a matter substantially related to her consultation with attorney x.in the current lawsuit,defendant was represented by the firm,and plaintiff moved to disqualify the entire firm.on appeal,the court refused to apply any presumption that the current members of the firm had been tainted by their distant contact with attorney x it held that disqualification was unnecessary.
a third significant case involved the situation in which plaintiff lawyer had previously worked at a firm then representing defendant in matters involving certain issues related to the current litigation.however,that attorney had nothing to do with those matters and had left that firm years before the current litigation commenced.in adams th,d the court declined to recognize a sort of reverse imputation under which the firm undisputed possession of confidential information was imputed to the individual attorney.as in goldberg,the trial court was instead directed to consider dispassionately whether the attorney was reasonably likely to have obtained confidential information material to the current lawsuit during his former employment.id.at,d.
finally,moving into the public sector area,the court in city of santa barbara superior court th,d,held that the disqualification of a city attorney office was not required even though the attorney for the plaintiffs in a property damage suit against a city accepted a position in the city attorney office during the litigation.on the record presented,the court found that the ethical wall was adequate to ensure that the attorney would not pass on any information to the deputy city attorney handling the city defense in that matter.implicit in the decision is the understanding that the attorneys involved could be trusted to obey not only the instructions of their superiors,but also the obvious dictates of their ethical duties.
thus,in the years since the state bar issued its opinion,courts have begun to develop flexible strategies for dealing with potential conflicts,and,in many cases,to reject automatic rules for disqualification.this has also proven true in the criminal context.we find a series of cases from our supreme court to be instructive.while we recognize that,as the people point out,these cases arose on appeal rather than before trial,we can not blind ourselves to the plain import of the decisions.
first,in people clark cal th,d,the defendant claimed that his sixth amendment right to counsel had been violated because one of his attorneys,in his capacity as head of the public defender office,had previously represented four prosecution witnesses.counsel had personally represented one of the witnesses and the court assumed that he had,in fact,obtained confidential information from this witness.accordingly,the court acknowledged that there was at least a potential conflict of interest id.at,d.with respect to the other three witnesses,however,the attorney stated to the court that he did not possess any confidential information about them and that his would not be affected by the prior representation the supreme court commented that,in the circumstances,no actual or potential conflict resulted from the representation of the witnesses by the public defender office,at,d,italics added.that is,the court accepted counsel representation and at least declined to apply a rule of implied receipt of confidences.
next,in people lawley cal th,d,it was undisputed that defendant advisory counsel had recently been appointed to represent a prosecution witness in unrelated criminal proceedings.worse,disposition of the witness case depended upon her truthful testimony in defendant case.advisory counsel represented to the court that even though he had met with the witness after accepting appointment,he had not discussed her case and had not received confidential information.he also indicated that he would feel no compunction to pull any punches.id.at,d.the supreme court again noted that the trial court was justified in rely ing on the representations of defense counsel that no conflict exists.id.at,d,citing crespo de llano cir.as in people clark,the court found that the record failed to reveal even a potential conflict.crespo de llano,supra.
the third case we wish to note is people cox cal th,d.although defendant raised several conflict claims,we are particularly concerned with the claim that a prosecution witness had previously been represented by an attorney in the same firm as defendant counsel.tapson also stated that he had no confidential information regarding the witness stemming from his firm prior representation of him.based on this record,we hold that no actual or potential conflict of interest existed id.at,d,italics added.
most recently,in a fourth case,the court has confirmed that in the prior representation of a witness situation,when the attorney has not received any pertinent confidential information from the witness,ordinarily there is no actual or potential conflict of interest.people cornwell cal th,d,citing cox,italics added.
although,on appeal,the critical issue in claims of conflicted counsel is whether the conflict actually adversely affected the attorney representation people lawley,supra,cal th at,d,people bonin cal d,people clark,people lawley,and people cox were not decided solely on the basis that the record reflected no adverse consequence of any conflict.rather,as we have stressed above,in each case the court determined that there was no conflict,actual or potential,and it did so on the basis of trial counsel averments and representations to the trial court.
certainly this approach is inconsistent with the rigid rule in civil cases that presumes the possession of confidential information and turns a deaf ear to counsel protestations that he does not in fact possess any such information in a civil case,the supreme court has confirmed the viability of this rule as recently as in the case of people ex rel.of corporations speedee oil change systems,cal th,d,in which the court also reconfirmed the rule of vicarious disqualification.however,the supreme court focus on the factual issue of whether actual or potential conflict existed in the clark line of cases strongly suggests that a different approach is appropriate in the criminal context.thus,counsel former representation of a prosecution witness does not compel the assumption that confidential information was acquired from the witness.see also vangsness superior court d.cited in people cox,in which the court found no difficulty in accepting a public defender representation that he possessed no confidential information about a former client of his office who would be a witness for the prosecution.
we perceive several possible justifications for declining to apply a rigid presumption in these cases.the first,particularly applicable to the public defender office,is that u nlike their private sector counterparts,public sector lawyers do not have a financial interest in the matters on which they work.as a result,they may have less,if any,incentive to breach client confidences.citation.city of santa barbara superior court,supra,th at,d.certainly the public defender need not worry about attracting new clients or retaining the loyalty of former clients it has a steady source of supply and is not dependent on referrals or solicitation.see castro los angeles county bd.of supervisors d.
the reverse of this argument is that the interest of the former client is also marginal.unlike the private client involved in expensive civil litigation,the economic interests of a witness or victim are not at stake.the possibility that counsel devastating would ever lead to a perjury charge or even public embarrassment is extremely tenuous.nor does the public defender client select an attorney on the basis of perceived compatibility and trustworthiness he accepts the representation because he must,not because he desires a confidant 
second,it is beyond dispute that many,if not all,public attorney offices handle a high volume of cases,and this clearly applies to the public defender.this factor is entitled to substantial consideration in these cases,given the fact that several years have elapsed since the witnesses were represented by the public defender and that the cases of both cary,and elizabeth involved relatively trivial cases.there is good reason to assume that the average public defender is unlikely to remember any confidential information imparted by the average past client without a great deal of coaxing and no reason to suppose that such information remains permanently floating in the office ether or is the subject of repeated conversations.the risk that confidential information will be passed through casual watercooler conversations is substantially less than in the private sector.
third,frequent disqualifications substantially increase the cost of legal services for public entities.see in re lee th,d.it has been held that if there would be only speculative or minimal benefit,the dislocation and increased expense of government caused by disqualification are unjustified.people municipal court byars d.a related issue is that public law offices often develop specific expertise in particular areas of law,and disqualification may deprive the people of the benefits of this acquired and cultivated expertise.see city of santa barbara superior court,supra,th,at fn,d.
the last factor to note is defendants interest in counsel.petitioner rhaburn expressly indicated that he wanted the public defender to continue baez counsel attempted to place on the record that baez also objected to his removal.we do not dispute that the trial court has the authority to remove appointed counsel over a defendant wishes if it is necessary to do so to protect the client sixth amendment right to counsel.people jones,supra,cal th at,d.however,people jones is distinguishable in that murder for defendant admitted that he was very uneasy due to the nature of the relationship his he had with a potential culprit.he found it very troublesome.queried about the possibility that the former client might sue him,he further acknowledged that it might cause him to flinch in this case.id.at,d.although defendant strongly requested that counsel be allowed to remain,the trial court believed that he was entitled to an attorney who would vigorously pursue all avenues of defense,and the supreme court affirmed 
here,by contrast,there is no conflict.both deputy public defenders have credibly represented that they feel no constraints in investigating or examining the witnesses.they have no personal loyalty to the witnesses and no motive to pull their punches.in that situation,the current client expression of willingness to continue with an attorney with whom he has formed a relationship should be respected.
in summary,and based on policy as well as practicality,we are persuaded that the trial courts erred in applying a rigid rule of vicarious disqualification in the situation presented by the cases before us.in neither case did trial counsel have a direct and personal relationship with the witness,and the direct acquisition of confidential information need not and should not be presumed.jessen,supra,th,d.instea
