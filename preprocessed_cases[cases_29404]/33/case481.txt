dennis evanson appeals from his conviction in the united states district court for the district of utah on counts of conspiracy to commit tax fraud,tax evasion,and aiding and assisting in the preparation of false returns.before evanson trial the court disqualified his retained counsel.his sole contention on appeal is that the disqualification deprived him of his right to counsel under the sixth amendment.exercising jurisdiction under,we affirm.the district court reasonably assessed the problems that could arise from counsel continued representation of evanson.
background 
the indictment alleged that evanson,who was an attorney licensed in colorado,and five codefendants operated a scheme to enable participants to cheat the government out of revenue.participants paid a base fee and a percentage of their tax savings.in exchange,the defendants manufactured fictitious transactions to conceal income and create apparent deductions.to carry out the scheme the defendants used a number of business entities that they controlled which we will call evanson companies.for example,a participant could acquire phony insurance policies.the participant would then pay premiums on that policy to an evanson company and report those payments as a deduction on his business or personal return.the defendants credited the amount of the payments less their fee to an account that they maintained for the participant.similarly,participants could obtain phony documents showing losses from currency futures,options,or forward contracts,vol.i at indictment.to obtain these documents,a participant either paid cash or signed a promissory note to become a partner in an evanson company.if the participant paid cash,his payment,less the defendants fee,was credited to his account.if he signed a promissory note,he was under no obligation to make payments on the underlying loan on the contrary,if a participant made a loan payment,the amount was credited to his account and,as a bonus,frequently reported as a deduction.
to access funds from their accounts,participants engaged in additional contrivances with the aid of the defendants.most commonly,funds were returned through loans provided by cottonwood financial,an evanson company.because the borrowed money actually belonged to the is,the borrowers there was no expectation that these fictitious loans be repaid.the defendants also enabled a participant to acquire property with the funds in his account by purchasing the property in the name of a nominee.for example,a participant who wanted to withdraw from his account could instruct the defendants to purchase a piece of real property in the name of an evanson company.although ostensibly belonging to the company,the property would be under the sole dominion and control of the participant.id.at.
ten months after the indictment was filed,the government moved the district court to disqualify evanson counsel,max wheeler,because of an alleged conflict of interest.the motion asserted that wheeler was involved in,or had intimate knowledge of,efforts by evanson and others to create false documents attempting to substantiate fictitious transactions and to induce participants to sign misleading documents or give other exculpating evidence.id.at.the government contended that wheeler would therefore need to testify at evanson trial.
in support,the government relied on three documents.the first was a letter written by evanson after participants who had learned of the federal investigation attempted to get their money back from the defendants.the letter,dated may,responded to a participant whose attorney had written wheeler to request that compass point investment llc,an evanson company,quitclaim certain real property to him.the property was owned by the participant but held in the name of compass point.evanson wrote the participant a letter rejecting the request.it began as follows 
my counsel,max wheeler,has received requests from your attorney that certain property be quitclaimed to you in your efforts to close out any interest you may have in international capital group an evanson company.we have reviewed the matter,and he suggested i confer with you directly on the issue.
id.at.the remainder of the letter characterized the arrangement with the participant as an investment fund and the property in question as an asset of the company purchased with loans from the fund.the best way to acquire the property,the letter explained,was for the participant to pay off loans that he had with evanson companies and buy the property outright.although other options might be available,explained the letter,none relieved the participant of his duty to service outstanding loans.evanson stressed that point,stating,i have told you in the past,even from the very beginning,that any loans provided to you were,and always must be treated as real financial relationships creating real obligations of repayment to your lender.id.at.
in the government view,this letter would help satisfy its burden of proving evanson willfulness because the letter evinces a and,presumably,shows that he knew that the scheme as it had previously operated was unlawful.the government therefore planned to seek admission at trial of the letter and evidence of surrounding events.this strategy,however,implicated wheeler,who was referenced in the letter opening paragraph.the government stated inasmuch as wheeler advised his client,he possesses knowledge of evanson knowledge and intent prior to sending out the letter.consequently,wheeler advice to evanson will be a material fact in the present criminal trial.wheeler will be a necessary witness.id.at.
the second document relied upon by the government was another letter sent by evanson to a participant in the scheme.dated february,with a return address for fishpaw currency group lc,an evanson company,the letter explained that under a new requirement,fishpaw would be obliged to treat certain loans as having been effectively forgiven.aplee.at.if a loan is designated forgiven,the letter continued,the company must file a in the name of the borrower in the amount of the outstanding loan,thus requiring the borrower to include the amount of the unpaid forgiven loan in their taxable income.id.the letter instructed the participant that to avoid this adverse tax event,he would need to review his loan obligations with the company and ensure that required payments are being made in accordance with their terms.id.
the government argued that this attempt to treat the loans as creating genuine financial to the original scheme,which contemplated no true further evidence of evanson willfulness.and,again,it cited evidence of wheeler involvement brent metcalf,a codefendant,had sent an identical letter to a different participant in the scheme.during plea negotiations with metcalf attorney,the government stated that it viewed the letter as an act of obstruction and threatened to withdraw from negotiations and file fresh charges.to persuade the government against that course of action,metcalf counsel explained that it was his understanding,based on conversations with his client,that wheeler had reviewed the letter before it was sent.
the third document cited by the government in its disqualification motion was an email that evanson had sent to a participant on february,and copied to wheeler.the email quoted from the government indictment in an effort to assure the participant that guarantee members of cayman island corporations which included some evanson companies need not pay taxes on income earned by said corporation,vol.i at.according to the government,this email aimed to mislead the participant into believing that evanson fraud scheme was endorsed by the united states and the email was designed to cause him to alter his interactions with the irs in a way that was beneficial to evanson defense.id.at.the government stated that because wheeler was copied on this email,it was sent with his knowledge and perhaps approval,which further illustrated his status as a potential trial witness.id.at.
in a written order the magistrate judge denied the government disqualification motion,reasoning that the privilege would severely restrict the testimony that wheeler could provide if called as a witness.the magistrate judge also cited a concern that i f counsel who assist clients in investigative stages are to be disqualified in trial stages,defendants will be substantially restricted in their choice of counsel and discouraged from seeking legal advice during an investigation,vol.ii at.
the government appealed the magistrate judge ruling to the district court,which ordered additional briefing and held two hearings on the matter.at the second hearing the district court reversed the magistrate judge and disqualified wheeler.the court ruled that the three documents described above would likely be admissible at trial.this,the court explained,generated many scenarios in which wheeler could and well might be called as a witness.id.at.wheeler could potentially serve as a defense witness,testifying that the documents in question were created in accordance with his advice.or if evanson were to testify that wheeler gave his stamp of approval,the government could call wheeler as a rebuttal witness.id.at.moreover,the court noted,codefendant metcalf whose counsel had previously claimed that wheeler reviewed the letter might attempt to call wheeler as a witness.
in a brief written order filed after the hearing,the district court stated its finding that t he possibility of wheeler testifying as a government or defense witness is real,and a serious potential for conflict arises from that possibility.id.at citing wheat united states,d.it also found that there was a strong possibility that wheeler would be an unsworn witness.id.in support of this finding,the court cited united states locascio,cir,which explains that a n attorney acts as an unsworn witness when his relationship to his client results in his having knowledge of the events presented at trial,enabling the attorney to subtly impart to the jury his knowledge of the events without having to swear an oath or be subject to,id.at.in a later order the court disqualified wheeler entire law firm.
after the district court disqualified evanson chosen counsel,four of his five codefendants pleaded guilty.only evanson,represented by new counsel,and codefendant wayne demeester were tried.the jury found demeester not guilty on all counts.as for evanson,the jury returned a verdict of guilty on counts of conspiracy,tax evasion,and aiding and assisting in the preparation of false returns.the district court sentenced evanson to months imprisonment.it also ordered him to forfeit property and to pay a penalty assessment,restitution of,and a money judgment of to the united states.on appeal evanson does not allege any error in his trial or sentence.nor does he contend that the disqualification of wheeler law firm was improper.he claims only that the pretrial disqualification of wheeler violated the sixth amendment.
ii.discussion 
we begin by reviewing the law governing disqualification of counsel,focusing on evanson contentions regarding the controlling standards and the scope of appellate review.we then turn to the merits of this specific appeal.
legal framework 
the essential aim of the sixth amendment is to guarantee an effective advocate for each criminal defendant.wheat,at.nevertheless,the amendment does not ensure that a defendant will inexorably be represented by the lawyer whom he prefers.id.the trial courts must pursue an independent interest in ensuring that criminal trials are conducted within the ethical standards of the profession and that legal proceedings appear fair to all who observe them.id.at.for example,a criminal defendant does not enjoy an absolute right to be represented by an attorney laboring under a conflict of interest.see id.at.even when a defendant seeks to proceed with conflicted counsel by waiving the conflict,a district court retains authority to reject the proffered waiver to preserve ethical standards and ensure a fair trial.see id.at.
evanson acknowledges that wheeler could have been disqualified if he actually had a conflict of interest.he insists,however,that there was no disqualifying conflict.he relies on utah rule of professional conduct,which has been adopted by the united states district court for the district of utah.see utah civ.g.rule,he notes,does not prohibit a lawyer from act ing as advocate at a trial unless he is likely to be a necessary witness.utah prof l conduct a evanson complains that the district court never found the requisite likelihood that wheeler would be a witness.
this argument fails on at least two counts.first,counsel can be disqualified for reasons other than a conflict of interest.see,united states collins,cir a n attorney may be dismissed for pursuing frivolous theories.pertinent here is the unsworn witness problem,which can warrant disqualification.locascio,at.the problem arises when an attorney was a participant in events to be explored at trial.see id.at.in that circumstance the attorney might convey knowledge of the events without having to swear an oath or be subject to cross examination.id.at.an attorney providing unsworn testimony is not at odds with his is no conflict of interest.see id.at.rather,the detriment is to the government,since the defendant gains an unfair advantage,and to the court,since the factfinding process is impaired.id.at.
second,the standard to determine whether a conflict of interest warrants disqualification is not set by rule.to begin with,there are conflicts of interest not covered by the rule.for instance,e ven if the attorney is not called as a witness,he may be constrained from making certain arguments on behalf of his client because of his own involvement,or may be tempted to minimize his own conduct at the expense of his client.id.at.in addition,rule can not supplant constitutional standards.even if a specific conflict of interest is addressed by a rule of professional conduct,such a rule can not define the scope of a defendant sixth amendment rights.true,rules of professional conduct are relevant in the sense that a court authority to disqualify counsel stems in part from its interest in ensuring that criminal trials are conducted within the ethical standards of the profession.wheat,at.but it does not follow that the sixth amendment requires courts to identify a strict violation of an applicable ethical rule before disqualifying counsel.see id.recognizing courts interest in ensuring that legal proceedings appear fair to all who observe them.evanson has cited no authority supporting such a view,nor,as we shall see,can it be squared with wheat,the leading case in this area.thus,the district court was not bound by the requirement in rule that testimony by wheeler be likely.
in wheat,attorney eugene iredale sought to represent defendant mark wheat on charges relating to a conspiracy after iredale had represented two other participants in the and javier bravo.see id.at.although and bravo had pleaded guilty to drug or other charges before wheat scheduled trial,the district court nonetheless denied iredale attempt to substitute as wheat trial counsel.see id.the supreme court affirmed,announcing that while the sixth amendment requires that district courts recognize a presumption in favor of defendant counsel of choice,that presumption may be overcome not only by a demonstration of actual conflict but by a showing of a serious potential for conflict.id.at.
without identifying a technical violation of applicable rules of professional conduct,the court described two possibilities that,in its view,created a sufficiently serious potential for conflict.see id.at.first,the district court had yet to accept guilty plea,and if the court happened to reject his plea,could stand trial.see id.at.in that event,wheat might be called upon to testify against,and iredale would be prevented from vigorously wheat,thus ineffectively representing.see id.at.second,bravo had pleaded guilty to delivering pounds of marijuana to a los angeles residence.see id.at.the government believed that a portion of this marijuana had ultimately been transferred to wheat and,accordingly,requested that bravo be made available as a witness to testify at wheat trial.see id.at.the court reasoned that if the government called bravo as a witness which it ultimately did,iredale would not be able to conduct a vigorous and would thereby provide ineffective assistance to wheat.id.at.
as the four wheat dissenters observed,the emergence of these conflicts was far from certain.see id.at.marshall,dissenting id.at.stevens,dissenting concurring in justice marshall analysis.any problem arising from iredale representation of was predicated on the district court rejecting guilty plea,an unlikely event.see id.at.marshall,dissenting.as for bravo,even though he was likely to provide testimony regarding a shipment of marijuana,there was little reason to think that he would provide disputed testimony triggering the need for a strenuous.see id.at.on the contrary,the shipment of marijuana was not to wheat but to a,and bravo had not heard of wheat before legal proceedings had commenced.see id.
nevertheless,the majority opinion rejected the dissenters view that iredale conflicts were overly speculative.it emphasized the difficulty of anticipating conflicts of interest and the need for appellate courts to be highly deferential to the trial judge judgment.see id.at.disqualification motions,the court explained,are not assessed with the wisdom of hindsight after the trial has taken place,but in the murkier context when relationships between the parties are seen through a glass,darkly.id.at.to assess t he likelihood and dimensions of nascent conflicts of interest,courts must predict how events will unfold at trial,a daunting task that can require an exercise of instinct and judgment based on experience,id.at.
in addition,wheat recognized that trial courts have a legitimate interest in seeing that their judgments remain intact on appeal.id.at.courts confronting potential conflicts of interest face the prospect of being by assertions of error no matter which way they rule.id.internal quotation marks omitted.if a court disqualifies counsel,the defendant can raise as here a claim that he was denied his sixth amendment right to chosen counsel.see id.but if the court declines to disqualify counsel,the defendant may claim that his counsel conflict of interest resulted in constitutionally ineffective performance at trial.see id.at.noting that courts have entertained claims premised on conflicts that the defendant waived.
for these reasons,appellate courts must afford a district court decision to disqualify counsel broad latitude.id.at.also using phrase substantial latitude to describe requisite deference.reflecting on the potential conflicts arising from iredale representation of wheat,the court noted that o ther district courts might have reached differing or opposite conclusions with equal justification,but that does not mean that one conclusion was right and the other was wrong.id.at.the evaluation of the facts and circumstances of each case,the court explained,must be left primarily to the informed judgment of the trial court.id.
evanson seeks to escape the deference wheat prescribes,asserting that our review of the disqualification order is de novo.we have recognized that de novo review is appropriate in some circumstances when the district court frontline position gives it little if any advantage over this court in assessing the propriety of disqualifying counsel.see united states bolden,cir reviewing disqualification of entire united states attorney office with respect to defendant motion to compel government to move for sentence reduction collins,at disqualification premised on frivolous and misleading pretrial pleadings.in this case,the facts presented to the district court may have been undisputed,but,as in wheat,the disqualification decision required an uncertain prediction of future developments in the,the potential for conflicts of interest and an unsworn witness at trial.see bolden,at disqualification not based on significant analysis of potential conflicts.we are clearly within the realm described by wheat where determinations must be granted broad latitude because trial judges are best situated to assess the likelihood of problematic developments at trial.disqualification order rested on trial court instinct and judgment based on experience see also id.at n.stevens,dissenting agreeing with majority deferential approach because it respects district court familiarity with the litigation 
evanson insistence on de novo review appears to derive from justice marshall dissent in wheat,which he repeatedly cites in his brief.in justice marshall view,a district court decision to disqualify a criminal defendant chosen counsel should be scrutinized closely on appeal.id.at.discussing inappropriateness of deferring.but seven justices,including two dissenters,disagreed with that proposition.see id.at.majority opinion see id.at n.stevens,dissenting.we of course are bound by the majority approach.
as we understand the principles set forth in wheat,the district court acted well within the broad latitude it is afforded in determining that wheeler should be prohibited from representing evanson because of a serious potential for and problems.id.at.those problems stemmed primarily from wheeler apparent involvement in the creation of two letters that evanson sent to participants in his tax scheme 
the first letter,dated may,responded to a participant request that certain real property of his that was being held in the name of an evanson company be conveyed to him by quitclaim deed.the request was initially lodged with wheeler and in rejecting it,evanson noted that wheeler had reviewed the matter,vol.i at.the letter characterized the tax scheme as an investment program and presumed,contrary to the participant understanding,that the property was a legitimate asset of an evanson company.the participant could acquire that property,the letter suggested,by paying off his loans with evanson companies and then purchasing it.the letter stressed,above all,the authenticity of the loans,stating,i have told you in the past,even from the very beginning,that any loans provided to you were,and always must be treated as real financial relationships creating real obligations of repayment to your lender.id.
the second letter,dated february,informed a different client of a new requirement that would require an evanson company to treat certain loans as having been effectively forgiven.aplee.at.to avoid the tax consequences of that designation,evanson instructed the participant to review his loan obligations with the company and ensure that required payments are being made in accordance with their terms.id.although this letter did not mention wheeler,codefendant metcalf counsel informed the government during plea negotiations that metcalf had told him that wheeler had reviewed the letter before metcalf and evanson had sent identical copies to participants.
the district court could reasonably anticipate that the letters would be offered into evidence,and admitted,at trial.the government argued that they would help prove the requisite intent.to prove that evanson willfully helped participants evade tax obligations,the government had to demonstrate that he had actual knowledge of what the tax laws required.cheek united states,d.if evanson had a belief that he was not violating any of the provisions of the tax laws,he could not be found guilty.id.according to the government,the letters would help it meet this standard because before its investigation,evanson had not required repayment of loans and had informed participants that assets purchased in the names of evanson companies could be transferred to the participants routinely.by concealing the true nature of the loans and nominee purchases,the letters indicated that evanson knew that those features of his operation contravened tax laws.after all,if he thought that his scheme was lawful,why would he attempt to conceal its method of operation after learning of the government investigation see spies united states.willfulness of tax evasion can be demonstrated by conduct likely to mislead or to conceal united states guidry,cir same.
although evanson did not reveal how he intended to respond to the government potential use of the letters,two options we
