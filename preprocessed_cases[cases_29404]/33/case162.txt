opinion of the court 
the trustee appeals from the district court order authorizing the retention of jones,day,reavis and pogue jones day as pillowtex,chapter bankruptcy counsel.the trustee argues that payments of fees by pillowtex to jones day within the days before bankruptcy may have constituted an avoidable preference and that the receipt of such a preference by jones day would constitute a conflict of interest with pillowtex creditors and its bankruptcy estate.the trustee maintains that because the bankruptcy code provides that debtor counsel may not hold or represent an interest adverse to the estate or an interest materially adverse to the interest of any class of creditors,jones day may have been disqualified from serving as pillowtex bankruptcy counsel.without ruling on the trustee preference allegation,the district court approved jones day retention on condition,proposed by jones day,that if jones day is determined to have received a preference,it return the amount of the preference to pillowtex bankruptcy estates and waive any resulting claim.on appeal,the trustee argues that the district court erred in authorizing jones day retention as counsel without making a determination whether jones day received a preference and asks this court to remand and direct the district court to make such a determination promptly.
facts and procedural posture 
pillowtex corporation and its subsidiaries referred to collectively as pillowtex manufacture pillows,blankets,towels and other textiles.jones day has represented and advised pillowtex since in a variety of matters,including corporate,financial,securities,real property,litigation,environmental,intellectual property,labor,employee benefits and tax affairs.prior to filing its bankruptcy petition,pillowtex retained jones day to assist it with contingency planning and bankruptcy preparation.
pillowtex declared bankruptcy on november,by filing a petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code.at the time of filing,pillowtex had approximately in trade debt,about in senior secured debt,and roughly in subordinated debt.for fiscal year,pillowtex gross revenues exceeded,and as of july,its assets were valued at approximately.
on november,pillowtex filed an application with the bankruptcy court to retain and employ jones day as its bankruptcy counsel pursuant to section of the bankruptcy code.pillowtex also applied to retain other professionals to assist it in its restructuring,including kpmg llp kpmg as an independent auditor and consultant.as part of jones day retention application,jones day set forth the date and amount of each payment that pillowtex made to the firm during the year immediately preceding the filing for bankruptcy.the disclosure by jones day showed that pillowtex made the following payments to jones day for services rendered 
the last payment listed,that on november,was made the day before pillowtex filed its petition for bankruptcy and was a retainer of for services rendered or to be rendered by jones day and for reimbursement of expenses including the applied portion of the retainer,pillowtex paid jones day in the year before it declared bankruptcy.of those payments were made in the ninety days before pillowtex filed its petition for bankruptcy.
the filed an objection to the application by jones day and kpmg for retention,arguing that both kpmg and jones day had received payments which constituted voidable preferences under section of the bankruptcy code.according to the trustee,jones day received payments before the filing of the petition which were voidable as preferences as a result of these payments,jones day is not a disinterested person and can not be retained to represent the debtors in possession pillowtex.app.at.eventually,the trustee withdrew his objection to kpmg retention pursuant to stipulation,but continues to press its objection as to jones day and requested a hearing.
before the district court,jones day argued that pillowtex payments to it were substantially within the historical pattern of payments between jones day and the debtors,which included wide swings in the timing of payments.app.at.jones day opposed the requested hearing,arguing that it was not necessary or appropriate for the debtors estates to incur the time and expense of litigating the preference issue.app.at.it proposed instead that if a preference action against the firm is initiated and a final order is entered determining that jones day in fact received a preference,jones day will return to the debtors estates the full amount of the preferential payment and waive any related claim.app.at.jones day noted that the trustee has previously adopted the same approach with respect to debtors accountants,kmpg,but i nexplicably,the trustee will not agree to this resolution with jones day.app.at.
the district court did not definitively determine whether jones day had received a preference from pillowtex.instead,the court adopted jones day suggestion that it authorize the firm retention on condition that if jones day was determined to have received preferential transfers,jones day shall promptly return the same to pillowtex estate and waive any unsecured claim it has by virtue thereof.app.at.according to the district court,subject to the provisions of this order,jones day does not hold or represent any interest adverse to the debtors estates and is a disinterested person,as defined in section of the bankruptcy code and as required by section a of the bankruptcy code.app.at.the trustee timely filed this appeal of the retention order.
the bankruptcy proceeding continued while this appeal proceeded.in the interim,no party has brought a preference action against jones day.the district court ultimately confirmed pillowtex second amended joint plan of reorganization by an order entered may.at oral argument before this court,fred hodara,an attorney for the official committee of unsecured creditors of pillowtex which joined in pillowtex brief on appeal,agreed with the trustee that under pillowtex confirmed plan of reorganization the unsecured creditors only receive pennies on the dollar for their claims.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
this is a core proceeding pursuant to b.the district court exercised jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to and.that court determination of pillowtex application for retention of counsel is a final order,see,united states trustee first jersey,in re first jersey,cir,which this court has jurisdiction to review pursuant to,see,in re marvel entm t group,cir.the confirmation of pillowtex plan of reorganization does not moot this appeal.see,citicorp venture capital committee of unsecured creditors,cir exercising jurisdiction over appeal despite confirmation of a chapter plan michel federated department stores,in re federated department stores,cir holding appeal not moot despite confirmation of plan because bankruptcy court had power on remand to deny pending fee requests and order disgorgement of previously awarded fees.
the trustee has standing to appeal the retention order.the trustee has statutory responsibility to monitor applications for retention of professional persons in bankruptcy cases,and,whenever the united states trustee deems it appropriate,to file with the court comments with respect to the approval of such applications.a h.the relevant statute addresses the trustee standing by explicitly providing that t he united states trustee may raise and may appear and be heard on any issue in any case or proceeding under this title.see also united states trustee price waterhouse,cir.
although jones day argues that it is significant that none of the parties in interest to the bankruptcy objected to its retention as counsel,the house report to the legislation expanding and implementing the trustee program on a national scale,embodied in,expressly puts the trustee on the level of a party,as it states the trustee is given the same right to be heard as a party in interest,but retains discretion to decide when a matter of concern to the proper administration of the bankruptcy laws should be raised,sess,reprinted in.see also in re columbia gas,cir.accordingly,we proceed to consider the issues presented.
discussion 
we review a bankruptcy court decision to approve an application for employment for abuse of discretion.see in re marvel ent mt group,cir an abuse of discretion exists where the district court decision rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact,an errant conclusion of law or an improper application of law to fact.quoting aclu black horse pike reg l bd.of,cir.
a debtor in possession,such as pillowtex,may,with bankruptcy court approval,employ one or more attorneys to represent it and to assist it in fulfilling its duties.see a.the attorneys selected may not be persons who hold or represent an interest adverse to the estate,and must be disinterested persons.id.the bankruptcy code includes as a disinterested person,someone who does not have an interest materially adverse to the interest of the estate or of any class of creditors or equity security holders,by reason of any direct or indirect relationship to,connection with,or interest in,the debtor,or for any other reason.e.prior representation of the debtor does not,of itself,merit disqualification.see b a person is not disqualified for employment under section of this title by a debtor in possession solely because of such person employment by or representation of the debtor before the commencement of the case.
we have considered the statutory requirements for retention of counsel in several opinions.in in re,cir,the bankruptcy court had disqualified counsel after finding that the law firm had an actual conflict of interest by representing both the trustee for the debtor in its chapter proceeding and the two principals of the debtor who had also filed chapter proceedings.in affirming the disqualification of counsel as well as the trustee,we stated that a conflict is actual,and hence per se disqualifying,if it is likely that a professional will be placed in a position permitting it to favor one interest over an impermissibly conflicting interest.see id.at.we noted that,t he term actual conflict of interest is not defined in the code and has been given meaning largely through a evaluation of particular situations arising in the bankruptcy context.id.
we again considered the standards applicable to retention of trustee counsel in in re marvel entertainment group,cir.because the parties urged conflicting interpretations of,we expressly reiterat ed our earlier holding that 
section a,as well as c,imposes a per se disqualification as trustee counsel of any attorney who has an actual conflict of interest the district court may within its to a and consistent with c disqualify an attorney who has a potential conflict of interest and the district court may not disqualify an attorney on the appearance of conflict alone.
id.at emphases added.in marvel entertainment,we reversed the district court disqualification of the trustee and trustee counsel because it was predicated only on the appearance of a conflict.we held that under section a the district court could disqualify counsel only if it had an actual or potential conflict of interest.id.at.
although the retention of counsel for the trustee was at issue in both and marvel entertainment,the same standards apply to the retention of counsel for the debtor in possession.see a subject to any limitations on a trustee serving in a case under this chapter,and to such limitations or conditions as the court prescribes,a debtor in possession shall have all the rights,other than the right to compensation under section of this title,and powers,and shall perform all the functions and duties,except the duties specified in sections a,and of this title,of a trustee serving in a case under this chapter.
in in re first jersey securities,cir,the trustee objected to retention of the counsel proposed by the debtor in possession on the ground that counsel had received a preferential payment,constituting an interest adverse to the estate.notwithstanding that both the bankruptcy court and the district court had approved counsel retention,this court reversed.we stated that w here there is an actual conflict of interest disqualification is mandatory.id.at citing in re marvel entertainment,at.then,in language that the trustee here emphasizes,we stated that a preferential transfer to debtor counsel would constitute an actual conflict of interest between counsel and the debtor,and would require the firm disqualification.at emphasis in original.
we held that counsel was disqualified because within days of the filing for bankruptcy it had received from the debtor stock in payment of a bill of in settlement for antecedent legal work.counsel had argued that the stock payment was made in the ordinary course of business and therefore not subject to avoidance,but we rejected that contention because payment of fees in unregistered restricted securities was a method of payment inconsistent with the parties prior course of dealings.see id.at.the trustee relies on the authority of first jersey securities in pointing to pillowtex payment of substantial fees to jones day as a possible preference.
in this case,the district court never decided whether jones day received an avoidable preference from pillowtex when it accelerated billing for and received payment for past due bills during the ninety days before pillowtex declared bankruptcy.an avoidable preference is defined in section b of the bankruptcy code as 
any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property to or for the benefit of a creditor for or on account of an antecedent debt owed by the debtor before such transfer was made made while the debtor was insolvent made a on or within days before the date of the filing of the petition that enables such creditor to receive more than such creditor would receive in a chapter distribution.
the preference rule prevents debtors from depleting the estate to pay favored creditors with assets that otherwise would have been apportioned among creditors according to the prioritization scheme of the bankruptcy code.see,george treister et,fundamentals of bankruptcy law c,at noting that is designed to achieve the policy of fostering equality of distribution among the creditors of an insolvent debtor.when the debtor becomes insolvent,a payment to one creditor from the estate limited assets is necessarily paid at the expense of another creditor.the receipt of a preference by a creditor thus creates a conflict with unpaid creditors,whose share of the remaining assets is diminished by the payment 
in this court,jones day explained that it sought payment from pillowtex of its outstanding bills in order that it would not be a creditor at the time of the bankruptcy,as that would have disqualified it from retention as counsel the record does not show how much of the fee jones day received within the days before bankruptcy was for bankruptcy preparation,how much was for legal work done years earlier,and what the ordinary practice was in jones day billings to pillowtex and pillowtex payments.jones day did not make a proffer of such information.instead,it argued merely that a hearing was expensive and unnecessary,and proposed that the court could avoid any possible conflict by authorizing retention of jones day subject to the conditions that jones day return any preference it is determined to have received,and jones day waive any claim resulting from the preference.
we agree with the trustee that the court order incorporating the two conditions does not resolve the question whether jones day received an avoidable preference and was therefore not disinterested and whether it should have been disqualified.if payments to jones day were determined to be preferences,jones day would,in any event,be obliged to return the funds to the estate.see t o the extent a transfer is avoided under section of this title,the trustee may recover,for the benefit of the estate,the property transferred,or the value of such property.
nor does its undertaking to waive the claims resulting from the preference resolve the issue of its possible disqualification if the fee payment was an avoidable preference.jones day cites a series of cases to illustrate that a professional can eliminate an adverse interest b
