in personal injury actions involving numerous defendants,separate counsel frequently represent the defendants because their interests are not precisely the same.the defendants,however,often share many common interests,including determining the nature and scope of the plaintiff injuries and the amount of the plaintiff damages.furthermore,the defendants may be able to decrease litigation costs by cooperating and sharing information with each other.attorneys for the defendants therefore sometimes engage in discussions regarding their respective clients common interests.the primary issue in this case is whether attorneys waive the attorney work product privilege by engaging in such discussions.
this issue arose when defendant and respondent lucent polymers,lucent moved to disqualify the metzger law group the metzger firm from representing plaintiff and appellant teresa meza.lucent and other joining defendants argued that the metzger firm should be disqualified because it hired bret drouet,an attorney who previously represented one of the defendants and who participated in meetings in which defense counsel disclosed privileged work product.
in opposition to lucent motion,meza argued that defendants attorneys waived the attorney work product privilege by disclosing their thoughts and impressions about the case to counsel for other defendants.the trial court rejected that argument,found that under the common interest doctrine the defendants did not waive the attorney work product privilege,and granted lucent motion.
we affirm.california recognizes the common interest doctrine.under that doctrine,defendants attorneys did not waive the attorney work product privilege by communicating with each other regarding their respective clients common interests.the trial court therefore did not abuse its discretion in its order disqualifying the metzger firm.
factual and procedural background 
in august,meza filed a complaint against joe plastics,joe plastics and numerous other defendants for personal injuries allegedly resulting from her exposure to toxic chemical products.in october,meza filed a first amended complaint,wherein she named additional defendants,including lucent,for a total of named defendants.at least of these defendants retained separate counsel and filed separate answers to meza amended complaint.attorney drouet of the law firm of waters,mccluskey boehle,represented defendant joe plastics.
meza alleged that from to,she worked as a sorter and packager for aztec concrete accessories,in fontana,california.she further alleged that as a result of her workplace exposure to hundreds of toxic chemicals negligently produced,refined,mixed,formulated,developed,researched,tested,inspected,manufactured,labeled,advertised,warranted,marketed,recommended,sold,distributed and delivered by defendants,she sustained injuries to her internal organs,and became ill with asthma,reactive airways disease,and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.
in march,joe plastics filed a proposed case management conference cmc order and an accompanying declaration by drouet.drouet stated in his declaration that defendants counsel had engaged in two exhaustive and detailed conferences to produce the proposed cmc order.the proposed cmc order stated,in essence,that defense counsel could exchange information regarding their common interests without waiving the and attorney work product privileges with the exception of some minor modifications not relevant here,the trial court adopted the proposed cmc order as an order of the court in april.
in may,defendants entered into a joint defense cost sharing agreement.this agreement,which was signed by drouet on behalf of joe plastics,provided that the defendants would create a common defense fund to share certain joint defense costs incident to the common defense,including fees for depositions of percipient and expert witnesses,expert preparation,site inspection costs for consultants and experts,compilation of medical records by consultants and experts,medical examinations,data base creation and maintenance by consultants and experts,and costs of deposition transcripts.
drouet participated with counsel for the other defendants in many meetings and telephone conferences and exchanged numerous emails with them.on these occasions,defense counsel shared their thoughts and impressions regarding the plaintiff,including her medical condition,discrepancies in her claims,and her presentation as a witness,the plaintiff attorneys,anticipating and analyzing their litigation strategies,the plaintiff percipient and expert witnesses,the joint defense consultants and experts,a site assessment performed at the location where the plaintiff was employed,trial preparation and strategy,and other factual issues and legal strategies.meza concedes for purposes of this appeal that counsel for defendants,including drouet,shared their individual work product concerning this litigation.
in january,the trial court entered judgment in favor of defendants and against meza on the ground that she failed to show any admissible expert evidence establishing causation.meza timely appealed the judgment to this court meza i.in july,while the appeal in meza i was pending,drouet became an associate of the metzger firm,counsel for meza.
in october,the trial court entered an order granting a motion to disqualify the metzger firm.meza timely appealed that order meza ii.meza claims,and defendants do not dispute,that drouet stopped working for the metzger firm in february.
in december,in an unpublished opinion in meza ii,this court reversed the trial court order disqualifying meza counsel,without prejudice,on the ground that the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the matter while meza i was pending.in january,in an unpublished opinion in meza i,this court reversed the judgment against meza and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.
in june,defendant lucent filed a motion to disqualify the metzger firm.defendants and respondents nova polymers,muehlstein,polyone distribution company,and exchange plastics joining defendants joined the motion.meza claims,and defendants do not dispute,that after drouet left the metzger firm,but before lucent filed its motion to disqualify,meza dismissed joe plastics from the lawsuit.
in support of her opposition to the motion to disqualify,meza filed a declaration by drouet.drouet stated that he never directly communicated with defendants other than joe plastics,and that counsel for the other defendants never disclosed to him any communications they had with their clients.drouet further stated that he did not have any communications with anyone at the metzger firm regarding this action.
after holding a hearing on the motion to disqualify,the trial court took the matter under submission and conducted an in camera review of certain written communications among defense counsel submitted under seal by lucent.thereafter,the trial court granted lucent motion to disqualify the metzger firm.this appeal followed.
contentions 
meza makes three major arguments.first,meza argues that even if drouet received privileged information,the trial court erred in disqualifying the entire metzger firm because drouet did not share any privileged information with the metzger firm and because meza will suffer irreparable harm if the firm is unable to represent her.
next,meza contends that lucent and the joining defendants did not have standing to seek disqualification of the metzger firm because they did not have an relationship with drouet.
finally,meza argues that lucent failed to establish that the communications among drouet and other defense counsel were protected under the common interest doctrine.consequently,meza claims,lucent and the other defendants waived their attorney work product privilege with respect to communications with drouet,and thus the metzger firm employment of drouet was not ground for the firm disqualification.

the attorney work product doctrine.
the legislature has codified the attorney work product doctrine in code of civil procedure section et see rico mitsubishi motors cal th,d,rico.section provides it is the policy of the state to do both of the following a preserve the rights of attorneys to prepare cases for trial with that degree of privacy necessary to encourage them to prepare their cases thoroughly and to investigate not only the favorable but the unfavorable aspects of those cases.b prevent attorneys from taking undue advantage of their adversary industry and efforts.
an attorney work product is the product of the attorney effort,research,and thought in the preparation of his client case.it includes the results of his own work,and the work of those employed by him or for him by his client,in investigating both the favorable and unfavorable aspects of the case,the information thus assembled,and the legal theories and plan of strategy developed by the as reflected in interviews,statements,memoranda,correspondence,briefs,and any other writings reflecting the attorney impressions,conclusions,opinions,or legal research or theories and in countless other tangible and intangible ways.bp alaska exploration,superior court d,fn,italics omitted bp alaska see also ranch superior court th,d.
an attorney has a qualified privilege against the discovery of general work product and an absolute privilege against disclosures of writings containing an attorney impressions,conclusions,opinions or legal theories.bp alaska,supra,d at.although the attorney is the holder of the work product privilege,a client has standing to assert the privilege on behalf of a former attorney who is absent from the litigation.id.at.the privilege may also be asserted by a pro se litigant because the privilege is intended for the protection of litigants,not just attorneys.dowden superior court th,d dowden.
drouet was disqualified from representing meza.
when an attorney successively represents clients with adverse interests,the attorney has a potential conflict of interest.if there is a substantial relationship between the subjects of the antecedent and current representations,the attorney must be disqualified.flatt superior court cal th,d,flatt.in other words,if an attorney represents client x,then represents client y,and x and y have adverse interests,the attorney has a conflict of interest and is disqualified from representing y if his previous representation of x is substantially related to his subsequent representation of 
the substantial relationship test mediates between two interests that are in tension in such a freedom of the subsequent client to counsel of choice,on the one hand,and the interest of the former client in ensuring the permanent confidentiality of matters disclosed to the attorney in the course of the prior representation,on the other.where the requisite substantial relationship between the subjects of the prior and the current representations can be demonstrated,access to confidential information by the attorney in the course of the first representation relevant,by definition,to the second representation is presumed and disqualification of the attorney representation of the second client is mandatory flatt,supra,cal th at,d.
under the substantial relationship test,drouet was clearly disqualified from representing meza in this action.there was more than a mere substantial relationship between meza suit and drouet representation of joe plastics.drouet represented joe plastics in the very same suit meza was pursuing.this was a per se conflict of interest that disqualified drouet from representing meza in this case.see rules conduct,rule c.
the trial court did not abuse its discretion in disqualifying the entire metzger firm.
meza argues that even if drouet were disqualified from representing her,the entire metzger firm was not.meza claims that drouet did not have communications with anyone at the metzger firm regarding this case and that the law firm employed extensive screening procedures to prevent drouet from disclosing confidential information.
as a general rule in california,where an attorney is disqualified from representation,the entire law firm is vicariously disqualified as well.citations.this is especially true where the attorney disqualification is due to his prior representation of the opposing side during the same lawsuit.henriksen great american savings loan th,d,fn.omitted henriksen see also flatt,supra,cal th at,d.accordingly,an ethical wall between an attorney with confidential information and his or her firm will generally not preclude the disqualification of the firm.henriksen,at,d.instead,there is a presumption that each member of the firm has imputed knowledge of the confidential information.speedee,supra,cal th at,d,flatt,at,d.
arguably the risk of drouet disclosing confidential information to the metzger firm substantially diminished when drouet left the firm.we are also mindful that meza interest in selecting her own counsel should be given due consideration.the trial court,however,acted well within its discretion in disqualifying the metzger firm.
prior to joining the metzger firm,drouet engaged in numerous oral and written communications with counsel for lucent and the joining defendants,wherein defense counsel revealed substantial confidential and privileged attorney work product.this work product included defense counsel impressions,conclusions and opinions about critical issues in the case.for good practical reasons,including saving judicial resources,the trial court expressly ordered that defense counsel could share work product regarding issues of common interest without waiving the work product privilege the metzger firm knew of this order before it hired drouet but chose to hire drouet anyway.the trial court could have reasonably concluded that allowing the metzger firm to represent meza would undermine california policy in favor of protecting attorney work product,its own cmc order,and the integrity and fairness of the proceedings.
we are not persuaded by meza argument that the disqualification of the metzger firm will cause her irreparable harm.meza has presented no evidence to support her claim that metzger is the only firm in the state of california that regularly litigates interstitial lung disease and asthma cases.in any case,the trial court could reasonably find that defendants interest in protecting attorney work product outweighed meza interest in choosing her counsel.
meza compares drouet tenure at the metzger firm with the brief and insubstantial contact between a lawyer and an opposing party in in re marriage of zimmerman th,d zimmerman trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying former wife motion to disqualify her former husband attorney.this comparison is unpersuasive for at least two reasons.the first is that meza is comparing apples with oranges.meza is comparing the relationship between a lawyer drouet and his new firm metzger in this case with the relationship between a party and an attorney at the opposing party law firm in zimmerman.second,the relationship in zimmerman consisted of a telephone conversation prior to the commencement of litigation.drouet representation of joe plastics and his relationship with the metzger firm were far more substantial.zimmerman therefore does not support meza position.
meza reliance on adams th,d,is equally misplaced.in adams,an attorney previous law firm advised a manufacturer about the disposal of toxic waste at a particular site.the attorney,hackard,did not personally advise the manufacturer about that issue or any other issue.nine years after leaving the firm,hackard represented plaintiffs against the same manufacturer in a case arising from its alleged wrongful disposal of toxic waste at the site.the court held that the imputed knowledge doctrine,that is,the doctrine that a lawyer knowledge of confidential information is imputed to other attorneys in his or her firm,does not
