the defendant,craven phipps,pleaded guilty to aggravated driving under the influence aggravated dui ilcs d f west and was sentenced to years imprisonment.following the denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea,the defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.on appeal,the defendant argues that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel at the plea proceedings.we reverse and remand for additional proceedings.
on april,the defendant drove a car that collided with a car driven by malocka gille.gille died as a result of the collision.immediately following the collision,the defendant was ticketed for violating a local traffic ordinance and for one count of driving under the influence ilcs a west.on april,the defendant was charged by indictment with one count of reckless homicide ilcs a west.the indictment indicated that the charge was a class felony,subject to special sentencing.
we note that,prior to,section of the criminal code of criminal code generally classified reckless homicide as a class felony,punishable by two to five years in prison ilcs d west ilcs a west.in addition to that general classification,section e provided in pertinent part as follows 
i n cases involving reckless homicide in which the defendant was determined to have been under the influence of alcohol or any other drug or drugs as an element of the offense,or in cases in which the defendant is proven beyond a reasonable doubt to have been under the influence of alcohol or any other drug or drugs,the penalty shall be a class felony,for which a person,if sentenced to a term of imprisonment,shall be sentenced to a term of not less than years and not more than years.ilcs e west.
effective july,approximately nine months prior to the defendant committing the instant offense,the legislature amended section of the criminal code pub.act,eff.july,in response to our supreme court decision in people pomykala.in pomykala,our supreme court held that section b created an improper mandatory presumption because,once a jury concluded that a defendant was intoxicated,the jury was to presume that the defendant was reckless unless the defendant proved otherwise.pomykala,at.under the newly enacted version of section,reckless homicide remained a class felony punishable by two to five years in prison ilcs d west ilcs a west.however,public act made significant changes to section,including removing subsection e,under which reckless homicide involving dui alcohol or drugs was classified as a class felony punishable by to years in prison.
in addition,public act amended section d of the illinois vehicle code vehicle code ilcs d west,which defines aggravated dui,by adding language similar to section e of the criminal code to offset the removal of section e.in particular,public act added section d f of the vehicle code,which provides in pertinent part as follows 
every person convicted of committing a violation of this s ection shall be guilty of aggravated driving under the influence of alcohol,other drug or drugs,or intoxicating compound or compounds,or any combination thereof if 
f the person,in committing a dui violation,was involved in a motor vehicle,snowmobile,vehicle,or watercraft accident that resulted in the death of another person,when the violation was a proximate cause of the death.ilcs d f west.
public act also amended section d to provide,in pertinent part,that aggravated dui alcohol or drugs is a class felony with a penalty range of to years in prison if the violation resulted in the death of one person.ilcs d west.
despite this change in the law,the state,defense counsel,and the trial court all acted as if the reckless homicide statute had not been amended.on august,defense counsel informed the trial court that the defendant would be entering a plea of guilty to reckless homicide in exchange for the state recommending a sentencing cap of years imprisonment.the trial court then asked the state if,based on the special sentencing provisions,the sentencing range was to years imprisonment.the state indicated that it was.the trial court then admonished the defendant that,based on the plea agreement,the defendant could receive a sentence of up to years imprisonment.the defendant indicated that he understood that he could receive a sentence of up to years imprisonment.the trial court subsequently accepted the defendant plea,entered a judgment of conviction,and ordered the preparation of a presentence investigation report.
on november,prior to sentencing,the state filed a motion to vacate the defendant guilty plea.the state asserted that the legislature had found the statute under which the defendant had pleaded guilty ilcs a west to be void.the state further asserted that the appropriate charge against the defendant was aggravated dui ilcs d f west.
we note that the state rationale for its motion was incorrect.the legislature had not determined that the reckless homicide statute was void.see people lush,d.rather,the legislature had amended that statute so as to remove the mandatory presumption language and the special sentencing provisions.see lush,d at.
on december,the trial court conducted a hearing on the state motion.defense counsel explained to the court 
it the state and the defendant intention at this time to vacate the previous plea entered on the reckless homicide,the same exact behavior encompassed in the aggravated driving under the influence of alcohol statute.we believe it eliminates any question regarding the validity of the statute if we vacate the plea on the reckless homicide,enter a plea instead to the charge of aggravated dui.
after the state indicated that it agreed with defense counsel statement,the trial court granted the state motion to vacate the defendant plea.the state then filed an information charging the defendant with aggravated dui.the information alleged 
that on or about the day of april,in the county of winnebago,state of illinois,craven phipps committed the offense of aggravated driving under the influence of alcohol in that he drove a motor vehicle within this state while under the influence of alcohol,in violation of ilcs a,was involved in a motor vehicle accident upon a public highway,namely auburn street,in the city of rockford,illinois,with a motor vehicle being driven by malocka gille,said motor vehicle accident causing the death of malocka gille,and said violation was the proximate cause of the death of malocka gille in violation of ilcs d f.class sentencing range of to years if sic.fine.
the defendant waived preliminary hearing and entered a plea of guilty to aggravated dui,which the trial court accepted on the same day.
on december,following a hearing,the trial court sentenced the defendant to years imprisonment.on january,the defendant filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea and a motion to reconsider his sentence.on march,following a hearing,the trial court denied the motions.the defendant thereafter filed a timely notice of appeal.
on appeal,the defendant argues that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel.specifically,the defendant contends that his counsel should have objected to the state motion to revise the plea agreement to vacate the plea to reckless homicide,a class felony,and substitute the charge with that of aggravated dui,a class felony.additionally,the defendant argues that,under the compulsory joinder statute,the state is required to prosecute all charges in a single prosecution.as the state failed to bring an aggravated dui charge against him within days of his being placed in custody,thereby violating the statute ilcs a west,the defendant argues that his counsel was ineffective for not objecting to the state filing an aggravated dui charge against him days after he was taken into custody.
prior to addressing the merits of the defendant appeal,we first address the state argument that,by pleading guilty,the defendant has waived his right to challenge on appeal the effectiveness of his trial counsel.in making this argument,the state relies on the law set forth in people stone,d,which provides 
it is well established that a voluntary guilty plea waives all nonjurisdictional errors or irregularities,including constitutional errors.people townsell.a guilty plea represents a break in the chain of events which has preceded it in the criminal process.when a criminal defendant has solemnly admitted in open court that he is in fact guilty of the offense with which he is charged,he may not thereafter raise independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea.he may only attack the voluntary and intelligent character of the guilty plea by showing that the advice he received from counsel was not within the standards set forth in mcmann.tollett henderson,d,citing mcmann richardson,d,defendant must show that advice was not within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.stone,d at.
here,the defendant is arguing on appeal that his attorney representation at the plea proceedings was not within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.thus,the defendant did not waive his right to challenge the effectiveness of his counsel representation.see people palmer,supreme court considered on direct appeal issue of defense counsel effectiveness at plea proceedings.
the state further argues that the defendant has waived the right to challenge the effectiveness of his counsel representation because he did not raise that issue in his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.the state correctly notes that the trial court allowed the defendant to speak with another attorney regarding whether he wanted to pursue an claim.the defendant informed the conflict attorney that he did not wish to pursue that claim.thus,the defendant original counsel continued to represent him at the hearing on his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.
even though the trial court gave the defendant the opportunity to raise an claim at the proceedings below and the defendant chose not do so,we do not believe it would be appropriate to determine that the defendant is now procedurally barred from raising that issue on appeal.waiver is a limitation on the parties,but does not limit the court ability to consider the issue.people peden,d.because both the parties and the trial court demonstrated some confusion as to the effects of the legislature amendment of the reckless homicide statute,the waiver rule should be relaxed.
having determined that the issue has not been waived for our review,we note our perplexity that the state raised no argument in its appellate brief other than waiver.the cases cited above as to when the waiver doctrine applies are not novel.moreover,although the state has the right to argue any procedural basis to affirm the trial court judgment,we believe that to rely solely on that basis,particularly when the defendant is asserting the substantial deprivation of a constitutional right,is inappropriate.the role of the state on appeal is more than just arguing that the lower court decision should be affirmed.the state role is to provide arguments sounded in law and,if necessary,to concede errors below,to help ensure that this court reaches a just resolution of the case before it.see united states wade,d,white,concurring in part and dissenting in part,joined by harlan and stewart,jj,quoting berger united states,setting forth that the state obligation in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case but that justice shall be done.
turning to the merits of the defendant appeal,we first observe that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is judged according to the,test established in strickland washington,d.people lawton,people albanese.to obtain relief under strickland,a defendant must prove that defense counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that this substandard performance caused prejudice by creating a reasonable probability that,but for counsel errors,the trial result would have been different.people boyd,d.
an attorney failure to seek discharge of his client on grounds generally will be deemed ineffective assistance of counsel if there is a reasonable probability that the defendant would have been discharged had a timely motion for discharge been made and no justification has been proffered for the attorney failure to bring such a motion.people staten,people peco,d.we address the likelihood of success of a motion to discharge before analyzing whether counsel was justified in declining to move for a speedy trial.see boyd,d at.
section a of the code of criminal procedure of provides that a defendant is entitled to a trial within days from the date he was taken into custody unless his own acts occasioned delay.ilcs a west.in this case,the defendant was taken into custody on april.all of the offenses arose from a single incident,but the state filed charges against the defendant on two different dates.on april,the defendant was charged with committing reckless homicide.on december,the defendant was charged with aggravated dui.
the rule for determining the number of days attributable to the state when new and additional charges are brought against a previously charged defendant was initially stated in people williams,d,
where new and additional charges arise from the same facts as did the original charges and the state had knowledge of these facts at the commencement of the prosecution,the time within which trial is to begin on the new and additional charges is subject to the same statutory limitation that is applied to the original charges.continuances obtained in connection with the trial of the original charges can not be attributed to defendants with respect to the new and additional charges because these new and additional charges were not before the court when those continuances were obtained.williams,d at.
in people williams,our supreme court reiterated its approval of the rule but stated that it applies only to new and additional charges that are subject to compulsory joinder under section of the criminal code ilcs west.the court concluded that the statute should not be interpreted to require joinder that is not already mandated by section of the criminal code.williams,at.the court restated the rule and emphasized its rationale 
if the initial and subsequent charges filed against the defendant are subject to compulsory joinder,delays attributable to the defendant on the initial charges are not attributable to the defendant on the subsequent charges.
the harm in a contrary result is obvious a trial by ambush.the state could lull the defendant into acquiescing to pretrial delays on pending charges,while it prepared for a trial on more serious,charges.we can not presume that a defendant would have agreed to a continuance if he had faced both charges.as justice kuehn presciently observed,all choices about requests that would delay proceedings would be made under a false understanding as a result of this deception.when the state filed the more serious charges,the defendant would face a hobson choice between a trial without adequate preparation and further pretrial detention to prepare for trial.today,we do not create a loophole for criminal defendants.instead,we close a loophole which would allow the state to circumvent a statutorily implemented constitutional right.williams,at,quoting people williams,d,slip op.at unpublished order under supreme court rule kuehn,dissenting.
in this case,the period for the original charges will also apply to the aggravated dui charge only if the new charge was subject to compulsory joinder.the provision of the criminal code states as follows 
a when the same conduct of a defendant may establish the commission of more than one offense,the defendant may be prosecuted for each such offense.
b if the several offenses are known to the proper prosecuting officer at the time of commencing the prosecution and are within the jurisdiction of a single court,they must be prosecuted in a single prosecution,except as provided in subsection c,if they are based on the same act.
c when or more offenses are charged as required by subsection b,the court in the interest of justice may order that one or more of such charges shall be tried separately.ilcs west.
here,the reckless homicide charge set forth that on
