appellant tommy thompson,in his capacity as trustee of the lazarus exempt trust,presents this appeal to challenge a ruling of the bankruptcy court,affirmed by the district court,holding thompson predecessor bradley beutel in contempt of court and imposing monetary sanctions.we conclude that beutel conduct in the time period between the district court announcement of an injunction and its reduction to writing was contemptuous,and accordingly affirm.
facts and proceedings 
this appeal grows out of the circumstances described in our previous decision in bradley ingalls in re bradley,concerning the bankruptcy of gary bradley 
in the,the fdic obtained a judgment for over million against bradley,his business partner james gressett,and their large real estate development company,circle c development.gressett filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in the early and received a discharge.in,bradley and gressett decided to separate their business interests by dividing,transforming,and transferring assets representing bradley share into a trust to be formed for the purpose of protecting his assets from creditors.bradley beutel,bradley cousin and close business associate,was chosen to identify,reconfigure,and transfer assets of values equivalent to bradley share into the trust.
id.at.in may,bradley sister created the lazarus exempt trust the trust.she named predecessor to current appellant trustee.
after substantial assets had been transferred to the trust,bradley declared bankruptcy.the bankruptcy court concluded that the trust was part of a fraudulent scheme 
for those of us looking in,this is an incredibly fraudulent scheme engaged in primarily by gary bradley,the debtor,gressett,the debtor business partner,and,with the trust formation,bradley beutel,the trustee,as well,to hide the assets bradley owned,to place them into the trust when formed and to preserve them from the clutches of bradley creditors,the fdic and the irs.
see bradley ingalls in re bradley,quoting earlier opinion see also at detailing the bankruptcy court more specific findings regarding the trust.the bankruptcy court denied bradley discharge from bankruptcy for transferring,removing,destroying,mutilating,or concealing property of the debtor with intent to hinder,delay,or defraud a creditor,pursuant to a a.it concluded that the trust was largely under texas law and was therefore not protected from creditors.see at.the bankruptcy court allowed the bankruptcy appellee ronald recover from the trust those assets that he could demonstrably trace from beutel possession to the trust possession at the time.some other assets were ruled beyond ingalls reach,however,because although ingalls had traced them from bradley to the trust,he had failed to show that those identical assets or products of those assets were still in the trust or that they had become commingled with trust assets.id.at.ingalls,beutel,and bradley all appealed aspects of the bankruptcy court ruling.the district court affirmed,and we did as well.see id.at.
the present appeal concerns beutel diversion of property from entities in the time period between the april,trial on the merits in the bankruptcy court and the issuance of the bankruptcy court resulting ruling on october.prior to the trial,the bankruptcy court had enjoined beutel from transferring property or money of the trust to himself or to entities controlled by him or represented by bradley attorney.that injunction expired at the trial conclusion.at that point,beutel began making preparations to sell significant trust assets,particularly real estate belonging to a entity called phoenix holdings.this property would later be among the assets held to be.
in order to prevent beutel from disposing of the phoenix properties or other trust assets,ingalls,together with the united states and fdic as creditors,filed a joint motion to maintain status quo pending final ruling in adversary proceeding.beutel did not attend the august,hearing on the motion,where beutel attorney admitted there were preparations to dispose of the phoenix property.at the hearing,the bankruptcy court informed the parties it would enter an injunction somewhat narrower than requested,stating that 
i going to enjoin beutel as trustee from disposing of any asset owned by any entity in which the trust owns at least percent of the equity or which it controls except that the trustee may sell,through his control of any of those entities,any asset of those entities if the sale is for a fair value and at arm length and provided further that the consideration therefore be maintained in that entity except for the payment of valid,claims of those entities and shall not be disbursed to other entities in which the trust owns an interest,to the trustee,to the beneficiary of the trust,or to entities connected to certain other individuals associated with the debtor.
the bankruptcy court instructed beutel counsel to take the lead in drafting a corresponding order.
it took almost a month for the bankruptcy court to enter the order,and in the meantime beutel effected the sale of trust assets.on september,counsel for ingalls submitted a proposed draft injunction to the bankruptcy court that same day,beutel closed the sale of the phoenix property and other trust assets.beginning september,beutel began to disperse funds received from the sale to various entities controlled by the trust,himself,and bradley.on september,beutel filed a motion to approve disbursements,seeking permission to make certain transfers contrary to the injunction previously announced it was not until september,that the bankruptcy court issued its ultimate written injunction,with terms essentially corresponding to those it had announced at the hearing.
on motion from ingalls and the government creditors,the bankruptcy court later held beutel,personally and in his capacity as trustee,in contempt for transferring trust property and failing to retain the consideration received in the entities that sold the property.see bradley ingalls in re bradley.it concluded that beutel transferred and diverted sale consideration away from trust entities later determined to be property of the bankruptcy estate,by various means including the initial structuring of the sale transactions.the contempt process took several years.ingalls,the fdic,and the united states initially filed a motion for contempt in october.consideration of the motion was delayed while the parties conducted discovery and litigated the appeal of the bankruptcy court rulings from the trial on the merits.the movants filed a first amended joint motion for contempt on december.after a trial at which beutel testified in his own defense,the bankruptcy court granted the motion,leading to this appeal.
the bankruptcy court rejected beutel testimony,in which he claimed that he had not known about the injunction until late september when the court issued the final written order.it concluded that beutel testimony was either an error of memory or perjury,id.at,and leaned toward the latter conclusion 
this court does not believe beutel testimony that he knew nothing about the injunction until september,in any manner,shape or form.beutel attempt to use the ostrich with his head stuck in the sand defense is not only implausible,it is patently ridiculous.his testimony can not be believed,and the court no longer holds any faith in beutel ability or desire to be truthful.he is the epitome of the witness.and,it is obvious that he chose not to attend the august hearing so he would not have to testify about the pending sale.
the bankruptcy court enumerated other key observations,findings,and conclusions in a list of reasons for holding beutel in contempt and sanctioning him 
this is a civil contempt issue not a criminal contempt issue.no imprisonment is involved.
beutel had actual knowledge of the court oral injunction stated on the record august.
the august,oral injunction was clear and specific.
it was only after the injunction was pronounced on the record that beutel counsel disclosed the existence of the pending sale.
the remainder of the hearing was devoted primarily to beutel counsel clarifying the exact extent of the injunction orally pronounced on the record approximately of the total time of the hearing.
the sale in question had been beutel primary focus from the end of the trial on the,the date of the injunction hearing.
beutel did not come to the so he could avoid being put on the stand and potentially have to testify about the pending sale.
the sale was of a great portion of real estate owned by the trust through two of its entities and would result in substantial cash being generated which beutel needed.
beutel believed he was restrained by the oral injunction of august.his september,motion stated unequivocally the existence of this court injunction which required him to obtain this court approval for making payments to related entities.the only such order in existence as of that date was the oral injunction of august.
beutel counsel was to draft the written order.it was a relatively simple order.yet it was not submitted to this court for entry until september,approximately four weeks after the august,hearing and two weeks after beutel counsel filed a september,motion to approve disbursements of the remaining sales proceeds.why was the september motion filed if beutel and his counsel did not believe the injunction was in place 
the september,motion to approve certain transactions and payments from the sales proceeds is a judicial admission as to the existence of the august,injunction and its validity.otherwise,there would be no reason for counsel to have filed the motion.
beutel wanton contemptuous behavior should neither be condoned nor encouraged.
courts should be able to rely upon a party counsel and their duty to the courts.
id.at.the bankruptcy court analyzed various aspects of the transaction and determined beutel had transferred to related entities in violation of the oral injunction and in contempt of court.it declined to order return of those assets because m ovants have failed to name any of these entities as respondents herein or to otherwise pursue them.id.at.it held beutel in contempt,however,and imposed sanctions against beutel personally and against thompson as beutel successor as trustee,jointly and severally for the entire amount.id.the district court affirmed.
ingalls subsequently settled with beutel,personally.thompson now appeals the contempt order and sanctions in his capacity as trustee.neither the united states nor the fdic is a party to the appeal.
ii.standard of review 
like the district court,this court reviews a bankruptcy court findings of fact for clear error,and its legal conclusions de novo.placid refining terrebonne fuel lube,in re terrebonne fuel lube,cir.where the district court has affirmed the bankruptcy court factual findings,we will only reverse if left with a firm conviction that error has been committed.id.a bankruptcy court assessment of monetary sanctions for contempt is reviewed for abuse of discretion.see also am.airlines,allied pilots ass n,cir reviewing contempt finding and damage award for abuse of discretion in appeal.
iii.discussion 
thompson challenges three aspects of the rulings below.most significantly,he argues that he was under no judicial compulsion prior to issuance of a written injunction,and that he can not be held in contempt for violation of an oral injunction.we will consider this argument in some depth.he also argues that the proceedings were confusing and failed to provide adequate notice of the conduct proscribed,and that some of his conduct deemed contemptuous actually did not violate the bankruptcy court orders.these arguments are unpersuasive.
availability of contempt sanctions for violation of an injunction not yet reduced to writing 
seventh circuit authority 
thompson main argument is that oral pronouncements at the august hearing were not enforceable by contempt until commemorated in a written order that complied with federal rule of civil procedure.he supports this argument by citation to two decisions of the seventh circuit,bates johnson,cir and hispanics united of dupage county village of addison,cir,which stand for the proposition that an injunction not reduced to writing is not a valid,appealable injunction under the federal rules of civil procedure 
bates concerned a district court that purported to orally prohibit certain actions by the state of illinois,but refused that state requests to put the command in writing.at.the court of appeals stated it was puzzled by the district judge unwillingness to put on paper what he said several times in court,and held that an oral ruling,by itself,does not comply with the requirements of federal rules of civil procedure d and.id.at.rule d provides in part that e very order granting an injunction and every restraining order must comply with certain requirements bates interpreted order in this sentence to refer to a written document only,and therefore concluded that the district court oral command did not comply with the rule.at.more importantly,the court noted rule,under which an injunction order must be accompanied by a judgment set out in a separate document.see at.it invoked seventh circuit authority emphasizing that,where a judgment is required,it is the judgment,not the order,that contains the court decree.see id.in light of these requirements,the court considered the raw oral commands of the district court to be a nullity a judge who proclaims i enjoin you and does not follow up with an injunction has done nothing.id.at citations omitted.because the state is not under an enforceable constraint,the court concluded that there is nothing before us on appeal.id.at.
similarly in hispanics united,the seventh circuit focused on the lack of binding effect and appealability of a court purported oral modification of a consent decree.the district court had issued several orders under which an emergency motion for temporary restraining order and for interpretation and enforcement of consent decree was granted to the extent allowed in open court.at.the court of appeals considered this no better than the injunction in bates that was never memorialized in writing.id.at.
thompson suggests that we must either accept his position or split with these seventh circuit cases,but we conclude there is no need for that choice.this case arises in a different context from the seventh circuit decisions,and presents different circumstances.bates and hispanics united discussed the inadequacy of oral decrees in determining whether there was a valid,appealable order,not in the context of contempt proceedings.furthermore,in the present case,in contrast to the district courts in bates and hispanics united,the bankruptcy court did follow up with an injunction materially identical to the oral command.in contrast to parties before the seventh circuit,beutel was held in contempt for violating an order he considered to be binding,and which,in any case,would shortly become binding upon him.the bankruptcy court held beutel in contempt for violating a central,common prohibition in the oral injunction and ultimate written command to retain the consideration from trust property sales in the entities whose property was sold,rather than diverting funds to entities potentially unreachable by the bankruptcy trustee.there is no allegation of clear error in the district court factual finding that beutel in fact considered himself bound by the oral injunction,and that he falsely claimed he consummated the subject transactions in ignorance of it.the question we face is not whether the bankruptcy court acted properly to create an effective,appealable order.it is whether beutel manifestly improper actions can render him liable for contempt.
contempt analysis 
the first step in the analysis is to determine whether the contempt here was civil or criminal the bankruptcy court may have associated criminal contempt with imprisonment,when it stated that t his is a civil contempt issue not a criminal contempt issue.no imprisonment is involved.at.that would not be the correct basis for the distinction 
a contempt order or judgment is characterized as either civil or criminal depending upon its primary purpose.if the purpose of the sanction is to punish the contemnor and vindicate the authority of the court,the order is viewed as criminal.if the purpose of the sanction is to coerce the contemnor into compliance with a court order,or to compensate another party for the contemnor violation,the order is considered purely civil.
lamar fin.adams,cir internal citations omitted.imprisonment is an appropriate remedy for either civil or criminal contempt,depending on how it is assessed.if the prison term is conditional and coercive,the character of the contempt is civil if it is and unconditional it is criminal.see generally shillitani united states,d holding that prison sentence of two years with automatic release upon compliance with court decree indicated civil contempt.similarly,a lump sum fine that punishes past conduct is criminal,while a fine that accrues on an ongoing basis in response to noncompliance is civil.compare am.airlines,allied pilots ass n,cir discussing imposition of criminal fine with hunt hunt in re hunt,cir discussing imposition of civil fine.
the present case concerns neither punitive criminal contempt nor coercive civil contempt rather it concerns compensatory or remedial civil contempt.civil contempt can serve two purposes,either coercing compliance with an order or compensat ing a party who has suffered unnecessary injuries or costs because of contemptuous conduct.travelhost,blandford,cir citing petroleos mexicanos crawford,cir.like criminal contempt,remedial civil contempt is but remedial contempt is civil,because it remedies the consequences of defiant conduct on an opposing party,rather than punishing the defiance per se.it accordingly does not require the special safeguards that accompany criminal contempt proceedings,such as establishment of mens rea and proof beyond a reasonable doubt.see mccomb jacksonville paper.holding that remedial civil contempt does not require proof of criminal intent griffith oles in re hipp,cir discussing character of criminal contempt as a crime in the ordinary sense,requiring a presumption of innocence,proof beyond a reasonable doubt,and protection against.the present proceeding is a remedial civil contempt proceeding,because the bankruptcy court held beutel liable to the bankruptcy estate rather than imposing a fine payable to the court.accordingly,we must determine if the remedial civil contempt power extends to defiance of a bankruptcy court injunction whose terms are known,but which has not yet been formalized as required by procedural rules.
if this were criminal contempt,we would have little difficulty concluding that the contempt power reaches beutel conduct as found by the bankruptcy court.criminal contempt in the federal courts is governed by,which allows punishment of d isobedience or resistance to a court lawful writ,process,order,rule,decree,or command.beutel conduct certainly constitutes willful resistance to the court lawful command,and arguably falls within other terms of the statute.consistent with this analysis,we have affirmed criminal contempt sanctions for violation of a bankruptcy court oral order later reduced to writing.see in re hipp,cir.we explained in hipp that the bankruptcy court orally granted an injunction prohibiting david oles from burdening certain disputed property with lis pendens filings.id.at.the order was reduced to writing and entered approximately one month later.id.the district court found oles to be in contempt of the oral order,which we deemed appropriate.id.at citing in re lamarre,cir for the proposition that an order entered in open court in presence of the defendant may be enforced by criminal contempt.oles argued that the oral order did not explicitly prohibit his conduct,pointing to the written order which was more specific,but we concluded the oral order was clear enough to provide notice of the proscribed conduct and subject him to contempt sanctions.id.at.
our precedents regarding remedial civil contempt do not appear to have addressed the question.we have often stated that the elements of civil contempt are that a court order was in effect,and that the order required certain conduct by the respondent,and that the respondent failed to comply with the court order,fed.deposit ins.legrand,cir emphasis added citing martin trinity,cir.but this formulation does not reflect any holding that civil compensatory contempt is unavailable in a circumstance like the one that confronts us here.the language is ultimately derived from the statement of the supreme court in mccomb jacksonville paper that c ivil contempt is a sanction to enforce compliance with an order of the court or to compensate for losses or damages sustained by reason of noncompliance.like our cases,mccomb discusses civil contempt in the context of violation of a formal order of the court,but it does not address the question whether civil contempt is also available for a knowing violation of an oral order before it is reduced to writing.
we therefore turn to the nature of the contempt power.it is settled law that the power to punish for contempt is an inherent power of the federal courts and that it includes the power to punish violations of their own orders.united states fidanian,cir citations omitted.the supreme court described the nature and necessity of the power in gompers buck stove range 
w hile it is sparingly to be used,yet the power of courts to punish for contempts is a necessary and integral part of the independence of the judiciary,and is absolutely essential to the performance of the duties imposed on them by law.without it they are mere boards of arbitration,whose judgments and decrees would be only advisory.
if a party can make himself a judge of the validity of orders which have been issued,and by his own act of disobedience set them aside,then are the courts impotent,and what the constitution now fittingly calls the judicial power of the united states would be a mere mockery.
this power has been uniformly held to be necessary to the protection of the court from insults and oppression while in the ordinary exercise of its duty,and to enable it to enforce its judgments and orders necessary to the due administration of law and the protection of the rights of citizens.
while the criminal contempt power is limited by,civil contempt remains a creature of inherent power.see spallone united states,d referring to the axiom that courts have inherent power to enforce compliance with their lawful orders through civil contempt.internal quotation marks omitted nasco,calcasieu television radio,cir f ederal courts have inherent power to police themselves by civil contempt,imposition of fines,the awarding of costs and the shifting of fees.in mccomb,the court described civil contempt in broad terms,encompassing sanctions that prevent experimentation with disobedience of the law,and remedial powers determined by the requirements of full remedial relief,as necessary to effect compliance with the court decree.at.citations omitted see also spallone,at.referring to the inherent contempt power as a basis for the exercise of broad equitable powers united states alcoa,cir d istrict courts have wide discretion to enforce decrees and to implement remedies for decree violations courts have,and must have,the inherent authority to enforce their judicial orders and decrees in cases of civil contempt.
we see no reason why the civil contempt power,as generally recognized in our courts,should not reach beutel conduct.as discussed above,the power is broad and pragmatic,reaching where it with prudent court management and due prevent insults,oppression,and experimentation with disobedience of the law.beutel shell game with the proceeds of trust property is the type of conduct contempt targets,and there is no doubt that he received adequate notice and opportunity to be heard at all stages of the proceedings.his conduct had the effect of frustrating not only the injunction,but also the trial on the merits,by diverting funds from trust entities that the bankruptcy court would later rule belonged to the bankruptcy estate.the district court clearly beutel intentionally avoided the injunction hearing because he intended to sell trust assets and distribute the proceeds in a manner that h
