jess rodrigues appeals the district court dismissal of his federal habeas petition.rodrigues argues that the district court erred by denying his request for an evidentiary hearing to examine alleged conflicts of interest on the part of defense counsel.the panel has jurisdiction pursuant to.because rodrigues has alleged no specific facts that,if true,would entitle him to relief under the actual conflict standard articulated in cuyler sullivan,d,we affirm.
background 
rodrigues owned and operated saratoga savings and loan association saratoga from to.while under rodrigues control,saratoga entered into several loan agreements with richard cristina,murray hall,ronald tate,and david lazares to finance real estate ventures in san francisco,san jose,and marina,california.in return for securing favorable loan terms for these applicants,rodrigues received a personal stake in the underlying real estate ventures.
in november,the resolution trust corporation rtc seized saratoga and placed it under conservatorship.on may,the rtc was formally appointed as saratoga receiver.at that time,saratoga assets were liquidated and transferred to a new,federally chartered savings and loan.
although saratoga was no longer in his control after,rodrigues continued to own and operate california housing securities,cal housing,saratoga parent company.in april,cal housing received a million tax refund for the tax years ending in and.around this time,rodrigues filed suit against kpmg,an accounting firm,alleging that kpmg negligently performed tax and audit work for saratoga 
on march,a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging rodrigues with counts relating to his management of saratoga,his participation in various real estate ventures,and his personal use of the cal housing tax refund.nineteen counts were eventually tried to a jury,fourteen of which related to the real estate ventures,and five of which related to the cal housing tax refund.
b.the relationship between rodrigues,joseph russoniello,cooley godward,kpmg,and the rtc 
stephen neal was lead defense counsel for rodrigues.when rodrigues originally retained neal,neal was a partner in the law firm of kirkland ellis.on march,neal left kirkland ellis to join cooley godward.
joseph russoniello,the former attorney for the northern district of california,is a partner at the cooley firm.russoniello was involved in the early stages of the rodrigues investigation during his tenure as attorney.by the time rodrigues was charged,russoniello had left his position as attorney to join cooley.russoniello did not participate in the rodrigues case after joining cooley,and appears to have been screened off from the matter.both rodrigues and the prosecutor were aware that russoniello was one of neal partners at the cooley firm.
before neal joined cooley,the firm had represented the rtc in a significant litigation.there was a two week overlap in which cooley concurrently represented both rodrigues and the rtc,during which cooley billed hours of time to the rtc.by the time rodrigues trial began,cooley no longer represented the rtc cooley did not advise rodrigues about its previous work for the rtc.
on december,while representing rodrigues,cooley was engaged by kpmg to provide real estate planning advice to a kpmg individual client.cooley billed to kpmg in connection with the matter.on december,cooley was engaged to provide estate planning services to another kpmg client.cooley billed to kpmg in connection with the matter.cooley did not advise rodrigues about its relationship with kpmg.
c.the rodrigues trial and appeal 
the prosecution case against rodrigues centered on testimonial and documentary evidence about four real estate transactions involving rodrigues,ronald tate,david lazares,richard cristina,and murray hall.
the prosecution introduced evidence that,on january,rodrigues signed a letter on behalf of saratoga committing saratoga to participate in a joint venture with tate and lazares to purchase property located on lick avenue,in san jose,california the lick avenue property.rodrigues later substituted himself for saratoga and,in return for his role in the transaction,was given a personal interest in the lick avenue property.
later that same year,rodrigues,tate,and lazares entered into a second joint venture to purchase a property in marina,california the marina property.in november,saratoga funded the closing by providing to tate and lazares.saratoga took no fees,and received only a normal rate of return on the loan.rodrigues received a interest in the marina property in exchange for his role in the transaction.
in june,tate and lazares sought a million loan to purchase the continental can warehouse property in san jose,california the continental can property.rodrigues told tate and lazares that they could each draw on their personal lines of credit at saratoga.according to tate,rodrigues originally informed them that saratoga would charge a fee for making the funds available,but later agreed to take a interest in the continental can property in lieu of a fee.rodrigues personally took a interest in the property,and received of the profit when it was sold in.
in addition to the transactions involving tate and lazares,the prosecution also presented evidence that rodrigues entered into a joint venture in with richard cristina and murray hall to purchase the cinnabar building,a warehouse in san jose,california the cinnabar property.in connection with the transaction,rodrigues arranged for saratoga to provide cristina and hall with a personal line of credit with no fees.as in the other real estate transactions,rodrigues received a interest in the property.rodrigues did not record or disclose his personal interest in the lick avenue,marina,continental can,or cinnabar properties.
the prosecution also presented evidence that cal housing received a large tax refund in for the tax years ending in and.the prosecution evidence indicated that rodrigues used approximately million of the cal housing refund to pay off a loan on his personal residence,to open a personal checking account and a personal securities account,and to pay a bonus to the accountant who filed the tax returns 
rodrigues was convicted on all counts charged and sentenced to months in prison,a fine,and million in restitution.after nine of the nineteen counts were reversed on appeal,including all of the counts related to the and tax refunds the district court reduced rodrigues sentence to time served,a fine of,and restitution of million this court affirmed the remainder of the conviction,holding that there was no substantial dispute that rodrigues received a benefit,that saratoga lost a benefit,and that rodrigues failed to disclose his interest.united states rodrigues,cir.
on july,rodrigues brought a federal habeas corpus petition alleging due process violations and ineffective assistance of counsel.on october,the district court granted the motion in part and denied it in part.the court rejected rodrigues claim that he was denied effective assistance of counsel as a result of former attorney joseph russoniello status as a partner of the cooley firm,and as a result of cooley concurrent representation of kpmg,rtc,and rodrigues.after holding an evidentiary hearing on several other issues not presented in this appeal,the district court denied the petition in its entirety.this appeal followed.
standard of review 
we review the denial of a petition de novo.united states mcmullen,cir.ineffective assistance of counsel claims are also reviewed de novo.id.at.a district court decision to deny a motion for an evidentiary hearing is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.id.
a.the sullivan actual conflict standard 
in general,ineffective assistance of counsel claims are analyzed under the strickland test,which has two components first,the defendant must show that counsel performance was deficient second,the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.this requires showing that counsel errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial.strickland washington,d.in the conflict of interest context,however,a defendant is relieved of the burden to prove prejudice.instead,prejudice is presumed if a defendant demonstrates that his counsel labored under an actual conflict of interest.cuyler sullivan,d.an actual conflict is a conflict that affected counsel opposed to a mere theoretical division of loyalties.mickens taylor,d emphasis in original 
the precise contours of the term adverse effect have been only generally defined by the caselaw.the second circuit has expounded on the term in perhaps the greatest detail,holding that a defendant must demonstrate that some plausible alternative was inherently in conflict with or not undertaken due to the attorney other loyalties or interests.united states feyrer,cir quoting united states schwarz,cir.with respect to the substance of the plausible alternative strategy,the defendant need not show that the defense would necessarily have been successful had it been used,only that it possessed sufficient substance to be a viable alternative.id.
taking an approach consistent with that of the second circuit,the ninth circuit recently held that t he showing must be that counsel was influenced in his basic strategic decisions by loyalty to another client or former client.united states shwayder,cir.in shwayder,the conflict involved a defense attorney previous representation of a key witness for the prosecution.the defendant contended that the attorney professional relationship to the witness,his former client,restricted the attorney ability to vigorously attack the witness credibility.id.the shwayder panel rejected this argument,noting that the attorney was not ethically restricted from vigorously the former client,and that the attorney had actually impugned the witness credibility several times throughout the trial.id.at.under these circumstances,the attorney relationship with his former client could not be said to have had an adverse effect on the attorney ability to advocate on behalf of the defendant.id.at.
although sullivan involved a conflict between multiple clients represented by the same attorney,the term actual conflict is not a synonym for direct conflict.an attorney has a duty of loyalty not only to his own clients,but also to all of his firm clients,aba model rule,comment a firm of lawyers is essentially one lawyer for purposes of the rules governing loyalty to the client.the scope of this duty is equivalent to the duty of loyalty to an attorney own client and,when in conflict with the interests of another client,has the same potential to adversely affect the quality of representation.for this reason,we reject appellee invitation to draw a distinction between direct and imputed conflicts for purposes of the sullivan analysis.see reynolds chapman,cir assuming,without deciding,that an imputed conflict can be an actual conflict within the meaning of sullivan united states gallegos,cir same salam lockhart,cir same.whether an alleged conflict is direct or imputed,actual conflict is a term of art defined by reference not to the nature of the alleged conflict itself,but to the effect of the conflict on the attorney ability to advocate effectively.mickens,d an actual conflict,for sixth amendment purposes,is a conflict of interest that adversely affects counsel performance.
burden of proof 
a district court must grant a federal habeas petitioner motion for an evidentiary hearing unless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.although section imposes a fairly lenient burden on the petitioner,the petitioner is nonetheless required to allege specific facts which,if true,would entitle him to relief.united states mcmullen,cir.this standard requires the defendant to do more than simply allege a conflict or baldly assert that the asserted conflict had an adverse effect.see id.there would be no point in raising the issue,and hence no ineffective assistance of counsel,unless there were some proof to offer in his favor.
synthesizing the federal habeas standard with the relevant sixth amendment authorities,the following test emerges in order to be entitled to a hearing on a conflict of interest sixth amendment claim,a habeas petitioner has the burden of alleging specific facts which,if true,would indicate that an attorney relationship to a third party influenced the attorney not to pursue a particular litigation strategy,and the foregone litigation strategy would have been a viable alternative.
c.the alleged russoniello conflict 
rodrigues argues that russoniello affiliation with the cooley firm impaired neal ability to present an effective defense because the employment of russoniello by the law firm representing him actually imposed limitations on his counsel that precluded any contact or consultation with russoniello,limitations that would not have applied were he represented by other counsel.rodrigues claim has no merit.
russoniello represented the united states government during the early stages of the rodrigues investigation.as rodrigues observes,russoniello duty of confidentiality to the government therefore bars him from consulting with neal about the rodrigues case.see aba formal ethics opinion,august,citing model rule c opining that a former government attorney may not use information relating to her representation of the government to the disadvantage of her former government client where such information has not become generally known.russoniello duty of confidentiality to the government,however,bears no relationship to his affiliation with the cooley firm.the ethical rule barring russoniello from consulting with neal would have also barred russoniello from disclosing information not generally known about the rodrigues case to any other defense counsel.for this reason,the district court did not err by rejecting rodrigues claim that russoniello affiliation with the cooley firm hindered his defense 
d.the alleged rtc conflict 
rodrigues contends that cooley relationship with the rtc created an actual conflict of interest.specifically,rodrigues argues that,as a consequence of cooley relationship with the rtc,neal made no effort to investigate or present evidence of incompetence or negligence by the rtc,which would have been highly relevant to support rodrigues claim that he lacked fraudulent intent with respect to all of the transactions charged in the indictment.rodrigues bears the burden of alleging specific facts which,if true,would indicate that negligence on the part of the rtc could have been used as part of a plausible defense strategy,and cooley relationship with the rtc influenced neal to forgo investigating presenting the negligence defense.rodrigues has not met this burden.
neither the facts alleged in rodrigues petition nor our independent review of the record indicate that rtc played any role in the lick avenue,marina,continental can,or cinnabar transactions that formed the basis for the bulk of the charges against rodrigues.indeed,the rtc was not appointed receiver of saratoga until,several years after the four real estate transactions took place.
the rtc was named as a victim in count of the indictment,which charged that rodrigues personal use of the cal housing tax refund unlawfully impeded the rtc ability,as receiver of saratoga,to apply for a portion of the refund the rtc status as a named victim alone,however,does not establish an actual conflict of interest.see mickens,at.holding that a defense attorney client relationship with a victim is a potential,rather than actual,conflict for purposes of the sullivan inquiry.neither rodrigues petition nor any other portion of the record indicates that the rtc played any role in rodrigues decision to use more than one million dollars of the cal housing tax refund to pay off his personal debts and to supplement his personal checking and securities accounts.accordingly,rodrigues has not met his burden of alleging specific facts that,if true,would demonstrate that the rtc negligence could have been used as part of a viable defense strategy.
rodrigues also argues that cooley relationship with the rtc led neal to avoid tate and lazares about a settlement agreement they entered into with the rtc in.rodrigues suggests that
