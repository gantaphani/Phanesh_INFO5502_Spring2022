background 
while a fugitive from texas,gutierrez was located by authorities in burnsville,minnesota.the officers obtained warrants to search gutierrez home and to arrest him.police obtained the search warrant based upon a controlled buy of ounce of cocaine at the residence earlier that day.a confidential informant,who was identified at trial,made the controlled buy.she was followed by officers to and from gutierrez residence.other than gutierrez and his wife,valerie,no other adults lived in the home.
gutierrez home was searched pursuant to a search warrant on october,the officers seized from gutierrez person a false mexican driver license in the name of juan antonio leon garza that displayed gutierrez picture an oklahoma driver license in the name of georgio gutierrez that displayed gutierrez picture approximately in cash,of which had been paid to gutierrez by the informant during the controlled buy.
police collected numerous other items from the home.the officers found a fanny pack on gutierrez kitchen table.inside the fanny pack were various documents with the gutierrez name on them.there were also birth certificates of the gutierrez children.the officers also found two keys in the fanny pack.in addition,the officers seized a locked backpack.the keys in the gutierrez fanny pack were to the lock on the backpack.the police opened the backpack and found over grams of methamphetamine,approximately grams of cocaine,and some marijuana.

while gutierrez was being transported to jail,he asked the officer whether his wife was going to be arrested.the officer responded that the decision would be up to the deputies at the scene who were still investigating.gutierrez then stated that the drugs and guns were his,that he would take full responsibility for them,and that his wife had nothing to do with them.at no time in his statement did gutierrez indicate anyone else was responsible for the drugs.
during his booking,he again asked the deputy if his wife had been arrested and if his kids were safe.after learning that his wife had not been arrested,and that she was with the children,gutierrez stated again that his wife had no role in the criminal activity 
faretta hearing 
although counsel was appointed,gutierrez elected to represent himself.on january,gutierrez appeared before a magistrate judge for the sole purpose of having the court determine if gutierrez understood the ramifications of pursuant to faretta california,d.at that time,the magistrate specifically advised gutierrez that if convicted he would face years imprisonment.the magistrate further warned gutierrez that unlike an attorney,gutierrez lacked familiarity with the rules of evidence or procedure that if gutierrez proceeded to trial unrepresented,the court would not act as his advocate or provide him with advice and that it would be difficult to attempt to try the case without the appropriate education and experience.the magistrate specifically told gutierrez that in the court opinion gutierrez would be best served by having a trained lawyer represent him and that the decision to proceed without an attorney was terribly unwise.
prior to trial,the district court again advised gutierrez concerning his right to an attorney.among other things,the district court specifically advised gutierrez of his right to have counsel at trial,that standby counsel had a different role than defense counsel,that the court would not be gutierrez lawyer,and that gutierrez was charged with various serious offenses.gutierrez persisted in his decision to represent himself.dean grau,esquire,acted as standby counsel both at the trial and at the earlier suppression hearing.
at trial,gutierrez stated that his,larry forga,asked gutierrez wife to store the briefcase and backpack for forga,and that she put those items in the apartment.gutierrez stated that valerie agreed to help her father because forga was providing her with drugs for her personal use.gutierrez acknowledged that he possessed various identification cards,each bearing different names,but all bearing his photograph.gutierrez explained that his had given him these identification cards.he admitted that police found various receipts and other documents bearing his aliases in the briefcase.he explained that the briefcase was valerie,and that she kept his the seized him.
gutierrez denied knowledge of the drugs and the gun found in his home on october.when asked about the fanny pack,which contained the keys to the backpack,gutierrez again pointed to his wife as the true owner.gutierrez also claimed that the approximately found on his person was,in part,from a tamale business gutierrez ran with his wife.
the government rested its case early on the second day of trial.gutierrez then moved the court for acquittal.the court denied his motion.to open his defense,gutierrez told the court that he wished to call his wife as a witness.valerie gutierrez,through her counsel,explained to the court that if called to the witness stand,she would assert her fifth amendment privilege.the court then excused valerie gutierrez.gutierrez then told the court that he wanted to get rid of his standby counsel.gutierrez request was based on the fact that grau had referred valerie to the federal public defender office to obtain representation.grau explained the situation to the court 
grau your honor,yesterday following the sequestration order i mentioned,of course,to the witness that i could really discuss what was going on here in the courtroom.she indicated to me something about what she wanted to testify to.in the process of her revealing it to me i stopped her,told her that she really should talk to me about it,that she needed to consult her own counsel.she told me that she could afford counsel.i asked dan scott federal public defender for the district of minnesota what we might do about it and dan scott appointed counsel.and i believe that gutierrez is unhappy with me.i tried to explain to him that the code of professional responsibility requires me to do what i did when i dealing with an unrepresented person,and gutierrez position is that what i did resulting in what just happened has i think gutted his defense and he indicates that he does wish to have my services even as standby counsel anymore.
the court then advised gutierrez that as an attorney grau has an obligation not to talk to any party that unrepresented where it could implicate that party right against.the court advised gutierrez that it did not see how grau violated his role as standby counsel,but that the court would be willing to release grau as standby counsel if gutierrez so wished.the court gave gutierrez some time to think it over,and after a recess,gutierrez decided that he wanted grau to remain.
the court found that gutierrez had a fifth amendment right that she lawfully asserted based upon the advice of her counsel thus,she could not be called as a witness.gutierrez made an offer of proof stating wife would have testified if called as a witness.gutierrez asserted,in essence,that valerie gutierrez would have inculpated h
