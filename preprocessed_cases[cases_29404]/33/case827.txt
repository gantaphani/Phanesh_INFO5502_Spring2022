leslie goldstein,represented by the law firm of posner rosen llp and lawyers howard rosen and lawrence posner sued,for fraudulent inducement to enter into an employment contract and other claims arising out of her employment as a sales representative.at her deposition,goldstein admitted certain representations by,although alleged in her complaint to be false,were in fact true at the time they were made.thereafter obtained summary adjudication on the fraud claim,and goldstein unilaterally dismissed the rest of her complaint with prejudice.
then filed a malicious prosecution against goldstein and the lawyers,alleging they brought the fraud claim without probable cause and with malice.the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants,finding that no triable issues of fact existed and the defendants had established probable cause for filing the fraud claim as a matter of law.
we affirm the judgment in favor of the lawyers because the undisputed facts establish they based the fraud claim on information provided by goldstein,they were entitled to rely on the information provided,and probable cause supported a claim for fraud based on that information.however,we reverse the judgment in favor of goldstein because triable issues of fact exist as to whether she acted with probable cause and without malice or in good faith on the advice of counsel.
factual and procedural background 
goldstein was employed as a salesperson by back to back kidsware,back to back a clothing manufacturer,from to october.she developed a business relationship with target stores and,during her last year of employment at back to back,was responsible for million in merchandise orders from target.in october,another apparel manufacturer,approached goldstein about coming to work for and bringing her target business with her.goldstein had discussions with officers lowell sharron,mitchell quaranta and bruce stern,who made the following representations to her 
is a great company 
people are here for a really long time 
we take care of the people that work for us 
we really want to do business with target 
you have the relationships with target.
during her preemployment discussions with,goldstein stated she expected to bring in to million in target business and asked whether was big enough to handle the production demands of target.responded that we are a million company and we can handle target production demands.based on assurances,goldstein agreed to go to work for and bring her target business with her.
according to goldstein,soon proved unable to meet target scheduling and quality control requirements.in january goldstein and sharron,sales manager,met with target representatives at target headquarters in minneapolis,where they were informed that target would no longer purchase goldstein line of clothing from.the reason given by target is disputed goldstein testified target said it had lost confidence in ability to handle target production requirements.sharron,however,testified that target never stated it had lost confidence in,but instead explained its buyers were under pressure to buy from divisions of its parent company rather than from outside vendors.target did not place any orders with goldstein after january,although it did continue to place orders for other clothing lines.in april terminated goldstein employment.she did not thereafter obtain a sales position with another apparel manufacturer.
goldstein retained the law firm of posner rosen,based on her understanding they were employment law specialists.at her first meeting with howard rosen,she told him about the statements made by at the time she was hired.she also told rosen that was not able to handle the target production,that target had stopped purchasing from because it had lost confidence in ability to meet target production requirements,that had failed to meet scheduled target delivery dates and that there were quality problems with the garments manufactured by.she also advised him that her reputation and credibility in the industry had been damaged as a result of problems with target.at rosen request,goldstein wrote down the statements that had induced her to go to work for the company and sent the information to rosen in a memorandum.the memorandum also stated that goldstein went to work for because i t was important for me to take my target business which i had built for the last years to a company that was big enough to handle the production demands of target.
rosen told goldstein he believed she had a viable claim for fraud in the inducement of an employment contract.the lawyers sent a demand letter to bruce stern at in which they set out the factual and legal basis for goldstein claims and demanded payment of,consisting of in commissions and the balance as damages for fraudulent inducement.
counsel responded to rosen letter with a cursory reply stating,in part,you are substantially misinformed regarding the facts.for example,you quote language which is not even contained in the written contract between the parties.in any event,based on the parties contract and without waiting to receive and determine the returns,markdowns and allowances which serve to reduce goldstein compensation,and without pursuing goldstein for her misrepresentations and breaches,there would be due.enclosed is a check in that amount.it is tendered in full satisfaction of any and all claims by goldstein.
the lawyers filed suit on goldstein behalf on july.the original complaint alleged claims for fraud in the inducement of employment,breach of contract for failure to pay commissions due refusal to pay wages,conversion,breach of fiduciary duty and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing the fraudulent inducement claim was based on the representations made by sharron,quaranta and stern during their preemployment discussions with goldstein.
counsel took goldstein deposition on september.at her deposition,goldstein made several significant admissions including the following 
was in fact a million company when it hired her,and she had no reason to believe otherwise.
she knew people stayed at for a long time.
she did have a relationship with target and she could bring target business to.
she told she expected to bring in to million in business from target.
representatives were telling the truth when they told her they could handle to million in business because their sales volume was over million.
at the time of her deposition,she did not have any reason to believe that personnel were not sincere when they said they could handle the target business.
despite these admissions,goldstein testified that she never told her lawyers that anything alleged in the complaint was untrue.
demurred to the original complaint on october.goldstein responded by filing an amended complaint,which eliminated the claims for conversion and breach of fiduciary duty.demurred to the fraud claim in the first amended complaint,apparently on the ground the statements alleged were nonactionable statements of opinion the demurrer was overruled,evidently because the trial court found the representation that was a million company to be a statement of fact.
in may moved for summary adjudication of goldstein fraud claim based on the admissions in her deposition.goldstein did not dispute any of the facts proffered in support of the motion for summary adjudication,nor did she present any evidence in opposition to the motion.the trial court granted the motion,finding the only actionable statement of fact alleged in the complaint was the representation that was a million company.because goldstein admitted that statement was true when made,there were no triable issues of fact as to the claim for fraudulent inducement.goldstein unilaterally dismissed her remaining claims with prejudice on august.
sued goldstein and the lawyers for malicious prosecution on september.after answering the complaint,goldstein and the lawyers filed a motion to strike the complaint pursuant to code of civil procedure section the motion.the trial court denied the motion on december,finding that had established a prima facie case for malicious prosecution against all defendants.
in june goldstein and the lawyers filed motions for summary judgment.in their motion,which goldstein joined,the lawyers argued the undisputed facts established the employment action was filed with probable cause and without malice.goldstein filed a separate motion for summary judgment in which she argued she could not be liable for malicious prosecution because she had acted on the advice of counsel.
the summary judgment motions were heard by a different judge from the one who had heard the motion.the court granted both motions,finding no triable issues of material fact existed and holding the undisputed facts established goldstein and the lawyers had probable cause to bring the fraud claim this appeal followed.
discussion 
standard of review.
the standard of review on appeal after an order granting summary judgment is well settled.a trial court properly grants summary judgment where no triable issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.we review the trial court decision de novo,considering all of the evidence the parties offered in connection with the motion except that which the court properly excluded and the uncontradicted inferences the evidence reasonably supports.artiglio corning cal th,d.in the trial court,once a moving defendant has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action,even if not separately pleaded,can not be established,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show the existence of a triable issue to meet that burden,the plaintiff may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings but,instead,shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action code civ,subd.o see aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.merrill navegar,cal th,d.
in reviewing the evidence,we strictly construe the moving party evidence and liberally construe the opposing party and accept as undisputed only those portions of the moving party evidence that are uncontradicted.only when the inferences are indisputable may the court decide the issues as a matter of law.if the evidence is in conflict,the factual issues must be resolved by trial.any doubts about the propriety of summary judgment are generally resolved against granting the motion,because that allows the future development of the case and avoids errors.citation.binder aetna life ins.th,d see also katz chevron th,d doubts as to the propriety of granting the motion should be resolved in favor of the opposing party.
because the parties did not obtain rulings on their evidentiary objections,we consider all the evidence proffered by both parties.
the parties filed written objections to portions of the evidence proffered in connection with the motion for summary judgment.in its tentative ruling on the motion,the trial court stated in relation to the objections to declaratory evidence put forward by both sides,it is not necessary to rule on them.instead,the court has considered only relevant and competent evidence in the face of the objections,and evidence which plaintiffs have not disputed.biljac associates first interstate bank d.
the trial court response to the parties objections,although sanctioned by division two of the court of appeal,first appellate district in biljac associates first interstate bank,supra,d,is in our view an unacceptable circumvention of the court obligation to rule on the evidentiary objections presented.city of long beach farmers merchants bank th,d trial courts have a duty to rule on evidentiary objections.part of the judicial function in assessing the merits of a summary judgment or adjudication motion involves a determination as to what evidence is admissible and that which is not.see sambrano city of san diego th,d rejecting biljac rule and observing while biljac is generally correct that it is presumed on appeal that a judge has not relied on irrelevant or incompetent evidence,biljac seems to allow the trial judge to arrogate to herself the right to the benefit of this presumption,as a device.surely this is not the meaning of this rule of appellate practice.citation.
when,as here,the trial judge fails to rule on objections to evidence presented at a summary judgment motion,the objections are deemed waived on appeal.sharon arman cal th,fn,d,disapproved on other grounds by aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,fn,d,ann pacific plaza shopping center cal th,fn,d.accordingly,in reviewing the trial court ruling,we consider all the evidence presented by the parties 
there are no triable issues of material fact with respect to the lawyers the trial court properly granted summary judgment in their favor.
based on the information goldstein provided to the lawyers,the fraud claim was supported by probable cause.
to establish a claim for malicious prosecution,a plaintiff must demonstrate the prior action was begun at the direction of the defendant,pursued to a legal termination in plaintiff favor,brought without probable cause and initiated with malice.sheldon appel albert oliker cal d,sheldon appel.the standard for determining the probable cause element is objective,not subjective.the trial court is called upon to make an objective determination of the reasonableness of the defendant conduct,to determine whether,on the basis of the facts known to the defendant,the institution of the prior action was legally tenable.id.at.whether a claim is legally tenable is tested by whether any reasonable attorney would have thought the claim tenable id.at.
whether the defendant had probable cause for instituting the prior action has traditionally been viewed as a question to be determined by the court.sheldon appel,supra,cal d at.determination of the presence or absence of probable cause depends on the facts which the defendant knew when he instituted the prior action.id.at.if the facts upon which the defendant acted are in dispute,those facts must be determined by the jury before the court can make its legal determination.id.at,what facts and circumstances amount to probable cause is a pure question of law.whether they exist or not in any particular case is a pure question of fact.the former is exclusively for the court,the latter for the jury.citations.sangster paetkau th,d evidentiary disputes and factual questions may require resolution before the trial court applies the objective standard to the issue of probable cause.
the trial court found the undisputed facts establish that the lawyers had probable cause to assert the fraudulent inducement claim.we agree.it is undisputed that the allegations in the complaint accurately reflected the facts as given to the lawyers by goldstein and that she never told them those facts were incorrect.the information provided to the lawyers,if true,was sufficient to state a cause of action for fraudulent inducement of employment 
i.the legal tenability of the fraudulent inducement claim was established by the trial court order overruling the demurrer to the first amended complaint.
contends the lawyers lacked probable cause to bring the fraud claim because they knew the false representations alleged in the complaint were only statements of opinion or a prediction of future events and could not state a claim for fraud.however,in overruling demurrer to the first amended complaint,the trial court concluded that a cause of action for fraud was stated based on the allegedly false statement that was a million company.it is undisputed that the allegations that made this statement to goldstein and that the statement was false were accurate to the best of the lawyers knowledge.
as to the other statements,we can not say that no reasonable lawyer would have thought they were arguably actionable statements of fact,rather than opinion,and thus sufficient to state a claim for fraud.see hufstedler,kaus ettinger superior court th,d distinction between a statement of fact and one of opinion is frequently difficult and context of statements is important therefore attorney did not lack probable cause to allege statements in defamation action were of fact,not opinion.we also can not say that the lawyers were not entitled to rely on target later termination of its relationship based on production problems according to what goldstein told the lawyers as an indication that statement that it could handle target production was not true when made.although target termination of the relationship,months after the statements,might not alone support an inference that the statements were false when made,it does reasonably suggest that such evidence might come to light during discovery.
because the allegations in the complaint were true to the best of the lawyers knowledge at the time the complaint was filed,and because the trial court overruled demurrer to the fraud claim,the lawyers necessarily had probable cause to bring the claim for fraud.see roberts sentry life insurance th,d denial of defendant summary judgment in an earlier case normally establishes there was probable cause to sue,thus barring a later malicious prosecution suit.
also argues the lawyers lacked probable cause because they knew goldstein could not prove damages based on her deposition testimony that her former employer,back to back,went out of business after she left its employ and did not pay her certain commissions to which she was entitled.however,this testimony was given after the complaint was filed and,therefore,does not indicate that the lawyers knew damages could not be proved when the complaint was filed.moreover,a reasonable inference is that back to back went out of business because goldstein left and took her target business with her.also argues that goldstein could never prove damages because she testified she did not turn down any other job offers to go to work for.again,this testimony the filing of the complaint.moreover,goldstein testified that she was talking to two other companies during her job search but broke off those talks when she accepted offer of employment.a trier of fact could reasonably conclude that if goldstein had not gone to work for,she would have continued discussions with the other companies and ultimately gone to work for one of them.
ii.the lawyers had no notice of specific factual mistakes in goldstein fraud claim.
argues that,even if the facts alleged in the complaint stated a cause of action for fraudulent inducement,other facts known to the lawyers at the time of filing negated probable cause.relying on our decision in arcaro silva silva enterprises th,d arcaro,contends that,because it sent a letter to the lawyers denying goldstein claim,the lawyers were on notice the claim was not tenable and should have investigated further before filing suit.
in arcaro,supra,th,d,we found a collection agency lacked probable cause to file an action on a guarantee purportedly executed by arcaro.when contacted by the collection agency,arcaro told the agency that the signature on the guarantee was a forgery and provided handwriting samples and the name of the suspected forger.the collection agency instructed its attorneys to file suit anyway.id.at,d.arcaro prevailed in the underlying suit and successfully sued the collection agency for malicious prosecution.id.at,d.
the outcome in arcaro,supra,th,d,hinged on the fact the plaintiff in the underlying action was given specific information as to verifiable facts that,if true,would totally negate its cause of action.normally,the adequacy of a prefiling investigation is not relevant to the determination of probable cause.see sheldon appel,supra,cal d at,adequacy of investigation and research is relevant to the issue of malice,but not to the issue of probable cause.in the unusual circumstances of arcaro,however,we found the party had a duty to investigate further before filing suit.notably,the collection agency attorneys were not named as defendants in the malicious prosecution action and arcaro contains no hint that the attorneys lacked probable cause to file suit based on the facts known to them.to the contrary,arcaro suggests the attorneys were entitled to rely on the genuineness of arcaro signature on the guarantee and had no duty to investigate before filing suit.arcaro,at,d i n most cases hammer would have been entitled to assume the signature on the credit application was genuine.but,when a party is put on notice a fundamental element of its case is disputed,it should not proceed without evidence sufficient to support a favorable judgment on that element or at least information affording an inference such evidence can be obtained.in the present case,hammer lacked probable cause to sue arcaro on the guarantee because it had no objective,reasonable basis in the facts known to it for a belief arcaro purported signature was genuine.
only prefiling communication with the lawyers was a terse letter stating y ou are substantially misinformed regarding the facts.such letters are commonly exchanged between counsel in almost every civil before either counsel has had an opportunity to fully investigate the facts.we decline to hold that boilerplate denial of the facts contained in rosen demand letter can be said to have put the lawyers on notice of any specific fatal flaw in goldstein claim,and thereby negate probable cause for filing the fraud action 
under california law,a lawyer has no liability for continuing an action where probable cause existed at time of filing.
contends a party can be held liable for malicious prosecution even if he or she first becomes aware of facts that negate the claim after the litigation is commenced and argues the lawyers should be held liable for filing a first amended complaint and thereafter continuing to pursue goldstein fraud claim after she admitted at her deposition the truth of the allegedly false statements upon which her claim was based.contention is at odds with the very definition of the tort of malicious prosecution.to establish a cause of action for the malicious prosecution of a civil proceeding,a plaintiff must plead and prove that the prior action was commenced by or at the direction of the defendant and was pursued to a legal termination in his,plaintiff,favor citations was brought without probable cause citations and was initiated with malice citations.bertero national general cal d,bertero,italics added.
we recently held in vanzant daimlerchrysler corporation th,d,notwithstanding the restatement second of torts position to the contrary see rest d torts,one who takes an active part in the initiation,continuation or procurement of civil proceedings against another is subject to liability to the other for wrongful civil proceedings,that california courts have typically refused to permit malicious prosecution claims where,as here,the claim is based on the continuation of a properly initiated existing proceeding.citations.vanzant,at,d.the longstanding rule in california is that,if probable cause exists at the outset of the action,the party acting with probable cause is insulated from liability for malicious prosecution.see hufstedler,kaus ettinger superior court,supra,th at,d sheldon appel,supra,cal d at,articulated a standard for determining whether the underlying action was objectively tenable when filed italics added.
in arguing for a contrary rule,mistakenly relies on an incomplete quotation from a footnote in pacific gas electric bear stearns cal d,in which the supreme court observed that a person who is injured by groundless litigation may seek compensation from any person who procures or is actively instrumental in putting the litigation in motion or participates after the institution of the action.id.at,fn.citing sheldon appel and bertero,the bear stearns court summarized california law,stating,the bringing of a colorable claim is not actionable plaintiff in a malicious prosecution action must prove that the prior action was brought without probable cause and was pursued to a legal termination in plaintiff favor.id.at.the court then noted,in the sentence omitted by,t he instigator,as well as the party,may be liable.id.at,fn.the first case cited in the footnote,jacques interiors petrak d,stands for that specific not the plaintiff in the underlying action but who without probable cause and with malice caused the underlying groundless litigation to be initiated may be liable for malicious prosecution.lujan gordon d,the other case cited in the bear stearns footnote,holds that one who without probable cause and with malice aids and abets a malicious prosecution after someone else has commenced it may be held liable.id.at.in each case,the underlying action was initiated without probable cause,and the defendant lacked probable cause to support it.in this case,in contrast,based on the information available to them,the lawyers had probable cause at the time they initiated the underlying action 
the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of goldstein.
triable issues of fact exist as to whether goldstein is entitled to rely on the defense to malicious prosecution.
goldstein argues she was entitled to rely on the advice of her counsel in bringing the underlying action,and therefore summary judgment was proper as to the malicious prosecution claim against her.however,a party may only rely on advice of counsel if that party has fully and truthfully disclosed the relevant facts to counsel and has acted in good faith.bertero,supra,cal d at,it is a defense to a malicious prosecution action to show the action was filed pursuant to the advice of counsel after the full disclosure of all relevant facts and that a person acting on the advice of counsel has proceeded with probable cause and in good faith,but if the initiator acts in bad faith or withholds from counsel facts he knew or should have known would defeat a cause of action otherwise appearing from the information supplied,that defense fails.this has been the law for more than years.levy brannan cal,advice of counsel could be no defense,when the prosecutor knows that the statements made by him,upon which the malicious prosecution is based,are untrue.franzen shenk cal,if the advice of counsel,was in part based upon a false statement of fact by the defendant,then the advice so given,and followed by the action taken by him pursuant to that advice,does not constitute a defense to malicious prosecution action.
goldstein admitted at her deposition that the allegedly false statements made to induce her to accept employment as a sales representative were,in fact,true.there is no indication that goldstein told this to her lawyers before they filed suit.to the contrary,the undisputed facts establish that goldstein did not tell the lawyers before they instituted suit on her behalf that the allegations upon which they based the complaint were inaccurate.accordingly,the record before the trial court supports the conclusion that goldstein believed the allegedly false statements to be true but did not disclose that belief to her counsel.at the very least,there is a triable issue of fact on this point and summary judgment in favor of goldstein can not be affirmed based on her defense.
there is also a triable issue as to whether goldstein fully and truthfully disclosed target reason for discontinuing its orders from.goldstein told her lawyers that,at a meeting at target headquarters,target personnel told her target would not place any more orders with because it lacked confidence in production capability.however,in his declaration sharron,a former executive who was also present at the meeting,testified that target said it would not be placing new orders with because of corporate pressure to purchase merchandise from its parent company rather than from outside vendors such as.sharron declaration creates a triable issue of fact as to what actually happened at the meeting and,therefore,as to whether the version goldstein gave her lawyers was true.
even if goldstein can not prevail on summary judgment based on her defense,she was entitled to the order granting her motion for summary judgment if she established that,based on the undisputed facts,the original complaint was legally tenable on the facts known to her at the time it was filed.leonardini shell oil d,fn.leonardini we believe the legal tenability standard is the appropriate measure of probable cause to apply to the plaintiff in the former action who does not rely upon advice of counsel as a defense.we conclude triable issues of fact exist on this point,as well.
b.the trial court improperly weighed the evidence in determining no triable issues of fact exist as to whether goldstein knew allegedly false statements were true when made.
in concluding goldstein had probable cause to initiate her lawsuit against,the trial court found that had mischaracterized goldstein deposition testimony as stating she did not believe agents had misrepresented their ability to handle target anticipated production demands.the context of this testimony,however,reveals that goldstein meant she had no reason to believe that plaintiff agents were lying to her at the time the representations were made.the only serious issue is whether defendants had reason to believe at the time the lawsuit was filed that plaintiff knew of the falsity of its statement concerning its ability to handle target production demands at the time it was made.the court found goldstein reliance upon the hindsight of actual falsity as supporting this conclusion as minimal but sufficient to shift the burden to plaintiff,which does not adequately rebut this position by presenting a material issue of fact.
in its opposition to defendants summary judgment motion,cited to portions of goldstein deposition testimony that are reasonably susceptible to the interpretation offered by goldstein admitted that had a reasonable basis for its opinion that it could handle the product which she promised to book with target.in addition,defendants evidence of actual falsity based on is,the assertion that target terminated its relationship with because of concerns about directly disputed by the declaration of lowell sharron submitted with opposition papers.
in concluding that goldstein had established probable cause as a matter of law,the trial court either misunderstood this testimony or improperly weighed the evidence and failed to adhere to the rule that the evidence of the moving party goldstein should be strictly construed,while that of the opposing party should be liberally construed,with all doubts being resolved in favor of the opposing party.salazar southern cal.gas th,d katz chevron,supra,th at,d.in either event,it was error for the trial court to rely on its interpretation of this evidence in granting summary judgment in favor of goldstein.code civ,subd.c summary judgment shall not be granted by the court based on inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence,if contradicted by other inferences or evidence,which raise a triable issue as to any material fact.if goldstein believed to be true all the statements she alleged as falsehoods in her complaint,then her fraud claim was not supported by probable cause.that is a triable issue of fact that precludes summary judgment in her favor 
c.there are triable issues of fact with respect to whether goldstein acted with malice.
the existence of malice is a question of fact to be determined by the jury.sheldon appel,supra,cal d at,the malice element of the malicious prosecution tort relates to the subjective intent or purpose with which the defendant acted in initiating the prior action,and is a question of fact to be determined by the jury.the malice required in an action for malicious prosecution is not limited to actual hostility or ill will toward plaintiff but exists when the proceedings are instituted primarily for an improper purpose.citations.albertson raboff cal d.
before sheldon appel california case law consistently held that the element of malice could be inferred from the absence of probable cause.we agree with the conclusion and analysis of division three of our court in downey venture lmi ins.th,d that such an inference is no longer justified absent some additional information that supports a finding of malice prior to sheldon appel,such a rule had a logical basis since,as the supreme court had previously said,probable cause requires a reasonable belief in the validity of the claim asserted.citation.the absence of a reasonable belief in the claim,a factor relating to the defendant subjective state of mind,would logically p
