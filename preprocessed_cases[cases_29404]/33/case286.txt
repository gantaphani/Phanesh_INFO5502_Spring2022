the district court disqualified roosevelt turner retained counsel from representing him in this case because the attorney was also representing an alleged coconspirator in sentencing proceedings.the question for us is whether this violated turner sixth amendment right to counsel of his choice.
in february the government indicted turner and eight others for conspiring to distribute cocaine in alton,illinois.but turner was not arrested until june,and by that time many of the alleged coconspirators had pleaded guilty and cooperated with the government.one exception was anthony womack.his first trial ended in a hung jury.on retrial womack was convicted,and he was awaiting sentencing when the authorities finally caught up with turner.in the meantime,womack hired a new represent him at sentencing.once in custody,turner was initially represented by appointed counsel,but his family soon hired baris as his attorney.the government questioned whether this joint representation was permissible and asked the court for a hearing on the matter.
the government suggested that baris representation of both defendants presented an insurmountable conflict of interest because one might decide to cooperate with the government against the other.baris countered that there was no actual any serious potential for neither client wanted to assist the government and prosecutors had not shown the slightest interest in securing either defendant testimony against the other.moreover,both defendants waived any conflict of interest.the district judge focused on the possibility that one defendant might provide information or testimony against the other and held that this was sufficient to create an absolute conflict of interest.on this basis the judge disqualified baris as turner counsel.a jury convicted turner of conspiracy,and he appealed,challenging the judge disqualification of his chosen counsel.
we reverse.the sixth amendment gives a defendant who does not require appointed counsel the right to choose who will represent him.see wheat united states,d.the supreme court recognizes a presumption in favor of the defendant choice,although this presumption may be overridden if there is an actual conflict of interest or a serious potential for conflict.id.at.where there is an actual or serious potential conflict,two aspects of the sixth amendment right to counsel are in tension the accused right to counsel of his choice and his right to the effective assistance of counsel.id.at.joint representation is not,however,a per se violation of the right to the effective assistance of counsel.id.at.
here,the district court disqualified baris based on the possibility that womack might cooperate against turner or vice versa.but this possibility for conflict is present in nearly every case of joint representation.the district court analysis disregarded the presumption in favor of the defendant chosen counsel and imposed what amounts to a per se rule against joint representation.as such,the court disqualification order was premised on a mistake of law and violated turner right to counsel of his choice.because this violation is structural,united states,d,turner is entitled to a new trial.
background 
in february a grand jury indicted turner,womack,and seven others on charges of conspiring to distribute cocaine in violation of a,b a ii,and.a superseding indictment filed in october added three more defendants as coconspirators.the government alleged that from january to january,turner and the others conspired to distribute large quantities of cocaine in and around alton,illinois.most of the alleged conspirators were quickly rounded up.turner,however,remained at large until june.
nearly all of the coconspirators pleaded guilty and cooperated with the government,but womack elected to go to trial.the government first attempt to convict womack ended in a mistrial because the jury could not reach a verdict.on retrial in april,the jury found womack guilty.the case against him relied largely on the kind of evidence customarily introduced in trials tapes of telephone intercepts capturing conversations among those associated with the charged conspiracy and the testimony of several of the cooperating coconspirators.
during both of his trials,womack was represented by attorney john abell.after his conviction,however,womack hired attorney irl baris to represent him for sentencing and appellate purposes.baris is an experienced attorney in practice since and an adjunct professor of criminal trial practice and procedure at washington university school of law for the last years.he has tried a variety of federal cases involving crimes,drug conspiracies,and racketeering offenses,and has argued numerous appeals in five or six federal circuits.he entered his appearance on behalf of womack on june.
as womack awaited sentencing,police finally arrested turner on june.attorneys represented turner for the next six weeks.turner family then hired baris to represent him,and on august,baris entered his appearance as turner counsel.the government immediately asked the district court to conduct a hearing under rule c of the federal rules of criminal procedure to evaluate the effect of any potential conflict of interest on each defendant right to the effective assistance of counsel.see.c outlining the court duty of inquiry in a case of joint representation.the government motion intimated that womack might be called to testify at turner trial or might pursue sentencing or appellate strategies adverse to turner interests,or alternatively,turner might be asked to provide information or testimony to assist the government at womack sentencing.
at the rule c hearing,the government argued as a general matter that the defendants interests might become adverse in the event that either opted to cooperate with the government.but the prosecutor was not more specific.he did not say,for example,that the government intended or was likely to seek womack cooperation and testimony against turner or vice versa.the prosecutor did say that a s a side note,an attorney in my office has requested permission to talk to whoever womack attorney is to see if womack is interested in cooperating with the government with regard to a somewhat unrelated matter,certainly with regard to his narcotics distribution.the judge sought clarification y ou said your line assistant has asked for permission to approach womack with the possibility of giving testimony against turner the prosecutor responded in the negative 
that is not accurate,your honor.that would not be accurate.the line attorney who has asked me about womack is seeking information with regard to individuals who purchased cocaine directly from womack,not necessarily information with regard to turner.of course,the issue becomes one of,once an individual begins to cooperate,there ca be limitations on that.
the government did not explicitly ask the court to disqualify baris.the gist of its argument,however,was that baris joint representation of turner and womack created an impermissible conflict of interest requiring his disqualification from turner case.
baris argued that turner was entitled under the sixth amendment to retain counsel of his choice.he explained that each client family had separately retained him and that both turner and womack had consented after consultation to the joint representation.he also said neither turner nor womack had any interest in assisting the government and noted that the government had not expressed any interest in seeking either defendant cooperation against the other.baris said both defendants were prepared to waive any conflict of interest.baris invited the court to make a personal inquiry of the defendants to confirm their consent to the joint representation.
the judge did not respond to this invitation.instead,the judge expressed his general concern that baris could not effectively advise one of his clients about the advantages of cooperating with the government without hurting the interests of his other client.the judge had presided over womack trial and knew that the evidence there had suggested that turner was womack sole cocaine supplier.b ecause there was testimony in the womack trial relative to turner,the judge said,womack is a person with potential relevant knowledge who could be subpoenaed to testify in the turner case.and how do you go about your own client with any sort of vigor that properly represents your other client baris reminded the court that the government could not compel womack to testify.the judge countered and so then what does the record show,that the attorney for turner advised the witness to take the fifth amendment baris responded no.the attorney for womack may advise him to take the fifth amendment.
on the flip side of the conflict question,the judge said that turner might need advice from baris if the government sought his cooperation in womack sentencing,and baris is not going to be in a position to do that faithfully,fully,exercising his full professional responsibilities to his client because,of course,if he were representing womack,he would want turner to testify against womack in a sentencing.baris suggested that the court concerns were based entirely on speculation.the attorney noted that under the supreme court decisions in wheat and,it was the government burden to establish an actual conflict of interest or at least a serious potential for conflict,and noted again that the prosecutor had not specifically said he intended to seek either defendant cooperation against the other.the judge responded how much more specific does it have to get other than there will be an approach for a proffer,and he is clearly not absolutely going to be a witness,he clearly a person with extraordinarily relevant knowledge that likely will be a witness.
perhaps sensing which way the wind was blowing,baris suggested that the court accept turner conflict waiver now and revisit the matter later if the prosecution decided to approach either defendant about cooperating.l et suppose that they do approach one of the defendants,baris said.at that time the issues can be crystalized and perhaps the facts can be revealed as to what the conflict is.here,we do know.the judge rejected this alternative,concluding instead that the conflicts are absolute and specific,they clear,they are not speculative,and t here no way that any waiver can overcome these conflicts.the court entered an order disqualifying baris from representing turner.
the government never sought either defendant assistance against the other.womack was sentenced to months imprisonment.with new counsel,turner proceeded to a jury trial.he was convicted of conspiracy to distribute in excess of kilograms of cocaine and sentenced to months imprisonment.he appealed,challenging the district court disqualification of baris as a violation of his sixth amendment right to retain counsel of his choice.
ii.discussion 
the sixth amendment provides that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to have the assistance of counsel for his defence.const.amend.vi.two aspects of this sixth amendment right are pertinent here the right of an accused who does not require appointed counsel to choose the attorney who will represent him,see,at.wheat,at,and the right to effective assistance of counsel,see strickland washington,d.
each of these rights protects something former secures the right to a particular lawyer regardless of comparative effectiveness,and the latter prescribes a baseline requirement of competence on whatever lawyer is chosen or appointed,at.the rights are different in another respect the sixth amendment protection against ineffective representation derive s from the amendment purpose of ensuring a fair trial,id.at.t he right to select counsel of one choice,by contrast,has been regarded as the root meaning of the constitutional guarantee,id.at.stated differently,the sixth amendment right to counsel of choice commands not that a trial be fair,but that a particular guarantee of fairness be wit,that the accused be defended by the counsel he believes to be best.id.at.
these two elements of the sixth amendment right to counsel will occasionally be in tension with each,when a defendant hires an attorney who has a conflict of interest.when this occurs,the defendant right to counsel of his choice may have to give way.a court confronted with a case of joint representation must take adequate steps to ascertain whether the conflicts warrant separate counsel.wheat,at.joint representation may present a conflict so concrete and serious that it intolerably undermines the right to effective assistance of counsel and justifies overriding the defendant choice of counsel.id.at.
not all cases of joint representation,however,give rise to a conflict of interest warranting disqualification of counsel the supreme court has held that joint representation is not a per se violation of the right to effective counsel.id.at.instead,joint representation requires careful judicial scrutiny for the presence and effect of conflicts the court ha s an independent duty to ensure that criminal defendants receive a trial that is fair and does not contravene the sixth amendment.id.at.see also united states combs,cir a court has an independent duty to balance the right to counsel of choice with the broader interests of judicial integrity.
where,as here,defendants charged jointly are represented by the same counsel,rule c of the federal rules of criminal procedure instructs the court to conduct a prompt inquiry into the likelihood and effect of any conflict of interest 
court responsibilities in cases of joint representation.the court must promptly inquire about the propriety of joint representation and must personally advise each defendant of the right to the effective assistance of counsel,including separate representation.unless there is good cause to believe that no conflict of interest is likely to arise,the court must take appropriate measures to protect each defendant right to counsel.
in cases,the district court has substantial latitude to refuse a defendant conflict waiver.wheat,at.the court decision,therefore,is reviewed for abuse of discretion we recognize,moreover,that the decision must be made ex ante if disqualification was proper on the basis of all information known or knowable at the time the judge acted,then later developments would not spoil the decision.rodriguez chandler,cir.
although the disqualification decision is left primarily to the informed judgment of the trial court,wheat,at,the force of the core constitutional command requires that the court start from a default position that gives effect to the defendant sixth amendment right to choose his own counsel.the supreme court has therefore recognized a presumption in favor of the defendant choice of counsel,and this presumption can be overcome only by an actual or serious potential for conflict.id.under wheat,the risk of rests with the prosecution rather than the defendant.rodriguez,at.the court role is to determine whether the attorney has an actual conflict,a potential conflict,or no conflict at all,united states perez,cir,and to evaluate any conflict for its effect on the defendant right to effective assistance of counsel.in addition,before accepting a waiver of counsel,rule c requires the court to advise each defendant of his right to effective assistance of counsel 
this framework requires the court to first determine the specific nature of any actual or potential conflict of interest arising from the joint representation.if there is no conflict of interest,then the defendant choice of counsel must be respected unless there is some institutional concern requiring disqualification.see,at.the court has an independent interest in ensuring that criminal trials are conducted within the ethical standards of the profession and that legal proceedings appear fair to all who observe them.quoting wheat,at.if,on the other hand,the court finds an actual conflict of interest that seriously undermines counsel effectiveness,there can be no doubt that the court may decline a proffer of waiver,and insist that defendants be separately represented.wheat,at.a conflict that amounts to a breach of the code of professional ethics obviously qualifies,see,as does a concrete conflict of interest which thoug
