plaintiffs appeal from an order disqualifying marshall silberberg attorney silberberg from representing them in their lawsuit,which alleges that the negligence of defendant bakersfield memorial hospital injured plaintiff katie faughn during her birth.the superior court granted bakersfield memorial hospital motion to disqualify attorney silberberg,pursuant to california rules of professional conduct,rule e on the ground that he had formerly represented catholic healthcare west,parent corporation of bakersfield memorial hospital,in litigated matters that bear a substantial relationship to those matters that are embraced in the present litigation,and is presumed to have acquired confidential information by virtue of the former representation.
plaintiffs argue that the record does not contain sufficient evidence to support the determination that attorney silberberg prior representation of corporate affiliates of bakersfield memorial hospital was substantially related to his representation of plaintiffs in this case.we conclude that bakersfield memorial hospital motion to disqualify relied too heavily on inferences about facts that were within its control and that could have been disclosed without compromising confidential information.by omitting these facts,bakersfield memorial hospital failed to carry its burden.thus,its motion should have been denied.
accordingly,the disqualification order is reversed.

rule e prohibits a lawyer from accepting employment adverse to a former client where the lawyer has obtained confidential information material to the employment.bakersfield memorial hospital asserted that attorney silberberg representation of plaintiffs was prohibited by rule e because his representation of plaintiffs would be substantially related to his past representation of parent corporation and affiliated hospitals in the five cases described earlier.

discussion 
standard of review 
the standards used by an appellate court in reviewing a motion to disqualify counsel often are described by quoting the following paragraph from the california supreme court opinion in people ex rel.of corporations speedee oil change systems,cal th,d,speedee oil 
generally,a trial court decision on a disqualification motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion.citations.if the trial court resolved disputed factual issues,the reviewing court should not substitute its judgment for the trial court express or implied findings supported by substantial evidence.citations.when substantial evidence supports the trial court factual findings,the appellate court reviews the conclusions based on those findings for abuse of discretion.citation.however,the trial court discretion is limited by the applicable legal principles.citation.thus,where there are no material disputed factual issues,the appellate court reviews the trial court determination as a question of law.citation.in any event,a disqualification motion involves concerns that justify careful review of the trial court exercise of discretion.citation.id.at,d.
when the declarations submitted in connection with the motion to disqualify do not contain conflicting descriptions of the facts,an appellate court need not defer to the inferences drawn by the trial court in resolving factual disputes for which the parties did not submit direct evidence.speedee oil,supra,cal th at,d,collins state of california th,d.in such a situation,the appellate court is concerned with the legal significance of the undisputed facts in the record and reviews the trial court decision as a question of law.ibid.
the question about which inferences should be drawn from the undisputed facts is significant in cases where the moving party relies on inferences rather than submitting direct evidence of facts that are within its control.sometimes,omitted facts become conspicuous by their omission see abatti eldridge d,particularly where the motion involved,like a motion to disqualify counsel,has the potential for tactical abuse.see oldham california capital fund,th,d motion to approve settlement over objections of judgment lien creditor speedee oil,supra,cal th at,d,the need for careful examination of motions to disqualify counsel is based on the important interests involved and the possibility of tactical abuse.
presenting direct evidence of facts to support a motion to disqualify counsel that is related to confidential information is constrained,of course,by the need to avoid the disclosure of the former client confidences and secrets.jessen hartford casualty ins.th,d jessen,citing ahmanson salomon brothers,d.ahmanson.one method of presenting evidence and protecting its confidential nature is to file the documents with the court under seal for in camera review,morrison knudsen hancock,rothert bunshoft th,d morrison detailed reports about pending cases prepared by counsel submitted for in camera review.
ii.disqualification of counsel 
prohibition against representing adverse interests 
an attorney may not,without the informed written consent of the client or former client,accept employment adverse to the client or former client where,by reason of the representation of the client or former client,the member has obtained confidential information material to the employment.rule e.
simultaneous representation 
courts applying rule e have created different standards for different situations.a question that is critical to identifying the correct standard is whether the attorney is simultaneously or successively representing clients with adverse interests.flatt superior court cal th,d,flatt.
this appeal does not involve simultaneous representation of clients.therefore,our analysis is focused on the rules applicable to situations involving successive representation.flatt,supra,cal th at,d.
successive representation 
in successive representation cases,a party may obtain the disqualification of an attorney by establishing that the targeted attorney has actual knowledge of material confidential information or is presumed to have acquired confidential information because of the relationship between the prior representation and the current representation.
actual acquisition of confidential information 
the acquisition of material confidential information,which often is difficult to prove,requires the disqualification of the attorney,pound demera demera cameron th,d pound lawyer associated into case had actual knowledge of confidential information,fifth dist.required disqualification of lawyer and law firm.
presumed acquisition of confidential information 
a presumption that the targeted attorney obtained confidential information during the prior relationship applies to two different situations.where the attorney was involved personally and directly in providing legal advice and services to the former client,the substantial relationship test is used to determine whether the presumption applies,farris fireman fund ins.th,d.in situations where the former relationship was peripheral or attenuated,the modified substantial relationship test is used to determine whether the presumption applies,adams th,d adams see jessen,supra,th at,d vapnek et,cal.practice guide professional responsibility,supra,to modified version of substantial relationship test.
actual acquisition of confidential information was not shown 
bakersfield memorial hospital moving papers asserted that attorney silberberg obtained confidential and privileged information as a result of his prior representation of other chw affiliates.a former client may seek to disqualify a former attorney from representing an adverse party by showing the former attorney actually possesses confidential information adverse to the former client.ahmanson,supra,d at.here,bakersfield memorial hospital did not show that attorney silberberg actually possessed confidential information adverse to it or parent corporation and,notwithstanding the general assertion made in its moving papers,did not rely on attorney silberberg actual knowledge of confidential information as the basis for its motion.pound,supra,th,d.
accordingly,the order disqualifying attorney silberberg can not be upheld on the grounds of actual acquisition of confidential information.
application of the substantial relationship test 
bakersfield memorial hospital moving papers focused on the argument that attorney silberberg should be disqualified because a substantial relationship existed between his former representation of chw and his current representation of plaintiffs in their lawsuit against it.the superior court written order granting the motion to recuse stated that attorney silberberg formerly represented chw in litigated matters that bear a substantial relationship to those matters that are embraced in the present litigation,and is presumed to have acquired confidential information thereby.
on appeal,bakersfield memorial hospital argues that the substantial relationship test applies and that the superior court findings under that test are supported by substantial evidence.
w here a former client seeks to have a previous attorney disqualified from serving as counsel to a successive client in litigation adverse to the interests of the first client,the governing test requires that the client demonstrate a substantial relationship between the subjects of the antecedent and current representations.flatt,supra,cal th at,d.
this court previously has described the substantial relationship test as follows 
thus,successive representations will be substantially related when the evidence before the trial court supports a rational conclusion that information material to the evaluation,prosecution,settlement or accomplishment of the former representation given its factual and legal issues is also material to the evaluation,prosecution,settlement or accomplishment of the current representation given its factual and legal issues.jessen,supra,th at,d.
this definition of substantially related is essentially the same as the formulation found in section of the restatement third of the law governing lawyers,which provides that the present representation will be considered substantially related to the prior representation if there is a substantial risk that the present representation will involve the use of confidential information acquired in the course of the prior representation.farris,supra,th at,d.
relationship of decision makers involved in the representations 
bakersfield memorial hospital makes the following argument to support its position that attorney silberberg prior representations of parent corporation and its affiliates are substantially related to the current case 
i n this case,as it does in all cases against its member entities,chw and its defense trust directly control the subject litigation.bakersfield memorial hospital does not play a role in making any decisions about the defense of the claim.chw is also solely responsible for payment of costs of defense and payment of any settlement or resulting judgment.citation.
to analyze this argument,we start by examining the assertions of fact and whether they are matters of inference or are supported by direct evidence.
the first assertions of parent corporation and chw hpl trust directly control all litigation against its member entities or directly control the action that plaintiffs have filed against bakersfield memorial not supported by the declarations submitted by bakersfield memorial hospital with its motion instead,we are asked to accept these facts based on inference.
similarly,the factual assertion that bakersfield memorial hospital plays no role in making any decision about the defense of plaintiffs action is not supported directly by the declarations.we are asked to infer this fact.
the factual assertion that chw pays the cost of defense and any liability presumably is meant to refer to the chw hpl trust role.this assertion is supported by a citation to the declaration of derek covert,the and general counsel of chw,and paragraph of that declaration describes the role of the chw hpl trust in assuming the liability of chw affiliates in hospital professional liability cases.consequently,bakersfield memorial hospital has established this fact regarding costs and liability and we need not infer its existence.
one reason bakersfield memorial hospital made the foregoing assertions of fact regarding how cases are controlled was to support its position that attorney silberberg knows and understands exactly how chw approached birth injury cases particularly the claims handling practices of chw and its claims managers,the manner in which cases were investigated,evaluated,analyzed,and prepared for trial,and the manner and purpose in the way chw approached settlement negotiations and trial bakersfield memorial hospital argues that this was crucial information and could be used to plaintiffs advantage in their suit against it.
what is the evidence in the record that leads to inferences that conflict with bakersfield memorial hospital assertions regarding centralized control and its exclusion from the process 
joseph hale september,letter to attorney silberberg contains language from which it may be inferred that control of litigation is not completely centralized and that individuals from the hospital or regions have input into the handling of litigation 
your main contacts will be myself,and the mhs regional director,risk safety manager,linda ubaldi.marge matsuda is the mhs claims manager and is also an important contact at ubaldi office.
barbara vankoll november,letter to attorney silberberg referred to a facility risk manager and requested that silberberg direct correspondence to me and to kathy dean at dominican santa cruz hospital 
these letters show that,at least in connection with some hospitals in the chw system,individuals at a regional or facility level have input into how litigated cases are handled.from this showing,it is possible but not necessary to infer that those individuals have some control over the litigation as well.
to determine which of the conflicting inferences to draw from the facts actually presented,we also examine what the record does not contain.in particular,are there facts within the control of the moving party that could be disclosed without defeating the purpose of protecting confidential information and are conspicuous by their absence abatti eldridge,supra,d at.see oldham california capital fund,supra,th at,d.
first,the declarations do not contain the general assertion that,once chw hpl trust assumes responsibility for paying the costs of defense and any resulting liability associated with a lawsuit against a member of chw system,individuals employed by the hospital play no role in deciding how the litigation will be handled.in addition,the declarations do not contain a specific assertion about bakersfield memorial hospital and where the responsibility is located for suits against that facility.this specific assertion would distinguish the bakersfield facility from
