on march,a jury convicted lazaro alexander hernandez defendant on one count of possession of a firearm by a prohibited person in violation of g and a.on appeal to this court,defendant argues that his fifth and sixth amendment rights were violated when a recused assistant united states attorney sent two to his son,who was married to defendant sister,regarding defendant case.defendant also argues that the district court erred when,pursuant to the recorded recollection exception to the hearsay rule,it admitted hearsay testimony linking defendant to the gun that he was convicted of possessing.the person with firsthand knowledge of the fact in dispute orally conveyed that information to two people who recorded it,and both the speaker and the people who recorded the information testified at trial that they performed their roles accurately.we hold that defendant constitutional claims lack merit and that the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the hearsay testimony under federal rule of evidence.accordingly,we affirm defendant conviction.
background 
on july,defendant attended his nephew alex birthday party at the cheyenne,wyoming home of his sister connie hernandez.also attending the party was shane crofts,an army officer who was connie hernandez boyfriend and the father of shane lived in brighton,colorado.during the party,defendant asked shane if he could smoke a cigarette in shane car.shane agreed and gave defendant his car keys,which defendant returned when he was finished.later that day,shane noticed that his garage door opener,which he usually kept in his car,was missing.the opener was found a few days later in connie side yard in a place that had previously been searched.
when shane returned to his house in brighton,colorado the next morning,he discovered that all of his firearms,as well as other items,had been stolen from the top shelf of his bedroom closet.one of the stolen firearms was a beretta millimeter semiautomatic pistol that shane father,christopher kip crofts,had given to him.kip crofts was an assistant attorney for the district of wyoming.there were no signs of forced entry at shane home,although someone could have come into the house from the garage because the door between the garage and the house was routinely kept unlocked.
about a month later,defendant asked two friends,kirk and tracy allen,to store a gun for him at their house.defendant told them this was necessary because another sister with whom he was living,vina renee hernandez renee,would not allow a gun to be kept in her home.defendant brought the gun to the allens house in a black duffel bag,and when the allens moved into a trailer,defendant transported the gun to the allens new residence after leaving the gun in the allens trailer for about a week,defendant retrieved it and carried it away in the same black duffel bag.
at one point during that summer,tracy allen mentioned to defendant sister renee hernandez that defendant was storing a gun at their house.renee hernandez asked her for the gun serial number,but tracy allen initially refused to give it to her.instead,tracy allen called another friend,jacqueline grant,and recited the serial number to her so that jacqueline grant could record it.when renee hernandez called tracy allen back several days later to ask again for the serial number,defendant had already taken back the gun,so tracy allen called jacqueline grant for the serial number.after jacqueline grant told tracy allen the number,tracy allen called renee hernandez and recited the number to her over the phone.renee hernandez then wrote the number down.
shortly before christmas,a friend of defendant came to renee hernandez house and dropped off a black duffel bag.inside the duffel bag were the beretta millimeter firearm and some of defendant personal possessions.the duffel bag and defendant personal possessions contained therein were positively identified as defendant by his former girlfriend,elizabeth fanning.renee hernandez gave the duffel bag and its contents,including the gun,to shane crofts,who then turned them over to federal authorities.
on july,defendant was indicted in the united states district court for the district of wyoming on a single count of possession of a firearm the beretta by a prohibited person,in violation of g and a.
in november of,connie hernandez logged onto shane crofts computer using his password and discovered two to shane from his father,kip crofts,the assistant attorney in wyoming.the first was dated june,during the period that defendant was under investigation by the federal government but before he was charged.in the message,kip told shane he was concerned about connie refusal to cooperate with ken bray,the alcohol,tobacco and firearms agent investigating defendant case kip warned shane what could happen to connie if she did not cooperate the second was dated november.in it,kip told shane that the defense investigator working on defendant case,steve brinkerhoff,had told him that defendant was the biggest jerk he ever worked with.connie hernandez turned copies of both messages over to defense counsel.in light of the second message,which implied a conflict on the defense team because of the apparent disdain that the defense investigator had for defendant,defendant counsel filed a motion to withdraw and a motion to substitute counsel.on november,the district court held a hearing on the matter,granted counsel motion to withdraw,and appointed private attorney daniel blythe as new counsel pursuant to the criminal justice act.
blythe filed a motion to dismiss the indictment and for further relief,citing prejudice from the november about the defense investigator poor opinion of defendant and arguing that the june was an attempt by the government to coerce connie hernandez into testifying against defendant,her brother.the same day,defendant filed a pro se motion to dismiss the indictment,arguing that his right to a speedy trial had been violated,citing prejudice from his former defense counsel conflict of interest,and indicating that his new counsel was ineffective.
the government responded to the motion for dismissal and further relief by noting that both kip crofts and the entire attorney office for the district of wyoming had recused themselves from the case and prosecution of this case had been transferred to the attorney office for the district of colorado hence,there could be no government action implicated in kip neither of kip had been directed to connie hernandez,and they only communicated true and accurate information from kip to his son shane about the risk to connie of choosing not to testify before a grand jury,so they could not be construed as threats to a witness and defendant suffered no prejudice from the.the government argued that if defendant no longer trusted his counsel,that situation was created by his own perceptions rather than by any government misconduct,and in any event,defendant had been given new counsel.nor,said the government,had it obtained any advantage,evidence or information about defendant defense from kip communications with shane.
the district court provisionally denied all defense motions and later affirmed that ruling after connie hernandez and defendant testified outside the jury presence.the trial ended in a hung jury,and the court declared a mistrial.prior to jury selection in the second trial,the district court again denied all of defendant pretrial motions,including his motion to dismiss at the second trial,the jury found defendant guilty.the court sentenced him to months in prison to be served concurrently with a state term,as well as three years of supervised release and a monetary assessment of.defendant timely appealed.
discussion 
defendant challenges 
we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to.we review factual findings under the clearly erroneous standard we review de novo the ultimate constitutional issue.united states johnson,cir.
defendant challenges his conviction on five grounds stemming from the two from kip crofts to shane crofts that were intercepted by connie hernandez that kip crofts june to shane crofts,urging shane to persuade connie hernandez to cooperate in the investigation of defendant,constituted an attempt to intimidate connie hernandez in violation of his fifth amendment due process rights that the november,which revealed that kip crofts and the defense investigator had spoken,thereby demonstrated improper contact between the government and the defense that violated defendant fifth and sixth amendment rights that the negative remarks attributed to the defense investigator in the november proved the existence of a conflict of interest within the defense team that violated defendant fifth and sixth amendment rights that the district court erred by failing to hold a hearing to investigate further the incidents and that defendant second appointed counsel was ineffective for failing to address sufficiently the previous four issues.we address and reject each of these claims in turn.
whether the june was an unconstitutional attempt to intimidate connie hernandez 
defendant claim on this point fails for three reasons.first,kip crofts and indeed the entire attorney office for the district of wyoming had already recused himself from defendant case by the time he sent the june to shane because kip crofts was not acting in his governmental rather,as the indicates,in his capacity as a concerned father and grandfather his actions can not be attributed to the government and thus can not be said to have violated defendant constitutional rights.
second,there is no evidence,other than defendant interpretation of the,that kip crofts intended to intimidate connie hernandez,and no evidence whatever that she changed her testimony after reading the.while connie testified at trial that she felt very intimidated when she read the,she also said that reading it did not change her testimony or her cooperation with defense counsel in any way.the only harm she articulated was that she had lost a lot of trust in our judicial system.while that is unfortunate,it does not amount to a violation of her brother constitutional rights.
third,even if the was an attempt by kip crofts to intimidate connie hernandez,it does not rise to the level of prosecutorial misconduct warranting reversal.prosecutorial misconduct entitles a defendant to relief only if the misconduct infected the trial to such an extent that it resulted in a fundamentally unfair trial.fox ward,cir citing donnelly dechristoforo,d.because connie testified that reading the did not change her testimony,defendant can not reasonably argue that kip sending the rendered his trial fundamentally unfair.accordingly,we reject defendant challenge to his conviction on this basis.
whether the november revealed improper contact between the prosecution and the defense that violated defendant sixth amendment rights 
the november revealed that kip crofts,as assistant attorney in the recused attorney office for the district of wyoming,had a conversation with defense investigator steve brinkerhoff of the federal public defender office.defendant argues that this constituted an invasion of the relationship between him and his defense counsel an assistant federal public defender that violated his fifth amendment right to due process and his sixth amendment right to counsel.as a result,he asked the court to dismiss his indictment.we decline to do so,as we find no violation of defendant constitutional rights.
where a litigant challenges governmental action under the due process clause and under another,more specific constitutional provision,we analyze the claim under the latter,more specific provision.see,bateman city of west bountiful,cir analyzing a claim under the takings clause rather than the due process or equal protection clauses graham connor,d analyzing a claim of excessive force by the police under the fourth amendment rather than under the more generalized notion of substantive due process.because the allegedly improper contact in this case took place after defendant was indicted and counsel was appointed,we analyze defendant challenge to that contact under the more specific sixth amendment right to counsel,rather than the more generalized notion of fifth amendment due process.
we reject defendant sixth amendment challenge to the contact between kip crofts and brinkerhoff because we find that kip crofts actions can not be attributed to the state.see generally brentwood acad.secondary sch.ath.ass n,d discussing the state action requirement.kip crofts and the entire attorney office for the district of wyoming had recused themselves from defendant case prior to defendant indictment on july.at that point,kip crofts was no longer acting on behalf of the state with respect to defendant case.therefore,any conversation that he subsequently had with defense investigator brinkerhoff,while perhaps unadvisable,was not attributable to the state.accordingly,we find that the contact between kip crofts and brinkerhoff did not violate defendant sixth amendment right to counsel.
whether the negative opinion of defendant held by the defense investigator as revealed in the november demonstrated a conflict of interest within the defense team that violated defendant sixth amendment rights 
defendant argues that the november proved two things the existence of an actual conflict of interest within the defense team,and that brinkerhoff violated the duty of loyalty,which is one of the paramount duties counsel owes to client.defendant argues that u nder these egregious circumstances,this court must assume that defendant was prejudiced by the collaborative actions of the government and the defense team.again,he bases his argument on the fifth and sixth amendments but does so imprecisely.rather than untangle the knots in defendant argument,we will reject his claim for the simple reason that he has failed to show how brinkerhoff opinion of him prejudiced his case in any way.and for the reasons noted above,we will analyze his argument solely under the sixth more specific constitutional provision in question here.
although defendant fails to specify what kind of sixth amendment claim he is raising here,it appears to be one of ineffective assistance of counsel.see aplt.br.at brinkerhoff,who was acting on behalf of defense counsel barrett,violated the duty of loyalty,which is one of the paramount duties counsel owes to his client.citing strickland washington,d.normally,we decline to review ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct appeal.united states galloway,cir en banc.only those rare claims which are fully developed in the record may be brought on direct appeal.id.at.we find that this ineffective assistance claim is sufficiently developed in the record to permit us to review it at this time.
to prove ineffective assistance of trial counsel,a defendant must satisfy the test established by the supreme court in strickland washington,d.one,he must prove that his attorney performance was deficient and fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.at.two,he must prove that his counsel deficient performance prejudiced him.id.at.if it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice,which we expect will often be so,that course should be followed.id.at.we follow that course here.
defendant ineffective assistance claim fails for two reasons.first,any harm caused to defendant by defense investigator brinkerhoff dislike of him was cured when,after the were disclosed by connie hernandez,brinkerhoff and defendant trial counsel of the federal public defender office withdrew,and defendant received new counsel,a private attorney appointed under the criminal justice act.second,defendant has failed to allege even a single fact suggesting that brinkerhoff dislike of him negatively affected his case in any way.hale gibson,cir the fact that trial counsel did not like his client or did not trust him does not rise to the level of a conflict of interest.personality conflicts are not conflicts of interest.citing morris slappy,d.defendant does not,for example,argue that brinkerhoff failed to pursue a particular line of investigation,or that he suppressed potentially exculpatory evidence,or anything of the kind.he merely states,without support,that brinkerhoff statement to attorney crofts,disparaging defendant could only have the effect of undermining his case and prejudicing him.such an unsupported allegation,without more,is insufficient to establish prejudice under strickland.see stafford saffle,cir.
in sum,the november suggests only that brinkerhoff thought poorly of defendant.that does not,on the facts before us,amount to a violation of defendant constitutional rights.
whether the district court should have held a hearing to investigate defendant allegations of governmental misconduct 
defendant argues that when confronted with the two,the district court erred by not conducting a hearing into whether those messages indicated a larger pattern of government interference with his case.because defendant raises this argument for the first time on appeal,we review the district court failure to conduct a hearing for plain error.under this standard,reversal is warranted only when there is an error that is plain or obvious that affects substantial rights and that seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states james,cir citing united states hishaw,cir.
we find that the district court did not err much less plainly err by failing to hold a hearing to investigate whether the indicated a larger pattern of government interference with defendant case.as we have already discussed,kip crofts,who had recused himself from defendant case,can not be considered part of the government in this context moreover,his two to shane crofts do not suggest that a pattern of malfeasance existed,and in fact the record affirmatively suggests that these were isolated,special circumstances,with no adverse impact upon defendant ability to mount a defense.it was thus not error for the district court to forgo a hearing on the matter.
whether defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel when his second counsel failed to pursue his issues pertaining to these 
defendant argues that his second lawyer,daniel blythe,was constitutionally ineffective for failing to zealously present the of interest issues to the district court.as noted above,however,there is no merit to the underlying claims and thus defendant second counsel could not have been ineffective for failing to pursue those claims.thus,we reject this ineffectiveness claim.
ii.whether the district court abused its discretion by allowing two handwritten notes with the serial number of the gun to be read into the record under the recorded recollection exception to the hearsay rule 
we review evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion,and our review of decisions admitting statements contested as hearsay is especially deferential.united states edward,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
defendant argues that the district court improperly admitted hearsay testimony about the serial number of the gun he was charged with possessing.specifically,he claims that the exhibits read into the record containing the serial number of the gun did not satisfy the requirements of the recorded recollection exception to the hearsay rule because they were not made by a single witness or adopted by a single witness.see.the serial number evidence was important because it was recorded from the gun defendant asked tracy allen to store for him,thereby providing direct evidence that defendant possessed the gun at issue.we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion and that the evidence was properly admitted under rule.
at trial,tracy allen was asked if she could remember the serial number of the gun that she said defendant stored at her home.she said that she could not.she did,however,testify that she had accurately recited the serial number to two grant and renee themselves testified that they accurately wrote down the serial number.the chain of events was as follows renee hernandez heard that defendant was keeping a gun at tracy allen house.renee hernandez then called tracy allen to ask for the serial number of the gun.tracy allen refused to give it to her.after that conversation,tracy allen called jacqueline grant and asked her to write down the serial number,which tracy allen read off the gun,which was in front of her.jacqueline grant wrote down the number.renee later called tracy allen a second time,again asking her for the serial number.at that point,tracy allen agreed to give it to her.but by this time,the gun was no longer at tracy allen home,so she did not have the serial number in her possession.therefore,tracy allen called jacqueline grant and asked grant to recite the serial number back to her.jacqueline grant agreed and read the number to tracy allen.tracy allen then called back renee hernandez and recited the serial number to her.renee hernandez wrote down the serial number as tracy allen was saying it.at no time after these phone conversations did tracy allen examine the writings made by jacqueline grant and renee hernandez.
tracy allen,jacqueline grant,and renee hernandez all testified at trial that they performed their roles accurately.tracy allen testified that she accurately read the serial number from the gun to jacqueline grant,and that she later recited it accurately to renee hernandez.jacqueline grant testified that she accurately wrote down the serial number when tracy allen recited it to her,and that she accurately read the serial number back to tracy allen pursuant to allen subsequent request.renee hernandez testified that she accurately wrote down the serial number when tracy allen recited it to her.the notes made by jacqueline grant and renee hernandez were read into the record but not themselves introduced as evidence.
defendant objected,asserting that the notes were hearsay that did not fit within the exception.he argued that because the statements read to the jury were the joint product of tracy allen,jacqueline grant and renee hernandez,they were not admissible under the hearsay exception for past recollection recorded.the district court overruled the objection.we conclude that the hearsay testimony did fit within the rule hearsay exception and that the district court ruling was correct.
rule is the exception to the hearsay rule for recorded recollections.it states 
recorded recollection.a memorandum or record concerning a matter about which a witness once had knowledge but now has insufficient recollection to enable the witness to testify fully and accurately,shown to have been made or adopted by the witness when the matter was fresh in the witness memory and to reflect that knowledge correctly.if admitted,the memorandum or record may be read into evidence but may not itself be received as an exhibit unless offered by an adverse party.
emphasis added.
the most logical reading of the phrase by the witness is that that phrase modifies both of the preceding verbs made and adopted.as explained in one leading treatise 
a somewhat different type of cooperative report is involved when one person orally reports facts to another person,who writes them down.a store clerk or timekeeper,for example,may report information to a bookkeeper.in this situation,courts have held the written statement admissible if the person reporting the facts testifies to the correctness of the oral report although at the time of the testimony,the detailed facts can not be remembered and the recorder of that statement testifies to faithfully transcribing the oral report.while subject to some ambiguity because of inartful drafting by congress,the federal rule continues to permit admission of such statements.
mccormick on evidence,at john strong,ed footnotes omitted.the authors of the mccormick treatise base their reading of the rule in part on the senate committee report commenting on a change to the rule 
the committee does not view the house amendment adding the words or adopted by the witness as precluding admissibility in situations in which multiple participants were involved.
when the verifying witness has not prepared the report,but merely examined it and found it accurate,he has adopted the report,and it is therefore admissible.the rule should also be interpreted to cover other situations involving multiple p
