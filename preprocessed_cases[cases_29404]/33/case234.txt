paul warfield and his company,jemesco,collectively,the warfield defendants appeal the district court decision awarding them monetary sanctions against paul leonard and randall roach,counsel for richard rentz,the plaintiff in the underlying litigation.in,the district court determined that leonard and roach had violated rule of the federal rules of civil procedure and by litigating several of rentz claims set forth in an amended complaint that lacked any basis in fact.in,the district court reduced the amount of potential attorney fees from that which was originally requested by warfield as sanctions,approximately,to a total of from leonard,and from roach,based on calculations of the amount of attorney fees actually caused by the sanctionable conduct.the district court then further reduced the amount of sanctions and ultimately awarded to the warfield defendants only from leonard and from roach.the district court did not sanction rentz or the relevant law firms.
on appeal,the warfield defendants argue that the district court abused its discretion by failing to sanction one of the law firms,failing to sanction rentz,and arbitrarily reducing the sanctions against leonard and roach to an amount far below the court own calculation of attorney fees reasonably incurred to litigate rentz frivolous claims.for the reasons explained below,we affirm the district court decision with respect to the first two issues.because,however,the district court abused its discretion in further reducing the awards to de minimis amounts,we vacate that portion of the district court order specifying the amount of sanctions and remand with instructions to the district court to issue an order forthwith imposing sanctions of against leonard and against roach,to be paid to the warfield defendants.
background 
the sanctions at issue in this case arise out of litigation that occurred between and involving rentz,the warfield defendants,and warfield,armando and ignacio mendez the mendez brothers.the mendez brothers own and operate a and business based in florida,dynasty apparel industries,dynasty.rentz,a dayton businessman,first met armando mendez while sitting next to him at a world series game in cincinnati on october.mendez told rentz that he and his brother ran a business and sought to obtain a license from the national football league nfl to produce nfl apparel.mendez said that he had a standing order from for million if he was able to procure an nfl license.after rentz told mendez that he knew someone who might be able to help obtain the license,the two men agreed that if rentz introduced mendez to someone who helped him obtain an nfl license,mendez would pay rentz a commission of one percent of dynasty gross sales of goods.although rentz and mendez shook hands on the deal and exchanged telephone numbers,they did not reduce the agreement to writing.joint appendix at.at.
rentz soon contacted paul warfield,a former nfl football player who leased office space from rentz in dayton.rentz suggested that warfield might use his connections to the nfl to help the mendez brothers obtain a license.although rentz prepared a letter of understanding obligating warfield to pay rentz one percent of gross sales of merchandise sold under an nfl license,warfield never signed an agreement with rentz.in late october,rentz arranged a meeting in dayton between the mendez brothers and warfield.after the mendez brothers showed warfield samples of their work,warfield agreed to seek an nfl license on their behalf.although rentz mentioned his commission at the meeting,there was no specific discussion of who would pay rentz.following the dayton meeting,rentz periodically spoke by phone with both warfield and the mendez brothers.during one call with armando mendez,rentz repeatedly mentioned the promised commission,but mendez suggested that warfield pay the commission.in november,warfield met the mendez brothers in miami,florida,and toured dynasty production facility.at that meeting,warfield told armando mendez that rentz was not warfield partner and told the mendez brothers that they would have to pay any commission to rentz.
in,warfield and his wife formed the corporation jemesco,which then entered an agreement with the mendez brothers corporation dynasty to create a joint venture called the group.the group obtained two nfl licenses in.in february,armando mendez told rentz that the mendez brothers had obtained an nfl license through a contact other than warfield,and rentz assumed that warfield efforts had failed.however,several years later,in july,rentz learned in a newspaper article that warfield had been in the florida business since.rentz concluded that warfield had obtained an nfl license for the mendez brothers and that rentz had been deprived of his commission.
after rentz threatened litigation,warfield filed a action against rentz on may,in the united states district court for the southern district of florida.rentz then filed a separate action in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio on june,naming as defendants the mendez brothers,dynasty also known as mendez screen printing,and the warfield defendants.the two actions were subsequently consolidated in the ohio district court on july.
on march,the district court dismissed several portions of rentz complaint but gave him leave to file an amended complaint.rentz filed an amended complaint on june,alleging various fraud,and claims against the mendez brothers,dynasty,and the warfield defendants,and tortious interference with a business relationship against warfield.on march,the district court dismissed the fraud claims and all of the claims insofar as they were directed against the mendez brothers individually.the claims remaining in the case,therefore,were the contract,and claims against dynasty and the warfield defendants,and the claim of tortious interference with a business relationship against the warfield defendants.
both dynasty and the warfield defendants subsequently moved for summary judgment on the remaining claims.the warfield defendants also filed a motion for sanctions against rentz,his counsel,and their law firms,pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,and ohio.at mot.for sanctions on february,the district court granted summary judgment to the warfield defendants,but denied summary judgment to dynasty.at dist.at 
the district court also found rentz counsel subject to sanctions under both rule and,but it denied the motion for sanctions under ohio as moot.at dist.at.specifically,the court found that rentz november deposition testimony revealed that there was no evidentiary basis for the allegations and legal claims that rentz continued to make against the warfield defendants in his amended complaint,filed on june,and in his opposition to the defendants motions for summary judgment,filed on august.
the district court explained that throughout his deposition rentz had repeatedly denied the existence of any agreement requiring the warfield defendants to compensate him.the court noted the following statements by rentz at his deposition i did not care where the commission came from,but i dealt with the mendez brothers.that is who i made the deal with.at rentz dep.tr.at i was not partners with warfield.mine would be coming from the mendez brothers.at rentz dep.tr.at i did feel my deal was with paul warfield.at rentz dep.tr.at.the district court also cited the following testimony in which rentz,after repeated questioning,acknowledged that neither jemesco nor warfield personally ever agreed to pay rentz commission

q did warfield ever obligate himself to pay you a dime

at rentz dep.tr.at.although ruling that rentz testimony demonstrated subsequent attorney misconduct warranting sanctions,the district court concluded that an evidentiary hearing was necessary to determine both the proper amount of sanctions and the proper litigants to be sanctioned.at dist.at.
in october,the district court held a hearing on the warfield defendants motion for sanctions.at that hearing,the warfield defendants specified that they sought the imposition of rule sanctions on rentz himself rentz attorneys,paul leonard leonard and randall roach roach and two of the law firms with which leonard and roach practiced during the litigation,leonard roach and cornyn,leonard hughes.at dist.at.the warfield defendants requested that the district court impose monetary sanctions of some to compensate them for the attorney fees that they incurred litigating the case.id.between november and february,the parties submitted briefs on the issues of who should be sanctioned and what amount of sanctions should be imposed.
more than seven years later,on august,the district court finally issued a ruling on these issues.the court found that only leonard and roach were subject to sanctions and imposed monetary sanctions on each of the two attorneys pursuant to both rule and.at dist.at.the court explained that leonard had filed the amended complaint in which certain claims against warfield were controverted by rentz deposition testimony.at dist.at.similarly,roach had prepared and filed a memorandum opposing the warfield defendants motion for summary judgment even though rentz prior deposition testimony had made clear that most of the claims against warfield had no evidentiary basis.at dist.at.the district court,however,denied the warfield defendants request that it also sanction rentz personally and the law firms with which leonard and roach practiced during the relevant period.
next,the district court calculated the attorney fees reasonably incurred by the warfield defendants due to the sanctionable conduct of leonard and of roach.beginning with the in total attorney fees claimed by the warfield defendants,the court made a series of specific deductions,including deductions for fees unrelated to the frivolous claims.the court concluded that the warfield defendants would be reasonably compensated by an award of for the attorney fees incurred due to leonard sanctionable conduct and due to roach sanctionable conduct.at dist.at.however,the district court then proceeded to reduce these amounts by more than ninety percent,ordering that leonard and roach pay just and respectively to the warfield defendants.in so doing,the district court observed that deterrence and punishment,rather than compensation for fees,were the primary goals of both rule and and concluded that these goals would be sufficiently served by the imposition of sanctions in the reduced amounts.

decision not to impose rule sanctions on law firm 
the warfield defendants argue that the district court erred in failing to hold the law firm cornyn,leonard hughes cl h jointly responsible under rule for the sanctionable conduct of leonard and roach.rule c provides that a bsent exceptional circumstances,a law firm must be held jointly responsible for a violation committed by its partner,associate,or employee.c.with this provision the amendments specifically departed from pavelic leflore marvel entertainment group,d,in which the supreme court held that a law firm may not be sanctioned under rule for a violation by one of its attorneys.the advisory committee notes to the amendments explain that it is appropriate that the law firm ordinarily be viewed as jointly responsible for its attorney rule violations under established principles of agency.advisory committee notes amendments.however,neither the text of the rule nor the advisory committee notes shed light on what constitutes exceptional circumstances.the warfield defendants contend that the district court finding of exceptional circumstances as to cl h amounted to an abuse of discretion.we disagree.
in april,both leonard and roach began to practice law with christopher cornyn cornyn and began receiving paychecks from the law firm cornyn,leonard and hughes cl h.at that time,rentz suit had been pending for around nine months.approximately two months later,on june,leonard filed the amended complaint for which he was later sanctioned.leonard left cl h later that year,in december,after a dispute with cornyn,but roach stayed on to practice in cornyn firm,which was then called cornyn,roach hughes.although leonard testified that he had only minimal involvement with the case after leaving cl h,both leonard and roach remained counsel of record on the district court docket until february,when leonard was replaced as trial counsel by cornyn.
the district court declined to sanction cl h under rule because it found that,even assuming that leonard and roach were acting as agents for the firm,the case remained first and foremost the responsibility of leonard and to a lesser extent that of roach,and t here was no evidence that cornyn or hughes was involved in the drafting or filing of the amended complaint.at dist.at.the court added that leonard affixed only his name to the amended complaint,rather than identifying himself as part of cornyn,leonard and hughes.id.the warfield defendants counter that leonard and roach were employees of cl h when the amended complaint was filed and that cornyn should be held responsible for failing adequately to supervise the case.they contend that cornyn allowed the resources of his law firm as wielded by leonard and roach to inflict harm and damage upon the warfield defendants without any attempt to manage or correct their improper conduct.warfield br.at.
the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to hold the law firm cl h jointly responsible for the misconduct of leonard and roach.first,there is no evidence that cornyn had any contact with the rentz case or was involved in either a supervisory or managerial capacity until cornyn replaced leonard as counsel of record in february,well after the sanctionable conduct occurred.instead,there was a general understanding among the three attorneys that roach and leonard would continue to maintain sole responsibility for the rentz case when they joined cornyn and hughes to form cl cornyn stated that when roach and leonard joined cl h in early i t was fairly clear in everyone understanding that,since it was ongoing litigation,that was their case and they would handle that action independent of me.at cornyn tr.at.consistent with this understanding,when leonard filed the amended complaint soon after joining cl h,the certificate of service did not identify him as a member of cl at.indeed,the only evident connection that cornyn or cl h had with the rentz case at the time of the sanctionable conduct was the appearance of the firm name on the letterhead of correspondence involving the rentz case.in sum,the record makes clear that the rentz case was solely the responsibility of leonard and roach during the relevant period,that cornyn had no involvement with the case until well after the sanctionable conduct had occurred,and that the three attorneys had an understanding that when leonard and roach joined cornyn they would handle the rentz case independent of cornyn.given the tenuous connection between the law firm cl h and the rentz case at the time of the sanctionable conduct,we can not say that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to sanction cl 
decision not to impose rule sanctions on rentz 
the warfield defendants also contend that the district court decision not to sanction rentz personally was an abuse of discretion because rentz was actively involved in the litigation and allowed his attorneys to make allegations against the warfield defendants that he knew to be untrue.rentz acknowledges that he was an active participant in the litigation,attending depositions and reviewing the various pleadings.however,he maintains that he provided consistent and truthful factual statements throughout the litigation and that,as a layperson without legal training,h e was not in a position to evaluate whether the allegations asserted in the two pleadings,now couched in their legal parlance as distinct legal theories,were equivalent to the accounts he provided of those meetings and events.rentz br.at.
rule expressly provides the district court with discretion to impose sanctions on a party that is responsible for the rule violation,provided that the violation is not one for unwarranted legal contentions under rule b.see.c c a.the advisory committee notes to the amendments explain that the amended rule permits the court to consider whether the party itself should be held accountable for his part in causing a violation,and to make an additional inquiry in order to determine whether the sanction should be imposed on parties either in addition to or,in unusual circumstances,instead of the person actually making the presentation to the court.advisory committee notes amendments.courts have generally declined to impose sanctions on represented parties.see charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice procedure ed.imposing a sanction on the client has met with disfavor.however,we have upheld the imposition of rule sanctions on parties,along with their attorney,when they misrepresented key facts during their depositions and at trial.union planters bank l j dev,cir.
as explained previously,the sanctionable conduct in this case was the assertion of claims against the warfield defendants that clearly lacked any evidentiary support.rentz amended complaint and his memorandum opposing summary judgment contained allegations that individually or in concert with the mendez to pay rentz a commission.rentz repeatedly acknowledged in his deposition testimony,however,that warfield never promised or agreed to pay him a commission.the district court sanctioned rentz attorneys for continuing to allege that warfield had promised to pay rentz a commission when there was no evidence of such a promise.but the district court found that rentz did not cause his attorneys to violate rule and therefore declined to impose sanctions on rentz.the district court explained that 
there is no evidence that rentz misled his counsel or failed to provide them any requested information concerning his claims against warfield.on the contrary,the evidence demonstrates that rentz was forthcoming with his attorneys and opposing counsel.while rentz believed that warfield had treated him unfairly,that does not demonstrate that he caused his counsel to violate rule.moreover,it was his truthful deposition testimony to the effect that warfield had not agreed to compensate him which led to the dismissal of all claims against that defendant,as well as the imposition of sanctions by the court.
at dist.at.
although the warfield defendants maintain that the district court should have held rentz jointly responsible for permitting his counsel to make the unfounded contentions,we believe that the district court did not abuse its discretion in limiting its assessment of sanctions to rentz attorneys.nothing in the record suggests that rentz made any false factual allegations during the course of this litigation.it is undisputed that rentz deposition testimony was accurate and truthful,though contrary to the claims doggedly pursued by his counsel against the warfield defendants.rentz was consistently forthcoming with his attorneys and opposing counsel and provided accurate information about his relationship and discussions with warfield.if rentz attorneys characterized warfield statements as constituting a promise,or creating a contract,it was not unreasonable for rentz,who lacked any legal training,to trust this professional judgment.further,the unfounded contentions at issue here were not entirely factual,but rather mixed questions of fact and law for which a such as rentz should not be held responsible.accordingly,the district court reasonably determined that rentz conduct did not cause his attorneys to violate rule,and we therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining
