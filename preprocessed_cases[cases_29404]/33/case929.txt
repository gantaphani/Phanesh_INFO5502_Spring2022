we granted the defendant petition for leave to appeal.a.on appeal,defendant contends that the circuit court order,granting appointed counsel motion to withdraw based on lack of merit,was unauthorized by the act and deprived defendant of his statutory right to counsel.as defense counsel observed in oral argument before this court,no other aspect of the appellate court judgment is in issue.in order to provide a proper context for discussion of defendant claim,we will provide a more detailed recitation of facts.
defendant pled guilty to one count of first degree murder on september.two other counts,charging first degree murder under alternative theories,were dismissed at the time of the guilty plea.
prior to the plea,the circuit court advised defendant of the possible penalties he faced given the hypothetical applicability of an array of statutory factors and the possible existence of certain circumstances.in the course of the court explanation of potential penalties,which included the death penalty,the prosecutor advised the court that the state would not be seeking a sentence of death.the prosecutor did not explain whether that decision was related to defendant guilty plea.in any event,the court advised defendant of his rights and confirmed that the guilty plea was an open plea.
a factual basis was presented to support the guilty plea.the state evidence indicated that defendant intended to kill lori caruthers and he carried out the murder in a premeditated manner pursuant to a preconceived plan,acting in concert with two other men,anthony walker and richard pallante.according to the factual basis presented by the state,defendant not only continued his association with anthony walker after walker expressed a desire to kill caruthers and her friend,mischell knepler,defendant affirmatively indicated he was prepared to assist in that endeavor,saying,find them.walker sister,tanya,would have testified that defendant later instructed her not to let caruthers use the telephone at the walker residence and in fact stopped caruthers when she attempted to leave the walker residence through the back door of the house.
richard pallante would have testified that defendant obtained a pistol at defendant residence on the day of the murder and stated that they had to kill caruthers because she knew too much.according to pallante,defendant and walker laughed when walker said,in effect,that defendant was cruel.pallante would have testified that defendant and walker persuaded him to give them a ride,and he arrived at the walker residence around on the evening of the murder.defendant and walker entered the car with caruthers.pallante headed west on old jacksonville road in the direction of knepler house.at some point the three men stopped and exited the car,at which time walker told pallante that defendant was going to kill caruthers because she knew too much.defendant got caruthers out of the car.after a short period of time,defendant returned and walker asked defendant what was happening.when defendant responded that they were just talking,walker urged him to hurry up.thereafter,the same sequence of events transpired a second time.after defendant departed from the car for a third time,and was gone for a while,walker instructed pallante to drive in the direction defendant and caruthers had gone.pallante located defendant and caruthers and parked on the opposite side of the road from them.defendant returned to the car and there was a repetition of the previous exchanges between defendant and walker,at which time walker started to get out of the car,saying,i do it myself.defendant responded,no,i do it.he then got out of the car and walked over to where caruthers was standing.shortly thereafter,there was a single gunshot and caruthers fell to the ground.defendant pulled caruthers body further into the ditch,got back into the car,and the three men left the scene,traveling toward springfield.defendant said he had told caruthers that her friend,mischell,was dead,and caruthers begged him not to shoot her before he killed her.
after the factual basis was presented,defendant entered a plea of guilty.at that time,the court stated 
this is an open plea.the state has indicated that they will not be presenting aggravating evidence to seek the death penalty.i consider that as a part of a very limited plea agreement.other than for that,has any force,threats,or have any threats or promises been made to you to cause you to enter this plea of guilty this morning 
defendant responded,no.the court thereupon noted for the record that defendant had been advised of the possible penalties that might be imposed,including an extended term or natural life imprisonment.the court found the plea to be voluntary,an open plea with the one exception previously stated,and further found a factual basis for the plea.the court accepted defendant plea of guilty and entered judgment thereon.
a sentencing hearing was conducted on november,during which evidence in aggravation and mitigation was presented.thereafter,the state argued for a sentence of natural life imprisonment or,in the alternative,an sentence,suggesting that the murder was committed in a cold,calculated and premeditated manner pursuant to a preconceived plan see ilcs b west and that the offense was accompanied by exceptionally brutal and heinous behavior indicative of wanton cruelty.defense counsel argued that nothing in the defendant background or the circumstances of the offense warranted a sentence more than the mandatory minimum sentence of years imprisonment.defendant made a statement in allocution.
the circuit court sentenced defendant to the maximum sentence of years imprisonment.given the court ambiguous statements leading up to imposition of sentence,it is impossible to tell whether the court found no statutory factors to support a sentence of natural life imprisonment or an extended term,or the court simply deemed such sentences inappropriate.in pronouncing sentence,the sentencing judge stated that he had considered all applicable statutory mitigating and aggravating factors.
defendant subsequently filed a motion for reduction of sentence.defendant motion was heard and denied on september.as previously noted,defendant appealed and the appellate court affirmed defendant conviction and sentence.greer,d,unpublished order under supreme court rule.
on december,the defendant filed a pro se postconviction petition,alleging that appellate counsel on direct appeal had rendered ineffective assistance in that counsel had failed to argue petitioner guilty plea was not entered into knowingly and voluntarily because trial counsel incorrectly advised the petitioner that he was eligible for the death penalty,and petitioner guilty plea was not entered into knowingly and voluntarily because it was based upon trial counsel representation of a bogus plea bargain.with respect to the first allegation,defendant claimed that his trial attorney advice regarding the availability of the death penalty was erroneous and,had he known that he was not eligible for the death penalty,he would not have given up all his rights to avoid an extended term or natural life sentence,although he was not legally eligible for either one of those sentence s as well.as for the second allegation,defendant claimed he pled guilty upon defense counsel representation that an agreement had been reached for a prison sentence,though he admits the record shows no such deal had ever been agreed upon.defendant petition does not address his own acknowledgment in open court that no promises had been made to induce him to enter the guilty plea.
because no one brought the petition to the attention of the circuit court within days of filing,the court docketed the petition for consideration and appointed counsel for defendant,as the act requires.ilcs,west.obviously,there was never an initial determination as to merits of the petition.
on october,defendant appointed attorney filed a motion to withdraw as counsel.counsel stated that he had reviewed the record,transcripts of proceedings,the state attorney files,and had interviewed all relevant parties,including defendant however,he could find no basis on which to present any meritorious issue for review.counsel supported his motion with a brief purporting to comply with anders procedures.in that brief,counsel meticulously detailed his activities after appointment and,with respect to each of defendant contentions,stated that he could not properly substantiate defendant claim,concluding that petitioner claim was not meritorious.counsel suggested that he had considered other possible issues,but could find no issue of merit.
counsel motion to withdraw was heard on december.the judge presiding noted that he had not been the original trial judge in the case and that the clerk had failed to bring defendant petition to his attention in a timely manner,necessitating appointment of counsel.the court confirmed that defendant had discussed counsel motion to withdraw with counsel and advised defendant that he could appeal if the court allowed counsel motion,but he would have to do so pro se.the court then granted the motion and dismissed defendant pending petition,stating 
the court having reviewed the materials submitted by counsel finds that there is no constitutional claim of merit and that it is appropriate that the postconviction petition therefore be dismissed.
the court thereupon directed the clerk to file notice of appeal on behalf of defendant.
the appellate court held that defendant had not been denied his statutory right to counsel when the trial court granted appointed counsel motion for leave to withdraw.in so holding,the appellate court noted and followed fourth district precedent in people norton,d,
this court has held that a defendant receives sufficient representation of counsel in a postconviction proceeding under the act when counsel complies with supreme court rule c c,even if appointed counsel moves to withdraw upon finding no meritorious issues to present.norton,d at,at.defendant does not allege that appointed counsel did not comply with the requirements of rule c or that appointed counsel was incorrect in his assessment that there were no meritorious issues to present.therefore,under this court precedent,defendant received adequate representation on his postconviction petition.d at.
the appellate court concluded that the circuit court,under the circumstances,had acted properly when it allowed postconviction counsel to withdraw.d at.in so holding,the appellate court declined to follow the third district decision in people mckenzie,d,upon which defendant relied.
the appellate panel in mckenzie had specifically overruled three third district cases people robinson,d,people rial,d,people cokley,d,that had reached a result consistent with norton.the crux of the mckenzie court reasoning was that the legislature has mandated appointment of counsel for indigents desiring representation at the second stage of postconviction proceedings,but has not specifically provided for withdrawal of counsel 
it appears from our review of the act that the legislature intended to create procedures to give a convicted defendant a opportunity to change the outcome of his criminal case.it also appears,from the legislators decision not to provide for withdrawal,that they intended for the defendant to have the assistance of trained counsel throughout the process.we,therefore,conclude from the absence of authorizing language that withdrawal of appointed counsel is in contravention of the statute.mckenzie,d at.
as additional support for its decision,the mckenzie court seized upon certain comments this court made in people porter,in the course of addressing and due process arguments.those comments,taken out of context,are cited in mckenzie as the following propositions rule c is concerned with appointment of counsel at the appellate level,while section of the act provides for appointment of counsel at the trial stage of postconviction proceedings the appointment of counsel at the hearing stage of postconviction proceedings is a matter for the legislature and a postconviction petitioner is entitled to have counsel represent him on a petition once he sets out allegations demonstrating a meritorious constitutional claim.mckenzie,d at.defendant position before this court relies heavily on mckenzie and makes essentially the same arguments.
we note,at the outset,that the defendant in this case arrived at the second stage of postconviction proceedings without there ever having been a determination that his pro se petition presented the gist of a meritorious claim.in that respect,this case differs from mckenzie,where such a finding was made prior to advancement to the second stage of postconviction proceedings and the appointment of counsel.notwithstanding that difference,we recognize that sections and of the act require appointment of counsel for an indigent defendant desiring representation when his or her pro se postconviction petition is not summarily dismissed by the circuit court within days of filing,irrespective of whether the circuit court has actually considered the merits of the petition.we begin our analysis with a discussion of the purpose of the act and the procedural mechanism for its implementation.
illinois hearing act provides a procedural mechanism through which a criminal defendant can assert that in the proceedings which resulted in his or her conviction there was a substantial denial of his or her rights under the constitution of the united states or of the state of illinois or both.people rogers,quoting ilcs west.in a postconviction proceeding,the circuit court does not redetermine a defendant guilt or innocence,but instead examines constitutional issues which escaped earlier review.rogers,at.a postconviction proceeding is a collateral attack upon the prior conviction rogers,at,and affords only limited review of constitutional claims not presented at trial people coleman.we stress that postconviction procedures entail review of the prior proceeding that resulted in a defendant conviction,whether or not evidence is introduced concerning matters outside the record.
under the provisions of the act,an indigent defendant who has not been sentenced to death is not automatically entitled to appointment of counsel.the source of the right to counsel in a postconviction matter is statutory rather than constitutional people mcneal,and the act do
