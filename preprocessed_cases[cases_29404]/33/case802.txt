plaintiffs and appellants frances sanchez and anthony sanchez collectively,plaintiffs appeal an order dismissing their action against defendants and respondents city of los angeles city,jose chavez chavez and vincent balderrama balderrama collectively,defendants for failure to bring the action to trial within the mandatory period.code civ.the essential issue presented is whether the death of defendant balderrama attorney made it impracticable for plaintiffs to bring the action to trial within five years.
this record demonstrates that there was no causal connection between the circumstances upon which plaintiffs are relying and their failure to bring the action to trial within five years.indeed,it is clear that the reason plaintiffs did not bring the action to trial within five years was that their counsel had mistakenly calculated the expiration of that statutory period.further,the death of defense counsel did not result in a situation of impracticability over which plaintiffs had no control.nothing prevented the plaintiffs from seeking the setting of a trial date within the period in the event defendants refused to stipulate to an extension of time.instead,plaintiffs simply acquiesced in the setting of a trial date beyond the mark without securing a stipulation to extend the statutory period.
for these reasons,we perceive no abuse of discretion in the trial court rejection of plaintiffs claim of impracticability and affirm the order of dismissal.

on january,plaintiffs filed an ex parte application for production of photographs and peace officer records.on january,plaintiffs filed ex parte applications to continue the trial,amend their complaint,shorten time and for production of forensic materials from the shooting investigation.on plaintiffs motion,the trial date was vacated and trailed until february,to hear the various motions.on february,the trial date was vacated.thereafter,a trial setting conference was set for april.because the plaintiffs amended their complaint,the trial setting conference was moved to may.
on april,the plaintiffs filed a renewed motion to compel peace officer records.on may,a jury trial was calendared for october,and a final status conference was set for october.on october,after plaintiffs submitted a witness list in support of long cause designation,with a trial estimate of days,the case was transferred to central civil west,with a status conference for december.additional status conferences followed.from march through july of,plaintiffs counsel was engaged in a trial in federal court.on october,the law offices of johnnie cochran associated in on behalf of plaintiffs,to try the case.on october,due to a conflict which prevented the city attorney office from representing balderrama,he received independent counsel,barry levin levin.the long cause trial package was not completed until may.on may,the case was sent to the branch court in compton for trial.thereafter,on july,a trial date was scheduled for september.
procedural history of the final six months.
on july,levin,balderrama attorney,committed suicide.shortly thereafter,the law offices of irwin evans evans substituted in on balderrama behalf.the parties stipulated to continue trial,with a requested trial date of december.
on september,the trial court and the parties participated in a conference call.the trial court inquired how long the parties required to prepare for trial.based on information provided by the parties,as well as to allow sufficient time to transfer levin files to evans office and to enable evans to become familiar with them,and to meet the court calendar concerns,the trial court set a final status conference for january,with trial to commence on january.nobody alerted the trial court that those dates were beyond the mark of january.
on january,one day before the final status conference,defense counsel for all the defendants initiated a conference call to plaintiffs counsel,requesting a trial continuance.defense counsel stated a continuance was necessary because evans had not yet received all of levin files and was not ready to proceed to trial.
on january,a final status conference was held in chambers.during the conference,plaintiffs counsel indicated he believed the period would expire sometime in june or july of.the trial court then checked the file,saw that the original complaint was filed january,and according to defense counsel,the trial court was absolutely dumbfounded at that point.
defendants motion for dismissal under the statute.
defendants promptly filed a motion to dismiss the action under the statute,arguing the failure to bring the action to trial within five years was due to the erroneous belief of plaintiffs counsel that the five years would not expire until june or july of.defendants pointed out that on september,when the trial court set a trial date of january,plaintiffs failed to alert the trial court to the chronology of the case and acquiesced in a trial date beyond the mark.defendants also argued that,leaving aside the plaintiffs silence at the september,trial setting conference,there was,as of that date,still ample time thereafter to advance the trial date pursuant to a motion under california rules of court,rule rule.defendants contended that plaintiffs inadvertence did not qualify as impracticability,impossibility or futility for purposes of tolling the statute.
in opposition,plaintiffs argued the statute was tolled on the grounds of impracticability,impossibility or futility because levin suicide on july,caused the september,trial date to be vacated,and resulted in several months of delay in selecting replacement counsel,providing new counsel with levin files and bringing him up to speed on the case.
trial court ruling.
on february,after hearing the matter,the trial court granted defendant dismissal motion,stating i do think that the issue in this case is whether or not it would be impracticable,impossible or futile to bring to trial within the period of time within which levin death occurred and new counsel was brought in and got properly prepared.i think the real issue is whether or not it impossible,impracticable or futile to bring the case to trial within the five years,and i do think in this case that we have that situation because as i stated yesterday when we said i had reviewed the minute orders in this case,and at the telephone conference that was held on september when this matter was discussed and the trial dates were selected.casselman,had it been brought to the court att
