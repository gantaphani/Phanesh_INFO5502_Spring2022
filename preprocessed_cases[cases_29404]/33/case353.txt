turner litigation 
on august,fletcher filed a lawsuit for a client,william turner,in the western district against honeywell federal manufacturing technologies llc honeywell.the lawsuit turner litigation alleged that honeywell had denied turner promotions on the basis of race.early in the turner litigation,the parties participated in mediation under the western district early assessment program.as the mediation session concluded,fletcher began directing profanities at jill marchant,honeywell counsel,and karen cain and william martucci,honeywell outside counsel.among other things,fletcher accused marchant of being a fucking liar.needless to say,the parties were unable to resolve the case in mediation.
in conjunction with the turner litigation,daniel craig,an associate working for fletcher,deposed karen clegg,former president of honeywell,on june.craig asked clegg whether she had made a comment that the white man is an endangered species at honeywell.
craig okay.do you recall being in a management meeting in approximately early where you made a comment,in fact,wrote on a board something to the effect that the white man is an endangered species at honeywell 
clegg i do know year that would have been made.i do recall that we provided diversity training to associates,and the trainers,and i happened to be one of the trainers,set out a chart,i believe it was,of perceptions that people had about each other,perceptions that are typically inaccurate and that may believe that one of the statements on the presentation material that was prepared for the trainers.
craig but did you actually say something to that effect 
clegg i think it was on the chart and i stated that was a perception.i certainly never presented it as my perception.as i said,it was part of diversity training to understand how people misperceive each other.
fletcher deposed jimmie banks,former honeywell manager of human resources services and diversity,on june.during the deposition of banks,fletcher asked a number of pointed questions about vernacular allegedly used in the community.the following exchange is representative of fletcher behavior during the deposition of banks 
fletcher now do you think if i were to refer to your wife as a nigger bitch that would be highly offensive 
banks yes,sir.
fletcher okay.and why would it be highly offensive 
banks because of the nature of the term.
fletcher okay.now,tell me why you think the term nigger bitch would be offensive.
banks in our culture,bitch is referred to as a female dog.in our culture,the word nigger in certain contexts is an offensive term.and you put those two together and you have very offensive identifiers.
fletcher now tell me a context in which it okay to refer to an african american as a nigger.
banks i do know of any.
fletcher did you just testify,sir,that,quote in certain contexts it offensive 
banks well,as i see it personally,it always offensive.in terms of how certain people might use it,it could be a term of affection in our culture.
fletcher when you say our culture,what do you mean 
banks in our culture.black culture.
fletcher relentlessly pressed this line of questioning until honeywell counsel objected.as part of the exchange between attorneys and in the presence of the witness,the plaintiff,the court reporter and others,fletcher characterized banks testimony as follows the fact that this man has testified that for years he refers to african americans as niggers,the fact that this man has testified that for years he found it a compliment to be referred to as nigger is shocking.fletcher added,this man,in my opinion,has done nothing but step on the backs of black people at honeywell so he can get further,he could be further ahead.the tirade concluded with fletcher calling banks a racist and comparing him to those jews that were willing to turn in other jews to the nazis to protect themselves.
honeywell complaints 
fletcher eventually learned of several additional individuals who claimed they also suffered racial discrimination at the hands of honeywell.initially,fletcher sought to join these individuals as additional plaintiffs in the turner litigation.however,after the district court denied his request,fletcher filed eighteen separate complaints against honeywell on behalf of these new plaintiffs the honeywell complaints.these cases then were assigned to numerous judges in the western district,except judge smith,who had recused himself under from the one case that was assigned to him.
as in the turner litigation,neither clegg nor banks were named as defendants or accused of any wrongdoing.nonetheless,each of the eighteen complaints contained inaccurate and misleading allegations purportedly based on the deposition testimony that clegg and banks gave during the turner litigation.for example,the honeywell complaints contained the following with regard to banks 
banks testified that r eferring to an as a nigger,could be a term of affection in our culture.
it can be a compliment if i say you my nigger,to an.
d.he himself has several people who compliment him by calling him a nigger.
e.he enjoys being called a nigger by these people.
f.it makes him happy when these people call him a nigger.
americans may call him a nigger without offending him.
use of the word bitch towards a female can be a term of endearment in our culture.and,
use of the term nigger bitch in reference to an female may be an acceptable expression that people use.
complaint at,brown honeywell fed,llc,emphasis in original.
absent from fletcher selective quotations was much needed context.for example,with respect to subparagraph i,banks actually gave the following testimony 
fletcher okay.now,so if it okay to refer to african americans as niggers and okay to refer to african american females as bitch,why would you be offended if someone referred to your wife or daughter as a nigger bitch 
banks i think i responded to the nature of your question,and what you doing is tying two things together to try to make it sound like i said something that i actually have said.
fletcher okay.well,is it okay to refer to your wife or daughter as a nigger bitch 
banks i told you the terms are highly offensive,but two people who have a relationship,that may be an acceptable expression that people use.
fletcher okay.tell me a scenario in which it acceptable to refer to an african american female as a nigger bitch 
banks as far as i am personally concerned,there are none.
as is clear from the transcript,banks testified that he found the terms nigger and bitch to be highly offensive and inappropriate.
the honeywell complaints signed by fletcher similarly distorted the deposition testimony of clegg.for example,the complaint stated that clegg admits that she told a group of management employees in a meeting at honeywell that the white man is an endangered species at honeywell.complaint at,brown,emphasis in original.however,as is clear from her deposition testimony,clegg stated this was an example of how people misperceive each other.
honeywell moved to strike the portions of the complaints that involved its executives deposition testimony on the grounds that the allegations were impertinent and scandalous.judge gary fenner,the first judge to take up this issue,found that the offending paragraphs were impertinent,scandalous,and taken out of context so as to be misleading.samuel coleman honeywell fed,llc,slip op.at.june.one month later,judge wright entered a similar order in a honeywell litigation case before him,finding that with respect to the deposition testimony,plaintiff counsel has taken statements out of context and mischaracterized other testimony beyond recognition.combs honeywell fed,llc,slip op.at.july.both judges ordered the complaints to be amended without the offensive allegations.fletcher amended the two complaints before judges fenner and wright but did not amend the complaints pending before other judges.
in september,judge howard sachs granted honeywell motion to strike,stating that the offending paragraphs consist of conclusory allegations,at best,and fraudulent mischaracterizations at worst.barbara coleman honeywell fed,llc,slip op.at.one month later,judge nanette laughrey granted,without substantive analysis,honeywell motion to strike,holding that the issue had been ably addressed by judge fenner and judge wright in parallel actions.brown honeywell fed,llc,slip op.at.
complaints of misconduct 
initially,chief judge dean whipple notified maridee edwards,chief disciplinary counsel for the state of missouri,that judges smith and fenner had voiced complaints about the unprofessional and abusive conduct of michael fletcher in cases before them.edwards declined to exercise jurisdiction over the issues involving the western district,instead leaving the matter to the western district.
on november,chief judge whipple granted yet another honeywell motion to strike and ordered fletcher to show cause why he should not be sanctioned.the order to show cause was based on his finding that fletcher has shamelessly included scandalous allegations that were inaccurate,misleading,and inflammatory.smith honeywell fed,llc,slip op.at.the only reason chief judge whipple could find for the inclusion of these allegations was to harass and embarrass honeywell management and to shamelessly publicize this case in the media prior to trial.id.at.
the court can find no legitimate reason why fletcher would include these allegations in a pleading to this court.even if these allegations were the context of the depositions show they are allegations are irrelevant and immaterial to the claims set forth in the lawsuit.plaintiff claims she was discriminated against by not being promoted,but does not allege that either banks or clegg was involved in the advancement decisions relating to her.
although fletcher filed a brief opposing sanctions and honeywell filed a brief in support,chief judge whipple made no further ruling on the show cause order.instead,the western district sent a letter to fletcher on january,notifying him that judges fenner and smith had referred allegations of misconduct against fletcher pursuant to local rule d.the letter explained that particular allegations prompting an investigation and possible disciplinary proceedings stem from your representations to the court in the honeywell complaints and comparisons with the actual transcripts of the testimony cited.the letter stated that the western district had appointed theresa levings appointed counsel to investigate whether fletcher had violated missouri rule of professional conduct requiring candor toward the tribunal or.rpc prohibiting conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice when he filed the honeywell complaints.the letter also notified fletcher that appointed counsel would investigate other conduct or allegations that may come to her attention during the course of her investigation.
d.the investigation 
appointed counsel deposed fletcher on may.during the deposition,fletcher acknowledged four outstanding bar complaints against him.three of these related to assertions fletcher allegedly made to class representatives in a suit against.the fourth complaint involved allegations of bribery,assault and resisting arrest.
appointed counsel also mailed letters throughout the kansas city legal community in order to ascertain whether fletcher had acted improperly at other times in his career.her investigation uncovered numerous other instances of fletcher demeaning and abusive behavior while participating in depositions and mediation.for example,during the mediation with joseph health center of a case involving race discrimination and wrongful discharge,fletcher threatened to publicize confidential patient information that his client had illicitly photocopied.in another instance of professional misconduct,fletcher left threatening phone messages at the home and office of laura lesniewski,an architect with habitat for humanity.fletcher promised to seek sanctions and bring a lawsuit for lesniewski improper and unethical negotiations with billy duncan,his former client.such threats were hollow and improper because fletcher knew that lesniewski was not an attorney bound by the rules that regulate contact with represented parties.
as a final example,fletcher employed demeaning and inappropriate tactics during the deposition of steven cox,former police chief of the leawood police department.after cox had stated that he believed a prior incident of rape occurred sometime in,or,fletcher pursued the following line of questioning 
fletcher okay.so you can recall when you graduated high school,but you ca recall when one of your women employees was raped by another employee 
cox that correct.
fletcher all right.is that because the high school graduation had more significance to you than the rape of miss gibbs 
cox far as a personal milestone in my life,yes,probably so.
fletcher okay.and that is because your graduation from college had more significance to you than gibbs rape by an officer 
cox no,sir.
fletcher okay.why do you recall the date of miss gibbs rape 
cox those are also events that people traditionally associate with a year.
fletcher also,ironically,you remember the decade you graduated from high school,but you ca remember the decade miss gibbs was raped,correct 
fletcher later shifted gears in the deposition and began to threaten both the deponent and his attorney,rebecca yocum.
fletcher does she represent you in your you aware,sir,that there a cause of action filed against you personally 
cox no,sir.
yocum first of all,sir,that is a misstatement.there is no such action.
fletcher okay.are you aware that there an amended complaint in which you are cited specifically under section of the civil code 
yocum and you misstating the record.there is no amended complaint that has been allowed to be filed.
fletcher did she tell you that are you aware of that you can answer.
cox no,sir.
fletcher okay.so are you aware that if she representing you that you may have personal liability in this matter 
yocum fletcher,you misrepresenting the facts.cox has not been named as a defendant in this litigation,period.and i resent the fact that you misrepresenting things to him.
fletcher sir,have you been advised that there a lawsuit pending or a proposed amendment to the complaint which would potentially involve you personally in liability 
cox no,sir.
fletcher is that a fact that you would have liked to have been advised of 
yocum fletcher,you misstating facts to him.stop it.there is no litigation against chief chief cox in this litigation.
fletcher i do know why you are getting upset.i simply asking him questions 
yocum i am upset because you are lying,sir.you are lying to the man.if there some litigation pending 
fletcher you
