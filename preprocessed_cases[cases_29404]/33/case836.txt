original proceedings in mandate 
in this case,we examine the outer boundaries of the application of the substantial relationship test for vicarious disqualification of counsel.the superior court entered an order disqualifying petitioner counsel because the insurer counsel,which had a conflict of interest of which it was then unaware,covered a few depositions for cumis counsel.petitioner seeks a writ of mandate directing the superior court to vacate its disqualification order,contending the court overextended the rules of vicarious disqualification.we agree.in this context,the disqualification of cumis counsel would require a double imputation of knowledge of confidential from one member of the law firm representing the insurer to another member of that firm,and second from the latter attorney to a different law firm entirely.case law does not support the double imputation.we grant the petition.
sheila ames and others real parties in interest or real parties filed suit against jeffrey frazier petitioner in connection with his involvement in the willed body program at the university of california,irvine.altogether,petitioner was named as a defendant in approximately lawsuits concerning the program.most of the cases have been consolidated.
petitioner insurer hired murchison cumming to defend the matters.subsequently,the insurer decided to appoint cumis counsel.the insurer approved petitioner request for hartley hartley,petitioner general counsel,to act as cumis counsel.it also chose to continue using murchison cumming to represent its own interests.
murchison cumming attorney dan longo,whose office is in santa ana,was designated to represent the insurer.early on,attorney joseph hartley was unavailable to attend certain scheduled depositions on petitioner behalf.longo agreed to cover the depositions in question,which began in march.in april,longo informed hartley he had come to learn that,before they filed suit,the real parties in interest had contacted george genzmer,one of the partners in the los angeles office of murchison cumming,about possible representation.ultimately,real parties did not retain murchison cumming.nonetheless,some time after the firm realized what had happened,it withdrew from representation of the insurer.
real parties filed a motion to disqualify hartley hartley,based on their prior relationship with murchison cumming.they asserted there was a presumption that murchison cumming had divulged confidential information to hartley hartley.the trial court agreed and granted the motion.petitioner filed this petition,seeking a writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its order disqualifying hartley hartley.we issued an alternative writ of mandate and stayed discovery in this matter.
discussiona.procedural issues 
standard of review 
generally,a trial court decision on a disqualification motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion.citations.if the trial court resolved disputed factual issues,the reviewing court should not substitute its judgment for the trial court express or implied findings supported by substantial evidence.citations.when substantial evidence supports the trial court factual findings,the appellate court reviews the conclusions based on those findings for abuse of discretion.citation.however,the trial court discretion is limited by the applicable legal principles.citation.thus,where there are no material disputed factual issues,the appellate court reviews the trial court determination as a question of law.citation.in any event,a disqualification motion involves concerns that justify careful review of the trial court exercise of discretion.citation.people ex rel.of corporations speedee oil change systems,cal th,d,accord,adams aerojet general th,d.in this case,there are no material disputed factual issues,so we review the trial court determination as a question of law.
substantial relationship test 
the trial court stated that once murchison cumming undertook depositions on behalf of hartley hartley,the two firms were engaged in the joint defense of petitioner.because of that joint defense relationship,and the application of the substantial relationship test set forth in flatt superior court cal th,d,the court concluded hartley hartley was presumed to have access to the confidential information real parties had disclosed to murchison cumming.due to that presumption,the court determined disqualification of hartley hartley was required.real parties assert the court correctly applied the substantial relationship test and,therefore,the petition should be denied.
successive representation 
the substantial relationship test was summarized in flatt superior court,supra,cal th at,d,as follows where the potential conflict is one that arises from the successive representation of clients with potentially adverse interests,the courts have recognized that the chief fiduciary value jeopardized is that of client confidentiality.thus,where a former client seeks to have a previous attorney disqualified from serving as counsel to a successive client in litigation adverse to the interests of the first client,the governing test requires that the client demonstrate a substantial relationship between the subjects of the antecedent and current representations.the substantial relationship test mediates between two interests that are in tension in such a freedom of the subsequent client to counsel of choice,on the one hand,and the interest of the former client in ensuring the permanent confidentiality of matters disclosed to the attorney in the course of the prior representation,on the other.where the requisite substantial relationship between the subjects of the prior and the current representations can be demonstrated,access to confidential information by the attorney in the course of the first representation relevant,by definition,to the second representation is presumed and disqualification of the attorney representation of the second client is mandatory indeed,the disqualification extends vicariously to the entire firm.citations.see also rosenfeld construction superior court d.ahmanson salomon brothers,d.
applied to the case before us,real parties argue it is clear murchison cumming would have been disqualified from representing petitioner.there was not merely a substantial relationship between the potential lawsuit with respect to which real parties consulted genzmer and the ensuing lawsuit with respect to which longo attended depositions,they were essentially one and the same.because of this,genzmer knowledge should have been imputed to all members of the firm,including longo.
as explained in rosenfeld construction superior court,supra,d at.rule of the state bar rules of professional conduct provides for the avoidance of representation of adverse interests.footnote omitted.it has long been recognized that knowledge obtained by one member of a firm of lawyers is imputed to all the other members.the imputed knowledge theory holds that knowledge by any member of a law firm is knowledge by all of the attorneys in the firm,partners as well as associates.citation.genzmer knowledge thus tainted all murchison cumming lawyers.as real parties view it,that taint seeped over to hartley hartley as well.
real parties fail to recognize that they are seeking an extension of the law.as explained in flatt superior court,supra,cal th at,d,the substantial relationship test applies in the context of successive representation.it is most commonly employed to determine whether an attorney and the various members of his or her firm are barred from undertaking the successive representation of clients with potentially adverse interests.here,it would typically be applied to ascertain whether longo could represent petitioner,assuming genzmer had an relationship with real parties.see people ex rel.of corporations speedee oil change systems,supra,cal th at,d,relationship established by lawyer consultation with prospective client,even though actual retention of the lawyer does not result.in other words,under the usual application of the substantial relationship test,the disqualification of longo would be at issue,not hartley hartley.hartley hartley never represented real parties and there is no successive representation issue as to that firm.
to be sure,the substantial relationship test has been applied in different contexts as well.for example,when an attorney who actively represents one party in litigation moves to another law firm that represents the opposing party in the same matter,the attorney and his or her new firm will both be disqualified.see,henriksen great american savings loan th,d dill superior court d.the knowledge of that one attorney with confidential information is imputed to his or her new firm.notice,however,that it is imputed only once,from the attorney with the confidential information,to the remainder of his or her firm.see also people ex rel.of corporations speedee oil change systems,supra,cal th at,d,when litigant representatives consult with attorney who is of counsel to law firm representing adversary,attorney knowledge imputed to entire firm with which he is associated klein superior court d.plaintiff law firm disqualified when one of its partners,while a member of a different firm,acquired confidential information concerning defendant.
double imputation 
what real parties seek is a double imputation.they ask this court to impute genzmer knowledge first to longo,and second from longo to a different law firm entirely.this is just because longo,the insurer counsel who had every right to attend the depositions on behalf of the insurer,subd.f,agreed to cover the depositions for the insured counsel.but real parties cite no california case casting the shadow of taint this far.
other jurisdictions have erected barriers against the continuing spread of this penumbra of disqualification.two cases in particular provide persuasive authority in this matter,american can company citrus feed cir and panduit all states plastic,disapproved on another ground in,koller,d.in american can company citrus feed,supra,a law firm representing the plaintiff associated local counsel,who was a member of the law firm that previously had represented some of the defendants.despite the association,the law firm representing the plaintiff was not disqualified.the court declined to reimpute knowledge of confidential information from the particular attorney who previously had represented certain of the defendants,to all of the attorneys in his law firm,including the attorney who served as local counsel to the plaintiff,and then from local counsel to the law firm that associated him.the court determined disqualification was unnecessary.indeed,resort to so drastic a measure would not only be unwise,but would also set disturbing precedent.if the defendants rationale were accepted,imputation and consequent disqualification could continue ad infinitum.id.at.
the court in panduit all states plastic,supra,followed suit.in that case,an attorney from the law firm representing the plaintiff formed a new law firm,which later merged with the law firm representing the defendant.the law firm was not disqualified.there was no reimputation of knowledge of confidential information first from the attorney handling the plaintiff matter to the attorney who formed the new firm,and second from the latter attorney to the law firm.providing alternative theories for its holding,the court cited american can company citrus feed,supra,with approval and noted that courts have refrained from endorsing a double imputation theory.panduit all states plastic,supra,at,fn.
we agree with this approach.to reimpute knowledge from longo to hartley hartley would be to go too far.the primary concern is whether and to what extent the attorney acquired confidential information.citation.people ex rel.of corporations speedee oil change systems,supra,cal th at,d.in this case,the attorney who acquired the confidential information was genzmer,not longo and not hartley hartley.the extent of the knowledge of longo and hartley was described in their respective declarations,filed together with petitioner opposition to the motion for disqualification.
longo informed the court that he was a partner in the law firm of murchison cumming,working at the firm santa ana office.he further declared that a couple of months after he learned hartley hartley had been asked to serve as cumis counsel,he found out that certain of real parties had consulted george genzmer,a partner in our firm los angeles office,about this matter.i have never been informed of the nature of what they said,nor have i reviewed the file,or asked to review the file,or asked about the nature of the consultation.longo also stated that he and hartley had never discussed anything of substance on this case because hartley was extremely busy preparing another case for trial hartley was handling the pleadings in the case,but we had not had a chance to confer on them before the conflict issue arose.he further stated n either hartley and i nor any member of his law firm discussed the content of the communications between the real parties who consulted with genzmer i do not know what those individuals said because i have not asked and have not been told.
hartley declaration was similar.he stated that in february,when the insurer asked him to step in as cumis counsel,he was busy preparing his cocounsel for a trial in another matter,and was barely able to take on any additional work.hartley also stated longo agreed to cover the depositions in this case while i finished preparing for the other trial.aside from or conversations with longo about scheduling matters,i simply did not have the time to discuss anything substantive with him.he continued sometime in april,longo advised me that george genzmer,one of the partners in the los angeles office of murchison cumming,had been contacted before this litigation began by real parties.he did not tell me any of the details of the work that genzmer performed,if indeed he performed any work,and told me nothing of the dispute between the real parties.i did not,nor would i,ask him about the nature of the communications between the real parties and genzmer.nor have i discussed or even requested information from anyone else at the murchison firm concerning the communications between genzmer and the real parties who consulted him.
real parties make no suggestion that these declarations are in any way inaccurate or that either longo or hartley had any actual information concerning the communications between real parties and genzmer.nonetheless,they urge that the simple fact longo,unaware of real parties contacts with genzmer,covered a few depositions tainted the entire hartley hartley firm.it is as though longo passed to hartley hartley a hypothetical infection caught from other attorneys at murchison cumming.klein superior court,supra,d at.this is one bridge too far.
normally imparted test 
current thinking on the breadth of application of the substantial relationship test in california is expressed in adams,supra,th,d.in that case,law firm represented the defendant.a partner in that firm,who had performed no work for the defendant,moved to law firm.once there,that attorney represented the plaintiffs on substantially related litigation.the court held that the attorney was not necessarily disqualified.id.at,d.it stressed that b oth rule e of the state bar rules of professional conduct and business and professions code section presuppose that confidences are acquired by individual attorneys,not by law firms in general.id.at,d.the court concluded that disqualification should not be ordered where there is no reasonable probability the attorney had access to confidential information while at his or her former firm that is related to the current representation.id.at,d.
the adams court enunciated this standard w here there is a substantial relationship between the current case and the matters handled by the attorney former firm,but the attorney did not personally represent the former client who now seeks to remove him from the case,the trial court should apply a modified version of the substantial relationship test citation.the court task,under these circumstances,is to determine whether confidential information material to the current representation would normally
