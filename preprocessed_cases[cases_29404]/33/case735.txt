plaintiffs brought an employment discrimination and wrongful termination lawsuit against three corporations and one individual.the defendants moved to disqualify the law firm representing the plaintiffs because that firm hired an attorney who previously worked at the law firm that represented the defendants.applying the modified substantial relationship test,the superior court found that the targeted attorney had carried his burden of proving that confidential information material to the plaintiffs lawsuit was not imparted to him.accordingly,the superior court denied the motion.
two defendants appeal,claiming the superior court findings of fact were not supported by substantial evidence,the superior court failed to consider and analyze material facts,the superior court committed legal error in analyzing the attorney opportunity for acquiring confidential information while at his former law firm,and the superior court erroneously denied their request to depose the attorney.
we conclude the superior court findings are supported by substantial evidence the superior court correctly ruled that the modified substantial relationship test,when met,shifts the burden to the targeted attorney to prove that he or she was not exposed to material confidential information not prove that he or she had no opportunity to acquire confidential information,and the superior court did not otherwise abuse its discretion.therefore,the order denying the motion to disqualify is affirmed.
facts and proceedings 
the second amended complaint of plaintiffs pedro garcia ochoa and agustin ochoa alleges that they were employed by defendants ridgeback ranch,ridgeback,fordel,fordel,peak harvesting,peak harvesting,from the late until their employment was terminated in may.the second amended complaint alleges age discrimination,disability discrimination,wrongful termination in violation of public policy,violations of provisions of the labor code,and violations of business and professions code section.
plaintiffs alleged that ridgeback,fordel,and peak harvesting are california corporations that do business in fresno county.plaintiffs alleged that defendant randall johnston was an employee as well as a shareholder,owner,managing agent of the three corporate defendants.they further alleged that johnston was their direct supervisor.
ridgeback and johnston filed a motion to disqualify attorney shelley bryant and the law firm of smith associates smith from representing plaintiffs in this case on june.declarations in support of the motion set forth the following facts.
ridgeback and johnston retained the law firm of jory,peterson,watkins,ross woolman jory peterson to defend them in this case soon after they were served with the complaint in january.bryant was an associate of the jory peterson firm at that time.from january through may,bryant was a shareholder in that firm.
in april,bryant informed jory peterson that he would resign his employment and shareholder status effective may,and would become associated with smith.bryant subsequently told john peterson of that firm he would begin work at smith immediately after his departure from jory peterson.
on may and may,john peterson sent letters to smith requesting it withdraw from representing plaintiffs in light of bryant new association with smith.smith refused to withdraw.subsequently,ridgeback and johnston informed john peterson that they would not waive the conflict and wished to file a motion to disqualify the smith firm.
john peterson is the attorney at jory peterson who is primarily responsible for representing ridgeback and johnston in this case.he is assisted by jason parkin.jory peterson billing records do not contain any entries showing bryant worked on this case.
jason parkin office was adjacent to bryant office most of the time that bryant was at jory peterson.parkin would regularly discuss issues and strategies with bryant.he remembered two occasions when he had discussions with bryant regarding issues and strategies relating to the present litigation.also,bryant had access to all computerized records maintained by the firm.
parkin performed an audit of the jory peterson software system used to manage documents created on the firm network.the audit showed that bryant gained computer access to six documents created in connection with this litigation.the documents were a declaration in support of a motion to compel,a memorandum of points and authorities in support of a motion to compel,a draft proposed order regarding a motion to compel,a notice of motion and motion to strike the complaint,a request for production of documents,and correspondence from jory peterson to the california department of fair employment and housing dfeh regarding complaints filed by plaintiffs with the dfeh.the audit also showed the dates that bryant accessed the documents.for example,he viewed the correspondence to the dfeh on november.
parkin also described monday luncheon meetings attended by attorneys and paralegals at jory peterson.at these meetings,various topics were discussed,including new litigation matters in which the firm had been retained as well as issues and strategies in pending cases.parkin routinely attended the meetings and stated that d uring his employment at jory,peterson,bryant attended nearly all of these luncheon meetings.jason parkin also asserted i recall discussing various issues and strategies regarding the present matter at one or more of the luncheon meetings.i have no specific recollection as to whether bryant was present at the particular meetings during which issues regarding the present matter were discussed,but i believe that he was present.
fordel and peak harvesting filed a notice of joinder in the motion to disqualify on august.the joinder in the motion was supported by a declaration of their attorney,russell vanrozeboom.the declaration asserted that on june,the law firm of caswell bell hillison llp began to represent fordel and peak harvesting in connection with the claims made by plaintiff pedro garcia ochoa and that prior to june,the entities were represented by jory peterson.based on his review of the files maintained by jory peterson,russell vanrozeboom stated that jory,peterson representation of fordel and peak harvesting dates back to claims filed by pedro garcia ochoa with the labor commissioner in or about june.
consequently,it appears that fordel and peak harvesting were represented by jory peterson while bryant worked at that firm and remained clients until about six weeks after bryant switched firms.
on august,plaintiffs filed their opposition to the motion to disqualify along with supporting declarations from william smith and bryant.bryant declaration asserts the following facts.while employed at the jory peterson,bryant did not represent any of the four defendants in this matter and did no work on the pedro garcia ochoa case or the agustin ochoa case.he did not look at any part of the files for these cases that were maintained in jory peterson file room.since beginning work at smith,bryant has done no work on the plaintiffs cases,except for preparing his declaration.
with respect to the six documents that the audit of the computer software showed bryant viewed while working at jory peterson,bryant asserts that the documents did not contain confidential information.in particular,he viewed three of the documents after they had been filed with the court,the request for production of documents after it had been served on the plaintiffs,and the correspondence with the dfeh three months after it had been sent to the dfeh.also,he asserts that,as a custom and practice,jory peterson never included confidential client information or confidential strategy in proposed orders,documents filed with the court,documents served on opposing parties,or correspondence sent to the dfeh 
bryant declaration contradicts the statements in parkin declaration regarding discussions about plaintiffs cases.bryant stated that he never discussed the facts of plaintiffs cases or any legal strategy of those cases with anyone.attorney bryant described his discussions with parkin as follows on one occasion,parkin and i discussed whether a court has authority to issue an order granting a plaintiff permission to file a new complaint following a successful attack on the pleadings,which raised a statute of limitations defense.we did not discuss the facts of plaintiffs cases or anything other than this generic legal question.i told parkin that i did not know whether the court had such authority.i also told him that he should research the issue before making a big deal of it to avoid wasting time.i do not know whether he researched the issue or made any arguments in court regarding this point.
paragraph of bryant declaration addressed the monday lunch meetings at the jory peterson i have never discussed the facts or legal strategies or issues of plaintiffs cases with anyone.i did not discuss plaintiffs cases with anyone during any monday lunch meeting at jory peterson as mentioned in the declarations of peterson and parkin.further,i do not recall anyone else discussing plaintiffs cases during any of the monday lunch meetings that i attended at jory peterson.therefore,as i did not attend every monday lunch meeting at jory peterson,i must conclude that i was not present at the meeting s where peterson and parkin claim that they might have discussed plaintiffs cases.
the declarations of william smith and bryant addressed how the smith firm kept bryant insulated from plaintiffs cases since he was hired by the firm.
on september,the motion to disqualify was argued before the superior court.parkin appeared on behalf of moving parties ridgeback,and johnston.russell vanrozeboom appeared on behalf of fordel and peak harvesting,william smith appeared on behalf of plaintiffs.
towards the end of the hearing,the superior court expressed a concern about the relationship between access to confidential information and acquiring confidential information because bryant had access to confidential information but did not acquire any.
also during the hearing,the attorney for fordel and peak harvesting requested that he be allowed to take the deposition of bryant in the event the motion to disqualify was denied and stated we want that opportunity to bryant about his declaration and to make a record of that for the court to review before it makes a final decision.
in an written order filed september,the superior court discussed in detail the declarations submitted by the parties,applied the modified substantial relationship test,and concluded the test was not satisfied.thus,the superior court refused to disqualify bryant or smith and denied the motion.the request to depose bryant also was denied.
on november,fordel and peak harvesting filed a notice of appeal relating to the order denying the motion to disqualify opposing counsel.
on february,we received a letter from smith advising that ridgeback had filed a chapter bankruptcy petition and requesting a stay of all proceedings.attached to the letter was a notice from the united states bankruptcy court for the eastern district of california relating to ridgeback ranch,case.on march,we filed an order that denied without prejudice the request to stay this appeal and stated respondents have failed to show how defendant ridgeback ranch bankruptcy action affects this appeal 
discussion 
iii.standard of review for motions to disqualify counsel 
a superior court decision on a motion to disqualify counsel is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.rosenfeld construction superior court d.rosenfeld.if the trial court resolved disputed factual issues,the reviewing court should not substitute its judgment for the trial court express or implied findings supported by substantial evidence.citations.when substantial evidence supports the trial court factual findings,the appellate court reviews the conclusions based on those findings for abuse of discretion.citation.however,the trial court discretion is limited by the applicable legal principles.citation.thus,where there are no material disputed factual issues,the appellate court reviews the trial court determination as a question of law.citation.in any event,a disqualification motion involves concerns that justify careful review of the trial court exercise of discretion.citation.people ex rel.of corporations speedee oil change systems,cal th,d,speedee oil.
as we recognized in rosenfeld,t he resolution of factual issues arising from competing declarations is conclusive on the reviewing court,and conflicts in the declarations are resolved in favor of the prevailing party.citations.rosenfeld,supra,d at.in contrast,where the declarations submitted reveal no disputed material facts,an appellate court need not defer to the inferences drawn by the trial court in resolving factual disputes for which the parties did not submit direct evidence.speedee oil,supra,cal th at,d,collins state of california th,d.in such a situation,the appellate court is concerned with the legal significance of the undisputed facts in the record and reviews the trial court decision as a question of law.speedee oil,supra,at,d.
iv.disqualifying counsel to protect confidential information 
restriction on representing adverse interests 
california rules of professional conduct,rule e provides that an attorney may not,without the informed written consent of the client or former client,accept employment adverse to the client or former client where,by reason of the representation of the client or former client,the member has obtained confidential information material to the employment.
modified substantial relationship test 
courts must apply rule e to a wide variety of situations.as a result,a number of rules have been created by the judiciary.we need not discuss the judicially created rules in detail because the superior court and the parties agree that the situation presented in this case is governed by the modified version of the substantial relationship test.see adams th,d adams first published decision to refer to the modified version of the substantial relationship test vapnek et,cal.practice guide professional responsibility the rutter group,discussing the modified version of the substantial relationship test.
furthermore,we independently conclude that the modified substantial relationship test applies because this case involves no proof that the attorney actually obtained confidential information during the course of the prior relationship the successive representation of clients with adverse interests and a attorney whose prior relationship with the moving party was peripheral or attenuated.adams,supra,th at,d jessen hartford casualty ins.th,d jessen see vapnek et,cal.practice guide professional responsibility,supra,to,to disqualification of attorneys.
under the modified substantial relationship test,a presumption that the attorney knows confidential information applies only where the moving party the client of the attorney former law firm makes an adequate showing that the attorney was in a position the client to likely have acquired confidential information material to the current representation.jessen,supra,th at,d.in adams,the court described the inquiry as whether the attorney was reasonably likely to have obtained confidential information.adams,supra,th at,d.
the superior court relied on adams for the proposition that three factors are considered in applying the test factual similarities between the two representations,similarities in legal issues,and the nature and extent of the attorney involvement with the case and whether he was in a position to learn of the client policy or strategy.adams,supra,th at,d.
the superior court determined that the first two factors were met because the same litigation was pending between the parties during bryant association with jory peterson and smith.based on this determination,the superior court considered the question whether confidential information material to the current representation would normally have been imparted to bryant during his relationship at the jory peterson office.in analyzing this question,the superior court stated it would focus on the relationship,if any,between bryant and the defendants herein,any time spent by bryant working on behalf of defendants and his possible exposur
