in the novel the victim of the rape is diana johnson.diana is described as devoted to her job,community,family,and friends.her afternoons and evenings were filled with ongoing community outreach programs,one of which was devised by her.the project she created involved children and the elderly working together in a vegetable garden.at the time of the rape,diana was intoxicated from alcohol.l ab reports revealed that the only intoxicating agent present in her system was alcohol,which was found at,extremely high levels.danner concludes that diana is an alcoholic in denial about her alcoholism.
the defendant in the novel is ernesto cantera,described as having a bloated face,a protruding belly,and filthy hands.talk about felony ugly,danner thought,he looks just like the pig he is felony ugly,the author notes,is a n expression used by some prosecutors to describe a defendant who fits the stereotype of a perpetrator of the crime for which he is charged.danner was saddened especially because cantera turned out to be so despicable.this dirt bag really did a number on her diana.danner said to herself,i get you,you heartless bastard for diana sake and for all the others who could follow.but if i try and do succeed,then all he learn is that he can get away with victimizing woman sic.i ca try this one unless i can win it.

recusal motion 
in his recusal motion,petitioner alleged dudley book contains a lengthy fictional account of a rape by intoxicating agent.just like petitioner trial,the deputy arranged for the fictional trial to begin in april.these and other coincidences lead petitioner to fear that the lines between fact an d fiction have been obscured by the publication of the book,and that the district attorney obligation to exercise discretion and seek justice impartially is now compromised by her financial and emotional interests in promoting her book.
in support of the recusal motion,petitioner counsel declared that,in her novel,dudley had incorporated facts of the real district attorney investigation of petitioner case arty lang shares many attributes of petitioner.arty lang is a photographer.citation.petitioner is a photographer.arty is described as a.citation.petitioner,who weighs pounds and is,is thin.he has black hair.he has facial hair in a style called a soul patch,a style associated with beatniks.

petitioner counsel further declared,from the first time he talked to dudley about this case,she said it would not settle.she refused to enter into any settlement negotiations and has summarily informed the court that the case will go to trial.
