ernest charles downs is a prisoner on florida death row.after exhausting his opportunities for state court review,he turned to the federal courts on december,filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to.the district court dismissed the petition as untimely because it was filed eight days beyond the limitations period provided by d.
regardless whether the petition was timely,downs contends he is entitled to equitable tolling because of egregious conduct by his counsel throughout his postconviction proceedings.in the alternative,downs argues on appeal that he is entitled to a hearing on the merits of his petition because he has made a colorable showing that he is actually innocent of a capital offense.we conclude the facts he has alleged,if true,would entitle him to equitable tolling for a period equalling,at a minimum,the eight days by which he missed the statutory limitations period.therefore,we vacate the district court dismissal of the petition and remand for an evidentiary hearing on the facts underlying downs request for equitable tolling.
facts and procedural history 
conviction and early 
following a jury trial,downs was convicted of first degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the contract killing of forest jerry harris in.he was sentenced to death.
in,the florida supreme court reversed downs sentence after determining he had been prevented from presenting evidence at sentencing that he had not shot the victim.during resentencing proceedings,downs and other witnesses testified another conspirator had fired the fatal shots.the jury voted eight to four to recommend a capital sentence,and the trial judge reimposed the death penalty.in september,the florida supreme court affirmed downs sentence.
florida capital collateral regional counsel ccrc is an entity created by the florida legislature to provide representation to indigent death row inmates.see sec y of dep t of,cir citing.stat.in,ccrc attorneys in tallahassee,florida began representing downs.
ccrc operates from several independent regional offices,see.stat.downs attorneys worked in the northern office.during the years represented downs,at least seven attorneys worked on downs case 
later postconviction 
in,downs counsel filed a state postconviction motion under,challenging downs capital sentence on numerous grounds,including the withholding of exculpatory evidence and the ineffectiveness of both his trial and resentencing counsel.the postconviction motion remained pending for five years.when the motion was denied in,downs appealed.the florida supreme court affirmed the denial of his postconviction motion on may,downs state,so d,and issued its mandate on october.
while downs postconviction motion was pending,the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa took effect,establishing a limitations period for state prisoners to seek federal habeas corpus review.d.aware of the limitations period imposed by aedpa and eager to safeguard his right to federal review,downs contacted immediately after the florida supreme court denied the appeal of his postconviction motion.in a letter dated may,downs asked his counsel to petition for rehearing on the denial of his rule motion prepare a state habeas petition the next step in florida postconviction review process and file a petition in federal court asking that his case be held in abeyance pending disposition of the state writ.the following week,downs sent a second letter to counsel,providing a detailed explanation of the history of his case and requesting a visit from counsel to discuss the contents of his postconviction motions.four months passed with no response from counsel.
finally,on september,a attorney responded to downs letter.the attorney apologized for his delayed response,explaining,i find myself interrupted by an emergency every time i try to work on your affidavits or consider our next move and your ideas o nce again,i write to inform you there will be delay before i can return my attention to your case.
approximately one month later,on october,the florida supreme court issued its mandate denying downs postconviction motion,and downs federal habeas limitations period began to run.
seven months later,on may,downs attorneys sent a letter asking downs to review a draft of a proposed state habeas petition,and sometime later that summer,a attorney told downs the state habeas petition had been act that would have tolled the federal habeas limitations period while simultaneously providing downs with additional state court review.see d providing that time when properly filed application for relief is pending in state court shall not be counted toward limitations period.however,the lawyer representation was a lie no state petition had been filed.
on september,six weeks before his federal limitations period was scheduled to expire,downs sent letters to two of his attorneys.in the first,he wrote 
i do know if i misunderstood you or what,but when we talked about a month ago,i was left with the impression that my state writ had been filed,and now i find out it not.you said a legal call would be easy to do.so how about setting one up so we can talk.i want to know what going on.
in the letter to his second attorney,downs wrote 
i was told back in may that my state writ was done and ready for filing n ow i find out that my state writ has even been filed.i want to know what going on you said yourself that my one year to be in federal court is up next month.so why all this time with nothing in state,especially when i thought i was already in state court 
counsel did not respond to downs demand for explanation and did not file either a state or federal habeas petition for more than one month.
at long last,on october,day of downs federal limitations filed a state habeas corpus petition,thereby temporarily tolling what little remained of downs federal habeas deadline.several weeks later,downs lead counsel resigned.a new attorney was appointed to handle downs case,but he too resigned one month after being assigned to the case.
under florida law,an attorney may not serve as lead counsel representing a capital litigant unless he or she is a member in good standing of the florida bar,with not less than years experience in the practice of criminal law,and ha s participated in at least five felony jury trials,five felony appeals,or five capital postconviction evidentiary hearings or any combination of at least five of such proceedings.stat.when downs second lawyer resigned in november,no other attorneys at office were qualified to handle downs case although remained downs counsel of record.the office obtained a continuance in downs case which remained in place from november until june,when new counsel was finally hired and assigned to the case.
while the state habeas petition remained pending,downs took additional steps to insure his lawyers would preserve his right to federal review.on june,downs wrote his counsel directing them to waste no time in filing either a state writ of coram nobis or a federal habeas petition 
let not take any chances a fter the present writ is argued,i want you to either file what was discussed in state court the writ of coram nobis or go ahead and initiate my federal appeal and then move to have it stayed while we return to state court.
counsel responded with a promise to be up the first full week in september with a draft.
although downs did not have access to any of his legal papers since they were in his attorneys possession,downs prepared for his meeting with counsel by drafting a pro se habeas petition listing the issues he wished to raise in federal court,to compare to the draft his lawyers had promised to bring him.however,when counsel arrived to meet with downs on september,they did not bring a draft of any state writ or federal petition.downs gave them a copy of the petition he had drafted himself.
later that day,a frustrated downs wrote to counsel with the following directive 
if you not going to protect my right to a federal appeal by filing what you said you would in state court and it pretty clear that you not going to,then i want you to go ahead and file my federal appeal.you said yourself today,that because a former attorney waited one year to file my state writ,that i have to be in federal court no later than the day the pending writ is denied.so no more waiting.go ahead and file my federal appeal.
counsel responded by letter on september,noting downs temperate yet firm rebuke.the response did not indicate,however,whether counsel had taken action as directed.
wishing to confirm counsel had filed the petition as he had directed,the following week downs spoke with an investigator from who was visiting the prison where downs was incarcerated.the investigator was unable to provide information regarding the status of downs habeas petition.
downs alleges that his lead attorney was abusing alcohol and living out of his car during the time he represented downs.concerned counsel alcoholism was delaying the filing of his habeas petition,downs wrote to another attorney working on his case 
i saw an investigator from your office last tuesday i tried talking to him about the status of my federal appeal,but he said attorney harry brody would have to respond to legal matters.every time i seen brody it ob v ious that he has been drinking.his condition was so bad this last visit that he damn near fell out of his chair in all candor,his condition concerns me greatly.
does brody understand the importance of protecting my right to federal review i keep telling him to initiate federal action now instead of waiting to see if the writ is denied by the florida supreme court.he keeps saying that if the state writ is denied,there will be a petition for rehearing followed by a mandate.but what if the court denies the writ and says no rehearing will be entertained.then what he needs to understand that my federal appeal needs to be initiated now,instead of waiting.
on september,the florida supreme court denied downs state habeas corpus petition,downs moore,so d,and on october,downs counsel filed a motion for rehearing.on november,without explanation,counsel returned downs draft habeas petition,stating simply,i am returning your petition.counsel did not indicate whether a formal habeas petition had been filed,but downs could have reasonably inferred from the return of his pro se petition that counsel either had filed the petition as directed,or was prepared to do so on the day the florida supreme court denied the pending petition for rehearing.
one month later,on december,the florida supreme court denied the motion for rehearing.downs attorneys did not file his federal habeas corpus petition until nine days later,on december.shortly thereafter,downs fired his counsel,and proceeded pro se in the district court.
federal habeas petition 
in his federal habeas petition,downs raised grounds for relief,including claims that his trial and appellate counsel were ineffective and that the state withheld exculpatory evidence from him in violation of brady maryland,d.at downs request,the district court stayed the petition for several years to allow downs to exhaust an ineffectiveness claim in state court.
in,the case was reopened,and on october,the district court dismissed the petition as untimely.the court found downs federal limitations period had expired october,one day before his attorneys filed the state habeas corpus petition.the district court held in the alternative that even if the state habeas corpus petition had been timely filed,downs federal habeas petition was nevertheless untimely because it was filed nine days after the state petition was denied on rehearing.
downs argued he was entitled to equitable tolling because,although he was diligent in pursuing his case,his attorneys repeated unresponsiveness and misrepresentations were beyond his control.the district court did not hold an evidentiary hearing and made no findings of fact with respect to downs allegations.instead,citing circuit precedent holding that mere attorney negligence is not sufficient to warrant equitable tolling,the district court concluded that downs was bound by his attorney error even though he did not acquiesce in counsel conduct.
in the opinion dismissing downs petition,the district court noted downs allegation that his attorney was ineffective for failing to adduce evidence that downs had not shot harris.acknowledging the allegations could be read as a claim downs was innocent of any capital offense,the district court ultimately concluded downs did not intend to raise an actual innocence claim.nonetheless,the court held downs had failed to present any new evidence or allege any facts which would support such a claim.
on appeal,this court granted a certificate of appealability,limited to the following issues 
whether attorney misconduct going beyond mere negligence can be an extraordinary circumstance warranting equitable tolling of the limitations period in d.see united states martin,cir stating that serious attorney misconduct,as opposed to mere negligence,may warrant equitable tolling baldayaque united states,cir spitsyn moore,cir united states wynn,cir nara frank,cir,abrogated in part by carey saffold,d.
assuming attorney misconduct going beyond mere negligence can be an extraordinary circumstance warranting equitable tolling,whether petitioner would be entitled to equitable tolling under the facts of this case.
whether the petition should be reviewed on the merits because of petitioner claim of alleged actual innocence.see house bell,d schlup delo,d sibley culliver,cir.
ii.discussion 
ordinarily,when a state prisoner conviction becomes final following the termination of his direct appeal,he has one year in which to file a federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus.d.that time is tolled by statute whenever a properly filed motion for state postconviction relief is pending.d.
we granted a coa to decide whether downs is entitled to equitable tolling of his limitations period.equitable tolling is an extraordinary remedy,however,and courts may permit its use only when other methods of tolling are unavailable.justice united states,cir it is a longstanding maxim of law that relief in equity generally is inappropriate when the moving party has an adequate remedy at law.therefore,the first question we must answer is whether statutory tolling alone makes downs petition timely.
statutory tolling 
downs federal limitations period began to run october,the day the florida supreme court issued its mandate denying his second motion for postconviction relief under.see d nyland moore,cir holding that motion remains pending until mandate issues.the district court interpreted d rule to mean the limitations period expired october,days after the mandate issued.although that calculation appears to comply with the statutory directive limiting the limitations period to one year,this court has suggested that the limitations period should be calculated according to the anniversary method,under which the limitations period expires on the anniversary of the date it began to run.ferreira sec y,dep t of,cir noting that limitations period should be calculated using the anniversary date of the triggering event accord united states hurst,cir united states marcello,cir.applying the anniversary method to this case means downs limitations period would have expired october,october,as the district court held.we emphasize the period would have expired because the filing of downs state habeas petition tolled the limitations period during the pendency of that petition.see d.
although the district court erred in finding downs petition was filed one year and eight days after his habeas limitations period expired,the court did not err in finding the petition untimely.as downs all but concedes because his attorneys waited until the eleventh hour to file his state habeas petition,he was required to file his federal habeas petition on december,the next business day following the florida supreme court denial of his petition for rehearing.see.a excludes from computation the day of the act,event,or default that begins the period.instead,the petition was filed december,eight days after the federal limitations period expired.
equitable tolling 
because downs petition was untimely filed,the district court could not consider it unless eight or more days of the federal limitations period were to be equitably tolled.concluding that this circuit precedent barred the application of equitable tolling under the circumstances of this case,the district court dismissed the petition.we review that decision de novo.helton sec y for dep t of,cir.
equitable tolling is a remedy that must be used sparingly,steed head,cir that is,in extreme cases where failure to invoke the principles of equity would lead to unacceptably unjust outcomes,see,justice,at citing david doran,comment,equitable tolling of statutory benefit time limitations a congressional intent analysis,equitable tolling,like all equitable remedies,emerged as the equity courts response to injustices resulting from decisions of the law courts in cases involving inequitable conduct.our precedents establish that equitable tolling of the limitations period is warranted when a movant untimely files because of extraordinary circumstances that are both beyond his control and unavoidable even with diligence.steed,at internal quotation marks omitted.
this court has used equitable tolling to extend the federal limitations period for prisoners seeking federal review of their state convictions on at least two prior occasions.in both cases,however,the petitioners untimely filing was caused by erroneous information supplied to them by state by egregious attorney misconduct.spottsville terry,cir knight schofield,cir.on many occasions,we have explained that m ere attorney negligence will not justify equitable tolling,steed,at,a point which the supreme court recently affirmed in lawrence florida,d.
seven of our fellow circuits have confronted whether attorney misconduct going beyond mere negligence may ever constitute an extraordinary circumstance warranting equitable tolling.although the severity of misconduct addressed by each circuit has varied greatly,the courts of appeals for the second,third,fifth,ninth,and tenth circuits have concluded that some forms of serious attorney misconduct may entitle a habeas petitioner to equitable tolling of the federal limitations period.the court of appeals for the seventh circuit disagrees until now,this circuit has not been faced with the issue.
the court of appeals for the seventh circuit has adopted a approach to requests for equitable tolling premised on the misconduct of a petitioner attorney.applying agency principles,the circuit holds that an attorney actions are always attributable to the client in the context of postconviction proceedings.see powell davis,cir modrowski mote,cir.the seventh circuit has recognized only one exception to the agency rule and that is the constitutional right to counsel which arises in the context of direct criminal proceedings.see johnson mcbride,cir.because petitioners have no constitutional right to counsel in federal postconviction proceedings,coleman thompson,d,the seventh circuit has held the severity of attorney misconduct in habeas proceedings is irrelevant for purposes of equitable tolling.no level of attorney misconduct can ever warrant equitable tolling because all acts of malfeasance are attributed directly to the petitioner.powell,at a ttorney misconduct,whether labeled negligent,grossly negligent,or willful,is attributable to the client.
respondents urge this court to follow the lead of the seventh circuit by holding that a client is always bound by the mistakes of his attorney,regardless how extreme or far afield from the client directives those actions may be.the approach has its merits.not only is it easy to administer,but it recognizes the important distinction between criminal proceedings in which the right to counsel is fundamental and essential,gideon wainwright,d,and postconviction proceedings,in which the provision of counsel is a matter of legislative grace moreover,the your lawyer,your fault approach is consistent with the general principle that lawyers are agents,and clients must be held accountable for the acts and omissions of their attorneys.pioneer inv.serv.brunswick,d.
the supreme court itself has invoked agency principles to hold a habeas petitioner to his lawyer error,albeit in a different context.in coleman,at.at,counsel for habeas petitioner roger coleman filed an untimely appeal in state court,thereby depriving the state courts of an opportunity to consider many of coleman federal claims on postconviction review.after his unexhausted claims were dismissed as procedurally defaulted,coleman appealed,contending his lawyer negligence constituted cause for reinstating the claims under the cause and prejudice test.id.at.at.resting its decision on concerns about federalism,the supreme court disagreed.id.the court noted defendants have no constitutional right to postconviction counsel,and therefore no means of imputing their counsel errors to the state therefore,a ttorney ignorance or inadvertence is not cause because the attorney is the petitioner agent when acting,or failing to act,in furtherance of the litigation,and the petitioner must bear the risk of attorney error.id.at.at quoting murray carrier,d.
although coleman arose in a different procedural posture and implicated federalism concerns not at issue in this case,it is instructive insofar as it makes the we do not an attorney ordinary negligence may be attributed to the client under general principles of agency.what coleman does not address,however,is whether agency theory bars relief when a habeas petitioner who has fairly presented his federal claims to the state court invokes equitable tolling based on the egregious misconduct of postconviction counsel.
although the seventh circuit decision in powell suggests the agency rule is absolute,the rule has several exceptions.for example,under fundamental tenets of agency law,a principal is not charged with an agent actions or knowledge when the agent is acting adversely to the principal interests.see in re jlj,cir t he general rule is that an agent act against the interest of the principal is void schlueter varner,cir ambro,dissenting w hen an attorney ceases altogether to serve the interests of his client,the law of agency is clear that the attorney acts alone.baldayaque,at jacobs,concurring w hen an agent acts in a manner completely adverse to the principal interest,the principal is not charged with the agent misdeeds.see also restatement third of agency n otice of a fact that an agent knows or has reason to know is not imputed to the principal if the agent acts adversely to the principal in a transaction or matter,intending to act solely for the agent own purposes or those of another person.extending this rule to the habeas context,it has been suggested that when an attorney conduct is so egregious it amounts to a de facto termination of representation,it would be improper to hold the client to the actions of his agent.see,baldayaque,at jacobs,concurring see also rouse,at equitable tolling may be appropriate where attorney misconduct reaches the level of utter abandonment.
although the law of agency is useful in analyzing the relationship in many contexts,the exceptions to the rule reveal agency theory has its limits.the rule that a petitioner must always bear the consequences of his attorney misconduct is rules do not govern the court exercise of its equitable powers.see fisher johnson,cir as a discretionary doctrine that turns on the facts and circumstances of a particular case,equitable tolling does not lend itself to rules.accord spitsyn,at valverde stinson,cir.in the words of justice frankfurter,equity eschews mechanical rules it depends on flexibility.holmberg armbrecht.
it is perhaps for this reason that every circuit court of appeals other than the seventh to have answered the question directly takes the position that serious attorney misconduct may constitute an extraordinary circumstance for purposes of equitable tolling.see martin,serious attorney misconduct,as opposed to mere negligence,may warrant equitable tolling quotations omitted accord fleming evans,cir baldayaque,spitsyn,wynn,nara.these courts have recognized a critical distinction between mere attorney negligence and serious misconduct,holding that the former does not warrant equitable tolling because it is not an extraordinary circumstance.see,irwin dep t of veterans affairs,d t he principles of equitable tolling do not extend to what is at best a garden variety claim of excusable neglect.baldayaque,at noting simple mistakes about the rules applied to the deadlines for filing of habeas petitions are ordinary.but when an attorney actions extend beyond everyday mistakes into the realm of serious misconduct,these courts hold that in some circumstances such malfeasance may be far enough outside the range of behavior that reasonably could be expected by a client that it may be considered extraordinary.id.
thus,our fellow circuits have declined to impute attorney misconduct to a client where the attorney has made misrepresentations to the client,disregarded the client instructions,refused to return documents,or abandoned the client case.in baldayaque,for example,the petitioner attorney ignored a directive to file a petition under,failed to conduct any legal research,wrongly advised the petitioner wife that the filing period had expired,and failed to meet or speak with the petitioner at any point during the representation.id.the second circuit held these actions,taken together,constituted extraordinary circumstances that might warrant equitable tolling.id.
similarly,in fleming,the tenth circuit held equitable tolling might be appropriate where an attorney made repeated misrepresentations to his client over the course of a year concerning the status of the client petition for state relief.at.nearly a year before the expiration of the aedpa limitations period,fleming mother had retained an attorney to represent fleming in state proceedings.id.at.on several occasions,fleming inquired into the status of his state petition the filing of which would toll the federal limitations period,see d,and repeatedly received false assurances that the petition was being prepared and would be filed shortly.id.when no petition was filed,fleming drafted his own petition and submitted it to the attorney for review and filing.the attorney,however,failed to file the petition until the aedpa limitations period had expired.id.the tenth circuit held these allegations,at a minimum,warranted an evidentiary hearing to determine whether fleming was entitled to equitable tolling in light of the attorney misconduct.id.at.
in martin,the eighth circuit granted equitable tolling to a petitioner whose attorney disregarded instructions to file a motion under,repeatedly lied to the petitioner and his wife about the filing deadline and the status of the case,refused to communicate with the petitioner or his family,and failed to return the petitioner documents.at.the fifth and ninth circuits have condoned the use of equitable tolling under similar circumstances,extending the federal limitations period when,among other things,counsel lied about filing a habeas petition,wynn,at,and failed to file a federal habeas petition after being instructed to do so,spitsyn,at.
we believe the,approach taken by the majority of our fellow circuits is better suited to an equitable inquiry than is the approach to egregious attorney misconduct adopted by the seventh circuit in determining whether downs has alleged extraordinary circumstances that,if true,would entitle him to relief,we must consider all relevant facts.these include his unequivocal,repeated demands that his attorneys file his habeas petition his close tracking of his attorneys work and the applicable federal deadlines and his counsel overt deception in representing they had filed a tolling petition in state court when they had not in fact done so,thereby depriving him of several months of his federal limitations period.
although downs persistence resulted in his counsel ultimately filing his state habeas petition one day before his federal limitations period expired,his counsel deceit and delay nonetheless put him in an untenable position.we say untenable because there was no way downs,imprisoned as he was,would receive notice of the state court ruling in time to file his federal petition within the one day remaining in his federal limitations period.thus,throughout the course of their representation,counsel thwarted downs best efforts to file a timely petition,working against his interests at every turn.
beyond those facts which are highly troubling in themselves,we note that downs,a capital defendant seeking federal review of his constitutional claims,filed his petition a mere eight days outside the statutory limitations period lonchar thomas,d dismissal of a first habeas petition is a particularly serious matter,for that dismissal denies the petitioner the protections of the great writ entirely,risking injury to an important interest in human liberty.accord wynn,at.
in reviewing counsel alleged conduct,we again emphasize downs was represented by the same counsel throughout his state and federal postconviction proceedings.during the course of representation,counsel alleged behavior ran the gamut from acts of mere negligence to acts of gross negligence to acts of outright willful deceit.in considering whether the conduct of counsel was extraordinary,we will not dissect the continuing course of conduct in which counsel engaged,but rather view counsel behavior as a whole.consequently,although the culminating event which rendered downs federal habeas petition untimely was counsel late filing of the petition,that ordinary act of negligence can not be isolated from counsel allegedly egregious misconduct.
in the end,we can not say whether extraordinary circumstances are present that entitle downs to equitable tolling because the district court made no findings of fact with respect to whether counsel behavior was as appalling as downs alleges and the written record suggests.we can,however,answer the question on which the certificate of appealability was granted assuming downs allegations are true,he has shown the existence of extraordinary circumstances.
our precedents require not only extraordinary circumstances,but also circumstances that are beyond the petitioner control and unavoidable even with diligence.see sandvik,at johnson florida dep t of,cir.in this case,the facts downs has alleged,if true,meet both standards.
we have held on previous occasions that d ue diligence does not require a prisoner to undertake repeated exercises in futility or to exhaust every imaginable option,but rather to make reasonable efforts.aron united states,cir.moreover,the due diligence inquiry is an individualized one that must take into account the conditions of confinement and the reality of the prison system.id.internal quotations omitted.the facts downs alleges,if true,establish that he acted with due diligence to ensure his petition would be timely filed.between june and november,downs wrote to three ccrc attorneys to express concern over the running of the aedpa filing period and to urge the filing of his federal habeas petition or an additional state court pleading.in addition,downs attempted to assist his attorneys in drafting his federal petition by providing them with either a draft petition or a list of issues to be included in the petition.these allegations suggest downs acted with appropriate diligence.
that leaves one final question whether the extraordinary circumstances allegedly presented by this case were beyond downs control.neither our precedents nor those of other courts have lingered much on this final prong of the equity analysis,often collapsing it into the question whether extraordinary circumstances have been shown.see,pace diguglielmo,d a litigant seeking equitable tolling bears the burden of establishing two elements that he has been pursuing his rights diligently,and that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way lawrence.at same arthur allen,cir equitable tolling may be applied if the petitioner demonstrates diligence in his efforts to timely file a habeas petition and extraordinary and unavoidable circumstances.as in the context of diligence,a petitioner need not show that superhuman efforts might have enabled him to surmount the extraordinary obstacles
