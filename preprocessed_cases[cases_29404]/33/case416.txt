we consider the relationship between a motion to substitute counsel and an invocation of a defendant faretta rights.we hold that while a defendant may invoke his or her rights after a denial of a motion to substitute counsel,the invocation must be unequivocal.a request to represent oneself made while at the same time stating a preference for representation by a different lawyer and rearguing the change of counsel motion is insufficient to invoke faretta.
a federal grand jury returned an indictment against defendant roberto accusing him and several other defendants of participating in a conspiracy to distribute,possessing with the intent to distribute,and distributing both methamphetamine and cocaine several of the charged crimes carry a mandatory minimum of ten years of imprisonment.the district court appointed william hines hines to represent and set trial for june.
before trial hines filed a motion to withdraw as counsel at request.at the ex parte hearing on the motion,hines stated that had accused hines of threatening him whenever hines discussed the evidence that would be presented at trial,and that did not believe hines on several points of law.judge pechman inquired whether hines believed that had any mental health issues,and hines responded that he did not believe so.hines also detailed the plea negotiations the government had offered to drop an enhancement for his leadership role in exchange for a plea.this deal would make eligible for a mandatory minimum sentence.hines advised that he was facing twenty years if he went to trial because of his prior felony drug conviction.the plea negotiations were at an impasse because would not accept any offer of ten years or more but the government would not offer a sentence lower than ten years without mendez sanchez cooperation.
judge pechman then questioned,who stated that his lawyer was always threatening him with ten years imprisonment.judge pechman told that hines could not dictate the terms of the plea agreement,he could only communicate the government offers.responded but the other thing we never really talked about very clearly is how am i going to go to trial there is any evidence against me.there have to be recordings there have to be pictures.how can it be based on just someone words judge pechman explained there is no requirement that one have pictures or recordings to be convicted of these crimes.finally stated that he would like another lawyer because he was looking for less than ten years,but if he could not receive a better offer,maybe he would sign off on it.the court granted his request for new counsel,and set a new trial date in november.after the hearing,judge pechman appointed michael kolker kolker to represent.
on august,the district court granted kolker request for a second attorney,appointed michael schwartz schwartz to represent with kolker,and moved the trial date to january.
moved to substitute counsel again on december.assistant united states attorney doug whalley whalley opposed the motion on behalf of the government.whalley stated that there would be no further plea offers that eight had pled in this case and were awaiting sentencing,some of whom would likely be released with time served and that one dea agent was traveling from central asia to testify.finally,whalley detailed the volume of evidence that he would present about sixty transcripts of recorded telephone conversations,several testimony,and evidence of undercover drug purchases from.any new counsel would require a continuance to prepare for trial,which would cause witnesses to languish in jail and fail to accommodate the dea agent traveling from central asia.
after this discussion,the district court cleared the courtroom and asked attorneys,schwartz and kolker,about the relationship.kolker said that he had visited many times,but whenever he tried to go over evidence,would leave the room,according to kolker,was convinced that the date on the search warrant demonstrated that it was a forgery and insisted kolker call the magistrate as a witness to testify to the forgery.kolker said that he had requested a second lawyer on the case because of his difficulties communicating with.he further stated that continued to insist that the videotaped depositions would not be admissible at trial,despite kolker advice to the contrary.kolker statements prompted judge pechman to ask whether kolker was concerned about competency.kolker responded no.he understands who i am and he understands what my job is.i think he just does want to hear what i telling him.and he just does want to talk about it,basically.
the district court next asked kolker,schwartz,about his impressions of and their relationship.schwartz said that there were times when had listened closely and had responded to what he was saying,but there were other times when he had simply changed the subject,especially when he did not like what schwartz was saying.schwartz also asserted that had understood the complex concepts of a jury,his constitutional right to have a jury decide all counts,and the government burden of proof.schwartz explained that,following a discussion of these concepts,had waived his right to a jury on the immigration count.kolker noted that t he difficulty became when we were discussing things that i think are much more difficult for him not to grasp or understand,but probably to sort of admit to himself.he concluded by saying that he did not believe the problems with could be resolved by assigning new counsel,that insisted on a trial,and that schwartz had no reservations about defending him.
the district court next questioned,who began by telling the court that he did not trust his attorneys,that they were in cahoots with the prosecutor,and that he did not want them in the hearing.when judge pechman asked why believed his attorneys were colluding with the prosecutor,explained that he knew that the police did not have a warrant and his attorneys claimed that they did.stated that when he asked the police if they had a warrant at the time they arrested him,they responded for him to shut up.from this response he concluded that there was no warrant.he also detailed that the warrant his lawyers showed him had a different date originally and that the date had been changed.judge pechman asked if he knew what the government final offer had been,and he responded ten years.
then commenced his ambiguous faretta demand well,i do want any lawyer anymore.told them i want the paper to sign and that tell me how long i going to be in jail.but they aware that i not guilty of all the things that they are saying.judge pechman asked if he was stating he wanted to sign a plea agreement,and responded yeah,yeah.what the point of getting another lawyer but then,in response to the same question asked again,answered no,no,i rather go to trial.that my right.but not with these lawyers.the court asked what thought another lawyer could do for him,and he responded that he knew his current lawyers would not do anything,and then he began discussing the warrant and its apparent discrepancy in dates.
the district court asked counsel to explain what issue had with the warrant.according to kolker,it was a warrant that magistrate judge james donohue had signed on november.judge donohue had begun to write november in the space for the date by which the warrant would have to be served,he then crossed that out,initialed it,and wrote the warrant must be executed by december.kolker stated that thought this warrant was improper and that there was another secret warrant that kolker was not showing him.judge pechman reviewed the warrant in question and explained to that,from the face of the warrant,and because she knew magistrate judge donohue signature,she could tell that the warrant was not a forgery.she stated that it seemed as if the magistrate judge had just accidentally begun to write november but he had initialed his mistake and therefore the warrant was,on its face,valid.the court next informed that his lawyers were obligated to explain what was likely to happen at trial and to help him make decisions based on that information.
responded but i do want these lawyers.i not going to risk my life with these lawyers.the court asked if he was asking to represent himself,and he replied that would be better and that he did not trust these lawyers.the court deferred the full faretta colloquy until the prosecutor had come back into the room.
once the prosecutor was present,the court denied motion to substitute counsel.the court explained that it had appointed for both kolker and schwartz after his initial problems with hines,even though it was her clear belief at the time that did not like the message that was being delivered by the government and was in fact assuming some other counsel would change that message.the court also stated that there were several defendants who could not be sentenced until after trial was completed that a witness was flying in from asia that the relationship problems between and his counsel were not personal problems but stemmed from refusal to face his current situation and that his counsel felt prepared for trial.
the district court next conducted a full faretta colloquy.during the colloquy,responded in a coherent manner,demonstrated familiarity with the charges against him,and acknowledged that judge pechman did not think it was a good idea for him to represent himself.in response to judge pechman ultimate question,is it still your desire to represent yourself equivocated well,not with this lawyer,no.if you assign me a different lawyer,yes,i will go with the lawyer.then said i understand that a lawyer knows more than i do.but this lawyer that are present here,they have done nothing for me ever,and from the beginning i knew that.judge pechman tried to clarify,asking s o let me understand.you would prefer to have a lawyer,you do not want to represent yourself replied i think it would be better if a lawyer will help me.but i hope that it would be a good lawyer,not like these guys.
based on these responses,the district court found that had not unequivocally invoked his faretta rights,and therefore,kolker and schwartz continued to represent him.
the jury found guilty on all counts.the court sentenced him to months,the mandatory minimum.he filed a timely notice of appeal.
on appeal,argues that judge pechman abused her discretion when she denied motion to substitute counsel,that judge pechman should have offered a attorney during the faretta colloquy,and that judge pechman plainly erred by not ordering,sua sponte,to undergo a competency evaluation.
we review the denial of a motion for substitution of counsel for abuse of discretion.united states prime,cir.under our established rule,we consider the timeliness of the motion the adequacy of the district court inquiry and whether the asserted conflict was so great as to result in a complete breakdown in communication and a consequent inability to present a defense.id.
applying this rule,the first salient fact is that motion to substitute kolker and schwartz was not timely.made the motion little more than two weeks before trial that had been continued twice and involved significant discovery.a new counsel,if permitted,would have required additional time to prepare for trial.while timeliness is not dispositive,and sometimes a defendant would be unable to make a motion until shortly before as in a case where a defendant realized his or her counsel was not was not the case here.see id.filed this motion on the same day as his plea deadline.this timing supports the district court finding that this motion stemmed from unhappiness with his plea offer,and not because of a legitimate or new breakdown in communication.
the second prong in our analysis is our conclusion that the district court inquiry was adequate.the inquiry must be adequate to create a sufficient basis for reaching an informed decision.united states musa,cir quotation omitted.judge pechman extensively questioned and his attorneys.the court was able to surmise from statements that refused to accept the consequences of his crimes.moreover,while some of the court questions were,many questions were targeted toward understanding the crux of the disagreement between and his attorneys.see united states franklin,cir holding that questions were not inadequate where the questions allowed defendant and counsel to sufficiently detail the reasons for the request to substitute counsel.the court was therefore able to make an informed decision regarding the motion and the inquiry can not be faulted.see united states mitchell,cir.
centers his argument on the third factor to be assessed under our,the extent of the conflict between and his attorneys.to meet this prong,a defendant must show that there was an extensive,irreconcilable conflict between himself and his appointed counsel.united states smith,cir.this conflict must have led to a significant breakdown in communication that substantially interfered with the relationship.united states,cir.
doubtless here there was some level of conflict.kolker stated that would leave the room or change the subject when his lawyers were speaking about something did not want to discuss.asserted that he would prefer to represent himself instead of kolker and schwartz and continued to say so throughout the faretta colloquy.
relies on.in,the defendant moved to substitute counsel because of a conflict between himself and his attorney.at.for example,counsel had used bad language,had threatened to sink for years if he refused to accept a plea,had tried to prevent him from filing motions,and even accused him of being a liar.id.at.also said that he would prefer to represent himself rather than continue with current counsel.id.at.we reversed the district court denial of motion to substitute counsel because we determined that the breakdown in the relationship was severe.id.at.
while there are some facial similarities between and this case,there are important distinctions.had already requested and received new counsel.he and his former counsel had experienced the same conflict over the plea negotiations and the validity of the warrant.when stated that he did not trust his attorneys,the court properly inquired into why and told him,though he still did not believe it,that the attorneys were correct the warrant was not a forgery,his attorneys could only relay to him the deals that the government offered,and there is no requirement that video evidence be introduced in a trial.kolker and schwartz demonstrated no animosity toward,unlike the attorney had in.when and his attorneys discussed issues that did not involve the evidence against him,such as waiving a jury on the immigration count,was able to have a productive conversation with them.the relationship between and his attorneys does not exhibit the same sort of striking signs of serious conflict that occurred in.see id.at.
in united states smith,we affirmed a district court denial of a motion to substitute counsel and held that the conflict between smith and his attorney arose out of general unreasonableness or manufactured discontent,cir.smith quarreled with his attorney about the wording of a discovery motion,and when smith attorney would not use his wording,smith unilaterally cut off contact,stating that he did not want to meet and discuss something and have nothing be done about it again.id.at.smith,like,had already received one substitute counsel.id.at.while having already been granted a motion to substitute counsel once does not preclude receiving another lawyer,the fact that this was the same breakdown in communications that had occurred with his previous lawyer is significant.the nature of the conflict demonstrates that it may have been based on general unreasonableness.it is unclear what could have been done differently had three lawyers tell him what he did not want to hear,he had not listened to any of them,and the judge herself had told him the same thing.if had received other counsel,it is likely that the same conflicts would have arisen.
finally,whatever conflict had with his counsel was not extensive or irreconcilable.see id.at.was able to communicate with his attorneys,they bore him no,and he stated that they were never rude to him.there must be limits on the ability of a defendant to gain new counsel when the defendant is
