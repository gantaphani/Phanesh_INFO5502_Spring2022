steve cooksey cooksey or appellant appeals the district court dismissal of his complaint filed against michelle futrell,brenda burgin ross,kathleen sodoma,christie nicholson,phyllis hilliard,cathleen ostrowski,and richard holden,members of the north carolina board of collectively,the state board or appellees.cooksey alleges the state board violated his first amendment rights by causing him to certain speech on his website wherein he offered both free and dietary advice to website visitors.the district court held that cooksey did not have standing to bring these claims,reasoning that he did not suffer an actual or imminent.
the district court erred,however,in not analyzing cooksey claims under the first amendment standing framework.as explained below,under that analysis,cooksey has sufficiently satisfied the first amendment requirement by showing that the state board actions had an objectively reasonable chilling effect on the advice and commentary he posted on his website.his claims are likewise ripe for adjudication.we thus vacate the district court order dismissing cooksey complaint,and remand so that the district court may consider cooksey claims on the merits.
on february,cooksey was rushed to the hospital on the verge of a diabetic coma.he was subsequently diagnosed with type ii diabetes.licensed dietitians advised that he should eat a diet low in fats and high in carbohydrates.after looking into the matter,however,cooksey came to the independent conclusion that he should do the inverse,that is,eat a diet high in fat and low in carbohydrates,also called the paleolithic diet because it is similar to the diet of humans living in the stone age.according to cooksey,shortly after adopting this diet,his blood sugar normalized and he was able to stop using insulin and other prescription medications.cooksey says that this,coupled with exercise,enabled him to lose pounds,and he feels healthier than ever.compl.
in january,cooksey launched a website,now called diabetes warrior,www.net,wherein he talked about his weight loss and lifestyle changes,including his personal meal plans and favorite recipes.the website contained a disclaimer that cooksey was not a licensed medical professional and did not have any formal medical education or special dietary qualifications.on the website,cooksey expressed his opinion that the high diet was causing more obesity and diabetes.his site ultimately became very popular,with approximately unique visitors in december and january alone.
the website had three main components of relevance to this appeal a dear advice column,in which cooksey selected certain questions he received from visitors to his website and posted them,along with his answers,compl.a free personal dietary mentoring section,in which visitors would post questions or share stories about diet,exercise,and related issues,and cooksey would respond to the posts,id.at compl.and a diabetes support life coaching service,in which cooksey proposed a fee in exchange for providing individualized advice and moral support to those wishing to try the paleolithic diet id.at compl.
on january,cooksey attended a nutritional seminar for diabetics at a church near his home.the seminar leader the director of diabetic services at a local hospital expressed her view that a,diet is best for diabetics.during the portion of the seminar,cooksey expressed his counter opinion that a paleolithic diet is best for diabetics.someone present at the seminar reported cooksey to the state board,which is charged with administering north carolina practice act the act,and claimed that cooksey was engaging in the unlicensed practice of dietetics.
the act prohibits any unlicensed person from engaging in the practice of,which is defined as the integration and application of principles derived from the science of nutrition,biochemistry,physiology,food,and management and from behavioral and social sciences to achieve and maintain a healthy status.id.the primary function of practice is the provision of nutrition care services.id.nutrition care services include the following 
assessing the nutritional needs of individuals and groups,and determining resources and constraints in the practice setting.
establishing priorities,goals,and objectives that meet nutritional needs and are consistent with available resources and constraints.
providing nutrition counseling in health and disease.
developing,implementing,and managing nutrition care systems.
evaluating,making changes in,and maintaining appropriate standards of quality in food and nutrition services.
the act also provides,any person who violates any provision of this article shall be guilty of a class misdemeanor.each act of such unlawful practice shall constitute a distinct and separate offense.gen stat.the act gives the state board the power to make application to any appropriate court for an order enjoining violations of this article,and upon a showing by the state board that any person has violated or is about to violate this article,the court may grant an injunction,restraining order,or take other appropriate action.id.see also id.providing that the state board shall,inter alia,c onduct investigations,subpoena individuals and records,and do all other things necessary and proper to enforce this article.state regulations further provide,any person,whether residing in this state or not,who by use of electronic or other medium performs any of the acts described as the practice of,but is not licensed shall be deemed by the state board as being engaged in the practice of and subject to the enforcement provisions available to the board.admin.code.
cooksey alleges that shortly after the diabetics seminar,the executive director of the state board,charla burill,called him and told him he and his website were under investigation.compl.when cooksey asked if he needed a lawyer,burill responded that the state board tried to resolve complaints informally,but that it does have the statutory authority to seek an injunction to prevent the unlicensed practice of dietetics.id.compl.apparently during this same conversation,burill asked cooksey to move the disclaimer stating that he is a layperson to the home page of the website,and he did so without objection.she also instructed cooksey to take down the part of his website where he offered his diabetes support service because such a service constitutes the unlicensed practice of dietetics.id.compl.cooksey reluctantly complied with this request because he feared civil and criminal action against him id.compl.burill then told cooksey that the complaint committee of the state board would review his website and report back to him on what he may and may not say without a dietitian license.id.compl.
on january,burill emailed cooksey,stating,
i have reviewed your website with the complaint committee.please find attached a document containing pages from your website with areas of concern noted.given our discussion,i believe our comments should make sense,however,should you disagree,i am happy to discuss.please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have.should you agree with our comments,we would ask that you make any necessary changes to your site,and moreover,going forward,align your practices with the guidance provided.again,please contact me with any questions,and please update me as changes are made.
id.at emphasis supplied.burill attached from cooksey website,which she and the complaint committee had marked with a red pen,indicating which statements showed areas of concern.see also id.at the review.
some of the comments from the review include the following 
you should not be addressing diabetic specific questions.you are no longer just providing information when you do this,you are assessing and counseling,both of which require a license.
when helping a website visitor with this issue introducing whipping cream into her diet you were assessing and advising these activities require a license.further would seem to communicate to the public that you can provide this type of service possibly for them too when you post in this manner.id.at.
it is acceptable to provide just this information a meal plan,but when you start recommending it directly to people you speak to or who write you,you are now providing diabetic counseling,which requires a license.id.at.
as previously stated,you can provide information on your site,but you can not work with individuals.consider how these testimonials come across to the public would the lay person believe you could counsel id.at.
the state board simply drew large red x through cooksey various packages.
cooksey did not contact the state board to further discuss the review as burill email invited rather,he altered his website and ceased expressing opinions in the form of personal dietary advice based on his fear of civil and criminal action against him by the state of north carolina.compl.on april,burill sent cooksey a letter on state board letterhead stating,in relevant part,
under north carolina general statute,a license is required to engage in the practice of.upon initial review of your website it was discovered that you were advertising diabetes support packages and charging a fee for these services.when we spoke on january,you indicated that you would take down the support packages page and make the disclaimer on your website more prominent.shortly thereafter,although you did not take down the page,you did delete the packages and you did make your disclaimer more prominent.
since our last correspondence,it appears that you have remained in substantial compliance with the requirements of article,chapter of the north carolina general statutes.therefore,effective april,the board is closing this complaint.as with all complaints,the board reserves the right to continue to monitor this situation.

on may,cooksey filed suit in the western district of north carolina,alleging appellees violated his first amendment rights.specifically,the complaint contains three counts alleging violations of 
count one a violation based on restriction of the dear advice column the application of the act is a restriction on his speech in that the state board declared his speech illegal based on the fact that it involved advice about diet and not advice about any other topic such as auto mechanics,taking the sats,or marriage 
count two a violation based on the restriction of the free personal dietary mentoring that cooksey offered through his website defendants prohibition of plaintiff cooksey personal,ongoing,uncompensated mentorship is an unconstitutional prohibition on something that americans have done since the inception of the united states share advice among friends and 
count three a violation based on the restriction of cooksey diabetes support lifecoaching packages the speech associated with plaintiff cooksey personal,ongoing,uncompensated mentorship of friends,acquaintances,readers,or family,as described in this complaint,which plaintiff cooksey contends is speech protected by the first amendment,does not lose its first amendment protection simply because plaintiff cooksey charges a fee for that exact same speech.
compl.cooksey seeks a declaratory judgment that the act and attendant regulations are unconstitutional and on their face to the extent that they prohibit plaintiff cooksey from conducting the dear abby style column,personal dietary mentoring,and the service a permanent injunction preventing the state board from enforcing the act and attendant regulations and attorney fees and costs.id.at compl.a h.
on july,appellees filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b for lack of standing and ripeness,and b for failure to state a first amendment claim.the motion was referred to a magistrate judge,who recommended that the motion be granted and the complaint be dismissed for lack of standing.the district court agreed and dismissed the complaint without prejudice on october,explaining,
plaintiff first objection is that it was plain error for the magistrate judge to conclude that because the state board issued no formal decision,there could be no injury.as the undersigned recognized in its own order and as found by the magistrate judge in the m r,plaintiff volunteered to remove parts of his website that the state board executive director identified as being areas of concern.the record before the court is devoid of any evidence or even an allegation that the state board made a formal determination on whether plaintiff violated the practice act,et,took or threatened any formal action in response to the complaint lodged against plaintiff,or ordered compliance in any way.indeed,there is no evidence or allegation that the state board or its executive director referred the complaint to a district attorney for prosecution.see.
inasmuch as plaintiff was not subjected to any actual or imminent enforcement of the act,he lacks article iii standing clearly,voluntarily removing parts of one website in response to an inquiry from a state licensing board is not a sufficient injury to invoke article iii standing.

this appeal concerns the threshold issue of justiciability.dep t of commerce house of representatives.appellees contend cooksey claims are not justiciable because he does not have standing to bring them,and furthermore,they are not ripe.for the reasons that follow,cooksey claims are justiciable because he has sufficiently shown that he suffered an by first amendment standards,and likewise,the claims are ripe for adjudication.
in determining whether cooksey claims are justiciable,we first turn to standing.article iii of the united states constitution gives federal courts jurisdiction only over cases and controversies,and the doctrine of standing identifies disputes appropriate for judicial resolution.miller brown,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the standing doctrine is an integral component of the case or controversy requirement,and has three elements 
first,the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.second,there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of the injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant,and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.third,it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.

the supreme court of the united states has explained that standing requirements are somewhat relaxed in first amendment cases 
even where a first amendment challenge could be brought by one actually engaged in protected activity,there is a possibility that,rather than risk punishment for his conduct in challenging the statute,he will refrain from engaging further in the protected activity.society as a whole then would be the loser.thus,when there is a danger of chilling free speech,the concern that constitutional adjudication be avoided whenever possible may be outweighed by society interest in having the statute challenged.

is defined as an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.appellees contend that cooksey loses on this first element because rather than alleging an injury in fact,he alleges only a hypothetical injury based on what the state board might do in the future.appellees br.further,appellees maintain,the state board never compelled cooksey to refrain from doing anything,and there was neither actual nor imminent enforcement of the act.id.at.cooksey,however,claims he plainly suffered an when he in response to the threat of sanctions under the dietetics practice act and in response to the actions of the state board.appellant br.he also maintains his speech was chilled by the civil and criminal sanctions enumerated in the dietetics practice act as well as by the specific actions of the state board.id.at.we agree with cooksey.
in the most general sense,the plaintiff must have suffered an injury or threat of injury that is credible,not imaginary or speculative.babbitt united farm workers union.in first amendment cases,the element is commonly satisfied by a sufficient showing of,which occurs when a claimant is chilled from exercising h is right to free expression.benham city of charlotte,cir internal quotation marks omitted.this court has explained,
we have recognized that,to demonstrate injury in fact,it is sufficient to show that one first amendment activities have been chilled.subjective or speculative accounts of such a chilling effect,however,are not sufficient.any chilling effect must be objectively reasonable.nevertheless,a claimant need not show he ceased those activities altogether to demonstrate an injury in fact.government action will be sufficiently chilling when it is likely to deter a person of ordinary firmness from the exercise of first amendment rights.
id.internal quotation marks,citations,and alterations omitted.
we are mindful,however,that the chilling effect can not arise merely from the individual knowledge that a governmental agency was engaged in certain activities or from the individual concomitant fear that,armed with the fruit of those activities,the agency might in the future take some other and additional action detrimental to that individual.laird tatum.in other words,a llegations of a subjective chill are not an adequate substitute for a claim of specific present objective harm or a threat of specific future harm.id.at.but see mangual rotger sabat,cir recognizing a first amendment when a plaintiff is chilled from exercising h is right to free expression or forgoes expression in order to avoid enforcement consequences internal quotation marks omitted.
in his complaint and its attached exhibits,cooksey has sufficiently shown that he has experienced a and objectively reasonable chilling effect of his speech due to the actions of the state board.the complaint states,but for the state board review of his website,conversations and emails with officials of the state board,cooksey would not have a uncertainty about the legality of private conversations and correspondence in which he expresses opinions in the form of personal dietary advice and he would resume his dear advice column.compl.most telling is the fact that cooksey actually ceased expressing opinions in the form of personal dietary advice,id.at,on the mentoring and dear abby style sections of the website.he did not even have to go that far for an to lie.see benham,at a claimant need not show he ceased those activities altogether to demonstrate an injury in fact.internal quotation marks omitted.
further,the state board actions would be likely to deter a person of ordinary firmness from the exercise of first amendment rights.benham,at internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.cooksey received a telephone call from the highest executive official of a state agency,who told him she had the statutory authority to seek an injunction against him if he did not bring his website in line with the act proscriptions.compl.he received a of his website from the state board complaint committee,which surely triggered the same trepidation we have all experienced upon receiving such markings on a high school term paper.furthermore,the review was accompanied by the statement,we would ask that you make any necessary changes to your site,and moreover,going forward,align your practices with the guidance provided.id.at.and cooksey was told,in effect,that he would remain under the watchful eye of the state board in a letter signed by burill,which stated,as with all complaints,the board reserves the right to continue to monitor this situation.id.at.a person of ordinary firmness would surely feel a chilling cooksey did.
in fact,this case presents more persuasive evidence of chilling than another case from this court in which standing was achieved.in north carolina right to life,bartlett ncrl,this court found that ncrl,a group with the purpose of protect ing human life,had standing to challenge certain state election regulations that would impose criminal penalties on organizations making contributions for a political purpose,cir.ncrl wrote to the state board of elections to inquire whether some of its activities specifically,distributing voter guides would violate the regulations at issue,and the board answered in the affirmative.see id.at.as a result,the court held,ncrl refrained from disseminating its guide,and its speech was chilled.id.at.the court stated,this case presents a statute aimed directly at plaintiffs who will have to take significant compliance measures or risk criminal prosecution.at quoting virginia am.booksellers ass n.
in the present case,we not only have evidence of specific and unlike ncrl unsolicited written and oral correspondence from the state board explaining that cooksey speech violates the act,but we also have a plaintiff who stopped engaging in speech because of such correspondence,and an explicit warning from the state board that it will continue to monitor the plaintiff speech in the future.see compl.burill told cooksey that he and his website were under investigation and that the state board does have the statutory authority to seek an injunction to prevent the unlicensed practice of dietetics.id.at review you should not be addressing diabetic specific questions.you are no longer just providing information when you do this,you are assessing and counseling,both of which require a license.id.at burill email w e would ask that you make any necessary changes to your site,and moreover,going forward,align your practices with the guidance provided.id.at burill letter t he board reserves the right to continue to monitor this situation.therefore,we have no trouble deciding that cooksey speech was sufficiently chilled by the actions of the state board to show a first amendment.
per ncrl,cooksey also satisfies the requirement by showing a credible threat of prosecution under the act.this court explained,
when a plaintiff faces a credible threat of prosecution under a criminal statute he has standing to mount a challenge to that statute.a statute that facially restricts expressive activity by the class to which the plaintiff belongs presents such a credible threat,and a case or controversy thus exists in the absence of compelling evidence to the contrary.this presumption is particularly appropriate when the presence of the statute tends to chill the exercise of first amendment rights.
