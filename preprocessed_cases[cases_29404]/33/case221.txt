the federal government appeals from the district court order issued pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure e requiring the government to return documents seized from the law offices and home of alan brown,a san antonio,texas criminal defense attorney.the government argues that the district court erred in concluding under rule e that brown should recover his property and that the government should make no use of it.we find that brown showed no irreparable injury warranting the district court suppression of the records,and therefore vacate the district court order and remand with instructions to dismiss this proceeding.
this case concerns the intertwined investigations of two individuals,brown and his office manager,kelly houston.in the federal agents began investigating brown client,sammy naranjo,for drug trafficking.in this investigation led agents to suspect that houston,who was having an affair with naranjo,was laundering money for him using brown law firm accounts.part of the investigation included wiretaps,and the agents intercepted telephone conversations between houston and naranjo.on september,agents,including special agent james maxwell of the internal revenue service,arrived at brown office to deliver notices of intercept to brown,on behalf of his client,naranjo,and to houston,to inform them that the government had intercepted their communications.brown,maxwell,and the other agent present discussed houston affair with naranjo,and subsequent to this first meeting brown,whom agents did not suspect was involved in houston alleged money laundering,agreed to cooperate with the agents in their investigation.around that time houston resigned from brown office because he instructed her that she could not continue working for him as long as she was in a relationship with naranjo.sometime before houston left the office she took with her various financial records detailing the office receipt of monies.although the assistant united states attorney assigned to the case,tom mchugh,requested in a letter to houston that she return these records,she denied having them.
as part of his cooperation with government agents,brown allowed the agents complete access to his office and staff members,who provided the agents with information on how financial records were kept at the office.pursuant to their request he also conducted,at his own expense,an audit of his office financial records,and in february brown testified before the grand jury as to the investigation into houston activities.
that same month the grand jury indicted naranjo on various drug trafficking and money laundering charges.although maxwell and the other agents involved in the investigation of houston believed that she should also be indicted,mchugh declined to prosecute because,at the time,he did not believe the agents had gathered enough evidence to secure a conviction.he did leave open the possibility,however,that if the agents gathered the evidence mchugh believed was lacking he would reconsider prosecution.
naranjo case was set for trial in october.brown was listed as a government witness,and naranjo threatened brown life.prior to his trial naranjo also suggested to the same agents who had investigated him and houston that houston could give them information about illegal activities being committed by brown.agents invited houston to talk with them,and she did.four days into his trial,naranjo pleaded guilty,and houston requested that,in return for her cooperation,naranjo sentence be reduced.in her discussions with the agents houston stated that,for many years,brown had been committing tax evasion by failing to report significant amounts of income he received in his practice.she provided the agents with the financial records she had taken from brown law office before her departure,and alleged that they proved that he had underreported income noted as received by him in the records.
in the summer of agents believed they had enough information regarding brown tax evasion to search brown office and home.on august,agent maxwell authored a page affidavit detailing houston allegations and evidence corroborating that information.on the basis of the affidavit the magistrate judge issued a warrant authorizing a search of brown office and home,which agents executed the night of august and early morning of august.additionally,on august brown consented to the agents request to search two storage units rented by his law office.pursuant to procedures outlined in maxwell affidavit,a taint team composed of agents and attorneys separate from the team of agents investigating brown conducted the search to protect any potentially privileged information contained in the records searched.the affidavit also provided that after the seizure the taint agents would maintain the records,which would be made available to brown or his staff.during this time brown could identify any potentially privileged records and attempt to resolve the privilege issues with the taint attorneys.if the issues could not be resolved they would be submitted to a court for determination.
brown refused to participate in this privilege procedure,so the government determined that the taint attorneys would have to sift through the records themselves to divide those privileged items from the nonprivileged ones.after this process had begun brown moved for a protective order,arguing that his counsel and the government had agreed that the taint team would not look through the records until a court had determined the proper procedure to be employed to resolve the privilege issues.brown also requested that the court order the seized property returned pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure e on the basis that it was illegally seized and that it contained privileged information.
the district court issued a protective order and determined that brown motion for return of property merited an evidentiary hearing.over a year after brown filed his motion for return of property,the court held a hearing that focused almost exclusively on the factual basis for maxwell affidavit in support of the search warrant application.specifically,brown argued that maxwell had omitted and misrepresented several material facts that,had they been revealed to the magistrate judge at the time he was considering the application,he would not have issued the search warrant.
nine months after the hearing,after prompting by the government,the district court issued its order granting brown motion.it concluded that maxwell had failed to state in the affidavit that houston cooperated with government agents to secure a reduced sentence for her paramour naranjo,who had threatened brown life and against whom brown was set to testify in the criminal trial,and that maxwell had also omitted that houston was likely cooperating to retaliate against brown for cooperating with government agents in the investigation of her alleged money laundering activities.
the district court additionally determined that maxwell should have revealed that he had investigated houston for money laundering involving the same financial accounts at issue with regard to brown tax evasion,and that maxwell believed she had indeed committed the offense despite the fact she was never prosecuted for it.moreover,the district court found important that houston had lied to mchugh about her possession of the firm financial records,and that maxwell had stated in his affidavit,contrary to this truth,that he was not aware of any false information houston provided to law enforcement officers.
finally,the district court concluded that maxwell had misrepresented the nature of the receipt books,which maxwell averred in the affidavit corroborated houston allegations.maxwell had explained that the receipt books contained more notations regarding receipt of monies than brown had reported on his tax returns,but the district court found that the evidence showed that the receipt books included notations of many different payments that did not constitute income,but rather court fees,fees to other attorneys,and restitution amounts.
based on these findings the district court concluded that brown was entitled to all of the seized property and the government should not be allowed to retain copies or make any use of the evidence,which effectively suppressed the evidence from consideration by the grand jury as well as in any proceedings.the government appeals this ruling.although at the time of the filing of this appeal brown had no criminal charges pending against him,in april of this year the grand jury indicted brown on certain tax fraud charges.
rule e reads as follows 
e motion to return property.a person aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure of property or by the deprivation of property may move for the property return.the motion must be filed in the district where the property was seized.the court must receive evidence on any factual issue necessary to decide the motion.if it grants the motion,the court must return the property to the movant,but may impose reasonable conditions to protect access to the property and its use in later proceedings.if a motion for return of property is made or comes on for hearing in the district of trial after an indictment or information is filed,it shall be treated also as a motion to suppress under rule 
our earliest opinions on this rule interpreted it broadly as empowering a district court to entertain on equitable grounds a motion for return of property if the government callously disregarded a search warrant victim constitutional rights.hunsucker phinney concerned a movant claim that government agents illegally searched his apartment and retrieved materials that the irs used to recommend a hefty tax assessment against him before the irs could actually make the assessment,hunsucker filed suit under the declaratory judgment statute and rule e requesting a return of the seized property and an order prohibiting its use as evidence against him the district court dismissed the case although the basis for the dismissal was unclear,it appeared to have been grounded in the district court finding that hunsucker attempt to obtain relief was premature 
in determining whether the dismissal was proper,this court found that 
a substantial body of precedent establishes that federal district courts have power to order the suppression or return of unlawfully seized property even though no indictment has been returned and thus no criminal prosecution is yet in existence.though firmly established,this jurisdiction is an exceptional one the theory articulated by most of the cases is that jurisdiction to order suppression or return prior to indictment exists not by virtue of any statute but rather derives from the inherent authority of the court over those who are its officers 
we cautioned,however,that it does not automatically follow that this unique power should be exercised wherever it exists.rather,such jurisdiction should be exercised with caution and restraint,and subject to equitable principles.
the panel confirmed that hunsucker was not a case warranting exercise of this anomalous jurisdiction,given that hunsucker had not shown that the agents exhibited callous disregard for his constitutional rights since the search in issue was conducted pursuant to a warrant issued in the normal manner.moreover,he had an adequate remedy at law for this allegedly unconstitutional deprivation because,if the irs did assess the tax,he could bring a refund suit.because the government had returned the originals of the documents to hunsucker before trial,he could not claim that he would suffer an irreparable injury from waiting to vindicate his rights on the theory that some of these materials were necessary to conduct a legitimate business or were otherwise of substantial value to him 
a year later,in richey smith,we reconsidered the issue of suits under rule e in that case a husband and wife sued in the district court under rule e requesting the return and suppression of allegedly illegally seized business records the district court dismissed the suit for lack of jurisdiction,because neither plaintiff had been indicted,but noted that the couple could file a motion to suppress in the event that a criminal prosecution followed richey explained that hunsucker had listed some of the considerations that should govern the decision by the district court whether to exercise this anomalous jurisdiction,including f irst and perhaps foremost,whether the motion for return of property alleges that government agents in seizing the property displayed a callous disregard for the constitutional rights of the taxpayer.other factors a court should consider are whether the plaintiff has an individual interest in and need for the material whose return he seeks,whether he would be irreparably injured by denial of the return of the property,and whether he has an adequate remedy at law for the redress of his grievance.it noted,without deciding the question,that a motion to suppress may not constitute an adequate remedy at law for a potential criminal defendant,because a wrongful indictment is no laughing matter often it works a grievous,irreparable injury to the person indicted.the stigma can not be easily erased.in the public mind,the blot on a man escutcheon is seldom wiped out by a subsequent judgment of not guilty.
the richey panel remanded the case to the district court for a hearing on the plaintiff allegations the court also stated that the district court would have to decide the appropriate relief to be granted should the plaintiffs prevail,reasoning that a motion prior to any suggestion of criminal proceedings,as here,is more properly considered simply as a suit in equity rather than one under the rules of criminal procedure,and s o viewed,return of the property would not necessarily entail suppression for the purposes of further court proceedings.as support for this proposition the court stated that while the taxpayer was entitled to be as well off as if the irs agent had not unlawfully seized those papers,he was not entitled to be any better off.
in united states calandra,released around the same time as richey,the supreme court suggested that the equitable powers of a district court under rule e do have certain limitations in that case a grand jury witness refused to answer grand jury questions on the ground that they were based on illegally obtained evidence federal agents had secured a search warrant of calandra place of business in connection with their investigation into possible illegal gambling operations being carried out there after the search calandra moved under rule e for suppression and return of the seized evidence,contending that the affidavit supporting the warrant was insufficient and that the search exceeded the warrant scope after a hearing the district court ordered the evidence suppressed and returned to calandra and further ordered that calandra need not answer any of the grand jury questions based on the suppressed evidence the sixth circuit affirmed,concluding that the district court had properly entertained the suppression motion and that the exclusionary rule may be invoked by a witness before the grand jury to bar questioning based on evidence obtained in an unlawful search and seizure.
the government petitioned for certiorari on the issue whether,under the exclusionary rule,calandra could refuse to answer questions before the grand jury on the ground that they were based on illegally obtained evidence,and the supreme court granted certiorari and reversed the court reasoned that t he grand jury sources of information are widely drawn,and the validity of an indictment is not affected by the character of the evidence considered,and added,the exclusionary rule has never been interpreted to proscribe the use of illegally seized evidence in all proceedings or against all persons.
of paramount importance to the calandra court was the exclusionary rule potential for hamstringing grand jury investigations 
it is evident that this extension of the exclusionary rule would seriously impede the grand jury.because the grand jury does not finally adjudicate guilt or innocence,it has traditionally been allowed to pursue its investigative and accusatorial functions unimpeded by the evidentiary and procedural restrictions applicable to a
