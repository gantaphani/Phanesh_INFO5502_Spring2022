background 
lal husband kamal lal was shot and killed by chp officers newman and otterby on march.on march,lal retained charles spahr to represent her and her minor son.in december,spahr and his mark webb filed suit against defendants in state court on behalf of lal,her son,and her husband estate.on august,defendants removed to federal court.
on november,the district court allowed webb to withdraw.spahr remained as lal attorney.on november,defendants counsel sent spahr their initial rule disclosures.spahr made no initial disclosures.two days later,defendants filed a case management statement.the initial case management conference was scheduled for november.defense counsel and spahr appeared at the scheduled time,but the court continued the conference to january.the court ordered counsel for both parties to confer before january and ordered spahr to provide rule disclosures within two weeks.spahr did neither.
according to her sworn statement provided to the district court,lal called spahr in to check on the status of her case.she recounts that spahr told her that he had participated in a conference call with defense counsel and the district court judge,that the judge wanted the parties to settle the case,and that the next meeting would take place in approximately two to three months.he did not tell her about the scheduled january case management conference.
neither spahr nor lal appeared at the january management conference.lal states that she did not know about the hearing and that she would have appeared,either with or without spahr,had she known about it.on january,the district court entered a written order directing lal and spahr to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed including dismissal of the complaint for failure to prosecute monetary sanctions for her repeated refusal to comply with the court orders.the court set a hearing on the order to show cause for february and warned that i f plaintiff fails to appear her complaint will be dismissed.
neither lal nor spahr appeared on february.lal states that she did not know about this second hearing.at the hearing,counsel for defendants stated that they had received no communications from spahr and renewed a previous request that the court dismiss the case.the next day,in a written order,the district court dismissed for failure to prosecute pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.
lal states that she called spahr in march to check on her case.she states that spahr told her that defendants needed more time for discovery.lal left spahr a voicemail on june.spahr replied in a text message,telling lal that he would call her that evening.but spahr did not call.spahr left a voicemail about a week later,telling lal that he was in the process of filing motions and that webb had tentatively agreed to work on her case again.
lal left another voicemail for spahr in august,but he did not respond.lal then called webb office and left a message for webb.webb also did not respond.lal left another voicemail for spahr in september.he finally returned her call on september.he told her he had scheduled depositions in her case for late november.when lal asked about additional depositions,spahr said it would be better to wait to discuss her case until webb returned the following week.spahr then scheduled a conference call for himself,webb,and lal for september.spahr did not call at the time scheduled for the conference call.lal called spahr minutes later and left a voicemail.she then sent him an email the next day about their failed conference call.she received no response to either her voicemail or email.
lal states that she called attorney wynn herron at about this time to get a second opinion.herron returned her call on october.he told lal that the district court had dismissed her case on february,because spahr had failed to appear for a hearing.lal states that she was shocked and told herron she was never informed of this development.herron advised her to file a complaint with the california state bar.lal asked herron about the merits of her case,but herron told lal that he did not handle such cases.
lal states that she called spahr later that same day.spahr told her that he had missed the district court hearing for a good reason and that he had her case in state court.lal asked for copies of the papers he filed,along with the case numbers.lal then called herron again and asked him to find the state court case spahr claimed he filed on her behalf.herron could find no pending cases filed on behalf of lal or her son.
lal states that she called spahr the next day,october,to get copies of the documents he claimed to have filed.spahr told her he needed to hours to retrieve the documents,that he had moved offices,and if anything fell through the cracks,that he would make it up to me.lal was distraught and spoke to her priest,who called spahr.spahr left lal a message on her voicemail at work at on october,suggesting that they set up a meeting the next morning to discuss spahr plans for lal case.lal states that she was not at work on the morning of october,and did not receive the message in time to meet with spahr.it is unclear whether the meeting would have actually taken place if lal had received the message in time.
lal filed a complaint with the state bar eight days later,on october.spahr called her that same day and told her he was filing a motion in her case.lal again asked for copies of all of the documents filed in her case.after not receiving anything for another two weeks,lal called spahr again.spahr said he would deliver the papers to her house that evening,but he never came.
lal called the state bar in november and spoke with willis shalita,the investigator assigned to her complaint.shalita advised lal to get another attorney.lal attempted to retain attorney paula canny that same day.lal was told that canny was undergoing chemotherapy and might not be able to take on her case,and that she would need to read everything before making a decision.lal states that a person in canny office told her a couple of weeks later that canny had a conflict of interest and could not represent her.
lal then called several other attorneys,all of whom declined to help her.on december,lal contacted attorney sydney fairbairn.fairbairn advised lal to demand that spahr turn over her case files and to hire a service to obtain copies of her case files from federal and state court.lal called fairbairn back four days later to say that she had hired a service.she then met with fairbairn on january.lal formally retained fairbairn on january.
on january,fairbairn filed a motion for substitution of counsel and a motion for relief from judgment under federal rule of civil procedure.the rule motion was supported by sworn declarations from fairbairn and lal.
the district court held a hearing on the rule motion for relief from the dismissal for failure to prosecute on march,and denied the motion two days later.the court expressed doubt about the applicability of our decision in tani,in which we held that an attorney gross negligence was a ground for granting a motion for relief from a default judgment.the court went on to hold that,even if tani applied,lal had not diligently pursued relief under rule b and that her delay prejudiced defendants.
lal timely appealed.
ii.standard of review 
we review for abuse of discretion a district court dismissal of an action under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to prosecute.hearns san bernardino police dep t,cir.we also review for abuse of discretion a district court decision to deny a rule b motion.cal.dep t of soc.servs.leavitt,cir.we review de novo any questions of law underlying the district court decision to deny a rule b motion.jeff kempthorne,cir.
iii.discussion 
lal appeals both the district court order dismissing her action for failure to prosecute and the order denying her motion for relief from judgment.we address each in turn.
dismissal for failure to prosecute 
the district court dismissed lal suit under rule b on february.rule b states that u nless the dismissal order states otherwise,a dismissal under this subdivision b operates as an adjudication on the merits.the district court order dismissing lal action did not state otherwise and was therefore an adjudication on the merits.because the dismissal order ended lal suit on the merits,it is a final decision appealable under.
federal rule of appellate procedure a a provides,in a civil case the notice of appeal must be filed with the district clerk within days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.lal filed her notice of appeal on march,over one year after the district court dismissed her action.under the version of federal rule of appellate procedure a a vi then in effect,the deadline for filing a notice of appeal started to run from the time the court entered an order disposing of a rule motion,so long as the rule motion was filed no later than days after the judgment was entered.however,lal filed her rule motion on january,long after the court february,dismissal order.we therefore do not have jurisdiction to review the district court dismissal of lal action for failure to prosecute.
relief from judgment 
federal rule of civil procedure b provides,in relevant part 
on motion and just terms,the court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment,order,or proceeding for the following reasons 
any other reason that justifies relief.
a motion under rule b must be made within a reasonable time.c.we use rule b sparingly as an equitable remedy to prevent manifest injustice.united states alpine land reservoir,cir.to receive relief under rule b,a party must demonstrate extraordinary circumstances which prevented or rendered him unable to prosecute his case.tani,at citing martella marine cooks stewards union,cir per curiam.
an attorney actions are typically chargeable to his or her client and do not ordinarily constitute extraordinary circumstances warranting relief from judgment under rule b.see link wabash,d ringgold worrall,cir.but there are exceptions to this general principle.in community dental services tani,cir,we joined the third,sixth and federal circuits in holding that an attorney gross negligence constitutes such an extraordinary circumstance.we followed the third circuit in defining gross negligence as neglect so gross that it is inexcusable.id.at quoting boughner sec y of health,educ.welfare,cir.
the attorney in tani virtually abandoned his client by failing to proceed with his client defense despite court orders to do so and deliberately deceived his client about what he was doing or not doing.id.at.the district court issued a default judgment.when tani learned of the default judgment,he promptly hired a new attorney and filed a motion for relief from the default judgment under rule b.id.at.the district court denied the motion.
we held that the behavior of tani first attorney constituted gross negligence and that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to grant tani relief under rule b.we wrote,c onduct on the part of a client alleged representative that results in the client receiving practically no representation at all clearly constitutes gross negligence,and vitiat es the agency relationship that underlies our general policy of attributing to the client the acts of his attorney.id.at.
we apply tani to this case and hold that an attorney gross negligence resulting in dismissal with prejudice for failure to prosecute constitutes an extraordinary circumstance under rule b warranting relief from judgment.dismissal with prejudice under rule b for failure to prosecute is the converse of a default judgment.in both instances,the consequence of the attorney action or inaction is a loss of the case on the merits.the only significant difference is that the plaintiff rather than the defendant suffers the adverse judgment.
our holding is consistent with latshaw trainer wortham,cir.the in latshaw requested rule b relief from a judgment resulting from her acceptance of an offer of judgment under federal rule of civil procedure.id.at.she stated that she accepted the offer based on her attorney coercion and erroneous legal advice,and she argued that his conduct constituted gross negligence meriting rule b relief.id.we distinguished default judgments,which are disfavored,from rule judgments,which are actively supported by courts.id.at.we therefore declined to extend tani to allow relief from judgments entered under rule,holding that the attorney conduct,even if grossly negligent,did not constitute grounds for rule b relief.
a dismissal for failure to prosecute under rule b is much more like a default judgment than a rule judgment.we based our decision in tani on the policy considerations we have recognized as underlying default judgments and rule b.tani,at.the same policy considerations underlie dismissal for failure to prosecute.we have stated that dismissal under rule b is so harsh a penalty it should be imposed as a sanction only in extreme circumstances.dahl city of huntington beach,cir.this is almost identical to our stance on default judgments,which are appropriate only in extreme circumstances.falk allen,cir per curiam.
it is obvious that the conduct of lal attorney constituted gross negligence.the facts recounted in lal sworn statement are not disputed.the similarities between the attorney conduct in tani and spahr conduct in this case are striking.first,both attorneys virtually abandoned their client s by failing to proceed with their client s case despite court orders to do so.tani,at.the attorney in tani filed the answer late and never provided plaintiffs with a copy.he failed to contact plaintiff for preliminary settlement discussions despite being ordered to do so,failed to oppose plaintiff motion to strike the answer,and failed to attend various hearings.id.at.spahr failed to make initial rule disclosures after being ordered to do so failed to meet,confer,and participate in the joint case management conference after being ordered to do so and failed to attend hearings.
second,both the attorney in tani and spahr deliberately misle d their clients and depriv ed them of the opportunity to take action to preserve their rights.id.tani attorney explicitly represented to tani that the case was proceeding properly.id.tani only learned of the default judgment against him when the judgment was mailed to his office.id.at.similarly,spahr continued to tell lal that her case was moving forward even after it had been dismissed.in,spahr told lal that the next meeting on her case would be in two to three months,even though the case management conference was scheduled for january.although the district court had dismissed lal action for failure to prosecute on february,spahr told her in march that defendants needed more time for discovery.on september,spahr lied to lal,telling her he had scheduled depositions in her case for november.on october,spahr told lal that he had her suit in state court.on october,spahr told lal he was filing a motion in her case.throughout october,spahr repeatedly assured lal that he would give her copies of all of the documents he falsely claimed to have filed in her case.in these circumstances,we hold that spahr acted with gross negligence and that lal has demonstrated extraordinary circumstances beyond her control that merit relief under rule b.
after expressing doubt about whether tani should be applied to grant rule b relief from a dismissal for failure to prosecute un
