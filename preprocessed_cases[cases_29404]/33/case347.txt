john winfield was convicted in missouri state court of multiple counts of murder,assault,and armed criminal action and was sentenced to death.after his conviction and sentence were affirmed by the missouri supreme court on direct appeal,he moved for post conviction relief in the state circuit court.that motion was denied after an evidentiary hearing,and the missouri supreme court affirmed.winfield then petitioned the federal district court for a writ of habeas corpus.the petition was denied,and winfield was granted a certificate of appealability on three issues,all of which have been briefed and argued.we now affirm.
john winfield met carmelita donald in,and she and her son mykale donald eventually moved in with him.they subsequently had a daughter,symone winfield.they had a difficult relationship,which carmelita ended in the spring of.she moved into a second floor apartment on page street in louis,missouri with her sister,melody donald,and their friend arthea sanders.winfield lived with his family about one block away on liberty street.
on the night of september,carmelita went out with her then boyfriend tony reynolds.winfield was unaware of this relationship and called her apartment numerous times between and pm that evening trying to reach her.he spoke with melody and asked where carmelita was.melody replied that she did not know,and winfield told melody to have carmelita call him when she got home.later that evening winfield went to carmelita apartment looking for her.by that time melody had learned from arthea that carmelita was out with reynolds,so the two women decided to lie to winfield and told him that she was with arthea mother.melody then went downstairs to shawnee murphy apartment in order to call arthea parents to let them know what had been said to winfield.when melody returned to her apartment,she discovered that winfield had destroyed some of her furniture.as he was leaving the apartment,winfield remarked that he would kick carmelita ass.
when carmelita returned home around midnight,winfield was waiting for her.he forced her into an adjacent parking lot to talk and repeatedly asked carmelita whether she was having a relationship with reynolds,which she denied.melody and shawnee watched the altercation from shawnee apartment,but arthea went outside and slashed the tires on winfield car.then arthea returned to shawnee apartment and told the others to call the police.
winfield,seeing that his tires had been slashed,went to his car,retrieved his gun,and went into shawnee apartment.he shot arthea in the head from close range,killing her.he then turned the gun on carmelita,said f uck you bitch and shot her numerous times.carmelita did not die,but she suffered multiple gunshot wounds and underwent emergency brain surgery.she was left completely blind and facially disfigured.winfield then shot and killed shawnee and turned the gun towards shawnee guest,james johnson,and melody.melody escaped out of the back door of the apartment and ran next door to call the police.johnson struggled with winfield in an effort to gain control of the gun.winfield tried to shoot him,but the gun either jammed or was empty so he hit johnson on the head with the gun and fled the scene.
the police arrested winfield the following day.after being informed of his rights,winfield told the police that he had thrown the gun in a creek near a newly constructed bridge.the gun was not found,but officers searched winfield home and discovered caliber bullets in his bedroom,the same type of ammunition used in the shooting.
winfield retained attorneys scott rosenblum and brad kessler to represent him.at that time the two attorneys worked together in rosenblum law firm.they agreed that kessler was to handle the guilt phase of the trial and rosenblum was to handle the penalty phase.the relationship between the lawyers deteriorated,and kessler left the firm three months prior to trial.he took case files with him,but not any of the penalty phase materials necessary for rosenblum portion of the defense.
two months prior to trial winfield filed a malpractice action against his attorneys,alleging that they had failed to consult with him adequately regarding the defense,that they had failed to investigate in preparation for his defense,and that they had failed to prepare a meaningful defense winfield nevertheless continued to allow kessler and rosenblum to represent him.he never informed the court of his lawsuit or of any problems with counsel,and he never asked the court to appoint new counsel.
trial began on july,and from the outset the defense admitted winfield acts on the night of september.the theory of the defense was that winfield actions that evening were not deliberate,but rather that he had acted in the heat of the moment.winfield testified in his own defense and admitted his acts,but claimed that he had not planned on hurting nobody and that he had just snapped.he also admitted initially lying to the police when he claimed that another person had used his gun.the jury found him guilty of two counts of first degree murder,two counts of first degree assault,and four counts of armed criminal action in violation of state law.
at the penalty phase of the trial the state presented a certified copy of winfield prior conviction for receiving stolen property.carmelita also testified that winfield had abused her in the past,including an incident where he put a gun to her head until she submitted to his sexual demands.the state also called arthea mother,melody sanders,and shawnee mother,gerry murphy.the penalty defense was presented by rosenblum who sought to portray winfield as an otherwise law abiding family man who just snapped the night of the murders.the defense called four witnesses winfield father john edmund,his stepmother marsha edmond,his brother david winfield,and a family friend from church,rosalie bell.these witnesses testified that winfield had a good relationship with his children,that he provided for the family,that he was a great family man,and that he had generally been law abiding.winfield did not testify during the penalty phase.after deliberating for almost six hours,the jury recommended a sentence of death which was imposed by the court.the circuit court also sentenced winfield to life imprisonment plus fifteen years on the two assault counts and to seventy five years on each count of armed criminal action.
winfield filed a direct appeal of his conviction and sentence,which the missouri supreme court affirmed.state winfield.winfield then changed defense counsel and filed a motion for post conviction relief in the circuit court of louis county pursuant to missouri supreme court rule.he raised various claims in his motion including ineffective assistance of counsel based on many grounds,but conflict of interest was not among them.he later sought to amend his filings to include a conflict of interest claim alleging that the falling out between his lawyers had created divided loyalties and that his pending lawsuit against them created an actual conflict of interest.the circuit court ruled that the amendment was not timely and was thus procedurally barred.
the circuit court held an evidentiary hearing at which various witnesses testified,including attorneys kessler and rosenblum,kessler assistant linda bates,lisa jones and melissa niehoff from the state prosecutor office.the circuit court later issued its decision denying winfield motion for post conviction relief.he appealed the decision to the missouri supreme court and attempted to include his tardy conflict of interest claim in a separate pro se brief.the court clerk refused to accept the pro se brief for filing because winfield was represented by counsel and the claim had not been raised by his counsel in his submission.the missouri supreme court affirmed winfield conviction and sentence.winfield state,banc.
winfield then filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri,alleging fourteen errors.many of these claims asserted ineffective assistance of counsel,especially of penalty counsel,but they also included a separate claim of conflict of interest based on the malpractice suit winfield had lodged against his attorneys as well as the problems between the two lawyers.the district court denied the petition.it concluded that winfield counsel had not been ineffective and that his conflict of interest claim was procedurally barred because winfield had failed to include that claim in his initial motion for post conviction relief and had only asserted it in the rejected pro se brief.the district court concluded that the state circuit court had thus disposed of the claim on an independent and adequate state ground.winfield sought to appeal,and we certified the following issues whether winfield counsel was ineffective in the penalty phase for failure to investigate,to present particular witnesses,and to call him to testify,and whether winfield conflict of interest claim was procedurally barred from habeas review.
winfield argues that both of his attorneys were ineffective during the penalty phase of the trial.he claims that penalty counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and call certain witnesses and that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to ensure that he was able to testify during the penalty phase.
we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.lyons luebbers,cir kenley armontrout,cir reviewing claims of ineffective assistance de novo.because the ineffectiveness claim has been adjudicated on the merits in state court,habeas relief is appropriate only if the state court adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.
to be eligible for habeas relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel winfield must meet the two part test announced in strickland washington,d.he must first establish that counsel representation was constitutionally deficient,which requires a showing that counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.at.wiggins smith,d.if he establishes that,winfield must then show that the deficient performance prejudiced his defense.strickland,at.this requires proving that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel ineffectiveness,the result would have been more favorable to winfield.id.at.a reasonable probability is one sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.wiggins,at.merely showing a conceivable effect is not enough.winfield must demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that absent counsel inadequate representation,the jury would not have sentenced him to death.kenley,at.
winfield first claims that penalty counsel did not conduct a proper investigation or present particularized facts in support of his penalty phase theory and failed to call certain witnesses who would have been supportive.winfield claims that his children symone winfield and mykale donald,his friend john sutherland,his mother evylyn winfield,and his grandmother delores dent would have told the jury how he was the man of the house and a good father,would have described the traumatic events winfield suffered in the years leading up to the murders,and would have explained why he just snapped the night of the murders.
counsel decision not to call particular witnesses during the penalty phase of trial must be viewed as of the time it was made,preston delo,cir,and his decision is presumed to be one of trial strategy unless clearly shown to be otherwise.rousan state,banc.the circuit court concluded that penalty counsel decision not to call these witnesses was part of his trial strategy and that their testimony would have been cumulative to that already offered,and this decision was affirmed by the missouri supreme court.winfield,at.the record reveals that neither child wanted to testify,symone would have testified about the hardship that winfield actions caused her mother carmelita,and mykale would have testified as to past violent incidents involving winfield.rather than call these children,rosenblum called winfield father,john edmond,and stepmother,marsha edmond,who both testified to winfield good relationship with his children.even carmelita admitted on cross examination that winfield loved his children.
not only was the decision not to call the children reasonable trial strategy,but their testimony would have been cumulative to that which was introduced.see bucklew luebbers,cir counsel not ineffective for not calling witnesses who would damage his case or whose testimony would be cumulative schlup armontrout,cir counsel not ineffective for not calling a witness who would damage the defense case hall luebbers,cir counsel not ineffective for failing to adduce cumulative evidence.similarly,the decision not to call winfield friend john sutherland was reasonable since sutherland had a criminal history and penalty counsel testified that he had tried to separate winfield from contacts like that.we agree with the district court that the state court conclusions in respect to these particular witnesses were not contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,nor were they based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.
winfield did not raise the arguments regarding the failure to call his mother evylyn or his grandmother delores in the state court proceedings.because a federal habeas petitioner claims must rely on the same factual and legal bases relied on in state court,schleeper groose,cir,winfield has defaulted these particular claims.his default will be excused only if winfield shows cause and prejudice or miscarriage of justice,coleman thompson,d,neither of which he has done.because apparently false statements related to winfield alibi defense had been made in depositions by his mother and grandmother and they would have been revealed to the jury,their testimony would likely have done more harm than good.winfield has not shown he was prejudiced by the failure to call them.
winfield further complains that penalty counsel never interviewed his aunt katherine,his cousins maurice patton and frank elliot,or his friend darrell jefferson.he asserts that failure to interview and call these witnesses establishes ineffectiveness.since the district court did not address this claim,he argues that its decision should be reversed.
counsel is required to make a reasonable investigation in preparing his defense,including reasonably deciding when to cut off further investigation.strickland,at.penalty counsel admitted that he did not interview maurice patton,frank elliot,darrell johnson,or katherine,but winfield has not shown that this prejudiced his defense.the missouri supreme court found that had these witnesses been called,their testimony would have been cumulative and consequently they did not need to be called.winfield,at.see also hall,at bucklew state,banc failing to present cumulative evidence is not ineffective assistance of counsel.moreover,darrell jefferson had a criminal record,and experienced penalty counsel had already made a reasonable decision not to call a different individual with a criminal background because he did not want the jury to associate winfield with criminals.katherine would have provided testimony critical of victim carmelita,which penalty counsel wanted to avoid since it could alienate the jury.we conclude that the failure to present cumulative testimony is not contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,federal law,hall,at,and that winfield suffered no prejudice by counsel not calling these witnesses.
winfield also argues that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to ensure that he was able to testify during the penalty phase of the proceedings.although attorney rosenblum was responsible for the penalty phase,winfield argues that attorney kessler knew of his desire to testify and should have intervened to ensure that he was able to testify.
the state circuit court held an evidentiary hearing to develop the issue of whether winfield had indicated to counsel that he wanted to testify in the penalty phase.rosenblum testified that he had talked with winfield about his right to testify,that he had advised him not to exercise that right,and that winfield never told him that he wanted to testify.attorney kessler and his assistant linda bates testified that at a time when rosenblum was not present,winfield told kessler that he wished to testify.kessler testified that he told rosenblum of winfield desire to testify immediately before the defense rested at the penalty phase,but that he was wave d off.rosenblum denied that kessler ever told him that winfield wanted to testify.
the circuit court considered all of the evidence and found that rosenblum testimony was credible but that kessler,bates,and winfield were not.the circuit court found that winfield had been informed of his right to testify at the penalty phase,had been advised by penalty counsel not to exercise that right,and made no protest when the defense rested its case.the court not only found that winfield had waived his right to testify at the penalty phase,but also that he had not demonstrated prejudice from penalty counsel failure to call him to the stand.the missouri supreme court determined that the circuit court findings were not clearly unreasonable,winfield,at,and affirmed.
after examining the record,the federal district court concluded that the circuit court factual findings were fairly supported and that winfield had not demonstrated prejudice from his failure to testify.we review the district court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.frey schuetzle,cir we presume that state court findings of fact are correct and will reverse only if they are not supported by the record.whitehead dormire,cir bounds delo,cir.
while a defendant has a right to testify during the penalty phase of his trial,waiver of that right is properly found where,as here,the defendant did not object when his counsel rested without calling him to testify.united states bernloehr,cir.winfield claim that he did not waive his right to testify was fully explored at the evidentiary hearing in the post conviction proceedings,and the state circuit court found that penalty counsel testimony was credible,unlike that of winfield,kessler,and bates.the circuit court was affirmed by the missouri supreme court.winfield,at.issues of credibility are left to the discretion of the state courts,pittman black,cir,and nothing in the record suggests that the state court erred in its determinations.see frey,at.
moreover,even if we were to find that counsel was deficient by not calling winfield to testify,the record indicates that he suffered no prejudice.not only would winfield testimony have been cumulative,he would have denied committing the murders which would have been contradicted by his trial testimony and the jury verdict.indeed,this was the reason penalty counsel advised him not to testify.after examining the record,we conclude that the state court did not err in its application of federal law to the issue of whether counsel was ineffective for failure to call winfield at the penalty phase or make an unreasonable determination of the facts.the district court did not err in denying relief on this ground.
winfield complains that the district court erred in finding his conflict of interest claim procedurally barred.he contends that his conflict of interest claim could have been defaulted only if the last state court to consider it had expressly denied it on the basis of an independent and adequate state ground and that the missouri supreme court had relied on a nonexistent rule against pro se briefs from represented parties.in addition,winfield claims that his counsel brief had preserved the conflict of interest claim because it is closely related to the ineffective assistance arguments made in the brief.
the state responds that under missouri supreme court rule,winfield conflict of interest claim was not timely filed and that this procedural default serves as an independent and adequate state ground to bar consideration of the claim at this time.it contends that a rule default is a separate and distinct issue from whether the refusal to accept winfield pro se brief was based on an applicable procedural rule.the state argues that review of the conflict of interest claim would be proper only if winfield had demonstrated cause and prejudice or actual innocence,which he has not done.
although a habeas claim need not present an exact duplicate of one raised in the state proceedings,odem hopkins,cir,it must present the same factual and legal bases as in state court in order for the claim to be preserved.anderson groose,cir.winfield state law claims presented by his attorney made no mention of a possible conflict of interest or of the malpractice suit he had filed against rosenblum and kessler.we therefore conclude that counsel submissions did not preserve that claim for habeas review.
the more difficult question is whether the conflict of interest issue was preserved by winfield mention of it in his pro se brief,despite the refusal of the clerk of the missouri supreme court to file it and his counsel subsequent failure to raise the claim in his official filing.to our knowledge we have not previously been presented with a case where a claim defaulted in the lower state court was not addressed in the state supreme court because the clerk refused to accept a pro se filing from a party represented by counsel 
we are prohibited from reviewing an issue that the state court has resolved on an adequate and independent state ground,including procedural default.reagan norris,cir.the procedural rule relied upon by the state court must be firmly established,regularly followed and readily ascertainable when it was applied,however.malone vasquez,cir.
it is far from clear that the missouri supreme court has a clearly established and regularly followed rule prohibiting defendants represented by counsel from filing a pro se brief.we noted in clemmons delo,cir,that n o rule of court or reported missouri case of which we are aware specifies the circumstances under which missouri appellate courts allow pro se briefs sometimes missouri courts allow pro se briefs,and sometimes they do not.that is their prerogative.id.at.
the state has not demonstrated that since our decision in clemmons the missouri supreme court has provided a clear and ascertainable rule.quite the contrary.the state j letter submitted following oral argument in this court concedes that on numerous occasions the missouri supreme court has accepted pro se briefs filed by defendants already represented by counsel.see,state wise,state,banc state clemmons,banc state guinan,banc state,banc state bannister,banc state laws,banc state peterson,mooring state,state turley.
the state contends,however,that over the past twelve years there have not been any pro se briefs accepted by the missouri supreme court when the author was represented by counsel.it argues that the record is thus very different from the one we surveyed in clemmons.while this may be true,a change in the practice of the missouri supreme court alone is not enough.for the rule on which it relied must have been a clear and ascertainable rule here there is no such rule we conclude that winfield conflict of interest claim is not procedurally barred by the court clerk decision not to file his pro se brief.see hall,at clemmons,at.
that is not the end of the inquiry,however.the state alleges that winfield failure to file a timely conflict of interest claim with the circuit court bars habeas review,regardless of the effect of the missouri supreme court clerk refusal to file winfield pro se brief.winfield responds that his failure to comply with the filing period in rule should not prevent us from reaching the procedural issue.he alleges that in order to bar review,the last state court to consider the case must actually have relied on the procedural bar as an independent basis for its disposition of the case.harris reed,d.
missouri supreme court rule provides that a motion for post conviction relief must in
