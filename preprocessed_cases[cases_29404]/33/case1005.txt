we have for review a referee report regarding six consolidated cases,arising from nine different florida bar investigations into the conduct of elizabeth aileen broome.we have jurisdiction.see art.v.const.
we approve the referee findings of fact and recommendations as to guilt,but disapprove of the recommendation as to sanction,imposing a suspension instead.indeed,were it not for the substantial mitigating evidence in this case,the sanction might have been disbarment.
a.the facts 
the report of the referee found broome guilty of separate rule violations of eighteen different bar rules,spanning a period of almost seven years,from march through october,and impacting several different clients.only four of the rule violations involved solely failures to respond to bar or grievance committee inquiries.
neither the bar nor broome took issue with the facts as found by the referee,although the bar took issue with the referee failure to make certain findings.because the facts are not at issue,except as they impact what the appropriate discipline should be,and because they are lengthy,they are only briefly summarized here,by case.
