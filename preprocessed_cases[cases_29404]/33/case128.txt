during the course of protracted litigation,one party discharged the law firm that had been representing it,and replaced it with two solo practitioners.prior to its discharge,the law firm obtained a million charging lien that will be extinguished absent a favorable disposition for its former client.it moved therefore to intervene in the continuing litigation as a matter of right.the district court denied the motion.
this appeal from the denial of that motion raises several thorny issues whether a discharged lawyer who has a charging lien it believes is in jeopardy by ongoing litigation possesses an interest justifying intervention as of right in that litigation whether the discharged attorney interests are adequately represented in the ongoing litigation and whether the former attorney moved timely to intervene.a lawyer,like a laborer,is of course worthy of his hire and is entitled to be paid for his work.yet,since the relationship rests on a foundation of trust and confidence,when a client loses confidence in counsel,public policy generally demands that the client have the prerogative to terminate the relationship at any time,without cause.
although choosing between these competing notions is not required to resolve this of the other issues will resolve the conflicting policies presented by these competing notions nonetheless give context to the discussion that follows.
background 
the underlying dispute in this case is between gbj corporation,formerly represented by the professional corporation butler,fitzgerald potter butler,law firm,or appellant and sequa corporation.that dispute arose when sequa allegedly breached a consulting contract.under the consulting agreement,gbj corporation was to provide consulting services to sequa on the use of leveraged lease transactions for sequa to shelter its tax liability.the main suit has been litigated before the district court for the better part of nine years,and now reappears before us following the denial of butler motion before the district court to join the suit as a party in its own right.the sole issue is whether the butler law former counsel in its action against intervene in the suit to protect its asserted interest in the outcome.
three years after butler served the initial complaint upon sequa on behalf of gbj,and in the midst of trial,on april,gbj dismissed butler as counsel.in june of that year a magistrate judge determined that the dismissal was without cause and,pursuant to new york law,see judiciary law mckinney,fixed a charging lien in the amount of in favor of butler upon any recovery gbj had in its action against sequa.the charging lien is the subject matter of butler appeal.
after relieving butler as lead counsel,gbj retained two solo practitioners,charles manuel,manuel and james jones,jones,who tried the case before the district court for days after butler dismissal,eventually procuring a sizable verdict for their client on the breach of contract claims.see sequa gelmin,civ,wl,at.attorneys manuel and jones subsequently appeared before us when both sequa and gbj appealed portions of the district court decision on the merits,and have since served as gbj attorneys of record after we vacated those portions of the district court judgment relating to the calculation of gbj damages tax recapture issue and the fiduciary obligations of gbj president to sequa fiduciary duty issue.see sequa gbj,cir.the litigation of the remanded issues continues to date.
butler contends that a series of incidents indicated its charging lien was in jeopardy.it says that in late,following our august,remand,the newly retained counsel for gbj contacted the butler law firm for assistance on the fiduciary duty issue.the law firm asserts that it acquiesced to this request out of a desire to protect its million charging lien,realizing that it could only recover upon it if gbj succeeded in the underlying litigation.thus,it provided assistance on the fiduciary duty issue,and on march,attempted to submit an amicus curiae brief separate from the one submitted on gbj behalf.when the district court rejected the amicus brief in august,a single memorandum,apparently a collaboration between attorney jones and the butler law firm,was offered in support of gbj position and filed in.
as litigation of the fiduciary duty issue proceeded,butler alleges that gbj new counsel solicited the firm aid in litigating the remaining dispute,the apparently more complex tax recapture issue.in a march,order the district court had referred the tax recapture issue to a special master,and butler claims that its subsequent assistance to gbj on this issue was exhaustive,including prepping gbj counsel on discovery methods and trial techniques in advance of a july hearing before the special master identifying and arranging for a tax expert to refute sequa expert report purchasing two hearing transcripts for gbj in the course of the sessions before the special master and drafting gbj august,memorandum,which was submitted to the special master.butler provided this aid purportedly because it had been forced to make a hobson choice either expend its own time and money to ensure that gbj would succeed in its claims against sequa,so that butler could later recover its charging lien,or do nothing and likely lose the lien.
butler avers that as a result of these repeated requests,it became increasingly concerned regarding the ability of attorneys manuel and jones to litigate gbj claims successfully against sequa,an adversary the butler firm describes as possessing unlimited financial and personnel resources.while purportedly not questioning the competence of the two solo practitioners,butler maintains they are not receiving adequate financial support from their client,and are either unable or unwilling to litigate the claims without such support.the law firm further notes that it has expended approximately hours on the dispute subsequent to its discharge.attorneys manuel and jones counter that butler has exaggerated its role in the litigation,and declare that they,not butler,have performed the lion share of the work,toiling for a combined hours on the case.
butler declares that two incidents were the proverbial straws that broke the camel back,and induced it to seek leave of court to cease acting as an outside adviser to gbj,and instead intervene in the action in its own right.the first incident was a request by gbj in september that butler pay for the special master fee following the hearing on the tax recapture issue.the law firm allegedly balked at this request,viewing it as a further sign of the inability of gbj to litigate its claims effectively.it cites the second incident as further proof of gbj dire financial position,that is,the fact that sequa,gbj adversary,eventually paid the fee.finally,on september,attorney manuel and an attorney for butler had an apparent confrontation when manuel discovered that butler was preparing a motion to intervene,after it had previously assured him that it would remain disassociated from the litigation.four days later,by a letter dated september,butler sought leave of the district court to move,pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure,to intervene in the underlying action.butler letter also referenced permissive intervention under rule b,but the gist of the motion was directed to intervention as of right under rule a.
at the november,oral argument before district judge deborah batts on the motion to intervene,contrary positions were expressed respecting whether gbj opposed butler motion.attorney manuel,as counsel for gbj,represented that gbj principal,jeffrey gelmin,had said in no uncertain terms that he had no intention of seeing butler,fitzgerald potter intervene in this case.timothy butler,who claimed to represent gelmin on other who,although not a member of the butler law firm,served as an intermediary with that that gelmin had informed him that he took no position on the motion to intervene.according to timothy butler,gelmin had also said that he did not feel that gbj was capable of seeing this through to the end,that we do not have the resources or the ability to see it through.predictably,sequa opposed the motion to intervene.
in a december,order judge batts denied butler motion to intervene under rule.she ruled that butler did not meet three of the four requirements for rule a intervention.from the denial of its motion,butler appeals.we affirm.
discussion 
we review the denial of a motion to intervene for abuse of discretion.united states city of new york,cir.this standard reflects the view that district courts,due to their proximity to the dispute,usually have a better sense of the case factual nuances upon which a motion to intervene often turns.united states pitney bowes,cir.
rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure governs intervention as a matter of right by a into an ongoing litigation.it provides that 
u pon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action 
when the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and the applicant is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the applicant ability to protect that interest,unless the applicant interest is adequately represented by existing parties.
as the language of the rule suggests,a putative intervenor as of right must meet four criteria the applicant must file a timely motion claim an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action be so situated that without intervention the disposition of the action may impair that interest and show that the interest is not already adequately represented by existing parties.pitney bowes,at.a intervenor failure to meet all of these requirements justifies the denial of its motion.id.
butler was found deficient in three of the requirements specifically,the district court held its motion was untimely,the law firm had not established it possessed an interest in the action justifying intervention,and even if it had such an interest,that interest was already adequately protected by counsel for gbj.because we think the trial court ruling finds support under two of its three rationales,we need not rule on the third one.
i the interest requirement 
the trial court sustained its denial of butler motion by holding first that movants have not demonstrated that they have an interest of the sort contemplated by rule.we have not had occasion to address whether a discharged attorney charging lien is a sufficient interest to support intervention as of right into a client underlying action.we recognize that there are arguments both for and against allowing discharged attorneys to intervene to protect their legal fees,and those arguments merit comment.but,because we conclude the order appealed from finds sufficient support on other grounds,we need not resolve that close question in this case.
new york charging liens 
new york statutory charging lien,see judiciary law mckinney,is a device to protect counsel against the knavery of his client,whereby through his effort,the attorney acquires an interest in the client cause of action.in re city of new york.the lien is predicated on the idea that the attorney has by his skill and effort obtained the judgment,and hence should have a lien thereon for his compensation,in analogy to the lien which a mechanic has upon any article which he manufactures.williams ingersoll.
butler charging lien,fixed by the magistrate at million,is of obvious value to the law firm.further,the lien is clearly put at some risk by the proceedings below,for under of the new york judiciary law,the law firm may only collect on the lien in the event of a verdict in gbj favor.if gbj claims against sequa do not result in a substantial judgment for gbj,butler charging lien will be extinguished.see judiciary law from the commencement of an action the attorney who appears for a party has a lien upon his client cause of action which attaches to a verdict,report,determination,decision,judgment or final order in his client favor.see also gordon shirley duke assocs.in re shirley duke assocs,cir the rationale of section is that an attorney should have a lien for his litigation efforts that bring a fund into existence it is upon the fund thus created,either by judgment or settlement,that the lien is imposed.
despite the substantial value of the charging lien,and its potential impairment by an adverse judgment,it is not certain whether this lien qualifies as an interest sufficient to justify butler intervention as of right into the dispute between gbj and sequa.to begin with,it is questionable whether a discharged attorney intervention into a former client action fits within the language of the federal rules.rule a provides in pertinent part that the putative intervenor must claim an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action.a emphasis added.the interest of discharged counsel seemingly is not in the subject of the underlying action,the contract dispute that precipitated the litigation,but is rather an interest in recovering delinquent attorney fees following an award in favor of its former client.an analogous case is dental,certified alloy,cir,in which we affirmed the denial of a general liability insurer petition to intervene as of right in a breach of contract action brought against one of its insureds.in holding that the insurer did not have an interest justifying intervention,we relied in part upon the reasoning that the insurer interest was only in its potential liability following an adverse judgment against its insured,and not in the underlying breach of contract action.see id.at.
similarly,the interest of discharged counsel in their attorney fees is unrelated to the underlying cause of action.hence,that interest does not present a particularly persuasive argument for intervention.crown fin.winthrop lawrence,cir per curiam affirming district court denial of petition to intervene by purchaser of land with lien upon it because purchaser did not have an interest in original action in which creditor gained the security interest in the land.but see united states eilberg,holding that law firm may intervene in suit against former partner based upon contention that they were entitled to disputed distributive fee,and rejecting argument that firm only had an interest in the contractual arrangement amongst firm partners and not the subject of the underlying action.
under state law,however,butler charging lien may indeed constitute an interest in the underlying action itself.new york precedent,which governs attorney charging liens issued by federal courts in new york,see russian news agency russian kurier,cir,defines a charging lien as giving an equitable ownership interest in the client cause of action,rather than providing for a mere priority of payment in favor of the attorney,lmwt realty davis agency.under this reasoning a client who enlists the services of counsel on a standard contingency fee arrangement equitably assigns a proportionate share of the cause of action to counsel.the client is left with only the remaining balance of any eventual judgment after the attorney receives his agreed upon share.in re city of new york,at.butler charging lien therefore represents at least arguably an equitable interest in the underlying cause of action.
client control of litigation 
distinct from the question of whether a charging lien falls within the language of rule are the public policy repercussions that arise when discharged counsel is permitted to intervene as of right in his former client action to protect an interest in legal fees.the fifth circuit appears to be the only federal appellate court to have grappled expressly with the problem of terminated attorneys as putative intervenors.gilbert johnson,cir discharged attorney may intervene as of right when he has a lien upon his former client cause of action gaines dixie carriers,cir per curiam intervention as of right by former counsel based upon contingent fee contract.the ninth circuit has avoided the issue on two occasions.venegas skaggs,cir,aff sub nom.venegas mitchell,d stockton united states,cir.but while the fifth circuit has adhered to its holdings in gaines and gilbert allowing interv
