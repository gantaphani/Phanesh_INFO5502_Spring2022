frank soto carrillo appeals from the judgment entered after a jury convicted him of first degree murder.we reject his claim that his constitutional rights were violated because the prosecution would not ask federal immigration officials to issue special visas for two exculpatory witnesses who lived in mexico.we also reject his three claims of instructional error and affirm the judgment.in a companion petition for habeas corpus,carrillo contends that his trial counsel had a prejudicial conflict of interest because he was also representing the son of a key prosecution witness who was facing a murder charge.we hold that no prejudice occurred and therefore deny the petition.
facts and procedural history 
at on january,daniel ramirez was shot and killed in front of a taco stand in the san fernando valley.in july,a jury convicted frank soto carrillo of first degree murder for that crime.the evidence at trial showed that at least two different guns were fired at ramirez,who sustained three gunshot wounds.karina orozco told the police that she heard shots being fired from three guns,but saw only one person who was holding a gun,and identified carrillo as having been that person.she also signed a statement that she saw carrillo kill ramirez.orozco also identified carrillo at his preliminary hearing,but at trial backed off from her previous identifications and claimed she had been pressured by the police to identify carrillo.
lionel rudy chavarria also witnessed the shooting.he saw appellant standing in a group of men when he heard four or five gunshots.chavarria saw sparks in front of people,including in front of carrillo torso.chavarria gave this information to the police after being arrested days later.he hoped that by doing so,he would get leniency.he did do some jail time,but thought he might have received a lighter sentence 
a los angeles police gang detail officer testified that carrillo and ramirez were members of rival gangs.carrillo belonged to columbus street and ramirez was a member of vincent town.a columbus street gang member had been killed by a vincent town gang member nine days before ramirez was killed and the officer believed that ramirez was murdered in retaliation.rosa garcia,who once belonged to columbus street and was carrillo former girlfriend,testified that she was in an apartment with carrillo days after ramirez was shot.according to garcia,carrillo asked if she had heard about what happened to ramirez and said we had it taken care of and i had that taken care of.the vincent town gang member who set all this in motion by killing a columbus street gang member was the of garcia sister and carrillo told garcia she could be next and that they were going to her house to look for the original shooter.
based on this evidence,the jury found carrillo guilty of first degree murder,subd.a and also found true allegations that he personally discharged a firearm,proximately causing great bodily injury and death,subd.d,personally used a firearm,subd.b,personally discharged a firearm,subd.c,and committed his crime for the benefit of a criminal street gang,subd.b a along with two prior conviction allegations,subd.b,this led the court to impose a state prison sentence of years to life for the murder conviction,years to life for the firearm discharge causing death or injury allegation and years for the gang benefit allegation.the remaining sentence enhancement allegations were dismissed.
carrillo primary issue on appeal stems from his unsuccessful efforts to have the prosecutor and the trial court help him obtain evidence from,or secure the trial attendance of,witnesses outside the united states.in february,carrillo brought a motion asking the court to appoint a commissioner to examine by way of written interrogatories two witnesses who lived in mexico.et a declaration from defense counsel stated that abraham prado and maria torrez,who lived in mexico and could not be compelled to testify,were necessary and material witnesses.according to defense counsel,prado was present when ramirez was shot and asked ramirez who did it.ramirez answered with a dying declaration that the shooters were the same as those that did it last time.when the victim was last shot,carrillo was living in mexico with torrez the prosecutor filed a written opposition that raised the following grounds the statements supposedly made to prado did not satisfy the requirements of section because they lacked foundation that ramirez,who was shot in the back,even knew who had shot him the statements did not qualify as dying declarations under evidence code section because prado told the police that ramirez had said he was alright,meaning that ramirez statements were not made under the fear of impending death and because prado statements were not proper under section,torrez testimony was rendered irrelevant.the trial court denied the motion on april,because it did not believe there was any enforcement mechanism in the event of perjury and because it believed the section procedure applied to only minor foundational matters,not to critical evidence of innocence or guilt that should be tested by.
carrillo followed this up with a motion to compel the prosecutor to ask federal immigration officials to exercise their discretion to issue a special parole visa to prado and torrez so they could enter the country for the sole purpose of testifying at trial.the motion was not supported by declarations or other evidence.based on a federal appellate decision,carrillo argued that the prosecution refusal to even request those visas denied his due process rights to a fair trial and to present a defense.a later supplemental brief included an august letter from a defense investigator summarizing his interview of prado.according to the unauthenticated letter,prado was a friend of ramirez and a distant relative of carrillo.he had a clear view of the shooters none of the shooters were frank carrillo.prado ran to ramirez,who said the person who shot him was the same individual that had shot him in the arm six months earlier.prado claimed he had tried unsuccessfully to explain this to the police and the prosecutor.
the prosecutor did not file a written opposition to this motion.the court denied the motion on april,for several reasons it did not believe the prosecution had a duty to help the defense locate and secure the attendance of witnesses the federal decision cited by carrillo was inapplicable because it involved federal prosecutors and federal immigration officials,while this was a prosecution by the state,which had no connection to or authority over the immigration department carrillo cited no authority concerning the parole visas,but the court independent research turned up two federal administrative regulations that showed such visas were issued subject to the immigration department sole discretion,meaning there was no guarantee a prosecution request would even be honored and the motion was supported by no evidence showing the witnesses citizenship,immigration status,possession or of a green card or visa,no evidence that the witnesses ever tried on their own,but failed,to obtain visas,and no explanation for defense counsels delay in attempting to secure the attendance of those witnesses since august.
discussion 
denial of the visa request motion was proper 
in theresius filippi cir filippi,the court held that federal prosecutors violated a criminal defendant constitutional rights to due process and to the compulsory attendance of witnesses by denying the defendant request that they ask federal immigration officials to grant an entrance visa to an ecuadorian national who had exculpatory evidence in defendant trial for transporting cocaine.id.at.because the defendant went to trial before the issue was resolved in the trial court,however,the federal appellate court held that the constitutional rights violations had been waived.id.at.pointing to somewhat analogous california authority,carrillo contends the same rule should apply here.
we will assume for discussion sake that prado and torrez were material defense witnesses who possessed important exculpatory evidence.we will also assume,but do not decide,that in the abstract,a refusal by the prosecution or the court to make sure that entry visas were at least requested from federal immigration officials for such witnesses violates a defendant constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial.even so,the record from below and the arguments made on appeal compel us to affirm the trial court ruling here in filippi,supra,the evidence showed that the defendant wife flew to ecuador,asked the witness to testify for her husband,and obtained his agreement to do so.the witness went to the american embassy and asked for,but was denied,an entrance visa.defendant lawyer wrote the attorney and asked for her cooperation,but she did not respond.upon request by the defense,the court wrote a letter to the embassy in ecuador and asked for assistance,but got no results.defense counsel then wrote to and phoned immigration officials,but was told federal prosecutors had to request the visa.
as the trial court in this case pointed out,carrillo motion was not supported by any evidence.though some factual assertions were made by way of argument,no evidence was placed before the trial court that explained the witnesses immigration status,showed that any steps had been taken to secure regular visas,or otherwise showed that their attendance would not be possible without the requested court orders.the unauthenticated letter from the defense investigator was silent as to prado immigration status,but mentioned that he had crossed back and forth from mexico,leading the trial court to infer that there might in fact have been no impediments to his ability to come here.furthermore,carrillo motion did not cite,discuss,or analyze the federal immigration provisions that apply in this case.while he cites two federal immigration regulations in his appellate brief,he has still failed to discuss or analyze their applicability to this case.as a result,their applicability and hence their efficacy are waived as issues.people beltran th,fn,d.because there was insufficient evidence to support the motion below,and because he has failed to make proper argument on appeal about the applicable federal immigration provisions,we affirm the trial court order 
instructional error claim for the allegation of firearm use causing death or great bodily injury 
section,subdivision d enhances the sentence of defendants who,while committing murder and other specified felonies,intentionally and personally discharged a firearm and proximately caused great bodily injury,as defined in section,or death,to any person other than an accomplice the jury in this case found such an allegation true as to carrillo,but he contends the court erred by failing on its own motion to give a certain instruction defining proximate cause.
as relevant here,the jury was instructed that the prosecution had to prove,among other facts,that the defendant or a perpetrator act caused great bodily injury to or the death of a person and that a n act causes great bodily injury or death if the injury or death is the direct,natural,and probable consequence of the act and the injury or death would not have happened without the act.a natural and probable consequence is one that a reasonable person would know is likely to happen if nothing unusual intervenes.in deciding whether a consequence is natural and probable,consider all the circumstances established by the evidence.
carrillo contends that pursuant to people bland cal th,d,bland,the court was obligated to sua sponte instruct the jury with caljic,which states,there may be more than one cause of the great bodily injury or death.when the conduct of two or more person contributes concurrently as a cause of the great bodily injury or death,the conduct of each is a cause of the great bodily injury or death if that conduct was also a substantial factor contributing to the result.a cause is concurrent if it was operative at the moment of the great bodily injury or death and acted with another cause to produce the great bodily injury or death.if you find that the defendant conduct was a cause of the great bodily injury or death to another person,then it is no defense that the conduct of some other person,even the injured or deceased person,contributed to the great bodily injury or death.id.at,d.absent that clarification,carrillo contends the jury could have found the allegation true based solely on the acts of any without determining that his conduct proximately caused injury or death.
the defendant in bland and another man fired shots into a car that killed one person and wounded two others.it was unclear whether the defendant or his accomplice fired the rounds that hit the two wounded victims.the defendant was found guilty of murder and attempted murder,along with the enhancement under section,subdivision d the trial court instructed the jury in the language of subdivision d,but failed to give an instruction defining proximate cause.the court of appeal reversed,reasoning that the enhancement could not be found true unless the defendant personally fired the bullets that struck the victim.the supreme court rejected the court of appeal reasoning,holding that the statute is satisfied even if the bullets did not hit the victim,so long as under the broad standard of proximate cause,the defendant act of firing the gun was a cause of the injuries or death.bland,supra,cal th at,d.as part of its holding,the bland court addressed the instructional requirements for proximate cause under subdivision d.according to the bland court,caljic correctly defined proximate cause as follows a proximate cause of great bodily injury or death is an act or omission that sets in motion a chain of events that produces as a direct,natural,and probable consequence of the act or omission the great bodily injury or death and without which the great bodily injury or death would not have occurred.id.at,d.if there is more than one cause of injury or death,then caljic should also be given.id.at,d.
despite the trial court error,the bland court found it harmless because proximate cause is a broader concept than jurors might assume and the jury was therefore unlikely to find proximate cause where none existed.because any confusion could have only helped the defendant,the supreme court did not reverse the trial court judgment.bland,supra,cal th at,d.
based on this,carrillo contends that instructional error occurred.we agree.the facts here showed that carrillo was one of several persons who shot at ramirez,who was struck by rounds fired from two or three different guns.there was no evidence that carrillo fired one of those guns.by modifying the instruction to state that the allegation was true if the conduct of carrillo or a harmed ramirez,and then by failing to instruct the jury that concurrent causes could operate together to determine proximate cause,there was a likelihood that the jury could have found the allegation true without finding that carrillo conduct was one of those causes.people palmer th,d test for instructional error is whether jury would likely misunderstand or be misled by instruction.however,as set forth below,under the applicable standard of review for constitutional error,the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at,d.
even if error occurred it was not prejudicial if the jury necessarily found the missing element true under other instructions.people dejesus th,d people matta d.defendant convicted of murder contended court erred by not instructing on attempted murder jury finding that defendant proximately caused victim death as part of murder verdict meant that key issue concerning need for attempted murder defendant assault of victim was proximate cause of his necessarily resolved against defendant,making error harmless.that is precisely what happened here.the jury was instructed that in order to find carrillo guilty of murder either directly or as aider and abettor,it had to find that carrillo acts caused ramirez death.as part of that,the jury was told that a n act causes death if the death is the direct,natural,and probable consequence of the act and the death would not have happened without the act.a natural and probable consequenc
