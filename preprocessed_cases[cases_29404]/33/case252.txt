background 
dubuc graduated from an accredited law school,passed the february michigan bar examination,and applied for admission to the michigan bar.the bar recommended to the board that his application be denied because it found that he lacked good moral character,a statutory requirement for admission.see.dubuc exercised his right to challenge the bar determination in a de novo hearing in front of the board.on june,the board issued an opinion denying dubuc application.according to its opinion,the board found that dubuc had failed to prove that he was a person of good moral character in view of his failure to accept responsibility for his wrongful actions when representing himself in previous lawsuits.
according to his testimony in front of the board,as reflected in the board opinion,dubuc had been involved in approximately lawsuits in the years preceding his board hearing.he filed one of these lawsuits in michigan livingston county circuit court in.in,he moved to disqualify the presiding judge,judge daniel burress.during a hearing on september,dubuc accused judge burress of engaging in a conspiracy against him.during a hearing on october,dubuc told judge burress that he had filed criminal charges against him for conspiracy,bribery,bribery attempt,and abuse of process.in an affidavit he filed in support of his criminal charges,dubuc attested that judge burress was engaged in a conspiracy to destroy him,obstruction of justice,abuse of process,bribery,and attempted bribery.
judge burress ordered dubuc to pay over in sanctions for violating several court orders,and after a bench trial,judge burress dismissed dubuc lawsuit as frivolous.the michigan court of appeals affirmed judge burress decision to award sanctions and dismiss the lawsuit.dubuc green oak township,wl.the michigan supreme court denied dubuc application for leave to appeal,and denied his subsequent motion to reconsider.in conjunction with the denial of his motion to reconsider,justice corrigan,joined by a majority of the other michigan supreme court justices,issued a statement encouraging the trial court to consider extraordinary sanctions to deter dubuc from continuing his vexatious tactics that have led to years of abusive litigation.at.among many other things,justice corrigan found that dubuc had engaged in abusive and frivolous tactics to delay the proceedings,including naming the trial judge as a witness seeking to depose the judge accusing the judge of criminal conduct and of conspiring with defense counsel and threatening to file a complaint with the judicial tenure commission against the judge.id.at.
relying upon the michigan supreme court decision denying dubuc motion to reconsider,the board found that the issue of whether sanctions were appropriate against dubuc had been decided against dubuc and was no longer an issue for the board to resolve.dubuc attorney admitted to the board that he knew of no facts that would support a criminal charge against judge burress for bribery or conspiracy.dubuc stated to the board that he had not intended to accuse judge burress of bribery,but that he meant only to accuse judge burress of knowing that bribery was occurring and doing nothing to stop it.according to the board,dubuc refused to accept responsibility for falsely accusing a judge of criminal actions and persisted in believing that the issues in front of the board were not his fault.in its opinion,the board found that his failure to accept responsibility for his actions prevented him from carrying his burden to prove that he was fit to practice law.
dubuc sought leave to appeal the board decision to the michigan supreme court,which declined to grant review.dubuc then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the supreme court of the united states,which also declined to grant review.dubuc then filed this lawsuit.
in his complaint,filed pursuant to,dubuc does not challenge the denial of his application for admission to the michigan bar.instead,dubuc seeks an injunction ordering defendants to allow him to reapply immediately for admission to the michigan bar.in addition,he seeks declaratory and injunctive relief prohibiting defendants from using his alleged first amendment activities criticizing a judge as a basis for denying his second application.
according to his complaint,the michigan supreme court rules concerning the state bar of michigan rcsbm prohibit dubuc from reapplying for five years from the date the board denied his initial application.under the rcsbm,according to dubuc,if he had acquiesced in the bar recommendation and not exercised his right to a de novo hearing in front of the board,he would have been eligible to reapply three years after the bar recommendation.therefore,according to dubuc,because he challenged the bar recommendation he must wait until to reapply,while if he had not appealed to the board he would have been eligible to reapply in.dubuc claims that punishing applicants for exercising their right to challenge the bar recommendation violates the first amendment right to petition the government and the fourteenth amendment rights to substantive due process and equal protection.he asserts that the rcsbm are facially unconstitutional in this regard.
in support of his request for an injunction and declaratory judgment prohibiting defendants from considering his alleged first amendment activities in evaluating his second application,dubuc advances two claims.first,he asserts that the practice of law is a profession of advocacy and is a quintessential first amendment activity.therefore,he argues,michigan procedure,which considers one moral character,is a prior restraint on a first amendment activity and is facially unconstitutional because it lacks adequate procedural safeguards and is too vague.
second,he claims that in practice defendants consider an applicant prior first amendment activity in determining whether an applicant has good moral character.he cites the denial of his first application as one of two illustrations that evidence the defendants practice.as his other example,he alleges that a law school graduate named stephen dean was told by a bar official that he would be denied admission to the bar because he picketed against his law school over classroom comments by one of his professors regarding the impeachment proceedings of former president clinton.he contends that denying one bar application based upon one protected speech is unconstitutional.he therefore claims that the moral character requirement,as it is being applied,is unconstitutional.
along with his complaint,which he filed on march,in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan,dubuc filed a motion for a preliminary injunction.defendants filed answers to the complaint and moved to dismiss for improper venue or,in the alternative,to transfer the case to the western district of michigan,where the offices of the board and bar are located.the district court scheduled a hearing on dubuc motion for a preliminary injunction and defendants motion relating to venue for june.
before hearing argument or evidence with regard to the parties pending motions,the district court at the beginning of the hearing on june,asked the parties to address the issue of immunity.in their answers,defendants asserted two claims of immunity.they all claimed immunity under the eleventh amendment,and the bar and berry claimed immunity under the rcsbm,which provide that the staff and committee members of the bar and the board are absolutely immune from suit for conduct arising out of the performance of their duties.the board and googasian did not raise the rcsbm grant of immunity in their answer.
at the conclusion of the parties arguments,the district court made an oral ruling dismissing the action based upon the immunity argument.the district court reasoning is unclear.the district court stated that t here no reason for me to go into a lot of details.in announcing its ruling,the district court referred to the rcsbm grant of absolute immunity and cited two unpublished district court cases dealing with the eleventh amendment,but the district court did not distinguish between the two claims of immunity nor did it specify which defendant was entitled to which type of immunity.the district court also stated that the doctrine probably would apply,too,but the district court explicitly declined to ground its ruling on this issue.having dismissed the action,the district court denied all pending motions as moot.
dubuc appeals.he argues that the district court erred in finding defendants immune and asserts that the doctrine is inapplicable to bar this lawsuit.furthermore,he urges this court to consider and grant his motion for a preliminary injunction.
ii.analysis 
eleventh amendment immunity 
the eleventh amendment provides 
the judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state,or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.
const.amend.xi.absent the state consent,the judicial power of the united states also does not extend to suits against a state by that state own citizens,even though this limitation was not made explicit in the eleventh amendment.hans louisiana.in addition to the states themselves,the eleventh amendment immunizes departments and agencies of the states.pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d.
to determine whether an entity is a state department or agency for purposes of the eleventh amendment,the primary issue is whether the state would ultimately be liable for any money judgment against the entity.brotherton cleveland,cir.courts,however,also look to other factors,such as how state law defines the entity and the degree of control the state maintains over the entity.id.at declining to decide whether these other factors are relevant to the inquiry.
the parties have not submitted any evidence regarding whether the state of michigan would be ultimately responsible for any money judgment against the board or the bar.the other factors,however,weigh in favor of finding the board and the bar immune from this lawsuit.in michigan,for purposes of promulgating rules relating to bar membership and determining whether to grant or deny bar applications,the board and the bar are merely extensions of the michigan supreme court.michigan law provides that the michigan supreme court has the power to provide for the organization,government,and membership of the state bar of michigan,and to adopt rules and regulations concerning the investigation and examination of applicants for admission to the bar.
because they are arms of the michigan supreme court for all purposes relevant to this lawsuit,the board and the bar are state agencies immune from this lawsuit under the eleventh amendment.kish michigan state bd.of law exam rs,finding that the board is a judicial agency of the state entitled to eleventh amendment immunity see also thiel state bar of wisconsin,cir holding that the state bar of wisconsin is a state agency entitled to eleventh amendment immunity.therefore,we affirm the district court dismissal of the claims against the board and the bar.
defendants googasian and berry assert that as state officials they are also immune from this lawsuit under the eleventh amendment.in general,the eleventh amendment immunizes state officials from suit in federal court.pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d.the supreme court,however,recognized an important exception to this general rule in ex parte young,where it held that the eleventh amendment does not bar a lawsuit seeking an injunction against a state official prohibiting the state official from enforcing a state statute that allegedly violates the united states constitution.in determining whether the doctrine of ex parte young avoids an eleventh amendment bar to suit,a court need only conduct a straightforward inquiry into whether the complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.verizon maryland,public service commission of maryland,d quoting justice concurring opinion in idaho coeur tribe of idaho,d.
dubuc complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.he alleges that the bar admission rules,facially and as currently applied,violate the united states constitution,and he seeks only injunctive and declaratory relief,not a money judgment or any other retrospective relief.therefore,neither googasian nor berry is entitled to immunity under the eleventh amendment pursuant to the straightforward inquiry that applies to this issue.verizon maryland,at.here verizon sought injunctive and declaratory relief the prayer for injunctive state officials be restrained from enforcing an order in contravention of controlling federal satisfies our straightforward inquiry.see also roe ogden,cir holding that members of the colorado state board of law examiners were not entitled to immunity under the eleventh amendment from a lawsuit challenging bar admission rules.importantly,determining whether the ex parte young doctrine applies does not involve an analysis of the merits of a plaintiff claims.verizon maryland,at.
in support of their claim for immunity under the eleventh amendment,googasian and berry cite idaho coeur tribe of idaho,d.in coeur,an indian tribe sought a declaratory judgment establishing its rights to quiet enjoyment over the submerged lands of lake coeur,as well as prospective injunctive relief against numerous idaho state officials to prevent them from exercising the state asserted regulatory jurisdiction over those submerged lands.id.at.a sharply divided court held that the state officials were immune from this lawsuit under the eleventh amendment because the suit was the functional equivalent of a quiet title action and if the tribe were to prevail,idaho sovereign interest in its lands and waters would be affected in a degree fully as intrusive as almost any conceivable retroactive levy upon funds in its treasury.id.at.under these particular and special circumstances,we find the young exception inapplicable.id.at.
googasian and berry reliance on coeur is unavailing because the present lawsuit is not the functional equivalent of a quiet title action that implicates a state sovereign interest in its lands or waters.in arguing for a broader interpretation of the holding in coeur,googasian and berry mistakenly cite portions of justice kennedy principal opinion that were not joined by a majority of the court.justice kennedy,in a section of his principal opinion joined only by chief justice rehnquist,advocated adopting a balancing test that would narrow the circumstances under which the ex parte young doctrine applies.id.at.a majority of the court,however,explicitly rejected this approach.id.at,joined by scalia and thomas,concurring in part and concurring in judgment and advocating the retention of the traditional straightforward inquiry for determining when the ex parte young doctrine applies id at.souter,dissenting,joined by
