background 
kentucky revised statute states 
the supreme court has power to provide for the organization,government and membership of the state bar of kentucky and to adopt rules and regulations to govern conduct and activity of the state bar and its members.
ann.in,kentucky enacted,which states 
notwithstanding krs,for a period of thirty days following the filing of a criminal or civil action,or claim for damages,or a traffic citation,injury,accident,or disaster,an attorney or an attorney referral service shall be subject to the following prohibition.an attorney or an attorney referral service shall not directly solicit,or knowingly permit another person to directly solicit on his or its behalf,a victim of the accident or disaster,or a relative of the victim,for the purpose of obtaining professional employment relating to a criminal or civil action,or claim for damages,arising out of the traffic citation,injury,accident,or disaster.
notwithstanding krs,an attorney shall not knowingly accept a referral from an attorney referral service when that referral has resulted from the attorney referral service violating the prohibition established in subsection of this section.
ann.a violation of is a class a misdemeanor punishable by a term of imprisonment up to one year,a penalty,or discipline by the kentucky supreme court.see.ann.
before the enactment of and,chambers routinely engaged in solicitation of accident victims.during the pendency of chambers lawsuit,the parties entered into a joint agreement stipulating that the portions of the statute that prohibited solicitation for thirty days following the filing of a criminal or civil action,or claim for damages,or a traffic citation were unconstitutional.defendants conceded that those portions of the statute were not narrowly drawn,nor did they materially advance a substantial state interest.the joint agreement provided that defendants would be permanently enjoined from enforcing those portions of the statute.the parties then filed for summary judgment as to the constitutionality of the remaining portions of the statute,the prohibition of attorney solicitation of victims of an accident,injury,or disaster.the district court granted defendants motion,holding that and violated neither the due process clause,the equal protection clause,nor the first amendment.this appeal follows.
discussion 
we review the grant of summary judgment and the constitutionality of a statute de novo.see kildea,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there exists no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.t he mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact.anderson liberty lobby,d emphasis in original.
due process clause 
in columbia natural,tatum,cir,we recognized that the due process clause provides the foundation for a challenge to a statute based on vagueness.the void for vagueness doctrine has primarily two goals first,to ensure fair notice to citizens,and second,to provide standards for enforcement by the police,judges,and juries.see id.as stated by the supreme court 
it is a basic principle of due process that an enactment is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined.vague laws offend several important values.first,because we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct,we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited,so that he may act accordingly.vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning.second,if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented,laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them.a vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen,judges,and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis,with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.
grayned city of rockford,d footnote omitted.although a statute is void for vagueness only if it is so vague that no standard of conduct is specified at all,coates city of cincinnati,d,we have held that a relatively strict test is warranted when criminal penalties are at stake,women med.prof l voinovich,cir.
chambers argues that the statute prohibition on solicitation is vague insofar as it does not distinguish between solicitation and other contact.for example,chambers asserts that it is unclear whether the statute prohibits sending a condolence card on legal stationery.he also claims that the statute is unclear as to whether the term victim includes the tortfeasor,or whether an accident or disaster victim includes a victim of intentional conduct.finally,chambers argues that,an exception to the statute which permits solicitation of a victim of an accident or disaster through advertising directed to the general public,does not sufficiently define general public.
chambers argument lacks merit and does little to undermine the general understanding of the conduct prohibited.the terms solicit,victim,accident or disaster,and general public are common terms,and individuals of common intelligence do not have to guess at their meaning.the statutes sufficiently set out the conduct prohibited such that they give fair notice to citizens and do not encourage arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement by police,judges,or juries.accordingly,we affirm the district court on this ground.
ii.equal protection clause 
the equal protection clause requires that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.city of cleburne cleburne living,d.the supreme court has clarified,however,equal protection does not require that all persons be dealt with identically,but it does require that a distinction made have some relevance to the purposes for which the classification is made.baxstrom herold,d.where a fundamental right is involved,we apply a strict scrutiny standard of review to regulations to determine whether the statute is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest.see grider abramson,cir.if the regulation is,however,such as a time,place,or manner restriction,we apply a more relaxed intermediate scrutiny,whereby a restriction will survive constitutional assessment if the implicated measure was narrowly fashioned to further a significant governmental interest.id.
in a case such as ours,where commercial speech is involved,only a limited measure of protection,commensurate with its subordinate position in the scale of first amendment values is required.ohralik ohio state bar ass n,d see also central hudson gas public serv.comm n,d holding that intermediate scrutiny applies to a first amendment challenge involving commercial speech.because regulation of commercial speech is subject to intermediate scrutiny in a first amendment challenge,it follows that equal protection claims involving commercial speech also are subject to the same level of review.see city of paul,d noting that the first amendment underlies the court equal protection analysis.thus,we must decide whether the classifications in th
