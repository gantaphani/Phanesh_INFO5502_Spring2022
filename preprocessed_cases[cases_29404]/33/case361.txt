jurisdiction was proper in the district court pursuant to.jurisdiction is proper in this court pursuant to.
the following summary of the background is based upon the record on appeal hereinafter record.on may,koste was indicted under missouri state law on five counts of sodomy with a child under the age of fourteen.each count involved the same child and referred to the same period of time in which the offense was alleged to have occurred.an assistant public defender,robert lundt,entered an appearance on koste behalf.lundt had represented koste in a prior,separate state court criminal case.
on october,koste filed a pro se motion to dismiss counsel alleging that he was receiving ineffective assistance from lundt.see record at.koste also filed a pro se motion for pretrial mental exam asking the state trial court to order a mental evaluation for a determination on a multiple personality disorder and any other psychological defect as a result of abuse or trauma.id.at 
lundt continued to represent koste for approximately five months,during which lundt filed motions to suppress and a witness endorsement on koste behalf.meanwhile,koste trial was continued on several occasions at the requests of both defense counsel and the prosecutor.
on march,the state trial court granted lundt permission to withdraw as koste attorney,and terri johnson,another assistant public defender,entered an appearance on behalf of koste.lundt and johnson worked together in the same public defender office.koste trial was postponed several more times,with the last continuance setting a trial date of november.
on november,a jury was selected for koste trial,and court was adjourned until the next morning.on the morning of november,koste filed a pro se motion of conflict of interest.see id.at.in this pro se motion,koste alleged that he was being denied effective assistance of counsel because a conflict has been created between movant and his attorney,due to a motion to vacate,set aside or correct judgment and sentence in cause number against attorney said office.id.at.koste was referring to a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel which he had asserted in a motion for relief challenging his conviction in the prior case for which lundt had been his attorney.
also on the morning of november,johnson notified the state trial court that koste wished to change his plea of not guilty to a plea of guilty pursuant to a plea agreement.the state trial court thereupon conducted a hearing at which koste pled guilty to each of the five counts in the indictment.during the hearing,the state trial court questioned koste regarding the voluntariness of his guilty plea and found that koste had entered his guilty plea freely and voluntarily.see id.at transcript of oral proceedings transcript at.the prosecutor summarized the facts which would have been proven if the matter had proceeded to trial,and koste admitted that he committed the acts alleged.see id.at transcript at.consistent with the plea agreement,the state trial court sentenced koste to five concurrent terms of imprisonment without parole,each to run concurrently with a life sentence that he was already serving on his prior conviction.id.at transcript at and transcript at.

id.at transcript at.
after judgment was entered based upon koste guilty plea,he filed a pro se motion for relief in state court.see id.at.he claimed,among other things,that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because johnson was acting under a conflict of interest at the time he entered his guilty plea.his pro se motion for relief stated the following 
a conflict did exist as counsel was also involved in cause number whereas movant is claiming ineffective counsel.this conflict forced movant to make statements without the advice of counsel this conflict did so prejudice counsel that counsel refused to converse with movant and prepare for trial.counsel did visit movant one time prior to picking jury for five minutes.b y the trial court refusal to relieve this counsel at movant request the trial court did operate to deny movant of conflict free counsel.
the state trial court appointed the special public defender office to represent koste in the relief proceedings.koste new attorney filed an amended motion for relief which fully incorporated koste pro se motion,added some claims for relief,and requested an evidentiary hearing.see id.at.one of the claims added in the amended motion for relief alleged ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to obtain a mental evaluation.id.at.in response,the state moved to dismiss koste motion for relief for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.
the state trial court denied koste request for an evidentiary hearing on the ground that he had failed to allege grounds that would entitle him to relief if true and that are not refuted by the record.koste state,pcr,div,slip op.at.may,findings of fact,conclusions of law,order and judgment.in addressing koste ineffective assistance claim based upon his trial counsel failure to obtain a mental evaluation,the state trial court noted that t he record here reflects that movant was fully able to understand the proceedings,and movant has alleged no facts which would have indicated to his attorney that his competency was at issue,slip op.at.regarding koste pro se motion asking for a mental evaluation,the state trial court reasoned that t he filing of this motion by movant does not indicate a lack of competency,but would seem to indicate the contrary.id.at.the state trial court denied koste motion for relief.id.at.koste appealed,arguing in terms of whether the state trial court should have at least held a hearing on his claims for relief.
the missouri court of appeals affirmed the denial of koste motion for relief and set forth its reasons in an unpublished supplemental memorandum.koste state,hereinafter missouri court of appeals memorandum.regarding koste ineffective assistance claim based upon the alleged conflict of interest,the missouri court of appeals explained 
koste lastly argues that the trial judge erred in refusing to conduct a hearing to determine whether he had a conflict of interest with his trial counsel.koste alleges that his trial counsel had a conflict of interest based on koste challenge to the effectiveness of her counsel in another proceeding.koste has failed to allege facts showing how his defense was prejudiced and his plea was rendered involuntary due to the alleged actions or inactions of his trial counsel because of the alleged conflict of interest.instead,koste argues that the alleged conflict caused his counsel to inadequately prepare for trial and also deprived him of advice.these conclusory assertions do not show how the matters complained of resulted in prejudice to his interests.the motion court did not clearly err in denying koste an evidentiary hearing on these allegations because the record conclusively establishes that his plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered and that he did not meet his initial burden of pleading facts,not conclusions,not refuted by the record which entitle him to relief.
regarding koste ineffective assistance claim based upon trial counsel failure to obtain a mental evaluation,the missouri court of appeals explained 
koste also claims that the motion court erred in failing to conduct a hearing to determine whether his trial counsel refused to pursue a mental evaluation.koste claims that had such an evaluation been conducted,it would have revealed that he suffers from multiple personality disorder.koste filed a pro se motion for a mental evaluation in this case on november.
after reviewing the files and the record,we conclude that there is nothing to suggest that koste counsel was aware or should have been aware of any mental defect of koste koste never said or did anything at his guilty plea hearing that would have caused the judge or his trial counsel to suspect that he suffered from multiple personality disorder or any other mental disease.moreover,koste does not claim that he ever requested his trial counsel to obtain a mental evaluation to determine whether he suffered from multiple personality disorder.in fact,he does not even claim that his trial counsel knew or should have known that he filed a pro se motion for a mental evaluation.under these circumstances,the motion court did not clearly err in denying koste request for an evidentiary hearing on this matter.
koste thereafter brought the present habeas action in the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri,pursuant to,asserting several claims for relief including the two ineffective assistance claims discussed herein.as to each of these two claims,the district court applied the standards in d and concluded that the decision of the missouri court of appeals was not contrary to clearly established federal law or based upon an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.see id.at.
in a panel opinion filed on august,we initially reversed the district court decision on the reasoning that the supreme court decision in holloway arkansas,d holloway,clearly established that,where a timely objection has been made regarding an attorney existing conflict of interest,the trial court is constitutionally required to determine whether an actual conflict exists.because koste had brought a timely pro se motion alleging an existing conflict of interest resulting from his pending ineffective assistance claim,we concluded that the state trial court was required under holloway to inquire into the conflict issue.because the state trial court had taken no action to explore the matter,we held that the missouri court of appeals decision,upholding the denial of koste motion for relief,was contrary to clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court.having disposed of the case on the issue,we did not reach koste ineffective assistance claim based upon his counsel failure to obtain a mental evaluation.
on april,the supreme court entered its order remanding the case to us for further consideration in light of its recent decision in mickens.
as in the case at bar,mickens involved a petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed in federal court pursuant to.the petitioner,walter mickens,was seeking relief from a state capital murder conviction and death sentence following a jury trial.mickens asserted,among other things,that his trial attorney had acted under a conflict of interest because,at the time of the murder,the attorney had been representing the victim of the murder for which mickens was tried and convicted.a state court judge had dismissed criminal charges against the murder victim due to his death and,a few days later,appointed the attorney who had been representing the murder victim on the dismissed criminal charges to represent mickens on the murder charge.in mickens case,the appointed attorney did not disclose his prior representation of the murder victim,a juvenile whose files remained confidential under state law.mickens did not learn of his attorney prior representation of the murder victim until the murder victim criminal files were inadvertently produced to mickens federal habeas counsel.
after the conflict issue was raised in the federal habeas action,the district court held an evidentiary hearing to examine the underlying facts.the district court denied mickens relief because he had not shown prejudice.initially a panel of the fourth circuit reversed,but subsequently the fourth circuit,sitting en banc,affirmed the district court denial of habeas relief.mickens taylor,cir.the supreme court granted certiorari.
in defining the issue before it,the court noted that there are exceptions to the requirement in strickland washington,d,that prejudice be shown in order to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.the court explained 
we have spared the defendant the need of showing probable effect upon the outcome,and have simply presumed such effect,where assistance of counsel has been denied entirely or during a critical stage of the proceeding.when that has occurred,the likelihood that the verdict is unreliable is so high that a inquiry is unnecessary.
mickens.at.
the court continued 
we have held in several cases that circumstances of that magnitude may also arise when the defendant attorney actively represented conflicting interests.the nub of the question before us is whether the principle established by these cases provides an exception to the general rule of strickland under the circumstances of the present case.
examining its relevant precedents,the supreme court stated of holloway that it creates an automatic reversal rule only where defense counsel is forced to represent codefendants over his timely objection,unless the trial court has determined that there is no conflict.id.at citing holloway,at.w henever a trial court improperly requires joint representation over timely objection reversal is automatic.
addressing next its decision in cuyler sullivan,d sullivan,the supreme court observed that n either counsel nor anyone else objected to the multiple representation,and counsel opening argument at sullivan trial suggested that the interests of the defendants were aligned.at.thus,under those circumstances,the court explained,w e declined to extend holloway automatic reversal rule and held that,absent objection,a defendant must demonstrate that a conflict of interest actually affected the adequacy of his representation.id.quoting sullivan,at.
finally,the supreme court addressed its decision in wood georgia,d wood,the applicability of which was the source of much debate in the case before the court.in wood,the supreme court had originally granted certiorari to consider an equal protection issue,but then discovered that there was an underlying due process issue because the petitioners had been represented by their employer attorney,under an apparent conflict of interest.upon discovering the apparent conflict,the court ordered the case returned to the state trial court to determine whether the conflict of interest that th e record strongly suggests actually existed.mickens.at quoting wood,at.the supreme court in mickens then explained wood as follows 
because o n the record before us,we could not be sure whether counsel was influenced in his basic strategic decisions by the interests of the employer who hired him,we remanded for the trial court to determine whether the conflict of interest that this record strongly suggests actually existed.
as used in the remand instruction we think an actual conflict of interest meant precisely a conflict that affected counsel opposed to a mere theoretical division of loyalties.it was shorthand for the statement in sullivan that a defendant who shows that a conflict of interest actually affected the adequacy of his representation need not demonstrate prejudice in order to obtain relief.emphasis added in mickens.
id.at internal citations and footnote omitted quoting wood,at.sullivan,at.
the supreme court thus went on to reject mickens argument that,where the trial judge has failed to make a inquiry notwithstanding an apparent attorney conflict of interest,reversal is automatic regardless of whether the conflict affected the attorney performance.id.at.the supreme court concluded that,where the trial court knew or reasonably should have known about a potential attorney conflict of interest and yet failed to make an inquiry,the petitioner,in order to void the conviction,must show that the conflict of interest had an adverse effect on his or her counsel performance.id.at.
we now apply mickens to the case at bar.at the outset,we review the nature of the attorney conflict of interest alleged by koste.as stated above,koste initially asserted that there was a conflict of interest in his pro se motion filed on the day of trial,which instead became the day of his hearing.johnson,herself,never alleged a conflict of interest or suggested that her ability to represent koste had been compromised.koste conflict of interest argument was based upon the fact that,at the time of his hearing,his trial attorney,johnson,worked in the same office with lundt,against whom koste had a pending ineffective assistance claim arising out of his prior,separate criminal case.mickens now makes it clear that,under these circumstances,koste is not entitled to automatic reversal of his conviction.at holloway thus creates an automatic reversal rule only where defense counsel is forced to represent codefendants over his timely objection,unless the trial court has determined that there is no conflict.citing holloway,at.
in mickens,the supreme court cautioned that it was only addressing the effect of a trial court failure to inquire into a potential conflict upon the sullivan rule that deficient performance of counsel must be shown.the court noted that the parties had assumed that sullivan would apply absent an exception for failure to inquire.id.at.the court observed 
the case was presented and argued on the assumption that absent some exception for failure to inquire sullivan would be a showing of defective performance,but not requiring in addition as strickland does in other cases,a showing of probable effect upon the outcome of trial.that assumption was not unreasonable in light of the holdings of courts of appeals,which have applied sullivan unblinkingly to all kinds of alleged attorney ethical conflicts.they have invoked the sullivan standard not only when as here there is a conflict rooted in counsel obligations to former clients,but even when representation of the defendant somehow implicates counsel personal or financial interests.
referring specifically to conflict issues based upon successive representations as was the case in mickens,the court stated w hether sullivan should be extended to such cases remains,as far as the jurisprudence of this court is concerned,an open question.id.at.
thus,following mickens,there remains an open question in the present case as to whether johnson even had a sufficient conflict of interest to warrant application of sullivan.the transcript of the hearing suggests that,at that time,the state trial court understood the nature of koste conflict argument but questioned whether a conflict of interest actually existed,where johnson had not actually represented koste in the criminal case from which koste pending ineffective assistance claim had arisen.see record at transcript at the court the court is not going to try koste pending motion for relief as being no legal suit against johnson and the court herein denies that.for purposes of the present analysis,however,we will assume without deciding that the state trial court had enough information to know that johnson was acting under a conflict of interest sufficient to require application of sullivan.given that assumption,we will further assume,consistent with mickens,that it was at least necessary,to void the conviction,for koste to establish that the conflict of interest adversely affected johnson performance.at.as a practical matter,we understand this standard to require koste to show that johnson performance was actually deficient in some specific way and that the deficiency was causally connected to the conflict of interest.
in the relief proceedings,koste did allege that the conflict affected johnson performance by causing her to prepare inadequately for trial and preventing her from giving him advice.the missouri court of appeals found neither to warrant relief or entitlement to a hearing because koste conclusory assertions did not show how the matters complained of resulted in prejudice to his interests.missouri court of appeals memorandum at.the missouri court of appeals further observed that koste ha d failed to allege facts showing how his defense was prejudiced and his plea was rendered involuntary due to the alleged actions or inactions of his trial counsel because of the alleged conflict of interest.id.
in ruling upon koste habeas petition,the district court quoted the missouri court of appeals reasoning and upheld the state court decision as not based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.district court order at.
we first note that the missouri court of appeals rejection of koste ineffective assistance claim for failure to prove prejudice resulting from the alleged conflict of interest is not entirely consistent with the applicable standard as explained in mickens.as discussed above,the supreme court stated in mickens that,following sullivan and wood,the standard remains that a defendant who shows that a conflict of interest actually affected the adequacy of his representation need not demonstrate prejudice in order to obtain relief.at quoting sullivan,at.emphasis added in mickens.in other words,even though koste failed to show prejudice,he
