rick mcphearson plaintiff appeals from an order disqualifying his attorney,john riestenberg,from representing plaintiff in a discrimination and harassment action against plaintiff employer,the michaels company defendant.following the holding in gilbert national for housing partnerships th,d hereafter gilbert,the trial court disqualified riestenberg because of a perceived conflict of interest arising out of his representation of another employee who entered into a confidential settlement agreement with defendant.
in gilbert,an attorney who successfully represented employees in a discrimination and harassment action brought against their employer was found to be disqualified from representing another employee in a similar case against the employer.gilbert,supra,th at,d.gilbert held that the settlement agreement reached in the first action,which required the parties to keep the fact of this settlement and this agreement,and each of its terms,strictly confidential,and specified severe sanctions for breach of the confidentiality provision id.at,d,created a conflict of interest that justified an order disqualifying the attorney from representing the other employee id.at,d.
for reasons that follow,we believe gilbert exaggerated the conflict of interest posed by such a confidentiality provision.moreover,in this case,unlike in gilbert,both plaintiff and the employee who entered into the settlement agreement waived the conflict of interest posed by attorney riestenberg representing them.finding no justification for the order under the circumstances of this case,we conclude the trial court abused its discretion in disqualifying riestenberg from further representation of plaintiff in this action.accordingly,we shall reverse the order.
before representing plaintiff in this action against defendant,attorney riestenberg represented kevin harris in a lawsuit against defendant and some of its employees hereafter the harris lawsuit.harris alleged that defendant,his employer,was liable for racial discrimination,harassment,retaliation in violation of the california fair employment and housing act feha,et,and retaliation contrary to public policy.
the harris lawsuit was settled.included in the settlement agreement was a clause stating harris represents and agrees that he will keep the terms of this agreement completely confidential and that he will not hereafter disclose any information concerning this agreement to anyone,including,but not limited to,any past,present or prospective employee,creditor or customer of defendant,with the exception of harris accountant,fiance,or spouse or by a court of competent jurisdiction.
shortly before the harris lawsuit was settled,plaintiff who also was represented by attorney riestenberg filed a complaint against defendant.like the harris lawsuit,plaintiff complaint alleged racial discrimination,harassment,and retaliation in violation of feha.
defendant moved to disqualify attorney riestenberg from further representation of plaintiff in this action.relying on the holding in gilbert,supra,th,d,defendant claimed that the confidentiality clause of the harris lawsuit settlement agreement created an unwaivable conflict of interest between riestenberg representation of harris and his representation of plaintiff.
although harris and plaintiff filed written waivers of the conflict of interest,the trial court concluded the decision in gilbert was applicable and dispositive.hence,the court granted defendant motion to disqualify attorney riestenberg.
discussion 
as we have noted,gilbert,supra,th,d involved an attorney who had negotiated a settlement agreement in a dispute between certain employees and their employer.among other things,the parties agreed to keep the fact of settlement,the agreement,and each of its terms strictly confidential.id.at,d.the agreement imposed significant penalties for a violation of its confidentiality provisions.ibid.later,the attorney undertook to represent another employee,eloise gilbert,in a similar action against the employer.ibid.at the outset of trial,it appeared that the attorney intended to call one of the settling employees,edwin franklin,to testify on gilbert behalf consequently,the employer moved to exclude franklin testimony on the ground that he should not be allowed to testify about any matters made confidential by the settlement agreement.id.at,d.expressing concern that the settlement agreement created a conflict of interest between the representation of franklin and gilbert,the trial court disqualified the attorney from further representing gilbert in the action.id.at,d.
the court of appeal affirmed the disqualification order gilbert,supra,th at,d,reasoning as follows franklin testimony would place him at risk of violating the settlement agreement and incurring severe sanctions.id.at,d.the trial court quite properly feared that gilbert attorney would be unable to prevent franklin his other client from crossing into prohibited territory while the attorney was simultaneously trying to elicit testimony helpful to gilbert case,much less while franklin was being subjected to by defense counsel.ibid.even if the attorney could successfully prevent franklin from testifying about matters made confidential by the settlement agreement,a conflict of interest still existed.id.at,d gilbert knew about the settlement agreement and the underlying facts herself and obtained this information independently of her attorney.not being a party to the settlement agreement,gilbert was not bound by its confidentiality clause.thus,she could have presented this evidence herself without the assistance of franklin or any of the other parties to the settlement agreement.to the extent her attorney curtailed his presentation of this favorable evidence in an attempt to reconcile the divergent interests of his multiple clients and the obligations of confidentiality arising from his own participation in the mediation and negotiation of the settlement agreement,the attorney necessarily violated his duty of loyalty to gilbert.id.at,d.in sum,gilbert wanted her attorney other clients to testify in her own case,even though they risked violating the settlement agreement and compromising their own interests by doing so.under the circumstances presented,this conflict of interest was irreconcilable,justifying the attorney disqualification from representing gilbert in the action.id.at,d.
the decision in gilbert emphasized there was no evidence in the record of this case that either gilbert,franklin,or any of the other complaining employees ever gave informed written consent to the actual conflict of interest posed by their attorney continuing to represent all of them in connection with this matter.gilbert,supra,th at,d.it follows,gilbert concluded,that t he absence of this necessary consent arguably makes their continued representation by the attorney a violation of the rules of professional conduct of the state bar of california.under these circumstances,gilbert right to retain the counsel of her choice must yield to the court obligation to protect the very integrity of our judicial process from a violation of the ethical standards of professional responsibility.citations.because the continuation of the relationship in this situation was prima facie improper,the remedy of disqualification was appropriate.the trial court acted well within its broad discretion in ordering it.citations.id.at,d.
we begin our analysis by observing what we perceive to be an exaggeration in gilbert when it found there was a very real danger to the settling employees posed by any testimony they might give in that case.gilbert,supra,th at,d,orig.emphasis.this is not so because the confidentiality clause of the settlement agreement in gilbert simply provided the parties agree to keep the fact of this settlement and this agreement,and each of its terms,strictly confidential.this provision does not apply to discussions between the employee and his counsel id.at,d.in other words,nothing in the confidentiality clause precluded the settling employees from testifying as percipient witnesses to any events relating to gilbert.
indeed,it would be contrary to public pol
