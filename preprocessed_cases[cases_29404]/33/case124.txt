following the settlement of a wrongful death action for million,plaintiff counsel,brian premo,premo sought an order apportioning the contingent fee award between himself and his former law firm,mackrell,rowlands,premo pierro,the firm.prior to its dissolution,the firm had been retained as counsel in the same action.the united states district court for the northern district of new york hurd,awarded the dissolved law firm as a quantum meruit is,a reasonable hourly fee multiplied by the number of hours it had devoted to the wrongful death matter.the balance of the contingent fee,was awarded to premo.the firm now appeals,arguing that the contingency fee was a firm asset.
we hold that the district court erred by not applying the new york rule that,absent an agreement to the contrary,a dissolving law firm is entitled to the value of the contingent fee at the time of dissolution.accordingly,we vacate the order of the district court and remand for findings whether there was an agreement among the firm shareholders as to the disposition of pending contingency cases and if no such agreement existed,what the value of the contingent fee was when the firm dissolved.
background 
in march,pamela santalucia was killed when her automobile was by a tractor trailer in las vegas,nevada.pamela was the mother of frank james santalucia frank james and former wife of frank santalucia santalucia.santalucia was put in touch with the firm in april regarding representation in a new york state court proceeding to determine the custody of frank james,who was then an infant.
after meeting with santalucia,the firm agreed to represent him in connection with the custody proceeding and proceedings to have santalucia appointed guardian of frank james and administrator of the estate of pamela santalucia.the firm agreed not to bill santalucia for any of this work,anticipating that santalucia would retain the firm to prosecute a wrongful death action on a contingent fee basis.through the efforts of the members of the firm,santalucia was appointed guardian of frank james in october,and was named administrator of pamela santalucia estate in december.
on january,santalucia executed a retainer agreement with the firm for representation in the wrongful death action.the firm was named as counsel in the retainer agreement,although it was understood that premo would be the lead lawyer in this action.over the next year,premo investigated the facts,researched applicable law,and otherwise provided representation in the wrongful death action.
one year later,on january,the shareholders agreed to dissolve the firm and to cease operations as of february.it was agreed that each lawyer would retain his files and continue working on those matters for which he had been responsible.thus,premo was to continue representation in the wrongful death matter,while other members of the firm were to continue representation in santalucia guardianship and estate matters.beyond that,however,the precise terms of the dissolution are in dispute.the firm claims that the shareholders had no agreement as to how pending contingency fees would be distributed upon collection.premo,on the other hand,asserts that there was an oral agreement among the firm shareholders that each lawyer cases,including contingency fee cases and profits derived therefrom,would remain the sole assets and profits of the respective attorneys.
earlier,in september,the other victims of the las vegas accident that killed pamela santalucia initiated a personal injury action against sebright transportation,sebright in the united states district court for the district of nevada.in this nevada action,matters were assigned to magistrate judge lawrence leavitt.on february,after the announcement of the firm dissolution,but prior to the cessation of operations,magistrate judge leavitt invited premo to attend a settlement conference with the parties in the nevada action.although premo had not yet filed suit on behalf of the santalucias,sebright wanted him to attend the settlement conference in the hopes of achieving a global settlement with all of the accident victims.
on february,as announced,the firm ceased operations.after being notified by premo,on or about february,that the firm would be dissolved,santalucia retained premo,individually,on february,to represent him in the wrongful death action.santalucia and premo agreed that any fee due to the firm would come out of premo contingency fee.on february,santalucia and premo memorialized their arrangement by signing a formal retainer agreement.
on march,premo went to nevada to attend magistrate judge leavitt settlement conference.at that conference,sebright offered to settle santalucia claims for million.
to avoid any statute of limitations difficulty,premo filed the instant action in the united states district court for the northern district of new york hurd,on march.the very next day,santalucia accepted sebright settlement offer of million.by the end of july of that year,the settlement agreement was confirmed in writing.
premo thereafter filed an application in the northern district for court approval of the settlement,as well as a determination of attorneys fees due to him and to the firm.on october,judge hurd approved the settlement agreement and,pursuant to premo retainer agreement with santalucia,directed sebright to distribute of santalucia settlement proceeds to premo.
in a subsequent decision dated february,judge hurd apportioned the contingent fee between premo and the firm.see santalucia sebright transportation,wl.judge hurd based his decision principally upon the language of the original retainer agreement that santalucia had signed with the firm in january.that agreement made the following provision in the case of termination of the representation 
the attorneys shall be entitled to payment of their full contingent share of any settlement of or judgment on the claim s or action s for prosecution or adjustment of which they are retained,if wrongfully discharged by client,or the quantum meruit value of their services rendered if they are otherwise discharged,substituted or withdraw from representation before such settlement or judgment is obtained.
the firm never claimed that santalucia had wrongfully discharged it from the representation.therefore,having concluded that,by its dissolution,the firm representation of santalucia had been terminated,the district court held that the firm was entitled only to a quantum meruit recovery.the district court then calculated the reasonable value of the legal services rendered by the firm from its retention in january until its dissolution on february,to be,hours at per hour.thus,the district court directed premo to remit to the firm,and to keep the remaining.see id.at.the firm now appeals.
discussion 
the district court had diversity jurisdiction over frank james underlying wrongful death claim pursuant to.new york law requires court approval of attorney fees when the client is an infant.see jud.law mckinney.the district court,at premo request,then assumed ancillary jurisdiction over this fee dispute between premo and the firm.chesley union carbide,cir it is well settled that a federal court may,in its discretion,exercise ancillary jurisdiction to hear fee disputes between litigants and their attorneys when the dispute relates to the main action citations and internal quotation marks omitted.the parties briefs assume that new york law controls this dispute,and such implied consent is sufficient to establish choice of law.civil environmental engineers,cir.
