lassiter holmes,iii,an attorney practicing in mcallen,texas,was convicted of mail fraud and conspiracy to commit mail fraud,stemming from a scheme he executed with pauline gonzalez,who at the time was the district clerk of hidalgo county,texas,to and file a fraudulent original petition in a medical malpractice suit holmes was handling,for purposes of avoiding a statute of limitations bar.holmes challenges his conviction and sentence on eight grounds.finding no reversible error with respect to his conviction and no plain error with respect to his sentence,we affirm.
holmes was retained in to represent hector and felipa gonzalez in a medical malpractice suit after hector gonzalez suffered the loss of a kidney from the alleged negligence of miguel aleman.over the course of the next two years,holmes worked sporadically on the case,seeking relevant medical records and attempting to procure an expert report.in may,holmes realized that the statute of limitations on the tort claims would soon expire 
on may,holmes filed a pleading styled plaintiff original petition with the hidalgo county district clerk office.a letter from an expert witness,bearing the same date,was attached.holmes paid the required filing fee with a check drawn from his law firm and likewise dated may.the clerk office opened a new case file,assigned a new cause number,and the petition may.that same day,holmes personally delivered a copy of the petition to aleman attorney,ron hole,and faxed a copy to ross.
although the parties took discovery,the suit remained largely dormant for three years,but on may,hole received a letter from bobby garcia,an attorney holmes had brought in to work on the gonzalez suit,seeking to settle the case for million.several days later,on may,the parties attended a mediation.
during the course of the mediation,the between the hole and his partner micaela alvarez,both of whom were representing aleman,and inquired whether they planned to make a settlement offer.they said no.the mediator admonished them to reconsider,telling them they were barking up the wrong tree if they thought they had a limitations defense.hole had asserted a limitations defense in his answer to the may,petition,but never urged it during discovery.specifically,the mediator told the defense what holmes had relayed to her moments before he had mailed an original petition before filing the may,petition,and he had an envelope to prove it.
because this was the first time the issue of an earlier,mailed petition had been raised,hole and alvarez went to the clerk office on may.they examined the case file for the suit filed by hector gonzalez against aleman and found no indication that a petition had been filed in advance of the petition that was may.
on may,hole moved for summary judgment raising,inter alia,the defense that limitations had run on may,but suit was not initiated until may.the next day,may,holmes sent the following letter by fax to pauline gonzalez the district clerk for hidalgo county 
dear gonzalez 
upon may,i mailed a petition style sic hector and felipa gonzalez miguel aleman.it has come to my attention that the petition was never made part of the record.
could you please conduct an investigation into this matter to determine if this petition was ever received by your office.
thank you for your assistance.

lassiter holmes,iii 
pauline gonzalez faxed the following answer on may,
in response to your inquiry,the plaintiff original petition in cause number was received.the search was conducted and petition was found in our office bearing the stamp file date of may.
if you have any questions or inquiries,please do not hesitate to contact me.

hidalgo county 
indeed,when alvarez returned to the clerk office on may to reexamine the file,she discovered a document styled plaintiff original petition,this one bearing a file stamp of may,this petition contained holmes signature in blue ink and a notation of check number under the signature block in addition,alvarez discovered what remained of a envelope,postmarked may,with the return address of holmes law firm.the envelope was severely torn such that the content of the addressee portion was not legible save the letter s,preceded by a portion of a letter that appears to be an e,and a small portion of a third letter 
in light of the sudden emergence of this hitherto nonexistent document,hole sought and received permission from the state district court to depose holmes and pauline gonzalez in his deposition,holmes testified that he mailed the original petition on the evening of may and that he had addressed the envelope to pauline gonzalez and had misspelled her name to end in an es.
although the record is opaque on the exact circumstances,holmes subsequently entered into a settlement agreement by which he would dismiss all claims against aleman and pay to aleman insurance carrier.holmes also executed an agreement with hector and felipa gonzalez whereby they agreed to release all malpractice claims against holmes in exchange for.
holmes did not,however,obtain peace with these settlements hole and alvarez filed a formal grievance against him with the state bar of texas.at a disciplinary hearing held in october,hole presented forensic evidence that the bond paper on which the may petition was printed contained a watermark and date code.according to the manufacturer hole maintained,the date code corresponded to the year,and thus the bond paper could not have been manufactured before.the petition could not,therefore,have been printed and mailed,as holmes suggested,in may.holmes received a sanction of two years probation from the state bar.
texas authorities subsequently initiated an investigation of the hidalgo county clerk office.in an interview with texas ranger israel pacheco on march,holmes gave a revised version of the events he had made several attempts to obtain a copy of the original petition he mailed on may,before he filed the petition on may,but the clerk office was unable to locate the original petition,so he brought a copy of the earlier,original petition to the clerk office as a to show employees the document he was looking for.
federal investigators initiated an independent investigation.he and pauline gonzalez were indicted for conspiracy to commit mail fraud in violation of count one and mail fraud in violation of and count two 
holmes testified in his own defense,trying to convince the jury that the copy he brought to the clerk office as a became the petition may,when someone in the clerk office erroneously it as for the may petition,holmes story was that he mailed the original petition on may,but it did not contain an expert report,so after securing an expert report he went to the clerk office with another petition attaching the report and because the deputy clerk was unable to tell him what cause number had been assigned to his earlier petition,he filed the may petition as if it were the new filing expecting that,when the may petition was located,the district clerk office would clean up the paperwork.
the jury was not persuaded,and holmes was convicted on both counts.he now appeals his conviction and sentence on various grounds.
holmes contends the district court admitted the videotaped and transcribed deposition testimony of pauline gonzalez in contravention of his sixth amendment right of confrontation.the government proffered gonzalez deposition testimony as a statement under federal rule of evidence d e,according to which a statement is admissible nonhearsay if it is made by a during the course of the conspiracy and in furtherance of the conspiracy.the government asserts that gonzalez deposition,which was taken by hole on may,only a few days after the petition may,was discovered,consisted of statements by a made in furtherance of the conspiracy with holmes,insofar as her testimony was an effort to conceal the objectives of a conspiracy then occurring 
during hole direct testimony,the government played gonzalez videotaped deposition and offered a transcribed copy of the deposition into the record.before playing the tape,the court inquired whether there was any objection,to which defense counsel responded,none whatsoever,judge.the court likewise inquired whether there was any objection before admitting the transcribed copy of the deposition,to which defense counsel responded in kind,no objection,judge.
notwithstanding the approach to this evidence taken at trial,holmes submits on appeal that the admission of this evidence violated his rights under the confrontation clause given holmes failure to object,our review is for plain error.see united states cartwright,cir.b.
holmes relies on crawford washington,d,in which the court fundamentally altered the scope and effect of the confrontation clause by replacing the balancing test,which had delimited the right to confrontation,with a categorical rule barring the admission of testimonial statements against the accused absent opportunity for.see crawford.at.
before crawford,the right of confrontation was controlled by ohio roberts,d,which held that the sixth amendment does not bar admission of an unavailable witness statement against a criminal defendant so long as the statement bears adequate indicia of reliability.to meet that test,roberts required that the statement either fall within a firmly rooted hearsay exception or bear particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.id.applying this approach,the court held,in bourjaily united states,d,that the exception to the hearsay rule was sufficiently steeped in our jurisprudence that the confrontation clause does not require a court to embark on an independent inquiry into the reliability of statements that satisfy the requirements of rule d e.
crawford abrogated roberts with respect to prior testimonial statements such statements may not be admitted against a defendant unless he has an opportunity to the declarant,irrespective of whether the statement falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception or bears particularized guarantees of trustworthiness with respect to nontestimonial statements,however,crawford leaves in place the roberts approach to determining admissibility 
because the categorical rule adopted in crawford is triggered only with respect to testimonial evidence,whether a challenged statement falls within the class of evidence deemed testimonial will generally be.but crawford declined to spell out a comprehensive definition of testimonial.crawford.at.instead,the court held that w hatever else the term covers,it applies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing,before a grand jury,or at a former trial and to police interrogations.id.beyond these specific examples,however,the boundaries of testimonial evidence remain unsettled.the court quoted three potential formulations of the core class of testimonial statements but declined to adopt or reject any of them 
in the case at hand,we are presented with a challenge to the admission of a statement made during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy in civil deposition testimony.statements made by a during the course and in furtherance of a conspiracy are by their nature generally nontestimonial and thus are routinely admitted against an accused despite the absence of an opportunity for the challenged evidence here,however,is not the statement made unwittingly to a confidential government informant or made casually to a rather,we have a statement that is derived from a formalized testimonial and sworn civil deposition testimony.
whether this evidence is testimonial as crawford used that term is uncertain.this case does not,however,require resolution of whether gonzalez civil deposition qualifies as testimonial evidence triggering the right of confrontation.even assuming arguendo that her deposition is testimonial under crawford,there was no constitutional error,because the government did not offer her testimony to prove the truth of the matter asserted 
in her deposition,pauline gonzalez lamented the organizational problems in the clerk office,testifying that her office was forced to deal with sloppy lawyers who were invariably forgetting and confusing pleadings,and was staffed by rotating and volunteer clerks prone to mistakes.pauline gonzalez thus explained that someone in the office could have mistakenly the petition after looking up the case information on the computer and using the postmark date stamped on the torn envelope.
far from offering this testimony to prove its truthfulness,the government sought to establish its falsity through independent evidence.indeed,the entire thrust of the government case was that the was not the result of a clerical error,but instead was the objective of an illicit conspiracy between holmes and pauline gonzalez.gonzalez testimony was thus offered both to show the existence of a scheme and to prove one of the overt acts charged in the indictment even assuming that her civil deposition testimony is testimonial within the meaning of crawford,then,this nonhearsay use of her testimony poses no confrontation clause concerns.see crawford.at street,at.
the irony is that holmes was keenly aware of the fact that pauline gonzalez was not a witness against him inasmuch as her deposition testimony was not inculpatory.in fact,it was holmes,not the government,that repeatedly relied on her deposition testimony at trial for its truthfulness.the record is replete with instances in which holmes pointed to gonzalez deposition testimony as exculpatory and corroborating his primary defense,that the pleading he provided as a must have been in error by someone in the clerk office.
during opening argument,for example,the defense pointed to the deposition as exculpatory 
pauline gonzalez,by way of her testimony,will tell you what she thinks happened on that videotape.someone took that blank petition,looked it up in the computer,pulled that case out of the computer,because the government already told you it was filed on may.
the defense relied on the exculpatory nature of her deposition testimony again while ron hole 
q gonzalez offered an explanation for how this could have happened,did she 
a not in my mind it was not a plausible explanation.
q she attempted or said that it could have been file marked by mistake,did she say that in the deposition and she indicated that some clerk or some volunteer working in the office could have done it accidentally and not deliberately,without any malice,on the video.
the defense returned to the exculpatory force of her testimony again during closing argument 
now,gonzalez says on her video,sworn deposition someone could very easily have said,just put the cause number on it or file it.put it with the file well,that not a crime,and no one should go to the penitentiary and be convicted of two federal felonies for that.
that the government did not offer gonzalez civil deposition testimony for the purpose of proving the truth of the matters to which holmes points can not seriously be contested.after all,the entire raison for the indictment and the felony charges was the government belief that the petition was the result of a criminal conspiracy and not some clerical error.because the government did not offer her testimony for its truth,there is no sixth amendment violation 
holmes contends that the evidence is insufficient to sustain his convictions for conspiracy to commit mail fraud and the substantive mail fraud offense.we address each count in turn.
it is by now that a defendant seeking reversal on the basis of insufficient evidence swims upstream.united states mulderig,cir.in reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence,we view all the evidence and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the verdict,and ask whether a rational trier of fact could have found that the evidence established the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.see,united states smith,cir.in so doing,we apply a rule of reason,knowing that the jury may properly rely on their common sense and evaluate the facts in light of their knowledge and the natural tendencies and inclinations of human beings.mulderig,at quoting united states ayala,cir.
because the jury is free to choose among reasonable constructions of the evidence,united states richards,cir,and retains the sole authority to weigh conflicting evidence and evaluate the credibility of the witnesses,united states millsaps,cir,it is not necessary that the evidence exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except that of guilt.united states williams,cir.if,however,the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict points equally to a theory of innocence and guilt,we will reverse a conviction based on circumstantial evidence.mulderig,at.
holmes challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction of conspiracy,characterizing the government case as establishing only that he prepared a pleading and gave it to the clerk office,which,in turn,it may.although he admits that it is not unreasonable to conclude from the record that pauline gonzalez caused the to occur,he contends that the evidence is insufficient in two allegedly critical respects first,there is no evidence demonstrating his knowledge of the at the time and second,there is no evidence demonstrating any motive on the part of gonzalez to the pleading.in the absence of such evidence,holmes claims he can not properly be found guilty of conspiracy without wild speculation.
to prove a conspiracy in violation of,the government must establish three elements beyond a reasonable doubt an agreement between two or more persons to pursue an unlawful objective the defendant knowledge of the unlawful objective and voluntary agreement to join the conspiracy and an overt act by one or more members of the conspiracy in furtherance of the objective of the conspiracy,united states peterson,cir.the government need not rely on direct evidence of a conspiracy each element may be proven by circumstantial evidence.mulderig,at.
the evidence is sufficient to support conspiracy.although his trial story it had to,given the bond paper his earlier deposition testimony,holmes admitted that the may,petition could not have been mailed on that date and that he printed and signed the petition that was ultimately may,by the clerk office and placed into the case file.
coupled with this admission,the jury could reasonably have concluded that the envelope in which holmes claims to have mailed the original petition on may,was actually a envelope in which something was returned to holmes law firm if this envelope,which as the postmark reveals had at one point been properly mailed,was in fact addressed to holmes law firm,the jury reasonably could have concluded that it was at some point prior to being placed in the clerk case file in holmes possession.
at a minimum,then,the evidence reveals that holmes gave someone in the clerk office both the petition that was ultimately and the envelope in which he claims to have mailed the original petition.the question,then,is whether there was an agreement or common purpose to the pleading and represent it to be the original.on that score,as the district court observed in its thorough memorandum,the testimony of three clerk employees is sufficient to give rise to the inference that holmes was knowingly working in concert with pauline gonzalez.
first,alexandra gomez,a criminal appeals clerk,testified that holmes approached her and he asked me if i could step outside because he needed to speak with me.she testified that holmes asked if it was possible for me to something for him that needed to be put into the file,or should have been put in the file.and i told him i could not.after refusing holmes request,gomez told holmes she could not be the one to do that,that he would need to speak with gonzalez to see what she could do.gomez testified further that a week after she refused holmes request,gonzalez called me on the telephone and asked me to stamp file a pleading that was on her desk with the date it had written on it,but that she refused because she knew it was against our rules to do that,the district clerk office rules.
second,veronica muniz testified that,at some point during the critical time period may,she observed holmes speaking with pauline gonzalez in gonzalez office.and,although she was the employee in the clerk office who had examined the file with hole and alvarez and did not find any indication of an earlier petition,muniz testified that shortly after observing holmes and gonzalez speaking privately,she saw a letter printing out that said they the clerk office had found the document.she then identified the may,letter sent by fax from gonzalez to holmes as the letter she observed in the printer,and relayed that,upon seeing the letter,i was surprised because i had,you know,i had been looking through the file,and i could find anything.so i was just surprised that it had been found 
third,viola wise testified that she prepared the may,letter from pauline gonzalez to holmes at the direction of gonzalez.specifically,wise testified to a conversation she had with gonzalez during which gonzalez said that she had found a missing document and instructed wise to go ahead and make a letter stating that gonzalez had found the paperwork.
based on this testimony,the jury could reasonably have concluded that holmes was seeking assistance to a petition and that after holmes met privately with pauline gonzalez,she asked gomez exactly what holmes had previously asked her to the petition,and that gonzalez then directed another employee to prepare a letter stating that the petition had been found.this testimony,when taken together with holmes admission that the petition ultimately was printed and signed as an original by him and provided to the clerk office,and the expert testimony concerning the envelope,is more than sufficient to establish an adequate picture of holmes role in the conspiracy.thus,despite holmes continued reliance on his version of the events in someone in the clerk office must have the pleading in jury was free to reject his explanation and accept the government.
to the extent holmes relies on the government failure to establish pauline gonzalez motive,he is attempting to avail himself of the absence of evidence the government was not required to offer.to be sure,the government did not establish gonzalez motive for conspiring with holmes to the petition indeed,the government admitted as much during closing argument 
the only thing are charged to figure out is what the motive of everybody is,and i submit to you,i ca exactly tell you what gonzalez motive was.i tell you she did violate her oath of office.i tell you she did something illegal.whether holmes promised to give her some money on the end,i do know.i think it reasonable to suspect,but i think it equally reasonable that she just is corrupt and just decided to allow a lawyer to do something like that,and she was willing to use her office to help him.
nevertheless,because the government is not required to prove gonzalez subjective intent for conspiring with holmes,the absence of such motive evidence does not render insufficient the evidence supporting holmes conviction of conspiracy.
with respect to the substantive mail fraud offense,holmes contends that the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction because the alleged misrepresentations were immaterial.specifically,he reasons that regardless of whether the may or may date is used for purposes of limitations,the underlying medical malpractice claims were time barred,and thus any representations about the may petition being the original were immaterial.
to prove mail fraud under,the government must show a scheme to defraud the use of the mails to execute the scheme and the specific intent to defraud.united states bieganowski,cir.in addition,the supreme court has interpreted section to require that the misstatement made in the course of the scheme to defraud be a material one.id.citing neder united states,d because holmes limits his attack to the materiality of the alleged misrepresentations,we cabin our analysis accordingly.
when the defense in the underlying tort suit moved for summary judgment asserting that hector gonzalez suit was as of may,holmes was taking a position completely contrary to what he urges now.indeed,in his opposition to summary judgment,holmes repeatedly pointed to the may,filing date as defeating aleman limitations defense.consider,for example,the following passages from holmes pleading 
the defendant admits on page six of his motion that the last date to file would have been may.assuming this date to be true,the filing of the plaintiffs petition on may,would have been timely.
alternatively,assuming arguendo that the last date of treatment was february,as asserted by the defendant then the limitations period would have extended to may,which would have been three days after the filing of the plaintiffs petition.
despite these representations,which plainly contemplate the may date as viable for limitations purposes,holmes characterizes the evidence adduced at trial supporting his assertion that either date was beyond the limitations period as overwhelming.his brief,however,fails to cite any record evidence supporting this claim.our independent review of the record indicates that,during the defense of hole and again during closing argument,the defense attempted to use the materials submitted by hole to the state bar to establish that limitations had expired as of either date.
specifically,the defense pointed to a chronology of events included in the file prepared by hole,which indicates that on april,the sol runs on last negligence claim,and includes a notation that holmes was correct that the statute on the visit would have expired on not as originally indicated.from this single entry,the defense claimed that the limitations period expired in april,and thus argued to the jury that holmes had no motive to fabricate a petition with a may,
holmes fails,however,to account for the next entry in that same chronology on may,the chronology notes,the sol runs on last treatment date.thus,contrary to holmes wholesale claim that the limitations period expired in april,aleman lawyers believed that claims calculated from the last date of treatment pursuant to what the parties refer to in their summary judgment papers as the continuing course of treatment doctrine,rather than from the last date of negligent treatment,were potentially viable as a limitations matter until may,and,as we indicated,this is precisely what holmes asserted in his opposition to summary judgment.
doubtless it is now with the medical malpractice case over,and sitting under two federal felony convictions in holmes interest to disclaim his previous reliance on the continuing course of treatment doctrine and to maintain that the suit would have been even on may.but there was never any judicial resolution of the limitations question instead,the record reflects a vigorous dispute as to the proper calculation of limitations.at the time,aleman lawyers were asserting that claims not filed by may were and holmes responded by claiming that the suit was not because the petition filed on may fraudulent timely filed.
therefore,to the extent holmes represented that the suit was filed on may,this representation could have saved him from a limitations bar had the state court ultimately accepted the view that the applicable trigger date was the last date of treatment,as holmes himself pressed in his response to summary judgment that holmes or even hole may now regard this as unlikely is not controlling that the may date could have saved the suit from the pressed by aleman defense counsel is.these representations thus were material,so we affirm holmes conviction of mail fraud.
holmes avers that the government closing argument contained an improper plea for sympathy for hector and felipa gonzalez,thereby prejudicing the jury against him to such a degree that he was denied a fair trial.we find no error.
improper prosecutorial comments constitute reversible error only where the defendant right to a fair trial is substantially affected.united states bernard,cir quoting united states andrews,cir.a criminal conviction is not to be lightly overturned on the basis of a prosecutor comments standing alone.the determinative question is whether the prosecutor remarks cast serious doubt on the correctness of the jury verdict.united states iredia,cir.
to resolve this question,we consider the magnitude of the prejudicial effect of the challenged statements,the efficacy of any cautionary instructions,and the strength of the evidence of the defendant guilt.bernard,at citing andrews,at.this already narrow standard of review is further constrained by holmes failure to object he bears the burden of demonstrating that the prosecutor statements constitute plain error.see.b.
holmes has failed to demonstrate error,much less plain error.the prosecutor lengthy closing argument,viewed in its entirety and in context of the charged offenses,is not primarily an appeal to the jurors emotions regarding hector and felipa gonzalez rather,the prosecutor was attempting to underscore the situation holmes found himself in,having missed the limitations period on an ostensibly serious and valuable medical malpractice claim.
the government therefore referred to the underlying malpractice suit as demonstrating holmes motive for conspiring with pauline gonzalez to a fraudulent petition.thus,although the government closing argument undoubtedly contains certain statements that tend to evoke sympathy for hector and felipa gonzalez,the subject of the malpractice suit,including its therefore the seriousness of the injury suffered by hector gonzalez,and the value that injury would have in such a obvious relevance beyond an argumentum ad misericordiam.
and once it is accepted that the merits of the underlying malpractice suit bear on holmes motive,the propriety of the prosecutor statements becomes a question of degree.at that point,we must proceed in light of the wide latitude afforded counsel when presenting jury argument.see united states,cir.here,given the district court cautionary instruction to the jury to consider only the evidence and that the attorneys arguments were not evidence,and the critical fact that these statements were neither persistent nor pronounced when viewed within the context of the entire closing argument,bradford whitley,cir,it is unlikely that the jury was led astray in any event,there is substantial evidence supporting conviction on both counts.the prosecutor unobjected statements do not produce reversible error.
holmes avers that his substantial rights were prejudiced by the government delayed disclosure of pacheco report summarizing his march interview the government concedes the delayed disclosure and resulting violation of federal rule of criminal procedure a a.
the standard of review for discovery matters is steep.we review alleged errors in the administration of discovery rules under an abuse of discretion standard and will not reverse on that basis unless a defendant establishes prejudice to his substantial rights.see united states ellender,cir citing united states garcia,cir 
the district court rejected holmes claim holding that he failed to demonstrate prejudice to his substantial rights because defense counsel had ample time to review the report,make holmes aware of its contents,and prepare him for any questions concerning the report on moreover,the district court characterized as disingenuous holmes claim that the delayed disclosure undermined the defense strategy and theory of the case the court observed that holmes could not have been by the contents of a report summarizing a meeting he attended with his attorney in fact,the district court noted that the defense had a lengthy,contemporaneous report holmes had prepared about the interview.
holmes now contends his substantial rights were prejudiced insofar as he was forced to decide whether to testify in his own defense before he received a copy of pacheco report.holmes claims that the central defense theory of the case turned on proving that someone in the clerk office had without his knowledge or encouragement the petition he had brought as a reference but because he was unaware of the existence of pacheco written summary of the interview where he had explained this story,he felt forced to testify.
as a threshold matter,there is no merit to holmes suggestion that had he known about pacheco written summary of his interview he could have relied solely on that report,could have refrained from taking the stand,and still would have adequately presented his defense theory to the jury.pacheco written summary is not sufficient by itself to present holmes states that holmes claimed to have brought a copy of the petition to the clerk office it does not,however,explain why this copy was signed and printed as an original.indeed,it was only when holmes testified on direct examination that the jury was treated to his explanation for this seeming irregularity 
q ordinarily,how do you handle your copies,copies of petitions that are in your file 
a i sign them.
a i like signing my names sic the pleadings.i just like doing it.
moreover,pacheco written summary of holmes statement is wholly insufficient to provide an exculpatory answer to any of the other critical questions in this case,questions that only holmes was competent to testify about.only he could testify to the alleged preparation of the petition and envelope on may,which he claims to have done alone or the alleged mailing of that still undiscovered petition.only he could explain what he actually was inquiring of gomez,who testified that holmes asked her to and file a pleading or the many occasions on which he claims to have gone although no other witness was able to corroborate these periodic stops to the clerk office to inquire about his missing petition or why he told aleman lawyer and insurance adjustor he was going to file the suit today on may,if he had in fact already mailed a petition and was referring only to the filing of an expert report or why,if he had in fact mailed an earlier petition,he did not style the petition filed on may,first amended petition or something similar.
it is therefore implausible to credit holmes suggestion that timely disclosure of pacheco written summary of his interview would have rendered holmes testimony unnecessary such that the delay prejudiced his substantial rights thus,although we have indicated that the delayed disclosure of a report within rule mandate of disclosure may be prejudicial if a defendant has to decide whether to testify before becoming aware of the statement particulars holmes can not credibly suggest that he would not have testified had the government produced the document in a timely manner.absent such prejudice,the delayed disclosure is not reversible error.
holmes challenges the denial of his motion for a new trial based on evidence.we reject his claim.
holmes points to the deposition of claude hildreth,a private investigator,taken during discovery in the legal malpractice suit.holmes contends that hildreth deposition testimony reveals that he was instructed by hole and alvarez to contact hector and felipa gonzalez and to inform them of holmes misconduct related to the filing of their medical malpractice lawsuit.according to holmes,this testimony contradicts hole and alvarez testimony and lends credence to holmes theory that hole and alvarez were pursuing a vendetta against him.
alvarez testified that she felt precluded as a matter of professional her role as opposing counsel in the underlying medical malpractice contacting hector and felipa gonzalez to relate the truth about their lawsuit.she did,however,testify that she felt obliged to write a letter to the editor of a local mcallen newspaper setting out candidate bobby garcia involvement in and awareness of holmes conduct in the underlying medical malpractice suit after viewing a campaign advertisement portraying him as the candidate who stood for good ethical practice and honesty and integrity in the mayor office.it was after reading this letter to the editor,hole testified,that hector and felipa gonzalez contacted his office,and it was only then that alvarez referred them to an attorney to pursue a legal malpractice suit against holmes.
we review the denial of a motion for new trial for abuse of discretion,see,united states blackthorne,cir,and we subject new trial motions based on evidence to an unusually stringent substantive test,united states ugalde,cir.namely,under the berry rule,a defendant is not entitled to a new trial on the basis of evidence unless he demonstrates that the evidence is newly discovered and was unknown to him at the time of trial the failure to discover the evidence was not due to his lack of diligence the evidence is not merely cumulative or impeaching,but is material and the evidence would probably produce an acquittal.see united states freeman,cir citing berry georgia.
holmes can not satisfy these standards.leaving aside the question of diligence whether a private investigator caused hector gonzalez to contact alvarez,and whether the investigator was directed to do so by hole or alvarez,do not bear on whether holmes committed the charged offenses.indeed,as the district court noted,even if hole did everything in his power to ensure that gonzalez brought a legal malpractice claim against holmes,this fact could not affect holmes guilt or innocence.
to be sure,hildreth testimony would have provided some support to holmes claim that hole had a vendetta against him.nevertheless,insofar as this evidence only casts doubt on the veracity of hole and alvarez testimony regarding their contact with hector and felipa gonzalez and demonstrates a bias on the part of methods of is merely impeachment evidence,and therefore insufficient to entitle holmes to a new trial.see,blackthorne,at.in any event,given the substantial evidence supporting the verdict beyond the testimony of hole and alvarez,this impeachment evidence does not have any tendency to undermine the outcome.
holmes contends that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance under the sixth amendment.this assertion is without merit.
holmes advanced his ineffective assistance claim in an amended motion for new trial in which he faulted counsel for failing to object to the government use of the pacheco report on and various instances of alleged prosecutorial misconduct.after a hearing,the district court denied relief,finding that holmes had failed to satisfy even the first requirement of strickland washington,d namely,that counsel performance was deficient.
the court referenced an affidavit of trial counsel submitted with holmes that characterized the failure to object to certain perceived errors as deliberate trial strategy.relying on our precedent foreclosing reliance on informed tactical decisions except in the most exceptional circumstances as a basis for claims of ineffective assistance the court faulted holmes for trying to have it both ways,using a deliberate,reasonable strategy at trial,and then relying on that same strategy as grounds for a new trial.
holmes charts a different tack on appeal.he now faults counsel for,as his brief puts it,deciding to be nice guy agreeable to everybody except his client.he claims that counsel without objection allowed the case to be tried in houston as opposed to mcallen or laredo,and then lied to holmes about the circumstances of the houston venue selection failed to conduct a proper investigation of certain important materials and subjected holmes to outrageous and improper covering as much as seven or eight hours over a period of two days.
because holmes did not present to the district court his claims concerning counsel handling of venue and failure to investigate,we must determine as a threshold matter whether to address these claims.our controlling precedent generally precludes review on direct appeal of ineffective assistance claims in the absence of presentment to the district court and an adequately developed record.see,united states navejar,cir 
although the record does contain testimony at the hearing on the question of venue and on counsel failure to investigate certain materials,these claims were not presented to the district court as grounds for relief.because the record on these issues is incomplete and inadequate for proper appellate review,we decline to reach them.we also express no opinion as to their merit vel non.
to the extent,however,that holmes complaints regarding and counsel passivity overlap and restate the claim actually developed and presented to the district court based on counsel failure to object to various instances of prosecutorial misconduct,we reject holmes claim.his briefing on this issue is devoid of serious analysis.he does not address the district court findings regarding trial counsel apparent deliberate strategy of passivity.nor does he provide even a single citation to even a single example of improper by the prosecutor and a possible valid objection counsel could have raised.instead,holmes merely concludes that counsel performance constitutes an utter perversion of the relationship.
this bare assertion will not suffice.to succeed on his ineffective assistance claim,holmes bears the burden of demonstrating that counsel performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced his defense.holmes can not escape this burden merely by stating his conclusion.mere conclusory allegations in support of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel are insufficient to raise a constitutional issue.green johnson,cir.
the presentence report psr grouped the two counts of conviction and applied the version of the sentencing guidelines.the psr scored holmes at a base offense level of under and enhanced his offense level by eight levels because the offense involved an elected official or official holding a or sensitive position pursuant to b b,for a total offense level of.holmes had a criminal history score of i,yielding a punishment range of to months imprisonment.
the government filed a written objection to the psr failure to recommend a enhancement for obstruction of justice pursuant to,because holmes had falsely testified under oath during his trial.the court sustained the objection.thus,holmes offense level was increased to,yielding a range of to months.the court sentenced holmes to concurrent terms and three years supervised release 
a few days later,the court held a telephonic conference with all counsel and holmes.as the transcript of the call reveals,the court wanted to revisit the obstruction of justice enhancement to make absolutely sure that the court had been sufficiently specific about the statements that the court believes to be perjurious.the court thus systematically identified each of the statements it found to be false and therefore to be providing the basis for the enhancement 
in his initial brief on appeal,holmes,on two grounds,challenges as clear error the sentencing enhancement for obstruction of justice.first,he avers that certain statements found to be false by the district court are not so and second,he asserts that,even if false,his deposition testimony can not not form the basis for the perjury enhancement,because the deposition was taken before any official investigation.
we review a district court finding of obstruction of justice for clear error.united states powers,cir.a factual finding is not clearly erroneous as long as it is plausible in light of the record as a whole.id.quoting united states cluck,cir.this is particularly true where a sentencing court imposition of a enhancement is based,at least in part,upon an evaluation of a witness credibility.id.citing johnson collins,cir.
holmes attempts to show clear error by essentially repeating his version of the events in question,maintaining that neither his claim to have brought the ultimately petition to the clerk office as a nor his claim to have mailed the original petition on may,was controverted by the evidence at trial.these claims were apparently unconvincing to the jury,and there is more than ample evidence supporting the district court determination that these statements,among others,were false.this is particularly true given that holmes was the key witness in his own defense,setting his own story of the events in question against the entirety of the government case,and therefore the district court perjury conclusion is based substantially on a determination about holmes credibility 
this does not,however,end the sentencing inquiry.during the pendency of this appeal,the supreme court decided united states booker,d,and holmes has raised,in supplemental briefing,a constitutional challenge,asserting that his sentence is infirm because it was enhanced based on a judicial finding that his offense involved an elected official under b b and a judicial finding that he obstructed justice by committing perjury under.
holmes did not object to his sentence on sixth amendment grounds in the district court,so our review is for plain error.see,booker.at united states mares,wl.lexis,at cir.under plain error review,we may not correct an error not raised in the district court unless there is an error that is plain and that affects substantial rights.see,johnson united states,d.if all three conditions are met,an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error,but only if the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.at.alternation in original internal quotation marks omitted quoting united states olano,d.
holmes first contends that the enhancement for an offense involving an under b b is error under booker.he contends that the jury verdict alone did not find that pauline gonzalez was an elected official.this is frivolous.holmes admitted as much at trial,and that is all booker requires 
holmes next contends that the enhancement for obstruction of justice based on his perjury at trial under is error under booker because the jury was never presented with the question whether he obstructed justice.insofar as the jury was not specifically asked and instructed to find beyond a reasonable doubt as is required with the elements of charged offenses whether holmes committed perjury while on the stand,and thus obstructed justice,imposing this enhancement under a mandatory guidelines regime was error under the sixth amendment 
because there was error,the second prong of plain error review requires us to determine whether the error was plain.johnson,at.although the error was not plain at the time of sentencing,it is now plain in light of booker 
we therefore turn to the third prong of plain error review whether the error affects substantial rights,which means that the error must have been prejudicial it must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.olano,at.and i t is the defendant rather than the government who bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice.id 
to carry this burden,a defendant must show a reasonable probability that,but for the error claimed,the result of the proceeding would have been different.dominguez benitez.at alteration in original quoting united states bagley,d.a defendant must thus satisfy the judgment of the reviewing court,informed by the entire record,that the probability of a different result is sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.at quoting washington,at.
in assessing whether a defendant has carried his burden of showing prejudice,we must,as this court in mares and the eleventh circuit in rodriguez have cogently explained,keep in mind precisely what thus what is under booker.the precise sixth amendment error identified in booker is not the use of enhancements that increase a sentence the constitutional error is that enhancements were being used under mandatory guidelines.see mares,at,wl.lexis,at rodriguez,at.
thus,in applying the third prong,the pertinent question is whether the defendant demonstrated that the sentencing under an advisory scheme rather than a mandatory have reached a significantly different result.mares,at,wl.lexis,at.absent some indication in the record that the outcome would have been different if the district court had been operating under an advisory system,a defendant fails to carry his burden of demonstrating prejudice and therefore that the error affected his substantial rights 
holmes attempts to demonstrate prejudice by quoting the following statement apparently made by the district judge at sentencing 
those who practice in my court have heard me say many times that i generally think the guidelines provide punishments that are far too harsh i also think that i took an oath to apply the law faithfully.and i do have a portfolio to ignore the sentencing table.
the problem for holmes is that he failed to include in the record on appeal the transcript of that hearing as a result,even if the alleged quoted statement constituted a sufficient basis for holmes to carry his burden of demonstrating prejudice a question we do not answer,it is not in the record on appeal and thus can not form the basis for a finding of prejudice nor has holmes identified any other basis in the record to suggest that the outcome would have been different if the district court had been operating under an advisory guidelines system.holmes has therefore failed to carry his burden as to the third prong of the plain error test.
there is no reversible error in the conviction and no plain error in the sentence.the judgments of conviction and sentence are 
holmes relayed this point to richard ross,the insurance adjustor assigned to handle aleman case,in a phone conversation on may,in which holmes said he would be filing hector gonzalez suit today,because limitations would expire the next day.
holmes copied hole on this letter and sent him a version by mail.the letter sent to hole was not,however,a photocopy of the letter faxed to gonzalez but was a version that,save for a typographical error,is identical.
unlike the petition filed on may,however,this petition was not and did not have a signature stamp naming the particular deputy clerk who had received the pleading,both of which the record reveals were customary practices in the clerk office.
the check number on this petition is the same as the check dated may with which holmes paid the filing fee for the may petition.
the true addressee of this envelope was a significant issue at trial,because the government alleged,and attempted to prove through expert testimony from a texas department of public safety document examiner,that holmes provided this envelope as part of his fraudulent scheme the government maintained that the envelope was likely a stamped envelope holmes had in an old case file with his law firm name as the addressee,and he tore the envelope such that only the letters es remained.
hole subsequently received permission from the state district court to remove the petition dated may for purposes of conducting nondestructive forensic testing.
the government presented the testimony of edward kennedy,a longtime employee of southworth paper company,the manufacturer of the bond paper,who corroborated these facts.holmes made no effort to dispute this evidence at trial.
holmes was represented at this meeting by counsel,and both he and counsel took copious notes.see infra part vi.
gonzalez was not tried with holmes after the indictment was returned,she became physically incapacitated,suffering from health problems.she died while charges were pending.
according to this theory,the earlier,original petition holmes claims to have mailed is still missing,although the envelope in which he claims to have mailed it has surfaced.

the indictment returned by the grand jury specifically charged that o n or about may,defendant pauline gonzalez testified falsely in a deposition regarding a civil petition bearing a date of may.
the manner in which holmes has presented this claim to the court bears mentioning his claim amounts to a wholesale challenge to gonzalez testimony.that is,of the less than two pages his brief devotes to this claimed constitutional error,holmes does not identify a single specific statement made by gonzalez that was offered against him for the truth of the matter asserted.at oral argument,the government stressed the nonhearsay use of this evidence,and we asked defense counsel why such use would pose confrontation clause concerns,to which we were told,without elaboration or example,there were truthful matters asserted.
of course,even if we had found an error,a separate question would follow whether,having forfeited the error by failing to object,we would exercise our discretion under rule b to correct it.in crawford,the court noted the applicability of the harmless error doctrine,see crawford.at id.at rehnquist,concurring in the judgment but we do not read those references as altering the applicability of the plain error rubric where there was no trial objection,and thus holmes would have the burden of demonstrating that the error affected substantial rights.although our disposition renders this inquiry unnecessary,we note that it would be strange,indeed,were we to hold that the admission of evidence to which the accused repeatedly relied upon as exculpatory and favoring an acquittal was such an egregious error that justice and the public integrity of the judicial process require the remedy he seeks reversal.more likely,the opposite is true.
a forensic document expert from the texas department of public safety testified that the partially visible letter preceding the letters es could not have been an the expert testified that the letter was more likely an m,which,of course,would be consistent with holmes.the jury reasonably could have credited this testimony rather than accepting holmes testimony that the es resulted from his misspelling of gonzalez last name.
muniz also testified that it was significant that the petition was not signed by a clerk,observing that b ecause if it an original petition it should have the specific time that it was filed and it also should have a signature on it.
the mail fraud statute expressly applies to a scheme or artifice to defraud another of the intangible right of honest services.the government entered into evidence the constitutional oath of office taken by gonzalez,see.const.art.xvi,and the oath taken by holmes as a condition of membership in the state bar of texas,see.gov t code ann.the court also instructed the jury that tampering with or fabricating government documents and committing perjury are prohibited by texas law.holmes does not,however,raise any challenge to the applicability of the intangible services doctrine to the facts at hand.

to the extent holmes complains that the prosecutor closing argument was improper insofar as it conveyed to the jury that hector and felipa gonzalez were denied their day in court not as a consequence of his conceded legal malpractice,but,rather,as a result of his illegal actions,this argument is also meritless.the prosecutor did not argue that they were denied their chance to have their case heard in court as a consequence of the charged crimes to the contrary,the prosecutor argued that the reason they never got the same chance their lawyer got this week to have their case heard in court is that their lawyer made a mistake.and then he compounded that mistake by violating the law.

the district court determined that there appears to be no dispute that the pacheco report was provided to defense counsel during the trial but before the defense had started to present any evidence.holmes brief,however,suggests that the report was not disclosed until after a break taken during the course of holmes direct testimony.
