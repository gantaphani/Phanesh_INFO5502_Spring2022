david williams appeals from the october,judgment of the united states district court for the western district of new york richard arcara,judge convicting williams,following a jury trial,of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise,money laundering,possession with the intent to distribute cocaine,unlawful possession of firearms,and four counts of unlawfully using a communication facility.on october,williams was sentenced to,inter alia,life imprisonment under b.
williams makes several claims on appeal.most significantly,he argues that his sentence is unconstitutional because his pretrial representation was impaired by an actual conflict of interest that effectively denied williams the opportunity to enter into a cooperation agreement or other plea agreement with the government.williams argues that he and his pretrial counsel had engaged in criminal transactions that were relevant to the crimes for which he was convicted,and that this attorney,in an effort to conceal his own wrongdoing,actively discouraged williams from cooperating with the government.
we conclude that williams sentence was imposed in error.all parties have conceded that williams pretrial attorney suffered from an actual conflict of interest.we further find that this conflicted representation led to a lapse in representation because williams attorney had a incentive to prevent williams from cooperating and took no meaningful steps to approach the government or otherwise explore a cooperation or other plea agreement,even though williams may very well have had knowledge valuable to the government,especially at the early stages of the proceedings.for example,the government might have valued williams knowledge as to the whereabouts of a being sought by law enforcement and also might have valued williams knowledge as to the criminal activity of williams conflicted attorney,who was under investigation for homicide and other crimes during his representation of williams.
as the case proceeded to trial and conviction with counsel,we propose a remedy tailored to fix the constitutional violation associated with the failure of williams conflicted counsel to explore a cooperation or other plea agreement with the government.for the reasons discussed herein,we remand to the district court for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.
background 
on january,david williams was indicted by a grand jury for his role as a principal administrator in a continuing criminal enterprise that was believed to have been one of the largest suppliers of cocaine in the buffalo,new york area.the next day,williams and other participants were arrested.the government executed several search warrants pursuant to which it found,among other things,firearms in residences used by williams in buffalo,new york and in pembroke pines,florida.
soon after his arrest,williams retained attorney anthony leonardo,to defend him against the charges.leonardo had represented williams on prior unrelated federal charges and was then representing him on a state weapons charge arising from a traffic stop.during the course of leonardo representation of williams,leonardo also represented calvin cornelious,a drug dealer who allegedly engaged in criminal activities with williams.
in march,mark overall,a close confidant of williams,began cooperating with the government soon after his arrest.overall implicated williams in narcotics trafficking and also alleged that williams and his attorney,leonardo,engaged in criminal activity together.specifically,overall alleged that in the summer of,he saw leonardo provide williams with firearms silencers and that,in december,he saw williams deliver handguns and silencers to leonardo who was going to have the silencers modified in order to be more effective.overall also alleged that leonardo and williams conspired together to hide a witness who was going to testify against cornelious in a state rape prosecution.leonardo represented cornelious in those proceedings and in a subsequent matter in federal court.
in august,the government made its first motion to disqualify leonardo from representing williams,though not on the most obvious grounds.the government sought leonardo disqualification because leonardo was simultaneously representing both williams and cornelious.the government alleged that williams and cornelious were involved together in drug trafficking and that leonardo representation of both presented a potential conflict of interest.this led to a september,curcio hearing,see united states curcio,cir,before magistrate judge carol heckman where williams waived any potential conflict of interest created by the simultaneous representation.at the time of the hearing,the government made no mention of overall allegations against leonardo.the government asserts that it did not make a public allegation at that time because overall allegations against leonardo had not yet been corroborated.
in the fall of,the government learned that leonardo was under investigation by the fbi in rochester,new york and in cleveland,ohio concerning allegations that leonardo was involved in money laundering and narcotics violations.in february,overall testified before the grand jury where he repeated his claims that leonardo and williams engaged together in illegal firearms transactions.on april,overall pled guilty to three counts in the indictment.the following day,a superseding indictment was filed that added three firearms charges against williams.specifically,williams and his daughter were additionally charged with possession of firearms in furtherance of drug trafficking activity and conspiracy to transport such firearms in violation of c and,respectively.in addition,williams was charged with being a felon in possession of firearms.none of these additional charges were based on overall testimony concerning the joint criminal activity of williams and leonardo.
in may,anthony vaccaro,leonardo business partner,was murdered with a silenced automatic firearm.leonardo became the subject of an investigation related to the murder,based in part on overall testimony that leonardo had access to firearms and silencers.leonardo subsequently made incriminating remarks to a confidential informant that implicated him in the vaccaro homicide,as well as in drug trafficking activity and money laundering.
the united states attorney office engaged in ex parte meetings to bring the allegations of leonardo activities to the attention of the united states district court for the western district of new york.beginning on june,denise,then united states attorney for the western district of new york,met with chief judge david larimer of the united states district court for the western district of new york to apprise him of the ongoing investigation into leonardo criminal conduct did not at this time mention to judge larimer the allegations that williams and leonardo had engaged in joint criminal activity.
on the following day,the government again moved to disqualify leonardo from representing williams,on the sole grounds that mark funk,another attorney in leonardo firm,was representing shanique williams,the daughter of the defendant.at a curcio hearing before magistrate judge kenneth schroeder,both david williams and shanique williams waived any potential conflicts of interest stemming from their representation by the same firm.again,no mention was made of the allegations tying leonardo to criminal activity with williams.
in august,united states attorney met again with chief judge larimer regarding the leonardo investigation.judge larimer advised that he was familiar with the matter based on his review of various electronic surveillance orders related to the investigation.during this meeting,informed judge larimer that leonardo was representing both williams and cornelious in separate criminal cases.raised the possibility of alerting the judges presiding over those cases,including judge arcara who presided over williams case.judge larimer subsequently did so,although judge arcara does not recall exactly what was said to him nor when the conversation occurred.according to the government,it did not bring evidence of the joint criminal activity between leonardo and williams into open court for fear of compromising its investigation into leonardo other criminal activities.
on december,leonardo was arrested on federal drug charges,including one count of using a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking activity.these charges were brought by the united states attorney for the western district of new york,the same office prosecuting williams.leonardo ultimately pled guilty to facilitating the murder of his business partner,money laundering,and trafficking in cocaine in august.
on january,the government moved to disqualify leonardo.in so moving,the government conceded that leonardo representation was marred by an actual conflict of interest.as part of its motion to disqualify,the government submitted an affidavit from the prosecuting attorney stating that 
the government foresees serious ethical,as well as practical,problems in leonardo attempting to zealously defend a client,which may include negotiating a plea agreement,by having to deal with the same united states attorney who has undertaken to convict leonardo of charges which,if convicted,would result in a lengthy term of imprisonment for leonardo.
this motion was granted,and williams retained new counsel.
on august,williams and his new counsel moved to dismiss the indictment,asserting principally that williams sixth amendment right to counsel was violated because of leonardo conflict of interest.williams also asserted violations of his speedy trial right and his due process right to be free of outrageous prosecutorial tactics.the motion was denied on october,and the matter proceeded to trial on november.
after a jury verdict,williams was found guilty of engaging,as one of several principal administrators,in a continuing criminal enterprise,in violation of a and b conducting a financial transaction involving the proceeds of unlawful activity with the intent to promote unlawful activity,in violation of a a i and ii possessing with intent to distribute more than grams of cocaine,in violation of a and b b possessing firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime,in violation of c and and four counts of using a telephone while committing a drug trafficking crime,in violation of b.williams was principally sentenced to life imprisonment for the first and third of these offenses,a consecutive term of years imprisonment on the fourth offense,and a concurrent term of years imprisonment on the remaining offenses.this appeal followed.
discussion 
williams sixth amendment right to counsel was violated 
the sixth amendment provides that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to have the assistance of counsel for his defence.const.amend.vi.this right to counsel includes a correlative right to representation that is free from conflicts of interest.wood georgia,d see also cuyler sullivan,d.whether a defendant representation violates the sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of law and fact that is reviewed de novo.triana united states,cir quoting united states blau,cir,cert.denied,d.
we group attorney conflicts of interest into three general categories.the first category describes those conflicts that are so severe that they are deemed per se violations of the sixth amendment.such violations are unwaivable and do not require a showing that the defendant was prejudiced by his representation.see united states fulton,cir united states john doe,cir,cert.denied sub nom.findley united states,d armienti united states,cir.by contrast an actual conflict of interest occurs when the interests of a defendant and his attorney diverge with respect to a material factual or legal issue or to a course of action.united states schwarz,cir internal quotation marks omitted.to violate the sixth amendment,such conflicts must adversely affect the attorney performance.see united states levy,cir.lastly,a client representation suffers from a potential conflict of interest if the interests of the defendant may place the attorney under inconsistent duties at some time in the future.united states kliti,cir.to violate the sixth amendment such conflicts must result in prejudice to the defendant.levy,at.
per se conflict of interest 
as noted,a per se conflict of interest requires automatic reversal without a showing of prejudice.john doe,at.so far,we have found such conflicts of interest only where trial counsel is not authorized to practice law and where trial counsel is implicated in the same or closely related criminal conduct for which the defendant is on trial.fulton,at see also united states cancilla,cir holding that a conflict of interest existed where defense counsel had,unknown to defendant,engaged in the same types of insurance fraud schemes for which the defendant had been convicted john doe,at w e have limited per se conflicts to two instances where trial counsel is not authorized to practice law or where counsel is implicated in the crime for which the defendant is on trial.
in united states cancilla,at,an allegation was made after trial,assumed to be true on appeal,that unknown to the defendant,the defendant trial counsel may have himself conspired with someone connected to the fraudulent insurance scheme used by the defendant.we held that a per se conflict of interest existed.id.at.given the similarity of counsel criminal activities to the defendant schemes and the link between them,it must have occurred to counsel that a vigorous defense might uncover evidence or prompt testimony revealing his own crimes.id.at.as a per se conflict,we did not need to find particular areas where his representation suffered.we noted,however,a variety of ways in which the defendant may not have received a vigorous defense citing,as williams does,the likely impact of counsel conflict during pretrial proceedings.id.in cancilla,we found it difficult,for example,to see how counsel conflicted in this way could impartially have given the defendant advice on whether or not to take a guilty plea,since counsel might have feared that acceptance of a plea would turn on the defendant cooperation,which might lead to discovery of the link to counsel own activities.id.
in united states fulton,we reaffirmed the application of the per se conflict rules to cases where a defendant counsel is implicated in crimes similar to those of the defendant.following a jury trial,fulton and three were convicted of a variety of offenses related to a scheme to smuggle heroin.id.at.during cross examination by fulton lead counsel of a particular who was a government witness,the government objected and sought an ex parte sidebar with the court.id.at.at sidebar,the government explained that the witness had several weeks earlier informed the government that with respect to a previous shipment of heroin he brought into the united states that this defense attorney received a portion of the heroin.id.quoting from the record.the government made clear that this was still just an unconfirmed allegation,but nevertheless,the court acknowledged its obligation to disclose the conflict to fulton.id.as we noted,t he district judge stated that if the investigation into the attorney conduct was of such importance that the government objected to the disclosure of the allegation,the government might have to choose between pursuing fulton or his attorney.id.the government decided to press on,and so the district court informed fulton and his lead attorney,in significant detail,why this attorney had a conflict of interest.id.at.after affording fulton the opportunity to consider this conflict and whether or not he wanted to continue to be represented by this attorney,fulton chose to waive the conflict and was subsequently convicted.id.
when fulton sought habeas relief,claiming that the conflict of interest deprived him of his sixth amendment right to counsel,the petition was denied.id.at.this court reversed,however,finding that fulton attorney suffered from a per se conflict of interest which was unwaivable.id.at.we held that where it is alleged that defense counsel engaged in the same or similar crimes for which a defendant stood trial,the conflict so permeates the defense that no meaningful waiver can be obtained.id.at.in such a case,we must assume that counsel fear of,and desire to avoid,criminal charges will affect virtually every aspect of his or her representation of the defendant.id.while fulton involved a defendant whose conflicted attorney proceeded through trial and sentencing,we noted how the conflict likely affected the defendant pretrial representation 
at the stage,counsel ability to advise the defendant as to whether he or she should seek to cooperate with the government is impaired.cooperation almost always entails a promise to answer truthfully all questions put by the government in such circumstances,counsel is hardly an appropriate negotiator of a plea and cooperation agreement.counsel judgments about potential defense strategies may be affected by the fear that evidence concerning counsel involvement might come out 
id.based on the attorney powerful in avoiding criminal liability,we determined that the conflict in this case was unwaivable 
given the breadth and depth of this kind of conflict,we are unable to see how a meaningful waiver can be obtained.the conflict here involves a bias arising out of counsel powerful in avoiding criminal charges or reputational damage and is thus of a different character than other conflicts advice as well as advocacy is permeated by counsel,and no rational defendant would knowingly and intelligently be represented by a lawyer whose conduct was guided largely by a desire for.
id.lastly,although the government was aware of the allegations weeks before its witness testified at trial,it was not until trial that the government informed the court about the issue.hence,we admonished the government in future cases to immediately inform the court of the existence of such a conflict once it becomes aware of it.id.
in some ways,the conflict affecting williams representation treads more upon sixth amendment concerns than the one in fulton.in the case at bar,the government had far more than mere allegations that leonardo was engaged in criminal activity,as the government investigation increasingly corroborated overall allegations.thus,it is more likely that leonardo,as opposed to fulton attorney,in fact,had something to hide.nevertheless,leonardo represented williams in this matter for approximately two years.in addition,the court below did not apprise williams of the conflict of interest soon after learning of it,as it did in fulton.and while it is unclear from fulton exactly what the nexus was between the attorney alleged criminal conduct and the defendant alleged criminal conduct,the court made clear that the crimes need not be identical.see id.at noting that waiver is inappropriate where a defendant attorney is implicated in related criminal activity emphasis added.
on the other hand,fulton conflicted representation extended through trial,while williams did not.furthermore,this case is perhaps distinguishable from fulton because it is clear in this case that williams knew of his attorney criminal activities.some of our cases note that the per se rule has only been applied where the client is unaware of his attorney underlying conflict.see united states rondon,cir.stating that we have applied the per se rule in only two situations when,unknown to the defendant,counsel was,at the time of representation,not duly licensed to practice law because of a failure ever to meet the substantive requirements for the practice of law or implicated in the defendant crimes internal quotation marks omitted second emphasis added,cert.denied,d solina united states,cir applying the per se rule where a defendant attorney was unlicensed without extending its applicability to those cases in which the defendant knew of his representative unlicensed status.however,though we have never held the per se rule applicable where a defendant is aware of his attorney related criminal activities,we have also never held it inapplicable.fulton may cast doubt on a requirement that defendants be unaware of their attorneys criminal activity in order for the rule to apply,as it is unclear in fulton whether or not the defendant knew of his attorney criminal conduct.in any event,such knowledge or lack thereof did not play a role in the decision of the case.
thus,we consider it unresolved in this circuit whether the per se conflict rules are applicable where the defendant is aware of the facts underlying what would otherwise be a per se conflict.in this case,the issue is not properly before us.though williams argued below that he suffered from a per se conflict in his motion to dismiss the indictment against him,he has chosen not to pursue this argument on appeal.because he does not press this argument and because we provide relief to williams on other grounds,we do not reach the issue of whether or not williams representation was marred by a per se conflict of interest.nevertheless,the analysis of whether his representation was so hindered informs our analysis of williams claims that his representation suffered from an actual conflict of interest which deprived williams of his right to counsel.see united states schwarz,cir finding the rationale of fulton applicable to actual conflicts of interest.
actual conflict of interest 
the district court,the government,and the defendant agree that leonardo representation of williams was burdened by an actual conflict of interest.leonardo and williams made unlawful firearms exchanges during the period of williams continuing criminal enterprise,and williams was indicted for having used firearms to further his criminal activities.whether or not the crimes for which williams was indicted involved particular firearms transacted with leonardo is irrelevant.at least some of leonardo criminal conduct was of the same type as at least some of the criminal conduct for which williams was prosecuted,and the fact that they engaged in that criminal activity jointly provides the necessary link between their crimes.conceding the actual conflict of interest,the parties only dispute whether this conflict led to a lapse of representation to entitle williams to relief and whether williams retention of leonardo waived this actual conflict.
lapse in representation 
once an actual conflict is established,a defendant need not prove prejudice,but simply that a lapse in representation resulted from the conflict.united states malpiedi,cir internal quotation marks omitted see armienti united states,cir.a defendant can prove a lapse in representation by demonstrating that some plausible alternative defense strategy or tactic might have been pursued,and that the alternative defense was inherently in conflict with or not undertaken due to the attorney other loyalties or interests.united states levy,cir internal quotation marks omitted.as we stated in malpiedi 
the test is a strict one because a defendant has a right to an attorney who can make strategic and tactical choices free from any conflict of interest.an attorney who is prevented from pursuing a strategy or tactic because of the canons of ethics is hardly an objective judge of whether that strategy or tactic is sound trial practice.counsel inability to make such a decision is itself a lapse in representation.
at internal quotation marks omitted.
williams has demonstrated the requisite adversity in his attorney performance by showing that his conflicted counsel failed to make any significant effort to negotiate a plea or cooperation agreement on his behalf.williams claims that leonardo never discussed the possibility of a plea bargain with him.he further claims that his conflicted counsel actively discouraged him from cooperating,even though many of williams made cooperation agreements in exchange for substantially reduced sentences.while williams obviously has an incentive to take this position,even if we do not accept his representations at face value,the government offers but one instance of a very cursory plea discussion with leonardo and that did not occur until december.this means that the government offers no evidence of any plea discussion or any attempt by leonardo to engage in a plea discussion until approximately two years after williams arrest and one week before leonardo arrest.given that the government knew on december,that leonardo was about to be arrested,we can not take seriously any plea discussion the government had with leonardo at that time,as any agreement could surely have been challenged had it been consummated.thus,we are left with no evidence that williams conflicted counsel ever engaged in a legitimate effort to seek a plea bargain on williams behalf.moreover,it is clear that no plea discussion is alleged to have occurred during the critical months after williams arrest when williams asserts that he had valuable information that he could have offered the government concerning the location of alvin jackson,a who had not yet been apprehended by law enforcement.
while seeking to make an agreement with the prosecution was surely a plausible alternative defense strategy or tactic,levy,at internal quotation marks omitted,williams has demonstrated that leonardo efforts at plea bargaining were negligible.williams may have had knowledge of value to the government,and his attorney should have made some effort to explore a cooperation agreement before williams information grew stale.given that leonardo made no reasonable effort to resolve williams case without going to trial and given the strong incentive leonardo had in preventing a cooperation agreement with williams,it is clear that williams defense was inherently in conflict with leonardo other loyalties or interests.id.internal quotation marks omitted.williams has,therefore,demonstrated the requisite lapse in his representation.
the government argues that williams has not demonstrated the requisite lapse in representation because it maintains that it never had and never would have offered williams a plea agreement involving a sentence short of life imprisonment.it claims to have pursued such a hardline because williams was one of the largest cocaine suppliers in the buffalo area it had a very strong case against williams and williams engaged in additional uncharged crimes.
the government argument fails for two reasons.first,williams has demonstrated the requisite lapse in representation simply by showing that his attorney failed to make any significant effort at plea bargaining when circumstances dictated that he should have.the government ultimate response to plea efforts that were not attempted is irrelevant.to show a lapse in representation,defendants need not show that the alternative strategy or tactic not adopted by a conflicted counsel was reasonable,that the lapse in representation affected the outcome of the trial,or even that,but for the conflict,counsel conduct of the trial would have been different.malpiedi,at.
second,in any event,we can not take the government hardline bargaining position at face value.the government claims that it would not have consented to any sentence short of life imprisonment.yet,in circumstances like this,it is the job of defense counsel to convince,or at least attempt to convince the government,why that position is unreasonable and not in the government best interests.in addition,if williams had a zealous advocate,the government would have had more incentive to negotiate a plea agreement and might not have taken such a strong stance against plea bargaining in the first place.furthermore,even if we accepted the government representation that it would not have consented to a sentence short of life imprisonment,it is also true that the government might have consented to a plea that involved just one count of conviction leading to life imprisonment,rather than the eight counts for which williams ultimately was convicted and sentenced.similarly,even if the government maintained its tough stance,the district court might not have accepted the government recommendation as to sentencing were williams to have pled guilty.thus,williams has shown that his representation suffered from an actual conflict and that his attorney performance demonstrated a lapse in representation that was adverse to williams interests.
in most cases when a defendant is faced with a situation in which his attorney has an actual or potential conflict of interest,it is possible for him to waive his right to counsel in order to retain the attorney of his choice.schwarz,at.to preserve the protection of the bill of rights for defendants,we indulge every reasonable presumption against the waiver of fundamental rights.glasser united states.see also wheat united states,d citing glasser.in circumstances where we permit defendants to waive conflicts with counsel,the waiver will be honored if it is knowing and intelligent.united states blau,cir.whether waiver of a conflict of interest is knowing and intelligent depends on the circumstances of each individual case.id.
the government argues that because williams had knowledge of the underlying facts which led to the conflict at the time he retained,williams had knowledge of the crimes they committed waived the conflict when he elected nonetheless to hire leonardo to represent him.thus,the government attempts to distinguish williams conflict from the conflict in fulton on the sole ground that the defendant in fulton did not know of the conflict at the time he hired defense counsel,whereas in this case,williams was obviously aware of the crimes the pair previously committed.the district court found this view persuasive stating,in its decision to deny williams motion to dismiss the indictment,that 
where,as here,the defendant retains the services of an attorney with whom he is engaged in illegal activity,he can not later claim that his sixth amendment rights were violated.it was the defendant,not the government,who created the conflict of interest in this case by retaining the services of an attorney whom he knew to be criminal.to permit the defendant to later accuse the government of failing to timely remedy a conflict that he himself manufactured would essentially reward the defendant for engaging in criminal activity with his attorney.under these circumstances,the court finds that williams knowingly waived his right to counsel.
before considering whether,in fact,williams waived the conflict of interest by retaining leonardo,we note three prerequisites to such a determination.first,in order to make a successful waiver argument,it must be the case that the conflict here was waivable at all.see schwarz,at an actual or potential conflict can not be waived if,in the circumstances of the case,the conflict is of such a serious nature that no rational defendant would knowingly and intelligently desire that attorney representation.as noted earlier,the facts of this case are similar to those in fulton,where we found that the conflict was not waivable.while fulton involved a per se conflict of interest,its reasoning weighs heavily on the facts of this case.furthermore,in schwarz,at,we relied on fulton to find no meaningful waiver of defense counsel actual conflict of interest based on economic,despite the fact that the defendant was apprised of the conflict and the risks of waiving it at a curcio hearing.a conflict premised on an attorney concerns for his own liberty will almost always be more significant than one premised on the kinds of economic interests in schwarz.thus,to find waiver as to this actual conflict,we would need to believe that the conflict in this case,in the first instance,was waivable at all.
second,it is undisputed that the government and the western district of new york had knowledge of the conflict long before leonardo ultimate disqualification.yet,williams was never informed of the conflict by either the court or the government until the government disqualification motion on january.we have stated that a district court is obligated to conduct an inquiry into a potential conflict of interest when sufficiently apprised of even the possibility that a conflict of interest may exist.united states,cir quoting levy,at,cert.denied sub nom.saia united states,d.where the district court fails to make such an inquiry,we have held this to be per se reversible error.see also united states stantini,cir,cert.denied sub nom.bisaccia united states,d united
