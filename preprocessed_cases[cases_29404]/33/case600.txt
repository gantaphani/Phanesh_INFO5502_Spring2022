retained counsel for an elderly person suffering from dementia must safeguard the of the person and his or her financial resources.as we shall explain,here the attorney did neither.the probate court expressly indicated that counsel put his own financial interests ahead of the interests of his client.it surcharged counsel.we agree with the probate court ruling and its rationale.we commend it.we affirm the judgment.
attorney william salzwedel appeals a judgment surcharging him for excessive attorney trustee fees,medical expert fees,and costs incurred while acting as the temporary trustee of the moore family trust.appellant paid himself fees and costs after his year old client,lester moore,was diagnosed with dementia and the subject of a conservatorship petition.appellant hired medical experts to oppose the conservatorship petition and drafted trust and estate documents to disinherit moore family.sitting as the trier of fact,and exercising its broad discretion,the probate court found that the fees and expenses were unreasonable and did not benefit the trust or moore.
appellant has no appreciation for the traditional rules on appeal.see,estate of gilkison th,in re marriage of greenberg th.he contends,among other things,that the probate court used the wrong standard in determining the reasonableness of his fees and expenses.
facts and procedural history 
in,lester moore and his wife,lou dell moore,created the moore family trust naming their daughter,poppy helgren,remainder beneficiary.after lou dell moore died in,moore signed a durable power of attorney appointing helgren as his.
after moore treating physicians notified helgren that moore suffered from dementia and lacked the capacity to handle his affairs.helgren discovered that moore was giving large sums of money to his girlfriend,lieselotte kruger.when helgren brought this to moore attention,he accused helgren of stealing trust money.moore hired appellant to file an elder abuse petition and amend his estate plan.
in october of,appellant had moore sign the following documents a partial revocation and modification of the trust,naming appellant as temporary successor trustee of the trust moore resignation as trustee and a durable power of attorney appointing appellant as moore.the next day,appellant sent helgren a letter accusing her of violating trustee duties.helgren provided an accounting which showed that no funds were misappropriated.
in december of,helgren filed a petition for conservatorship.ventura county super,case no,pr cp oxn.a few months later,she filed a second petition to determine moore capacity to execute the estate planning documents ventura county super,case pr tr oxn.
the probate court consolidated the petitions and appointed attorney lindsay nielson as receiver to inventory moore property and trust assets.appellant submitted billings for fees and expert witness expenses to the receiver who paid the bills but voiced concerns about the amount charged.in february of,the court appointed senior deputy public defender mary shea as for moore and,appointed respondent angelique friend,a professional fiduciary,as temporary conservator of moore person and estate.immediately upon her appointment,friend terminated appellant as moore attorney.
in may of,the probate court removed appellant as trustee,appointed friend as the new temporary successor trustee of the trust,and ordered appellant to render a trust accounting.before he was removed as trustee,appellant paid himself in trustee fees.
appellant filed a petition to settle his accounting to which friend and helgren objected,subd.b before the evidentiary hearing,the trial court ruled that the trustee fees were disapproved absent a showing that the services benefited moore in the sums charged and a showing that moore had the capacity to contract for and approve the fees when the services were rendered.with respect to the medical expert expenses,the probate court ruled that t hese professional fees are expressly disapproved absent an affirmative showing by appellant that the charged medical services benefited moore in the sums charged.the probate court noted that the accounting listed in opening inventory and cash receipts and that appellant paid himself in fees,or of the conservatee reported trust estate,plus another,or another of the conservatee reported trust estate,in related professional and litigation fees.
reasonable fees and expenses 
we review the surcharge order utilizing the abuse of discretion standard.donahue donahue th,donahue see also estate of gilkison,supra,cal th at.as trustee,appellant was charged with the responsibility of incurring fees and expenses that were reasonable in amount and appropriate to the purposes of the trust.donahue donahue,supra,at.principles of trust law impose a reasonableness requirement the fee award must be reasonable in amount and reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation,but it also must be reasonable and appropriate for the benefit of the trust,at.
appellant contends that the trial court applied the wrong standard in reviewing his fees because he was retained before moore mental capacity was adjudicated in the conservatorship proceeding.appellant claims that moore had the autonomous and unfettered right to decide what services would be provided and that appellant was duty bound to zealously act on moore personal wishes.by this theory,there could be no probate court review of his fees.
we reject these arguments because appellant,acting in a trustee capacity,paid the fees and expenses with trust funds.appellant could not put on horse blinders and follow the orders of a client who he knew,even before formal adjudication,suffered from mental impairment in order to approve the trustee accounting,the trial court had to determine the reasonableness of the fees and expenses,subd.b b donahue,supra,th at.a strategy calls for close scrutiny on questions of reasonableness,proportionality and trust benefit.consequently,where the trust is not benefited by litigation,or did not stand to be benefited if the trustee had succeeded,there is no basis for the recovery of expenses out of the trust assets citation,at.as trustee,the burden was on appellant to show that he subjectively believed the fees and expenses were necessary or appropriate to carry out the trust purposes,and that his belief was objectively reasonable,at conservatorship of lefkowitz th.
substantial evidence supports the finding that the fees were unreasonable.appellant drafted an elder abuse petition that was never filed,prepared trust amendments and estate planning documents that were not signed or filed,billed the trust to educate himself on conservatorship law,and failed to keep adequate time records.appellant had little,if any,experience in conservatorship matters or in acting as a trustee.
the expert witness expenses were also excessive.appellant retained edward hyman,a psychologist,from northern california who billed at the rate of an hour.doctor hyman charged for travel time and billed hours on january,for report writing and a psychological assessment.the trial court found that appellant could have hired an medical expert from ucla to make the psychological evaluation for appellant also paid a celebrity psychiatrist,carole lieberman,to evaluate moore but the doctor never wrote a report or testified.in an,appellant admitted that doctor lieberman fees were shocking and that doctor hyman travel fees were an embarrassment.appellant paid another,alan abrams,to review some medical records.the trial court found that was a reasonable fee for moore psychological evaluation and that everything else was wasted money and wasted time no abuse of discretion occurred.probate courts have a special responsibility to ensure that fee awards are reasonable,given their supervisory responsibilities over trusts.donahue,supra,th at.
the probate court factually found that appellant was predominately fighting for his own economic interest,and was not fighting for moore rights appellant prevailed upon moore,who was a senior with conceded memory issues and prior dementia diagnoses to engage counsel.in that context,appellant infused himself as the trust
