with fifteen strokes of his knife,richard leavitt slashed and stabbed danette elg to death in her bedroom.then,as elg lay dying on top of her punctured waterbed,leavitt hacked out her womanhood just as his had seen him do to play with the female sexual organs of a deer.state leavitt leavitt i,idaho.we decide whether leavitt lawyer rendered ineffective assistance of counsel while trying to have him acquitted of the death penalty.
our first opinion in this case recounts the facts of leavitt crime and trial.see leavitt arave leavitt iii,cir.we repeat only those relevant to this appeal.jay kohler and ron hart represented leavitt at trial and sentencing.after the jury convicted leavitt of murder,kohler and hart moved for appointment of a mental health expert to evaluate leavitt for sentencing purposes.the trial court granted the motion and appointed david groberg,a forensic psychologist,to perform the evaluation.
groberg diagnosed leavitt with antisocial personality disorder and intermittent explosive disorder.he reported that leavitt was otherwise of average intelligence with no serious deficits in his cognitive abilities.although he opined that these disorders rarely have a physiological cause,groberg recommended that leavitt receive neurological testing to be sure.kohler and hart moved for such an examination,which the trial judge granted.
jaynes neurological examination of leavitt revealed no evidence of higher cerebral dysfunction nor any objective neurological deficit.nevertheless,jaynes believed that leavitt ct scan showed a very slight cortical cerebral atrophy that may or may not have an effect on his cognitive sic function.based on this finding,jaynes suggested further testing.the trial judge denied the motion for an mri,stating that additional mental health evidence would not be a significant factor in sentencing.at the conclusion of the hearing,the trial judge found that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating evidence and sentenced leavitt to death.
david parmenter then replaced kohler and hart as leavitt counsel.parmenter represented leavitt in his appeal to the idaho supreme court and succeeded in having the death sentence vacated.on remand,at the second sentencing hearing,parmenter made a strategic decision to focus on convincing the judge that leavitt was a good guy rather than pursue the mental health angle that had proven unsuccessful at the first sentencing.despite this change in strategy,the trial court again sentenced leavitt to death,and this time the state supreme court affirmed.state leavitt leavitt ii,idaho.
after exhausting his direct appeals and state collateral review,leavitt petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus claiming parmenter was ineffective for failing to investigate his mental health.the district court granted leavitt request for the mri that the state court had denied,and the experts found that it looked normal.
the district court dismissed leavitt claims as procedurally defaulted,but we reversed and remanded for the district court to consider leavitt ineffectiveness claims.leavitt iii,at.on remand,the state moved for an additional mri because the defense never disclosed the results of its earlier test.the new mri showed white matter hyperintensities wmhs in leavitt brain,which could indicate an organic cause of his personality disorders.based on this evidence,the district court concluded that parmenter had been ineffective in failing to investigate leavitt mental health before the second sentencing hearing,specifically in failing to renew the request that the court obtain an mri.the district court granted a conditional writ of habeas and the state appeals.
we review de novo the district court grant of his petition for writ of habeas corpus.see martinez villareal lewis,cir.to the extent it is necessary to review findings of fact made in the district court,the clearly erroneous standard applies.silva woodford,cir.clear error review is significantly deferential and requires us to accept the district court findings absent a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.rhoades henry,cir quoting silva,at internal quotation marks omitted.because leavitt filed his original habeas petition in the district court before the effective date of aedpa,its provisions do not apply.alaca woodford,cir.to establish ineffective assistance of counsel,leavitt must show both that his counsel performance was objectively deficient and that it prejudiced his sentencing.see edwards lamarque,cir en banc citing strickland washington.we review the district court determination as to both of these issues de novo.united states birtle,cir.
deficient performance 
judicial scrutiny of counsel performance is highly deferential.strickland washington,c ounsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.a defense lawyer must make reasonable investigations that,at a minimum,permit informed decisions about how best to represent his client.sanders ratelle,cir.but strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable.strickland,at.
here,parmenter made a thorough investigation in preparation for the sentencing hearing.he met with leavitt just a few days after he was appointed.he discussed the case with prior counsel and reviewed all transcripts and records from the prior proceedings.he spoke with leavitt mother and father many more than times.he interviewed leavitt brothers and sister,and had many conversations with leavitt.parmenter also interviewed several prison guards to gather information about leavitt behavior while incarcerated.this case thus does not present the typical capital case ineffectiveness situation where counsel scrambled to prepare just before the penalty phase,or failed to investigate entire areas of mitigation.see,hamilton ayers,f d cir.
petitioner nonetheless argues parmenter was ineffective for failing to gather additional mental health evidence for the second sentencing hearing.we reject this argument because the decision to forego further investigation into leavitt mental health condition was reasonable in light of counsel knowledge of what had transpired at,and in preparation for,the initial sentencing hearing.
to begin with,parmenter knew that kohler and hart had already spent significant time investigating mental health evidence during the course of their representation.all of leavitt prior mental health records,two from licensed psychologists and one from a psychiatrist,diagnosed him with a personality disorder,without suggesting any possibility of an organic brain injury.groberg,a psychologist retained specifically to gather mitigation evidence,also diagnosed leavitt with a personality disorder.original counsel requested a second expert,jaynes,to conduct more testing.leavitt eeg came back completely normal,but the ct scan revealed a very slight cortical atrophy that suggested a possibility of disease.but even jaynes,who identified this abnormality,concluded that there was no objective neurological deficit on examination nor any evidence of higher cerebral dysfunction.
while a lawyer is under a duty to make reasonable investigations,a lawyer may make a reasonable determination that particular investigations are unnecessary.babbit calderon,cir see also cullen pinholster.parmenter review of prior counsel efforts provided an informed basis for him to decide not to investigate further.the dissent dismisses this conclusion as appellate factfinding.dissent at.but our job is not to divine parmenter actual reasons for failing to seek additional testing,but rather to affirmatively entertain the range of possible reasons leavitt counsel may have had for proceeding as he did.pinholster.at emphasis added.
leavitt argues that parmenter could not have made a reasonable strategic decision to forgo further investigation because jaynes findings constituted a promising lead that required follow up.our recent decision in west ryan,cir,suggests otherwise.in west,we held that counsel was not deficient for failing to unearth additional mental health evidence where the doctor report contained purported red flags.id.at.these flags included slow movement of his right hand,which could reflect neurological deficits.id.at.based on this finding,the doctor commented that he could not rule out a cognitive impairment absent further testing.id.we held that this did not create a duty to investigate further because earlier tests revealed that the defendant intellectual memory,language and perceptual functioning were normal.id.at.the doctor ultimately concluded that the results of the evaluation were more consistent with an individual of low educational status than with any cognitive impairment.id.alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.
similarly,leavitt doctor may have found some evidence suggesting a cognitive impairment,but he ultimately concluded that the his performance on personality,psychological and cognitive more consistent with a diagnosis of a personality disorder.as in west,we conclude that such an equivocal finding is not the kind of powerful mitigating evidence sufficient to overcome strickland presumption that counsel acted reasonably in declining to investigate further the possibility that the defendant might suffer from a cognitive impairment.id.citing bobby van hook.
second,even had parmenter wanted to investigate further,he had good reason to believe a motion for another doctor would be denied.leavitt was not constitutionally entitled to a third psychiatric expert under ake oklahoma.contra dissent at.leavitt himself has never tried to argue otherwise,and with good reason by its own terms,ake limit ed the right it recognize d to provision of one competent psychiatrist.ake,at emphasis added.given this unambiguous language,we held that the defendant lacks the right to appointment of a second psychiatrist,pawlyk wood,cir,even where the first psychiatrist is alleged to be incompetent or reaches a diagnosis unfavorable to the defense,see harris vasquez,cir.we recognized that ake limitation to a single,independent psychiatrist is critical given that p sychiatry is not an exact science,and psychiatrists disagree widely and frequently on the appropriate diagnosis.pawlyk,at quoting ake,at alteration and first omission in original.accordingly,neither we,nor the supreme court,has ever held that a trial court violated ake by refusing to appoint a second,let alone third,mental health expert,harris,at ake did not require appointment of a third psychiatrist see also,granviel lynaugh,cir ake did not require appointment of an additional psychiatrist martin wainwright,cir ake did not require appointment of a second neurologist.leavitt had not one,but two experts,and so was not entitled to an additional evaluation.
sensing the walls of precedent closing in on its conclusion,the dissent resorts to arguing that leavitt was denied his right to a competent psychiatrist who will conduct an appropriate examination.dissent at.first,it far from clear that such a right exists,see vickers stewart,cir,or that,if it does,we be able to review it on habeas,see wilson greene,cir refusing to recognize an ake claim solely based on whether the first mental health expert conducted an appropriate examination harris,at refusing to recognize an ake claim based on the argument that the first expert was incompetent.second,there no indication that the examinations in this case were in any way inappropriate.the doctors reviewed leavitt files,conducted a battery of psychological tests and administered both an eeg and a ct scan to detect neurological abnormalities.due process does not require a state to fund every technologically conceivable test to rule out the possibility of an organic mental disorder.third,even putting aside the issue of adequacy,leavitt was entitled to additional testing because he could have made a preliminary showing that his mental health was likely to be a significant factor in his sentencing in light of the judge express indication to the contrary.ake,at see also williams stewart,cir upholding trial court denial of an expert under ake because the defendant failed to establish that his sanity was likely to be a significant factor in his defense.ake did not give leavitt the right to another expert had the state trial court granted him one,it would have been a matter of judicial grace,not constitutional right.
given that leavitt was not entitled to a third expert,the judge previous hostility towards appointing another doctor became all the more relevant in parmenter development of a mitigation strategy.parmenter knew about prior counsel failed attempt to obtain an mri.not only did the judge deny kohler and hart request,he had an order ready and waiting before they had even presented it.the order stated that any further evidence of the mental condition of the defendant will not be a significant factor in the sentencing and so the mri shall not be ordered.given the judge emphatic statement that mental health evidence would not be significant,it was perfectly reasonable for parmenter to believe that he might pretty routinely deny a second request for an mri.counsel need not file motions that are likely to lose,because doing so may cost the defendant some of his lawyer credibility with the judge.lowry lewis,f d,cir.
preserving credibility was particularly important because the judge was not just presiding over the hearing,but deciding the ultimate issue of whether to impose the death penalty.parmenter recognized that,in general,filing frivolous motions may have some effect on the judge fact finding.in this situation,it would have been reasonable for him to fear that renewing the motion would irritate the judge and hurt his client case.we review counsel decision solely to determine whether it fell within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.strickland,at.a decision to avoid annoying the judge at least when it comes at the small price of forgoing the filing of a motion that was once denied and will likely be denied again falls well within strickland range of reasonableness.
leavitt direct request to the sentencing judge for more psychological testing did not obligate parmenter to renew the motion.the decisions on what trial motions should be made,and all other strategic and tactical decisions,is within the exclusive province of the lawyer aba standards for criminal justice ed emphasis added.in fact,because the judge indicated that he was going to consider leavitt request,parmenter could reasonably have believed it was unnecessary to submit a motion.even with the benefit of hindsight,parmenter testified that he was sure what new information he could have added to the original motion to convince the trial judge to change his mind.parmenter reviewed all of leavitt medical records and the judge denial of the original motion,and exercised his independent judgment that it would do much good to take another run at judge george for additional testing.leavitt disagreement with counsel decision did not render it unreasonable.
third,parmenter decision to steer clear of the mental health issue was reasonable because the judge had already decided the mental health evidence was an aggravating factor.the judge stated that the personality disorder diagnosis was not a mitigating factor,but rather a condemning factor because i t is the catalyst to provoke another possible homicide or serious physical injury.parmenter did want judge george to have additional ammunition and acknowledged that this concern may have been part of the reason that leavitt and i decided not to pursue that angle.his concern was reasonable because in some cases,presenting evidence of mental disorders to create empathy might actually cause worry and concern that the defendant is an irreparable monster.edwards ayers,cir quoting john fabian,death penalty mitigation and the role of the forensic psychologist,law psychol.the trial judge had considered leavitt mental health aggravating at the first sentencing,and it was thus reasonable for parmenter to fear that he would treat it as aggravating again.
instead of continuing with a mitigation strategy parmenter knew had been rejected by the trial judge,he reasonably decided to switch gears.parmenter goal was to humanize leavitt by portraying him as something other than the monster the prosecution made him out to be.parmenter wanted to develop a theme that rick leavitt is a pretty good guy and not the kind of guy that should be put to death.evidence of mental health may have detracted from,or even conflicted with,this strategy.see cox ayers,cir.parmenter acknowledged that raising a mental condition at mitigation might have be en somewhat inconsistent with leavitt defense at trial.in cox,we held that counsel reasonably decided not to present,and not to look further for,evidence concerning petitioner character and emotional state where t hat decision reflected counsel strategic choice to emphasize their primary argument at the penalty phase.id.parmenter likewise made a conscious and informed decision to focus the mitigation case on portraying the defendant as a good guy,rather than try to excuse the crime by presenting evidence that he might have had mental health problems.
counsel is not required to undertake all possible investigations.see strickland,at.there will always be more documents that could be reviewed,more family members that could be interviewed and more psychiatric examinations that could be performed.but,as the supreme court recently reminded us,t here comes a point where a defense attorney will reasonably decide that another strategy is in order,thus mak ing particular investigations unnecessary.pinholster.at quoting strickland,at alteration in original see also bobby van hook,per curiam holding that at some point,additional evidence would be only cumulative and the search for it distractive from more important duties.parmenter had developed a knowledgeable foundation from reading expert trial testimony,reviewing and marking up medical reports and meeting with which to base his decision to take the mitigation case in a different direction.
while parmenter chosen strategy failed,we must avoid the temptation to evaluate his decision through the fabled vision of hindsight.brown uttecht,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we must evaluate his performance only based on whether he made reasonable,informed decisions based on what he knew at the time.
so what did parmenter know once he took over the second sentencing he knew that leavitt had been examined by at least five mental health professionals,all of whom diagnosed him with personality disorders.he knew that the trial judge had summarily denied a request for more testing.and he knew that the judge who would ultimately decide whether to impose the death penalty did consider such evidence to be mitigating.having seen former counsel try and fail with a mental impairment mitigation strategy,it was not unreasonable for counsel to try a different tack.such strategic decisions are precisely of the kind we vest in the discretion of informed,experienced trial counsel.
even if we assume that parmenter performance was deficient,leavitt suffered no prejudice.petitioner has the burden of showing a reasonable possibility that,but for counsel deficient performance,the death sentence would not have been imposed.wong belmontes.where the defendant claims ineffective assistance for failure to file a particular motion,he must not only demonstrate a likelihood of prevailing on the motion,but also a reasonable probability that the granting of the motion would have resulted in a more favorable outcome.styers schriro,cir.because it is unlikely that judge george would have granted the motion for additional testing,or that the results of any such testing would have changed the outcome of the sentencing,we can not say the alleged deficiency was prejudicial.
leavitt has not established a reasonable probability that the motion would have been granted had parmenter presented it.although parmenter believed that judge george might be a little more than other judges,he also testified that the judge had already made himself clear in the first sentencing hearing and was therefore likely to deny the request.parmenter might have supported a renewed motion with evidence of leavitt behavior while imprisoned over the four years,but as the prison officers testified,leavitt was a model prisoner who had no incidents of explosive behavior.this undermined the theory that he had an organic brain disorder that rendered him uncontrollably violent from time to time.
it would certainly not have been an abuse of discretion for the judge to deny the motion.see united states george,cir.as discussed above,the defendant had no right to an additional expert under ake.see supra.moreover,although the idaho supreme court vacated the original sentence,it did not do so on the ground that there should have been more mental health testing.to the contrary,the court did not disagree with the findings of the trial court that the defendant herein is possessed of an intermittent explosive disorder or that the mental health evidence should be considered aggravating.leavitt i,at.it disagreed only with the trial court misperception of the alternatives available to him and authorized him,in his discretion,to obtain additional information testimony.id.emphasis added.having already appointed two experts,judge george exercise of that discretion to deny the motion would have been.
most damaging to leavitt prejudice claim,however,is the fact that judge george actually considered his request for additional testing but did not grant it.at the beginning of the second sentencing hearing,leavitt told the judge that he would like to have a nother psychological evaluation done on him.judge george could have denied the request as untimely or required parmenter to submit a motion as leavitt counsel,but instead he said he would consider what might need to be done.at the close of the hearing,judge george again indicated his intent to consider leavitt request leavitt in the beginning indicated that the court might consider some further psychological report.i not passing judgment on that right now.i certainly going to consider that.a little over a month later,the court sentenced leavitt to death.there is no reason to believe the judge did take leavitt request into consideration,as he promised he would.if the judge considered it,but did not grant it,parmenter failure to file a formal motion to the same effect can not have been prejudicial.
even if the motion had been granted,leavitt must show that technology was sufficiently advanced in to enable a doctor to detect the abnormalities.the district court acknowledged that the abnormalities in the mri were overlooked by leavitt doctor,and were not discovered until,but ultimately credited his neurological expert who testified that a reasonable medical examiner would have been able to spot the abnormalities on an mri in.because the district court resolution of the factual dispute was not clearly erroneous,we proceed on the assumption that the abnormalities would have been detected at that time had an mri been performed.see bonin calderon,cir.
starting with that assumption,we must reweigh the evidence in aggravation against the totality of available mitigating evidence.wiggins smith.thus,we must examine what these abnormalities were and how they would have impacted the mitigation case.white matter hyperintensities,like those on leavitt brain scan,are simply bright spots that appear on an mri.but the wmhs,previously called ubos,or unidentified bred sic objects,just do tell us very much.in trying to explain what the bright spots might mean,bigler testified that wmhs represent a disruption in the normal flow of electrical impulses,which can affect behavioral regulation and may slow down brain responses.beaver testified that he would hypothesize that the wmhs were an underlying cause of leavitt personality disorders.such opinions,which couch results in tentative language,are simply not enough to show prejudice.rhoades,at finding no prejudice where expert reports talk in terms of conditions that the defendant likely has or may have sears upton,finding prejudice where the expert opinion of brain pathology was unequivocal.
the experts testimony was not only tentative,but also highly speculative.bigler opined that the location of the wmhs seems to have a bearing on the type of problem manifested.beaver then testified that because the bright spots are located in an area associated with emotion and behavior,they might have caused leavitt violent outbursts.but martell testified,and the district court accepted,that brain injury anywhere in the brain could lead to violent behavior.and,although bigler testified that wmhs are more likely to be present in people with psychological disorders,he conceded that they are also seen in the mris of some perfectly healthy people.this kind of speculative mitigation evidence is not entitled to significant weight.see bible ryan,cir finding no prejudice because argument that brain dysfunction can be an explanation for violent behavior was speculative.
moreover,there a significant possibility that,had this highly speculative evidence been given any weight at all,it would have been treated as aggravating rather than mitigating.see atkins virginia.in cullen pinholster,for example,the supreme court found that new evidence of an organic personality syndrome and brain damage was by no means clearly mitigating,as the jury might have concluded that the defendant was simply beyond rehabilitation.id.at.the court concluded that,in light of the ambiguous nature of the brain injury,t here wa s no reasonable probability that the additional evidence would have changed the jury verdict.id.at.here,too,there no way of knowing which way evidence of a biological mental impairment would have cut it very well may have counted against leavitt.
even assuming the evidence of wmhs would have been treated as mitigating,we must discount its weight because any evidence of a brain dysfunction causing uncontrolled,sudden,violent impulses would not explain the most disturbing aspect of the murder here the surgical mutilation of the victim body.belmontes.at.we agree with the district court that leavitt removal of elg sexual organs is more strongly associated with simple depravity than a continuation of rage or anger.even had the trial judge been convinced by leavitt experts that the repeated,violent stabbing of the victim could be explained by some abnormalities in his brain,the sexual mutilation,for which no expert testimony was available,pointed to a different cause altogether.see mickey ayers,cir finding no prejudice in counsel failure to adequately prepare mental health expert whose testimony suffered from the fundamental weakness that a jury was unlikely to believe that a defendant suffering as the expert diagnosed could act as the facts of the crime showed the defendant did pizzuto arave,cir finding no prejudice in counsel failure to request neurological testing because a n organic brain disorder could not account for,or have any bearing upon,the herndon murders which the evidence demonstrates were premeditated,planned out,and part of a consecutive series of complex acts.
the evidence is less weighty still because it is merely adds to what had already been presented.see bible,at.the trial judge knew that leavitt had a slight atrophy in his cerebral cortex.this was more than just a lead,it was itself evidence of some physiological problem.true,it was not clear exactly what the brain atrophy meant jaynes had testified that it may or may not lead to cognitive impairment but neither is it clear what the wmhs mean.the wmhs are thus additional,cumulative evidence of the brain disorder the sentencing judge already knew leavitt had.for the prejudice analysis,cumulative evidence is given less weight because it is not as likely to have affected the outcome of the sentencing.babbitt,at.
we must look at the effect of the omitted evidence in light of all the mitigation evidence presented.wiggins,at.the sentencing judge was aware of all the evidence,including mental health evidence,that was given at the first trial.the court already treated evidence of leavitt intermittent explosive disorder as mitigating.to this,parmenter added the testimony of several witnesses from leavitt past,including family members who spoke very highly of him.parmenter also presented the testimony of several prison guards,who testified that leavitt had been a model prisoner in the intervening years,that he thrived in the structured prison environment and that he did not pose a threat of harm to other prisoners.parmenter additionally introduced evidence that leavitt was an accomplished artist and poet and had won awards for his talent.the sentencing judge also considered mitigating evidence that leavitt was married,had reestablished contact with his son,had been steadily employed and had no prior felony convictions.the addition of an ambiguous result from leavitt third mental health evaluation is not enough to raise a reasonable possibility that the outcome would have been different.
given the exceptional depravity of this murder,it is unlikely that additional evidence of a brain abnormality would have made a difference.see,woodford visciotti,per curiam campbell kincheloe,cir g iven the overwhelming aggravat ing factors and the heinous nature of the crime there is no reasonable likelihood that the jury verdict would have been different had mitigating evidence been introduced.the supreme court recent decision in wong belmontes,is instructive.belmontes was sentenced to death after bludgeoning his victim to death with a steel dumbbell during the course of a robbery.id.at.the supreme court held that excluded evidence of impairment of the neurophysiological mechanisms for planning and reasoning was not prejudicial because it was hard to imagine expert testimony outweighing the gruesome facts of the murder.id.at.belmontes crime was gruesome,to be sure,but it pales in comparison to leavitt murder of danette elg 
leavitt repeated and pitiless stabbing and cutting of his victim in all parts of her body,including even a thrust through her eye and into her brain,was vicious and remarkable enough for the most jaded reviewer of this genre of crimes.the added mutilation of the victim as part of the death dealing attack or as a grisly aftermath is yet another marker of the unnecessary tortuousness of this crime.
leavitt,at quoting leavitt,at.the details of this crime are simply too atrocious for the exclusion of tentative,cumulative evidence to undermine confidence in the sentence.
the dissent would have us believe that an mri would have revealed critical new mitigating evidence sufficient to shake our confidence in the judge imposition of a capital sentence.dissent at.but this is simply not so.the state trial judge who made the ultimate life or death decision described the mitigating evidence as feathers on the scale when weighed against the heinousness and brutality of leavitt crime.reweighing all the evidence presented at the second sentencing hearing,the additional feather provided by the mri evidence would not have been nearly enough to tip the scale in leavitt favor,so there was no prejudicial error.
one definition of insanity is repeating the same course of action twice and expecting a different result.parmenter decision to cease further investigation into leavitt already heavily analyzed mental health was entirely rational.leavitt has not made out his claim that parmenter assistance was constitutionally deficient.even if he had,the gruesome nature of the crime,coupled with the relatively weak additional evidence that might have been revealed had an mri been granted,leads us to conclude that any ineffectiveness was not prejudicial.
the circumstances of richard leavitt murder of danette elg are indeed horrendous.that alone should have been a signal that there was something radically wrong with leavitt,who was otherwise a citizen,a father and a husband.i agree with the trial judge who sentenced leavitt to death that the fact that such a person would do this act leaves one asking why.leavitt counsel,david parmenter,failed to provide an answer to that question that could have saved his client life leavitt suffered from an organic brain disorder in the part of the brain responsible for regulating emotion and impulse control.despite the majority many tangents and alternative holdings,leavitt habeas petition concerns one simple point whether counsel should have made a motion for the mri examination of his brain that the neurologist had recommended.had parmenter done so,the examination would have revealed leavitt organic neurological disorder powerful mitigating evidence that could well have altered the sentencing decision of the trial court.that alone is sufficient to resolve this case.parmenter failure,despite the neurologist recommendation,to seek the examination that was necessary to establish the existence of leavitt organic brain disorder unquestionably rendered his performance deficient and that inexplicable conduct prejudiced his client under any reasonable standard.not surprisingly,the united states district court for the district of idaho so found,and we are asked simply to affirm the lower court.
parmenter,who represented leavitt at his resentencing,knew the following at the time of that hearing prior to leavitt original sentencing,his neurologist had recommended further examination,specifically an mri,to determine if leavitt had organic or physiological disfunction sic of the brain after a ct scan revealed abnormalities in his brain white matter.leavitt original trial counsel had then attempted to obtain an mri before leavitt was sentenced,but the trial court had denied counsel motion for a continuance to do so.the trial court had erroneously considered leavitt diagnosis for personality disorders,rather than an organic brain disorder to be an aggravating,rather than a mitigating,factor,in pronouncing leavitt first death sentence.the idaho supreme court had subsequently vacated leavitt death sentence on appeal,because the trial court record failed to show a an adequate weighing of mitigating circumstances against the aggravating factors and b a demonstrat ion that the trial court adequately considered penal confinement as an adequate protection of society,as contrasted with the imposition of the death penalty.state leavitt,idaho.when the case was on remand,both leavitt and his mother had requested a new presentence investigation and asked parmenter to further develop the neurological evidence.during the resentencing hearing,the trial court expressed its desire to give the defendant all of his rights.one of those rights included access to a competent psychiatrist who will conduct an appropriate examination and assist in evaluation,preparation,and presentation of the defense,as to which leavitt mental condition had been shown to be a significant factor.ake oklahoma,emphasis added.and in general,as capital defense counsel he was obligated to investigate and present evidence of mental impairment,in light of the mitigating force of such evidence.see,evans lewis,cir.
any reasonable attorney under these circumstances would have renewed the motion for the mri scan that leavitt was wrongly denied prior to his original sentencing a scan that we now know would have revealed white matter hyperintensities in the right frontal lobe of his brain,which are organic neurological irregularities in an area believed to be responsible for regulating emotion and impulse control.because evidence of such an organic disorder is the kind of mitigating evidence by which a defendant moral culpability would have been reduced,a reasonable attorney might well have saved his client from the death penalty by obtaining that evidence and presenting it to the court.caro ryan,cir.nevertheless,parmenter totally neglected to do so upon resentencing,even though the idaho supreme court had already expressed concern over leavitt mitigation profile a failure that parmenter himself has since admitted i n retrospect was probably unjustified.
in light of the clear evidence of parmenter deficient performance regarding the most important aspect of the penalty phase of leavitt trial,and leavitt inexplicable behavior surrounding the commission of the murder,there is,at the least,a reasonable probability that,had parmenter sought and obtained the test that would have shown leavitt organic brain disease,a reasonable trial court would have sentenced leavitt to life without parole,or alternatively that the new death sentence,like the first,would have been reversed on appeal or vacated on habeas corpus.strickland washington.leavitt was therefore prejudiced by parmenter ineffective assistance.accordingly,i would affirm the judgment of the chief judge of the united states district court for the district of idaho,including his conditional grant of the writ.
deficient performance 
parmenter chose not to move for an mri examination during the resentencing proceedings notwithstanding his client own request that he do so for the simple reason that he thought the trial court would deny the motion again.as he acknowledged at the evidentiary hearing in these habeas proceedings,however,there was really no reason not to at least ask the judge to grant a renewed motion,especially in light of the failure of counsel at the first hearing to advise the judge of the controlling supreme court decision,ake.parmenter fear that the motion might be denied again did not justify his failure to attempt to obtain the critical evidence that would allow him to make the strongest argument possible in his client favor.
the majority view that it was perfectly reasonable for parmenter to refrain from renewing the mri request because moving for further neurological investigation could have irritate d the judge and hurt his client case,op.at can not be taken seriously,for it rests on the apparent belief that our nation trial judges are unwilling to accept zealous advocacy and that,once antagonized by it,will punish such advocates with adverse rulings.melendez diaz massachusetts,breyer,dissenting internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.to the contrary,in death cases judges generally expect that,given the stakes,i t the battle of the zealots.alex kozinski,tinkering with death a judge reflects how does it feel to send another man to die,the new yorker,at.even worse is the idea that the judge whose actions we review would order the execution of a capital defendant because he became irritated by the lawyer renewal of a motion.s igning the order that will lead to the death of another human being is the gravest duty a judge has,capable of filling him with a nagging sense of unease,something like motion sickness.kozinski,tinkering with death,at.in this circumstance,no reasonable person could believe that annoyance at a lawyer motion would lead a judge to reach that result.
indeed,any fear parmenter may have had of an adverse ruling was unreasonable in light of the weight of authority that would have supported his motion,including a critical supreme court decision that original counsel had not brought to the trial court attention during leavitt first sentencing proceedings.under ake,when a mental health professional has made a plausible showing that testing,such as an mri,constitutes part of an appropriate examination,that testing is one of the raw materials integral to the building of an effective defense that the state must provide to the defendant.id.at.no reasonable counsel,knowing that controlling authority on a critical issue had not been presented the first time,would have declined to even attempt to renew the motion.
the majority nonetheless offers a number of other theories as to why parmenter failure to request an mri examination was a reasonable strategic decision.first,the majority suggests that parmenter deliberately decided not to revisit the organic neurological issue in light of the inconclusive neurological findings prior to leavitt original sentence.op.at.that bit of appellate factfinding must come as news to parmenter,who testified,as set forth above,that he had not renewed the motion for further neurological examination because the trial court had previously denied that motion during the first sentencing proceedings not that he believed the neurological case to be weak.in any event,there is no way parmenter could have actually decided whether a mitigation strategy based on leavitt organic brain disorder was the superior one without first investigating whether leavitt in fact had such a disorder 
second,the majority suggests that leavitt counsel made a reasonable choice not to move for an mri because the trial court had previously considered the mental health issue to be an aggravating factor rather than a mitigating factor.op.at.but the majority sleight of hand should not mislead anyone characterizing an mri examination as merely additional mental health evidence blurs an important distinction.the manner in which the trial court had previously considered leavitt personality disorder would have told parmenter nothing about how the court would have viewed the neurological disorder that the mri would have revealed.evidence of organic brain dysfunction could have provided significant mitigating evidence,summerlin schriro,cir en banc.defense counsel accordingly had a duty to investigate and present mitigating evidence of mental impairment.bean calderon,cir.
even in cases involving many aggravating factors,including the gruesomeness of the crime,counsel failure to present evidence of an organic neurological condition at the sentencing phase is sufficiently prejudicial to establish ineffective assistance of counsel.see douglas woodford,cir.indeed,the supreme court has made clear that evidence about the defendant background and character is relevant because of the belief,long held by this society,that defendants who commit criminal acts that are attributable to a disadvantaged background may be less culpable than defendants who have no such excuse.penry lynaugh,citing california brown,concurring.thus,it was entirely unreasonable to fear broaching the mental health issue again,even if parmenter did think of organic neurological disorders and personality disorders as indistinct,particularly given that the trial judge was no doubt aware of the fact that the idaho supreme court had already reversed his decision for failing to give sufficient consideration to mitigating factors 
the majority is left with the argument that parmenter made a strategic decision to focus on convincing the judge that leavitt was a good guy,and accordingly made a thorough investigation in preparation for the sentencing hearing by reviewing the transcripts and records from prior proceedings,speaking with leavitt immediate family members,and inquiring into leavitt behavior while incarcerated.op.at.parmenter could not have made a strategic decision as to which mitigation argument to make,however,without knowing whether leavitt had organic brain damage.that he conducted a thorough investigation relevant to one possible strategy does not make any more reasonable his failure to investigate a potentially much stronger case for mitigation.parmenter simply neglected the one subject that he should have known mattered most.
the majority is correct in one respect good guys simply do go around hack ing out a dying victim womanhood or playing with the female organs of a deer.op.at.it is far more likely that a person who engages in such conduct has an organic mental disorder than it is that he is simply a likeable fellow who had a bad day or two.faced with jaynes testimony from the first sentencing proceedings that cortical atrophy suggested a possibility of organic neurological disease,and the reality that further testing would be required to determine if leavitt had organic or physiological disfunction sic of the brain,parmenter simply lacked any excuse for not moving for the mri examination to which leavitt was constitutionally entitled see summerlin,at we have long recognized an attorney duty to investigate and present mitigating evidence of mental impairment.internal quotation marks omitted.no reasonable,competent counsel would have conducted leavitt resentencing proceedings as parmenter did.his performance was without question deficient.
ii.prejudice 
if parmenter had submitted a motion for an mri in,there is at least a reasonable probability that an objective decision maker would have granted the motion.strickland,at.if,for some reason,the court had denied such a motion,there is a reasonable probability that this error would have been reversed on appeal either by the state appellate court or during federal habeas proceedings and the mri would ultimately have been ordered.i can be confident that this is so because under governing supreme court authority that existed by that time,when an indigent defendant demonstrates to the trial judge that his mental condition at the time of the offense is to be a significant factor at trial,the state must,at a minimum,assure the defendant access to a competent psychiatrist who will conduct an appropriate examination and assist in evaluation,preparation,and presentation of the defense.ake,at emphasis added.
here,it seems,there was even more than a reasonable probability that the motion would not have been denied again parmenter testified that,in his experience,the particular trial judge who presided over leavitt case was more prone to change his decisions than other judges were,if shown a good reason for doing so,and the ake argument that had been overlooked the first time would certainly have been a good reason.moreover,any objective sentencing judge who followed the applicable law would have allowed neurological testing to take place if competent counsel had timely filed a motion under ake requesting an mri.then,had testing been ordered,an mri undertaken in would have revealed leavitt brain injury,as the district court found and neither the state nor the majority dispute.there is a reasonable probability that the court would then have seriously considered the mitigating evidence of leavitt brain injury and sentenced him to life imprisonment rather than death.
the majority disagrees,contending that leavitt was not prejudiced by parmenter ineffectiveness because,it assures us,there is no way the motion would have been granted had it been made.apparently,the majority believes that the trial judge would have disregarded professional norms,supreme court precedent,and this court precedent,and ruled erroneously on a motion to obtain further neurological testing.even if,in actuality,the trial court had not been willing to apply controlling law,that would not be relevant to our inquiry instead,for purposes of a prejudice analysis,leavitt is entitled to the presumption of a reasonable,lawful,and objective adjudicator who will follow the law.see summerlin,at.a defendant has no entitlement to the luck of a lawless decisionmaker,and neither does the state,so we can not presume that the motion would have been denied controlling law to the contrary.strickland,at.furthermore,even if the motion had been denied,or if the trial court failed to give significant weight to the result of the mri examination,competent counsel would have appealed and there is a reasonable probability that the state supreme court would then have reversed the sentencing judge again or vacated the sentence during state habeas proceedings.see,state leavitt,idaho reversing leavitt first death sentence for errors during sentencing proceedings.in short,there was no excuse for parmenter failure to renew the motion for further neurological examination.that failure rendered his performance deficient,and that deficiency prejudiced leavitt.
alternatively,the majority finds no reason to believe the judge did take leavitt own oral request for another psychological evaluation into consideration,and therefore concludes that a properly filed motion would similarly have been considered and denied.op.at.but we have absolutely no evidence,and the district court made no factual finding,that the sentencing judge did consider the informal oral request made by the defendant,as he would have been required to consider a written motion prepared by counsel.indeed,while the trial court ruled on counsel motion during the first sentencing hearing in a written order,the court did not rule on leavitt oral request at all.furthermore,had parmenter submitted a motion for an mri,it surely would have included citations to the applicable authorities,such as ake,and therefore would have been far more persuasive than leavitt informal request,which did not mention either an mri or the legal authority supporting his request.that government hires lawyers to prosecute and defendants who have the money hire lawyers to defend are the strongest indications of the belief that lawyers in criminal courts are necessities,not luxuries.gideon wainwright.leavitt own oral request did not and could not render harmless his counsel failure to move for an mri examination,as the majority appears to believe.
the majority also holds that leavitt was not prejudiced by parmenter conduct because leavitt white matter hyperintensities,which would have been discovered had an mri been ordered,just do tell us very much.op.at.it reaches that conclusion because the medical experts who testified at leavitt evidentiary hearing spoke in hedged terms about the causes and effects of these anomalies in the brain.my colleagues fail to appreciate that doctors,unlike litigators,do not speak with absolute certainty and confidence particularly where,as here,they are describing the scientific findings in a field where research is ongoing and the scientific community understanding of the brain inner workings is constantly developing moreover,the prejudice inquiry is not concerned with certainties rather,we must consider simply whether there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different,meaning a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.strickland,at.it is therefore sufficient that the mri evidence would have revealed abnormalities that are significantly correlated with neuropsychiatric disorders,because this evidence of organic brain damage is sufficient to undermine confidence that leavitt would still have been sentenced to death had that evidence been presented.
applying strickland,we have set aside sentences on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel without needing to speculate about what sentence would be imposed at the new sentencing hearing to follow.rather,it has sufficed that our confidence in the sentence on review has been undermined because of counsel deficient performance,even when the circumstances of the crime of conviction were particularly brutal.see,lambright schriro,cir summerlin,at stankewitz woodford,cir douglas,at ainsworth woodford,cir.the majority should have adopted the same approach in this case.
even if i were to attempt to predict the outcome of a hypothetical new sentencing hearing,as the majority does,i could not reach the same result with any confidence.evidence of organic brain injury,of a kind that may physically compel behavior or prevent emotional regulation of certain conduct,is the kind of evidence that suggests a defendant moral culpability would have been reduced.caro,at.under our case law,such evidence,if it is credible,is considered weightier than evidence of,purely psychiatric or personality disorders,such as intermittent explosive disorder,that involve a lack of emotional control.id.at.leavitt organic brain injury is of a kind that typically prevents individuals from exercising control over their behavior.his injury is present in the area of the brain thought to be responsible for regulating emotions,impulse control,and conduct,and falls firmly within the category of disorders that a sentencing court should ordinarily weigh more significantly in mitigation than psychiatric problems or personality disorders.
when considering punishment,courts generally treat an individual failure to control a personality disorder,or to suppress an or psychopathic personality,as more blameworthy than an individual response to an organic brain disorder.whether or not this difference in assessing blame is warranted in this case is not a matter for us to decide the court duty is to apply the law as it now exists this court case law is replete with examples of the considerable weight that should be accorded at sentencing to evidence of neurological or organic damage.
in caro,for example,we held that there had been prejudice at sentencing resulting from counsel failure to call an expert during the penalty phase of the trial to testify about a capital defendant organic brain injury,even though the jury heard testimony regarding other psychological or emotional problems.we emphasized that particular weight should always be given by a trier of fact during sentencing to evidence of organic injury because of the effect of such evidence on a finding of moral culpability.id.at.in douglas woodford,cir,we similarly determined that the petitioner received ineffective assistance of counsel because counsel failed to investigate and present mitigation evidence that the petitioner suffered from possible organic impairment and test results revealed some level of preexisting neurological deficit.id.at.we held that the petitioner suffered prejudice at the sentencing phase because such evidence was precisely the type of evidence that we have found critical for a to consider when deciding whether to impose a death sentence.id.at.i therefore believe that we can not have confidence that if the sentencing judge had been presented with mitigating evidence pertaining to leavitt brain injury he would have imposed the death penalty nonetheless.
that there may not be a direct causal connection between leavitt brain abnormalities and his criminal act does not affect this analysis.although it is difficult to conceive of the horrific offense committed by leavitt being committed by anyone with a normal mind or,in terms,anyone without an organic brain disorder the supreme court has held that no such connection is necessary for the existence of mental disorders to serve as a mitigating factor during sentencing.see,penry johnson,holding that the sentencing factfinder should consider and give effect to all potentially mitigating circumstances at sentencing.
moreover,the very existence of neurological problems may serve as mitigation at sentencing by eliciting sympathy from the sentencer.see douglas,at see also hendricks calderon,cir holding that mental health evidence could be mitigating at the penalty phase even though it is insufficient to establish a legal defense to conviction in the guilt phase.the district court correctly held that evidence of an organic brain defect may humanize a defendant,in a way that the labels of antisocial personality disorder and intermittent explosive disorder d o not.as the district court noted in its findings of fact and conclusions of law,the role that leavitt brain injury may have played in his commission of the murder is still not entirely free from ambiguity and uncertainty,but despite this uncertainty,there is no doubt that the complete picture including leavitt organic brain disorder presents a stronger and more sympathetic mitigation profile than the one that was before the sentencing factfinder.
evidence of serious mental problems even such problems that are not organic in nature may be sufficiently mitigating to warrant the imposition of a life sentence,rather than the death penalty,even in cases in which individuals have been convicted of truly horrific crimes.for that reason,our court and the supreme court have held that assistance of counsel was ineffective when potentially mitigating evidence of a defendant mental condition was not presented.see,rompilla beard,williams taylor,lambright,at stankewitz,at.thus,we can not assume that the grievous nature of the offense renders the failure to present evidence of the organic nature of a brain disorder nonprejudicial.the potential mitigating effect of leavitt neurological impairment was all the more likely given that the factfinder at the penalty phase of leavitt trial was a judge,who we must presume to have been in the case law and modern notions of criminal culpability,rather than a jury,which might have concluded that leavitt was simply beyond rehabilitation.pinholster.at contra op.at.parmetner failure to present evidence of such problems prejudiced leavitt defense.to put it differently,the failure should be sufficient to undermine our confidence in the verdict.
the majority effort to downplay the evidence of organic brain damage as cumulative mitigation evidence is simply incorrect
