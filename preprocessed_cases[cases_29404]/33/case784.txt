defendant century insurance century insurance company century appeals the denial of its motion to exclude the testimony of century former attorney,barry zalma,as an expert in the trial of plaintiff helen brand claims against century.century moved to disqualify zalma under rule e of the rules of professional conduct on the ground that he had formerly represented century in substantially related litigation and,as a result,had access to confidential information material to this action.we conclude that because zalma was personally involved in providing legal advice and services to century in matters substantially related to the instant litigation,he is barred from testifying as an expert witness against century.accordingly,we reverse.
factual and procedural background 
from to,century retained zalma and his law firm,barry zalma,to defend century and to render coverage opinions in connection with coverage and bad faith claims under century insurance policies.zalma represented century in connection with a variety of coverage disputes,including coverage for moisture intrusion,rot and fungal infestation under century homeowner policies.in total,zalma directly represented century in different actions.during the same period,zalma supervised two or three attorneys employed by his law firm in handling an unspecified number of additional cases on behalf of century.while he was engaged as coverage counsel by century,zalma received confidential information concerning the company claims handling policies and procedures,its litigation strategies,and its business practices,concerning,among other issues,the company handling of litigation based on mold infestation claims.
in zalma and a business partner formed claimschool,as an educational operation to train insurance adjusters and lawyers in the business of insurance.in,while zalma was still representing century,century engaged claimschool to present a seminar to its adjusters concerning century claims handling practices and procedures in preparation for the seminar,zalma consulted with century concerning its claims handling policies and procedures,and during the seminar,he spent two or three days analyzing century homeowner policy.zalma acknowledges that as a result of this engagement to educate and train century claims adjusters,he acquired knowledge of the company claim handling practices,policies and procedures.he also provided the company with comments and criticism regarding its claims handling practices.
plaintiff helen brand commenced the instant action based on a claim under her century homeowner insurance policy for damage to her home due to mold caused by a water leak.a first amended complaint,filed on july,alleges five causes of action against century,including breach of contract and bad faith,based on century alleged failure to investigate properly plaintiff loss to advise plaintiff whether the claim is covered under the homeowner policy and to compensate plaintiff for the covered loss under the homeowner policy.this complaint further alleges plaintiff suffered emotional distress stemming from the presence of mold in her home,and asserts century negligently repaired a floor after inspection,as a result of which plaintiff fell.
on december,brand designated zalma as her expert to testify on the issue of century handling of her claim.following brand refusal to withdraw the designation,century moved for a protective order barring zalma from testifying as brand expert.at the hearing the trial court indicated it was not inclined to disqualify zalma because century claims handling practices could be discoverable century had not produced enough proof of a substantial relationship between zalma current engagement by brand and his representation of century and zalma representation of century involved only the rendering of coverage opinions,not litigation.on this basis,the trial court denied the motion without prejudice to renew it following zalma deposition.
following zalma deposition,century renewed its motion to disqualify zalma as brand coverage expert.the motion was supported by zalma deposition testimony and the claimschool notebook used in the seminar for century claims handlers and adjusters,which contained numerous forms and documents related to century insurance policies and claims handling procedures.
the trial court denied the motion,indicating that a substantial relationship between the prior and current representations could not be established based on the amount of time years between the two engagements.the trial court also found the claimschool seminar to be a general course,which could not form the basis for any claim of privilege,and thus would not support zalma disqualification.
century filed in this court a petition for writ of mandate,prohibition or other appropriate relief challenging the trial court denial of the motion to disqualify zalma a summary denial of the petition was issued on august,
century then filed a timely notice of appeal from the trial court denial of the motion to disqualify zalma.
