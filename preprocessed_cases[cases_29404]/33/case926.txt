the defendant,tommy hardin,was represented at trial by an assistant public defender.he was represented in postconviction proceedings by another assistant public defender.his postconviction attorney argued that his trial attorney was ineffective.the sole issue in this case is whether the simple fact that both attorneys were employed by the du page county public defender office necessitated an inquiry by the circuit court of du page county into a potential conflict of interest.the appellate court refused to remand for such an inquiry and affirmed the dismissal of the defendant postconviction petition.d.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
background 
on may,the defendant was indicted on five counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse.see ilcs d west.the trial court appointed the du page county public defender office to represent the defendant.assistant public defender jameson kunz was assigned the defendant case.
the defendant complaints with kunz representation began almost immediately.at an october,court date,the defendant reported that kunz had made unethical and uncalled for statements.according to the defendant,kunz said his job was to sell me out,which led the defendant to look bad on the whole public defender system.the trial court found that the defendant accusation was not credible.the court told the defendant that it was public defender stephen baker decision which attorney would represent him,and the court indicated that it had not heard anything to discredit kunz work.the defendant replied,i respectfully do not want him as my attorney.i have told him to his face that he was fired.i do think he is going to represent me.and i do not have faith in him due to the fact of what was said in our conversations,period.the trial court stated that kunz was experienced and competent,but that the defendant had the option of representing himself.the court refused to direct the public defender to reassign the case,and it declined to appoint private counsel.the defendant then warned,your honor,it just that i feel it will be a conflict due to the fact that i will be filing with the disciplinary commission.the trial court told the defendant that it would reconsider its decision if he filed a disciplinary complaint and such a conflict arose.
at a september,court date,the defendant asked the trial court to dismiss and replace kunz.the trial court stated that there has been nothing to indicate to me that he is incompetent or ineffective in his representation of you.if you are having some type of personality difficulties,that is something that i will not get involved in,and that is something that you have to direct to baker.the court requested that the defendant put his complaints in writing,so kunz could understand them and relay them to baker.on september,when the trial court asked if the defendant was continuing to ask for the dismissal of the public defender,the defendant clarified,this particular one.the defendant then submitted to the court a handwritten letter,which specified reasons why kunz was ineffective 
he has made statements in the past that it is his job to sell me out.
he has tride sic to have a pre ple sic report ordered and he knew i was aposed sic.
he knows that i have said that i will not plead out this case,but he has tried to get me to plead out.

jami has told me that i have no say in what gose sic on this case.
i have told him on severol sic accounts that this is taking to sic long.
he has asked for some continuances so he could do somthing sic but never did it.
i have object sic to some of the continuances that he and the state have agreed to and even on record and for example and i was over ruled by you your honer sic.
jami has made threats that if i cause him problemes sic that i will get more time.
jami has kept me in the dark on most things.
when i asked him to file things he has refused.
on some motions that he has filed he was prepared to argure sic the motion but the state was.
he has been doing the states sic job for example when i objected to this last contunence sic he did not argure sic for me but agreed with the state and argued for them.

i asked for a compleat sic copy of the transcripts so that i might use and find the ones that would prove my points in the past but jami has said he will decide what transcripts that i will get.
under artacol sic secten sic of the illinois state constitution 
i have tried to get jami to file a motion to supress sic evedens sic he refuse.i my self sic asked judge dockery who denide sic it.
the court scheduled a hearing on the defendant allegations.
at an october,court date,kunz stated that he had discussed this list with baker,and that baker saw no basis in the defendant charges to reassign the case.the trial court agreed,stating 
most of these items,to be perfectly honest,are very vague,and some of them are certainly matters of strategy or legal tactics which do fall within the province of the attorney.m ost are items that appear to be some type of a personality conflict between the two individuals.and as i indicated to the defendant several times,the court is not going to become involved in any type of issues of personality conflict.my concern is whether there has been ineffective representation by kunz of the defendant,and i find nothing raised in these points to show that.
the court continued the case to allow the defendant time to decide whether to continue with the public defender,to retain a private attorney,or to represent himself.
the next day,the defendant chose none of the above.he could not afford to retain a private attorney,and he explained that he was not qualified to represent himself.he then stated that he will not work with kunz in any way,shape or form and that what he says,he does not say for me.he does not do for me.the defendant informed the court that he had obtained forms to file a disciplinary complaint against kunz and added,i think he will be so prejudiced and retaliate.the trial court found no basis for a disciplinary complaint,stating that the defendant threat of filing one was merely an attempt to circumvent the court order denying his motion to substitute counsel.the court reiterated that kunz would remain as defense counsel until the defendant chose to represent himself.
the defendant continued to be uncooperative,and kunz expressed to the trial court his concern about the defendant,questioning whether his obstinacy was a conscious decision or a result of a problem.on november,the trial court held a sua sponte fitness hearing and found the defendant unfit for trial.the defendant disagreed with this finding.on july,the trial court found the defendant was fit for trial.the defendant then claimed that kunz had disclosed confidential medical and psychological reports to a doctor whom kunz had contacted as a possible mitigation witness.the defendant stated that he could not trust kunz and again asked the court to dismiss and replace him.the court refused to do so.
on december,the defendant again voiced his displeasure with kunz representation,stating to the court,for your information,your honor,i am filing a lawsuit against kunz for incompetency,and i want to get rid of him.the court responded,well,you can file whatever suits you want.the court gave the defendant the choice to continue with kunz as his attorney or to represent himself.this exchange followed 
the court if you file a lawsuit against kunz,the case law is have numerous times indicated that kunz would represent you,and unless the public defender office changes filing an ardc complaint or any type of lawsuit does not 
the defendant i am telling you he is not going to represent me.
the court then you are going to represent yourself.
the defendant i am not qualified and neither is he.
the court the issue is,you are either going to represent yourself or he is going to represent you.
the defendant this is what the situation boils down to,i am being blackmailed into pleading guilty 
the court no,you are not.
the case proceeded to a jury trial.a jury convicted the defendant on all five counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse,and the trial court sentenced him to concurrent terms of imprisonment.the defendant appealed,and the appellate court affirmed.see people hardin,d,unpublished order under supreme court rule.
on april,the defendant filed a pro se petition under the hearing act.see ilcs et west.the defendant alleged that kunz was ineffective for two reasons he failed to include evidence of unnamed witnesses psychological records,and he breached client confidentiality.the defendant requested postconviction counsel,and the trial court appointed the du page county public defender office to represent the defendant.ricky holman was assigned the defendant case.
at a july,court date,holman informed the trial court that the defendant foremost request was to be represented by an attorney outside of the public defender office.the court denied that request.on november,holman filed an amended petition for the defendant in which he fleshed out the defendant ineffective assistance of counsel claims and added additional claims.the amended petition alleged that the defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel because kunz failed to two witnesses at trial regarding their psychological histories failed to introduce the psychological histories of two witnesses who gave victim impact statements at the sentencing hearing and failed to those witnesses at the sentencing hearing.the amended petition further alleged that the trial court erred in refusing to allow kunz to the alleged victims regarding their psychological histories and because it found the defendant unfit.the petition further alleged that kunz violated the privilege when he gave medical records to a du page county jail psychologist and,finally,that his sentence violated the proportionate penalties clause.holman filed a rule c certificate along with the amended petition,stating that he had consulted with the defendant about putative violations of his constitutional rights,examined the record and transcripts,and made necessary amendments to the defendant pro se petition.see c.
on november,the trial court found that the amended petition stated the gist of a constitutional claim and ordered the state to file a response.on december,the state filed a motion to dismiss this petition.at a january,court date,holman informed the court that he had received two letters from the defendant.according to holman,the defendant distrusts the public defender office immensely,and he displeased,and i thought i bring it up once again.on february,the trial court received a letter from the defendant 
the reason that i am writing this letter is to make a formail sic complaint against the public defenders office.i had requested that i be appointed counsle sic out side sic of the public defenders office due to the conflict of interest.i was then appointed the public defenders office who then appointed ricky holman to represent me.this letter is to inform you that he has failed to represent me properly i was told that i would receve sic copies of every thing filed and ordered.i have not receved sic anything nor has he kept me informed of anything.i have only receved sic phone call in june and letter telling me that i will be in open court to hear the aguments sic.i do know whats sic going on at all.i wish to be present in court to deal with this problem.i can not have some one sic represent me who dose sic not keep me informed or has sic my best intrust sic in mind.so i ask the court to appoint counsle sic outside the public defenders office due to the conflict of interest.i would also like to file for a reduction of time if at all possable sic.
the trial court acknowledged that it had received this letter,and holman informed the court that he had recently updated the defendant on the case.the court observed that the defendant apparently just wants more communication.holman repeated,e very time i communicate with him he does not want the public defender to represent him.i just making that again as a matter of record.
on april,at the hearing on the state motion to dismiss,holman addressed some inconsistencies among arguments in the amended petition.holman explained that the petition was drafted as directed by the defendant 
knowing his background ahead of time,psychological background,and knowing that he does not want the public defender office to represent him,either at this stage of the proceedings or at trial stage,i followed through with his request and filed each and every paragraph as he insisted that they be brought before the court.i respectfully ask that the court look at each paragraph individually as it rules on the state motion to dismiss.
the court granted the state motion and dismissed the amended petition.
on appeal,the defendant did not address the merits of his petition he simply argued that the trial court erred by failing to inquire into whether a conflict of interest arose when holman attacked kunz effectiveness.the appellate court affirmed.d.the appellate court initially reviewed people banks,where this court stated that a trial court should conduct a inquiry into a potential conflict of interest.the defendant argued that the trial court should have made this inquiry when it appointed the public defender office to represent him in postconviction proceedings.the appellate court disagreed,stating that the dispositions of the consolidated cases in banks showed that a trial court inquiry is not required.d at.
the appellate court then relied on people spreitzer,and held a trial court duty to investigate arises only if,at an early stage in the proceedings,a defendant presents facts suggesting a conflict that goes beyond the problem of one public defender having to attack another.d at.the appellate court found that the defendant conflict of interest allegation did not trigger this duty.d at.though the defendant did use the phrase conflict of interest in his letter during postconviction proceedings,he failed to provide any details regarding this putative conflict of interest,other than the fact that his postconviction attorney worked in the same office as his trial attorney.d at.the appellate court concluded that holman handling of the petition does not suggest that he shied away from pursuing the ineffective assistance of counsel claims.d at.the defendant assertion that holman was not communicating with him did not show a conflict of interest,but rather the defendant unrealistic expectations.d at.
we granted the defendant petition for leave to appeal.a.
the defendant raises a single issue whether the trial court should have conducted an inquiry to ensure that there was no conflict of interest between his postconviction public defender and his trial public defender.the defendant essentially claims that holman may have had a conflict of interest stemming solely from his employment in the same public defender office as kunz,and thus that holman provided ineffective assistance of counsel.see people titone,treating a conflict of interest argument as an ineffective assistance argument.on this legal question,our review is de novo.people morales.
the right to effective assistance of trial counsel comes from the sixth amendment and includes the correlative right to representation.see wood georgia,d,people washington.there is no corresponding constitutional right to effective assistance of postconviction counsel.see people pinkonsly.the right to assistance of counsel in postconviction proceedings is a matter of legislative grace,and a defendant is guaranteed only the level of assistance provided by the hearing act.see people greer.we have labeled that level reasonable assistance.see
