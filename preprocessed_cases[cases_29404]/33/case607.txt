introduction 
in,raymond sandler,then an attorney at sandler rosen,drafted wills for willet brown and his wife betty brown.willet will established a marital trust that was expected to generate several million dollars in annual income.the will named betty as the marital trust income beneficiary for life upon her death,the principal of the trust was to be transferred into an exemption equivalent trust that would benefit each of willet four children.betty will,in turn,left a large majority of her estate to the exemption equivalent trust.after willet died,betty revoked the will that sandler had prepared and drafted a new instrument transferring the large majority of her assets to a trust that was to benefit her daughter.
following betty death in,a dispute arose between her personal representative petitioner fiduciary trust international of california and the marital trust trustees regarding whether the terms of willet will required the trust to pay approximately million in estate and inheritance taxes that were due on betty assets.fiduciary trust filed a motion to disqualify sandler rosen,arguing that the firm was barred from representing the trustees based on sandler prior representation of betty.the trial court denied the motion and fiduciary now petitions this court for a writ of mandate compelling the court to vacate its ruling and enter a new order disqualifying sandler rosen.we issued an order to show cause and we now grant the petition for writ of mandate.
factual and procedural background 
a.the browns estate planning documents 
raymond sandler,an attorney at sandler rosen llp,served as willet brown personal,family and business attorney.in,sandler drafted a will for willet,whose estate was then estimated to be worth million,and a separate will for willet wife of years,betty brown.at the time sandler drafted the wills,willet had four adult children kim blake,who was his only child with betty,and three children from a prior marriage michael brown,patricia louise brown and peter ransom brown.
willet will bequeathed his personal effects and real property to betty.the remainder of his estate was to be divided between two trusts the exemption equivalent trust and the marital trust.the exemption equivalent trust was to be initially funded with a pecuniary amount equal to the maximum sum of various gift and estate tax exemptions then in effect,which totaled approximately.the trust was to be divided into equal shares among willet four children.each child was to receive the income from their respective share of the trust for life upon their death,the principal of each child share was to go to his or her designated appointee.
the will placed all of willet remaining assets into the marital trust and named betty as the income beneficiary of the trust for her life.the will directed that,upon betty death,the trustees of the marital trust were to pay all legally enforceable claims against her or her estate,expenses of administration and any estate or inheritance taxes payable by reason of her death,including interest and penalties,from either income or principal of the marital trust unless other adequate provisions shall have been made therefore.after such payments were made,the trustees were to distribute the remaining principal of the martial trust into the exemption equivalent trust.
the separate will that sandler drafted for betty bequeathed various personal and real property to her daughter kim.the residue of betty estate was to go to the trustees of the exemption equivalent trust created under the will of willet brown.
in addition to the two wills,sandler prepared a memo for willet summarizing the terms of the estate planning documents.the memo stated that sandler expected betty to receive approximately million in annual income from the marital trust,which would enable her to accumulate a sizeable amount during her lifetime.the memo further explained that,under the terms of betty will,this accrued income would go into the exemption equivalent trust which is for the benefit of all four of your children.the memo also indicated that while there would be no tax to pay under your present will,substantial federal estate and state inheritance taxes would become due upon betty death,which would be paid from the marital trust.after the payment of those taxes and any other debts,the remaining principal would be transferred to the exemption equivalent trust and divided into equal shares for each of your children 
betty signed her will in july of and willet signed his will two months later.willet died in october of.shortly thereafter,the marital trust and equivalent exemption trust were established pursuant to an ex parte order appointing testamentary trustees.
after willet died,betty established the betty brown trust,which she amended on several occasions.the operative version of the trust acted to rescind betty will and directed that,upon her death,a significant majority of the trust assets which consisted of betty personal effects,residences and income she had accumulated from the marital trust were to be distributed to kim outright.the betty brown trust also included language indicating that the trustee should obtain all estate and inheritances taxes due on her estate from the trustees of the marital trust the terms of the marital trust established under the will of betty late husband,willet brown,provide that upon betty death,the trustees of the marital trust shall pay any estate or inheritance taxes payable by reason of betty death,unless other adequate provisions shall have been made therefore.betty has made no provision for the payment of any such claims expenses or taxes to the extent that trustee hereunder shall be required to pay any such claims or expenses,or any such taxes payable by reason of betty death,betty directs the trustee to recover from the marital trust all such claims and expenses and all such taxes 
betty died on december.fiduciary trust international of california fiduciary was appointed administrator with will annexed of betty estate and letters of administration were issued on november.
dispute regarding payment of taxes owed on assets held in the betty brown trust 
as a result of betty death,approximately million in estate and inheritance taxes became due on the property in the marital trust and the betty brown trust.although the trustees of the marital trust agreed to pay the portion of the taxes attributable to property held within the marital trust approximately million,they refused to pay the portion of taxes attributable to assets within the betty brown trust.
in august of,fiduciary filed a petition for an order confirming its right to seek payment from the trustees of the marital trust for any and all claims,expenses or taxes arising from betty death,including the total federal estate tax liability attributable to the death of betty brown of which the estimated remaining amount is approximately.fiduciary argued that it was entitled to this payment because willet will specifically directed the trustees of the marital trust to pay any estate or inheritance taxes payable by reason of betty death unless other adequate provision have been made therefore.fiduciary also argued that the betty brown trust included specific language clarifying that betty had made no other provisions for the payment of estate and inheritances taxes.
the trustees of the marital trust,who were represented by sandler rosen,filed a cross petition seeking an order that it was only obligated to pay estate and inheritances taxes,claims,and expenses attributable to property held by the marital trust and had no further obligation to pay taxes,claims,or expenses attributable to assets owned by the betty brown trust.the trustees alleged that,during the years between willet and betty deaths,betty had accumulated more than million in assets from the income she received from the marital trust.the petition asserted that,under the terms of betty will,those assets would have been transferred to the equivalent exemption trust upon her death,thereby benefitting each of willet four children.following willet death,however,betty had elected to revoke that will and established the betty brown trust,which benefitted only kim.
the marital trust trustees argued that,in light of the changes betty made to her estate plan,it would be unfair to require the marital trust to pay the million in estate taxes owed on the assets in the betty brown trust i f the betty brown trust prevails on its claim against the marital trust,then each of willet other three children,patricia,michael and peter will pay approximately in death taxes on property they will never receive.each of their exemption equivalent trusts will be reduced by that amount if the marital trust pays the death taxes for the betty r brown trust such a result was never intended,contemplated or understood by willet when he signed his will and when he died.at the time of his death,he had knowledge of betty will which bequeathed all her property,except personal property and the residences,to the exemption equivalent trusts established by his will for the benefit of his four children equally.
the trustees articulated three reasons why the marital trust should not be required to pay the taxes attributable to the betty brown trust.first,they asserted payment of such taxes was not permitted by probate code section and,which require estate taxes to be equitably prorated in proportion to the value of the property received by each person interested in the estate unless there exists a clear and unambiguous direction to the contrary the trustees contended that the language in willet will requiring the marital trust to pay any taxes that became due upon betty death was not sufficiently clear in light of events that occurred after willet death.
second,the trustees argued that betty decision to redirect the residuary of her estate from the exemption equivalent trust to kim constituted other adequate provisions for the payment of inheritance and estate taxes betty brown revised estate plan represents a tremendous change of circumstances from that existing when willet brown signed his will.approximately in betty browns residuary estate are adequate provisions for payment of the claims,expense,and death taxes attributable to the assets in the betty brown trust in which the marital trust now has no interest.
finally,the trustees argued that the court had equitable and statutory authority to alter or modify the distributive provisions of willet will to accomplish willet actual intent at the time the instrument was executed.the trustees contended that the wills sandler had drafted for willet and betty made clear that willet only intended the marital trust to pay taxes on property that was to be transferred to the equivalent exemption trust.thus,according to the trustees,the court had authority to modify willet will to clarify that the trustees were only required to pay taxes applicable to assets within the marital trust.
fiduciary motion to disqualify sandler rosen 
summary of fiduciary motion to disqualify 
in december of,fiduciary filed a motion to disqualify sandler rosen from representing the marital trust based on the firm prior representation of betty in.fiduciary contended that the subject of sandler rosen current representation was substantially related to the services it had provided to betty in,which consisted of drafting her will and advising her about her and willet estate plan.fiduciary asserted that because sandler rosen was attempting to undertake a representation adverse to a former client in a substantially related matter,it was automatically disqualified.
fiduciary attorney,vivian thoreen of holland knight,filed a declaration in support of the motion explaining that she discovered raymond sandler had previously represented betty after reviewing a declaration that charles birke,an attorney at sandler rosen,had filed in a related proceeding in october of.birke declaration included the following statement sandler was the personal attorney of willet h brown.over the years before brown death in,sandler advised brown on estate planning matters,including drafting wills from time to time for brown.he also drafted a will for brown wife,betty brown and communicated with her concerning her will.t he files maintained by sandler contained written communications with willet brown and betty brown,regarding their estate plans,drafts,and final wills signed by willet brown and betty brown.sandler rosen had also produced to holland knight an executed copy of betty will and a letter sandler had written to betty stating a draft of the will that i have prepared in accord with our recent meeting is enclosed.
the trustees opposed the motion to disqualify,arguing that the rule precluding an attorney from undertaking a representation adverse to a former client was predicated on the duty of confidentiality.the trustees further asserted that because sandler rosen had jointly represented willet and betty brown in the estate planning matters,it owed no duty of confidentiality on any matter of dispute between them relating to that prior representation.in support of its position,the trustees cited evidence code section,which provides an exception to the privilege for communications made in the course of a joint representation in proceedings between the joint clients.
the trustees also asserted that although california courts generally utilize the substantial relationship test to assess disqualification motions predicated on successive adverse representations,the test did not apply in the context of joint representations.according to the trustees,under such circumstances,the party moving to disqualify must establish that it would be unfairly disadvantaged by use of any confidential information,thereby undermining the integrity of the judicial process 
finally,the trustees argued that betty had waived her right to disqualify sandler rosen by failing to object to the firm representation of the trustees in several prior proceedings between the parties.a declaration from charles birke stated that betty brown,acting through independent counsel,had litigated multiple prior disputes against the marital trust and had never sought sadler rosen disqualification in any of those matters.according to the trustees,betty failure to move to disqualify sandler rosen for more than years,despite several adversarial proceedings,proves that betty consented to sandler rosen continued representation of the trustees of the marital trust.the trustees also argued that,in the current action,fiduciary attorney,holland knight,had learned of sandler prior representation of betty more than two months before moving for disqualification.
hearing on the motion to disqualify 
at the hearing on the motion to disqualify,the trial court stated that,under the substantial relationship test,it was required to determine whether the evidence in the moving papers support s a rational conclusion that information material to the former representation would be material to the current representation.the court explained that the primary issue in the current dispute was whether betty had made any other adequate provisions for the payment of her estate and inheritance taxes within the meaning of willet will.the court further explained that,in its view,there was little likelihood that any confidential communication between betty and sandler would be relevant to that issue t he trouble that i having here is that either betty brown did or did not make other adequate provisions.i mean,that going to be the issue at trial.is that necessarily going to be determined,or can it be determined without the resort to confidential communications being revealed between betsy brown and sandler and sandler office back in.
the court also expressed concern that while fiduciary had provided documents showing betsy and sandler had shared communications regarding the estate planning matters,it had not identified any evidence suggesting that they had discussed the other adequate provisions clause w ithout evidence showing betty and sandler discussed the other adequate provisions clause,i do know that i can conclude that there even any possibility of confidential communications i do know that we at the point,factually,that i can conclude there any possibility of confidential information necessarily being involved that should mandate the disqualification of sandler rosen.
in response,fiduciary argued that it was irrelevant whether betty and sandler had actually exchanged confidential communications related to the current proceeding the proper inquiry was only whether a substantial relationship existed between sandler rosen former representation of betty and its current,adverse representation of the marital trust.fiduciary further asserted that sandler could have easily avoided a disqualifying conflict by obtaining betty consent to their subsequent representation of willet in the event a dispute arose between her and willet regarding their estate plan.fiduciary attorney explained that a fter that representation is over which in this case occurred in sandler rosen,not having gotten informed written consent so far as we know,can not represent the husband versus the wife or vice versa in any matter having to do with the estate plan.
the court,however,reiterated its view that any communications that occurred in were unlikely to be used in the current dispute is there really anything that transpired during the representation back in that sandler rosen could ever possibly come in because we have a document that speaks for itself and what we going to be looking at is not what happened in,because there nothing else there but the instruments.we going to be looking over the many years past did betty brown do anything to address the payment of estate taxes.i do see how anything that transpired with sandler rosen could in any way be entertained by the court or introduced in court the court also noted that sandler,betty and willet had all died during the years that had passed since the prior representation,thereby reducing the likelihood that sandler rosen was in possession of any confidential communications related to the current dispute t hat the interesting part about this case,that there is no one alive,there is nothing in writing,there is no possibility,and yet you seeking to disqualify 
the trustees,on the other hand,did not address whether fiduciary had shown that a substantial relationship existed between the current and antecedent representations.instead,it argued as it had in its briefs that disqualification was unnecessary because there was never any confidentiality in this case.this was a joint estate plan,joint client.the evidence code is absolutely clear that there is no confidentiality between joint clients in a dispute between the joint clients.the trustees further asserted that,under zador corporation kwan th zador,the substantial relationship test does even apply in the joint case.now zador went on to say in that case there was informed consent.but your honor,in this case there was no rule in effect about informed consent on conflicts when sandler did this work.the rule that fiduciary is citing became effective september the.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the court took the matter under submission.on february,it denied the motion.fiduciary subsequently filed the instant writ petition seeking relief from the court ruling.we issued an order to show cause why the trial court should not be compelled to vacate its ruling and issue a new order granting the motion to disqualify 
discussion 
standard of review 
generally,a trial court decision on a disqualification motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion.citations.citation.as to disputed factual issues,a reviewing court role is simply to determine whether substantial evidence supports the trial court findings of fact the reviewing court should not substitute its judgment for express or implied factual findings that are supported by substantial evidence.citations.citation.as to the trial court conclusions of law,however,review is de novo a disposition that rests on an error of law constitutes an abuse of discretion.citations.the trial court application of the law to the facts is reversible only if arbitrary and capricious.citation.in re charlisse cal th,charlisse.
b.the rules governing disqualification of an attorney proceeding against a former client 
a motion to disqualify counsel places a litigant right to select his or her attorney into conflict with the duty to maintain ethical standards of professional responsibility.jessen hartford casualty insurance company th,jessen.in determining whether a conflict of interest requires disqualification,however,the trial must look beyond the interests of the parties.people ex rel.of corporations speedee oil change systems cal th,speedee oil.the paramount concern must be to preserve public trust in the scrupulous administration of justice and the integrity of the bar.the important right to counsel of one choice must yield to ethical considerations that affect the fundamental principles of our judicial process.citations.ibid.
protecting the confidentiality of communications between attorney and client is fundamental to our legal system it is a basic obligation of every attorney t o maintain inviolate the confidence,and at every peril to himself or herself to preserve the secrets,of his or her client.bus,subd.e.speedee oil,supra,cal th at.to protect the relationship confidentiality,the rules of professional conduct provide that an attorney shall not,without the informed written consent of the client or former client,accept employment adverse to the client or former client where,by reason of the representation of the client or former client,the member has obtained confidential information material to the employment.rules conduct,rule e.
a disqualifying conflict of interest generally arises under rule e in two situations in cases of successive representation,where an attorney seeks to represent a client with interests that are potentially adverse to a former client of the attorney and in cases of simultaneous representation,where an attorney seeks to represent in a single action multiple parties with potentially adverse interests.in re charlisse,cal th at.where,as here,the potential conflict is one that arises from the successive representation of clients with potentially adverse interests,the governing test requires that the client demonstrate a substantial relationship between the subjects of the antecedent and current representations.flatt superior court cal th,flatt.

c.the trial court erred in denying the disqualification motion 
the parties do not dispute that a substantial relationship exists between the prior and current representations 
the trustees do not dispute that sandler rosen prior representation of betty was direct in nature and substantially related to the current tax dispute.these apparent concessions are.there is no question that sandler representation of betty was direct rather than peripheral.the undisputed evidence shows that,in,sandler personally provided estate planning legal services to betty and willet 
it is equally clear that there is a substantial relationship between the subject of sandler rosen representation of betty and the subject of its representation of the marital trust.a substantial relationship exists whenever the subjects of the prior and the current representations are linked in some rational manner.citation.citation.knight ferguson th.thus,successive representations will be substantially related when the evidence before the trial court supports a rational conclusion that information material to the evaluation,prosecution,settlement or accomplishment of the former representation given its factual and legal issues is also material to the evaluation,prosecution,settlement or accomplishment of the current representation given its factual and legal issues.jessen,supra,th at.
the evidence produced at the trial court proceedings demonstrates that sandler initially represented both betty and willet regarding their estate plans.in that role,sandler drafted willet and betty wills and had communications with them regarding these instruments.it is rational to conclude that,during the course of the representation,sandler would have explained to betty the meaning and effect of the significant terms of the wills,including the clause directing that all taxes due upon her death would be paid from the marital trust unless other adequate provisions shall have been made therefore.indeed,it is rational to assume betty would have had a particular interest in the meaning of this provision given the significant estate and inheritance taxes that were expected upon her death.the particular meaning and intent of that clause,in turn,is at the very heart of the current dispute.thus,the subjects of sandler rosen former representation of betty and its current representation of the marital trust are not only substantially related,but involve the same subject matter the intended meaning of the provision delineating the payment of estate taxes.while sandler rosen initially represented both betty and willet,they have now chosen to continue to represent only willet,through the marital trust,taking a position adverse to betty.
the trial court minute order does not explain why it denied fiduciary motion for disqualification.during the motion hearing,however,the court repeatedly stated that,in its view,there was little likelihood that sandler and betty had actually shared any information that would be relevant to the current dispute or that sandler had passed any such information onto the surviving members of his firm.the court also noted that fiduciary had not provided any evidence that sandler and betty discussed the other adequate provisions clause.based on these comments which are the only insights we have into the court reasoning it appears that,rather than merely assessing whether the prior and current representations were substantially related,the court inquired as to whether sandler had actually obtained,or was otherwise in a position to obtain,any confidential information that other members of his firm might be able to use in the current proceeding.
arguably,such an inquiry might have been proper if sandler relationship with betty had been peripheral or attenuated.the case law makes clear however,that such an inquiry is not permitted where,as here,the relationship was direct w here the lawyer was personally involved in providing legal advice and services to the former client it must be presumed that confidential information has passed to the attorney and there can not be any delving into the specifics of the communications between the attorney and the former client in an effort to show that the attorney did or did not receive confidential information during the course of that relationship.jessen,supra,th at see also brand century ins.century ins.th,disqualification required despite a year passage between the two engagements and the absence of any evidence demonstrating confidential information had actually been obtained.
the trustees have failed to identify any reason why disqualification is not required under the circumstances of this case 
although the trustees do not dispute that a substantial relationship exists between sandler rosen representation of betty and its current representation of the marital trust,they argue that disqualification is not required because sandler rosen jointly represented betty and willet in the estate planning matters and betty and fiduciary waived any right to disqualification through unreasonable delay.
a.the joint nature of sandler rosen prior representation of betty and willet is insufficient to avoid disqualification 
the trustees initially contend that the rule prohibiting an attorney from successively representing clients with adverse interests does not apply where the attorney jointly represented the parties in the prior matter.in support of its position,the trustees rely on both statutory and decisional authority.
evidence code section does not establish a blanket exception to the ethical limitations on adverse,successive representations 
the trustees first argue that the prohibition on successive,adverse representations does not apply when the attorney jointly represented the parties in the prior matter because,under evidence code section,any communications made during the course of that joint representation are not privileged as between the joint clients.evidence code section set s forth a joint client exception to the evidentiary privilege accorded to communications.western continental operating company natural gas corporation of california d,western continental.the exception provides that when two or more clients have retained or consulted a lawyer upon a matter of common interest neither may claim the privilege in an action by one against the other.citations.citation.zador,supra,th at.the trustees contend that because the bar on successive,adverse representations is predicated on the duty of confidentiality,it does not apply where the prior representation was governed by section.
the trustees argument finds support in croce superior court of city and county of san francisco d croce,which held that an attorney who had previously represented several clients associated in a business enterprise was not disqualified from representing one of those former clients in a related,subsequent litigation instituted against the other former clients.the appellate court explained that,under the exception to the privilege,communications made by parties united in a common interest to their joint or common counsel,while privileged against strangers,are not privileged as between such parties nor as between their counsel and any of them,when later they assume adverse positions.id.at.thus,according to the court,the attorney was not prohibited from using confidential information obtained in the first representation against his former clients in the second representation.
several courts have rejected croce implication that evidence code section creates a blanket exception to the prohibition on adverse,successive representations in cases where the attorney jointly represented the parties in the prior matter.see goldstein lees d,even if croce were applicable,we would have difficulty following it the rule of croce has not been followed in any other state,and several more recent cases suggest that its rule may no longer be followed in california.for example,in industrial indemnity great american ins.d,industrial,an insured who had been previously represented by an attorney retained by its insurer moved to disqualify the attorney from representing the insurer in a subsequent,related matter.the insurer opposed the motion,arguing that under evidence code section and croce,since the insured and insurer were united in a common interest in the defense of the original action,communications to their common counsel were not privileged.id.at.
the appellate court rejected the argument the viability of croce has been questioned.citation.nevertheless,even if croce is still good law,it is inapplicable.minimally it presupposes that the former representation of two or more clients united in a common interest citation was not,itself,a violation of the rules of professional conduct.industrial,supra,d at.the court explained that,during the prior representation,the attorney had failed to disclose that a potential conflict existed between the insurer and the insured,who would not be indemnified in the event the injury occurred as the result of the its own negligence.the court concluded that,even if croce wa s still good law,it d id not apply to a situation where the joint representation of two or more clients with conflicting interests was undertaken or continued without disclosure and written consent.id.at.
similarly,in cornish superior court d cornish,the court held that the determination whether an attorney may represent one former joint client against another in a subsequent,related matter depends on the individual facts of each case.cornish involved a dispute between a contractor and its subcontractor arising from a construction project.several lawsuits were filed regarding the project,and the contractor,acting through his independent counsel,agreed to tender defense of several of the actions to the subcontractor bond company,capital.prior to accepting the defense tender,capital attorney obtained the contractor consent that if capital and the contractor became adversaries in a future litigation,the attorney could continued to represent capital regardless of any conflict with the contractor.moreover,at all times during the defense,the contractor retained personal counsel to advise him and there was no evidence that capital attorney ever provided advice directly to the contractor.in a subsequent related action,capital,using the same attorney,sued the contractor,who then moved for the attorney disqualification.
the appellate court ruled that,under such circumstances,disqualification was not required.the court cited croce in support of its holding,but rejected the apparent breadth of its holding a n attorney should not always be free to represent one former joint client against another merely because of the exception to the privilege and we can easily envision situations where such action would seriously undermine the integrity of the relationship,the present case is not such a situation.cornish,supra,d at.the court noted that,in the case before it,the contractor maintained an relationship with his personal attorney,who he had looked to not only to advise him but to represent his interests in the litigation.ibid.it further noted that capital attorney had informed the contractor that it intended to continue to represent capital in the event a conflict developed between the parties.the court explained that its conclusion wa s based on the specific facts present and would be significantly altered if petitioner had not been independently represented by counsel or if there was evidence that petitioner looked to both its personal counsel and capital attorney for advice and counsel.id.at.
finally,in western continental,supra,d,the court rejected outright croce conclusion that the exception to the privilege had any relevance to the issue of disqualification.the plaintiff in western continental jointly litigated a claim with the natural gas corporation of california ngc against a third party.years later,plaintiff,utilizing the same attorney,filed a breach of contract action against ngc,which then moved to disqualify plaintiff attorney.the trial court concluded that the matters were substantially related and granted the motion.
on appeal,plaintiff argued that the ethical rules applicable to successive representations did not apply where the attorney jointly represented the parties in the former matter.western continental,supra,d at.plaintiff asserted that,pursuant to evidence code section,each party fully understood that information disclosed by either party during the joint representation should be shared with both parties.ibid.as a result,the attorney was permitted to disclose to plaintiff any information ngc had provided during the course of the joint representation.
in rejecting this argument,the court adopted the reasoning set forth in prior federal decision that had rejected croce we disagree that the privilege exception in evidence code section ha s any application here w e are not concerned in this case with discovery of allegedly privileged communications.instead,the pertinent issue is the propriety of an attorney representation adverse to a former client.our courts have distinguished the rule against representing conflicting interests from the evidentiary privilege noting that the former is broader than the latter.the evidentiary privilege and the ethical duty not to disclose confidences both arise from the need to encourage clients to disclose all possibly pertinent information to their attorneys,and both protect only the confidential information disclosed.the duty not to represent conflicting interests is an outgrowth of the relationship itself,which is confidential,or fiduciary,in a broader sense.not only do clients at times disclose confidential information to their attorneys they also repose confidence in them.the privilege is bottomed only on the first of these attributes,the rule,on both.citation.citation.western continental,supra,d at citing and quoting hutton company brown,what the court in croce failed to note is that the basis for the rule against representing conflicting interests is broader than the basis for the evidentiary privilege.
we agree with western continental reasoning and follow its holding here.in explaining the standard for evaluating whether representation adverse to the interests of a former client is prohibited,the california supreme court has broadly explained that an attorney is forbidden to do either of two things after severing his relationship with a former client.he may not do anything which will injuriously affect his former client in any matter in which he formerly represented him nor may he at any time use against his former client knowledge or information acquired by virtue of the previous relationship.citation.the prohibition is in the disjunctive.an attorney may not use information or do anything which will injuriously affect his or her former client.citation.city national bank adams th,citing and quoting wutchumna water bailey cal,and people ex rel.deukmejian brown cal d,footnote omitted.in this case,sandler rosen conduct falls squarely within the prohibition.although the firm previously represented both betty and willet in the estate planning matters,it is now asserting on behalf of willet representatives that the documents it prepared during the joint representation should be interpreted in a manner that would substantially reduce the value of betty estate or her trust,thereby harming her interests.
the california supreme court has also repeatedly held that the disqualification rules are not merely intended to protect client confidences or other interests of the parties rather,t he paramount concern is to preserve public trust in the scrupulous administration of justice and the integrity of the bar.speedee oil,supra,cal th at.in light of these significant public interests,we do not agree that matters of disqualification should be determined solely by reference to evidentiary rules 
moreover,even if,as cornish indicates,there may be some circumstances under which an attorney may represent one former joint client against another in a substantially related matter,this is not such a case.none of the factors underlying the court decision in cornish are present here sandler rosen directly and personally advised betty on the estate planning matters there is no evidence that betty retained independent counsel to advise her and,as discussed in more detail below,there is no evidence sandler rosen disclosed to betty the adverse aspects of the joint representation nor did it obtain her consent that,if a conflict arose,sandler rosen could continue to represent willet.
ii.zador kwan supports disqualification 
the trustees next contend that,under zador kwan,supra,th,courts should not use the substantial
