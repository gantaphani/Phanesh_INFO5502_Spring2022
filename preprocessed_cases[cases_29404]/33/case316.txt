discussion 
we generally discourage appellants from bringing ineffective assistance of counsel claims for the first time on direct appeal because only rarely is the trial record sufficiently developed for meaningful review.see united states pergler,cir united states martinez,cir.however,when appellate counsel did not represent the defendant at trial or in pretrial proceedings and when the record is sufficiently developed to allow review of the issue,it is appropriate for an appellant to raise an ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal.martinez,at.fuller claim meets these criteria trial defense counsel no longer represents fuller,and the record is sufficiently developed to allow consideration of the claim that trial defense counsel was laboring under a conflict of interest when fuller sought to withdraw his plea.accordingly,we address fuller ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal.id.
