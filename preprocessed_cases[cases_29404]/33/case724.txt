plaintiffs james haluck and michael litton appeal from a judgment in favor of defendants ricoh electronics,larry vaughn,haruo uesaka,yoji ide,yoshihiro nomura,and houssam el jurdi on their complaint for employment discrimination on the ground the trial judge misconduct so infected the proceedings they were deprived of a fair trial.defendants filed a protective,claiming the trial court erred by denying their motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication on the ground the action was barred by a united states treaty with japan.defendants also filed a motion for sanctions against plaintiffs and their counsel,claiming the appeal is frivolous.
we conclude the trial judge conduct was sufficiently egregious and pervasive that a reasonable person could doubt whether the trial was fair and impartial and reverse on that ground.on remand,the case shall be assigned to a different judge.because we reverse,the motion for sanctions is denied.as to defendants,the court properly found the treaty did not bar the action and thus we affirm its ruling.
based on the nature of this appeal,few of the underlying facts are relevant.plaintiffs were employed by defendant ricoh.they sued ricoh and certain of its employees for damages for statutory and common law discriminatory employment practices,claiming they were passed over for promotions,and litton ultimately wrongfully terminated,because they were caucasian and complained about racial discrimination.after a plus trial,the jury returned a defense verdict.
the misconduct 
we recite only the most egregious instances of the judicial misconduct cited by plaintiffs.
ricoh sought to introduce a video it used for training or public relations purposes.characterization by the trial court.plaintiffs lawyer contended,among other reasons for excluding it,that the video was prejudicial and it a marketing piece and has no bearing on the lawsuit.the court announced it would watch the video during the lunch hour and did so together with defense counsel without notifying plaintiffs lawyer that he would be present or inviting her to join them.it then overruled plaintiffs objections to admission of the video.
somewhere midpoint in trial,in overruling one of plaintiffs objections,the judge held up a sign,apparently prepared by him,stating overruled.the next day,when the court overruled another of plaintiffs objections,defendants attorney presented the judge with a different sign,stating your honor,i want to help you if i may.this is a much nicer version.the court better than my homemade one.reinglass plaintiffs object to callahan presenting another overruled sign to the court.the court sign was adequate enough.the court the court will await receiving a sustained sign from plaintiff s so we can split the benefits here.reinglass how many do i get 
a week later,when plaintiffs lawyer objected to a question,the court apparently used callahan overruled sign.reinglass i am objecting to a ny reading of the document not in evidence.the court he not reading,he asking questions.reinglass hopefully he wo read.the court and hopefully he wo keep talking.callahan your honor,i did get a chance to make that.the court it took too much time to make that sign.reinglass and there a sign,and i object to that.the court he is directing it to me.it lightening things up.and the jury nods.
midway into the trial,the court stated,jeffrey the clerk,we going to the soccer style method here.red card,bucks each.okay.if i say,red card plaintiff,write it down,bucks.red card defense,bucks.we keep a running tab.end of trial,we collect it from them and we may take you guys presumably the jury to lunch at a very nice place.okay.court has enough money for now,and that will either stop the talking or give you a very nice lunch.italics added.
over the next pages of transcript,during which plaintiff litton was being examined,defendants lawyer raised at least nine objections,six of which were overruled,with no mention of a red card.then,when plaintiffs counsel stated she was reading the last portion of a deposition,defendants counsel stated,very good.i probably should say very good.no objection.the court states,that an orange card,not a red card.
during the next pages or so in the transcript,defendants lawyer made three objections,two of which were overruled.as plaintiffs lawyer continued her examination of litton,she noted she was almost finished with a section.defendants counsel stated.the court responded,and a half.go ahead.after several questions,defendants lawyer stated,and,to which the court replied,overruled.numbers junky.no red cards were mentioned.
over the next pages of transcript,defendants lawyer raised two more objections,one of which was overruled.defendants then interposed a hearsay objection.the court asked,we going to have the expert witness testify,right reinglass pardon me the court we going to have him testifying,right reinglass yes.the court and litton is testifying to his numbers pretrial and questioned on the complaint and not about experts and discovery,so we wait for the expert to tell us what those numbers were and how had he arrived on them.sustained.reinglass may i the court red card plaintiff,jeffrey.reinglass i was asking.the court.next question.
in testifying as to his emotional distress,litton stated that he felt like he was in a white room without doors or windows that had no boundaries.on as to this testimony,the following exchange occurred 
callahan q have you ever heard of the twilight zone a yes sir.q goes kind of like this,do do,do do.reinglass your honor,i would just object.this is argument.the court your objection on the record.reinglass also improper argument.callahan you traveling through another dimension,a dimension not only of sight and sound,but of mind,a journey into a wondrous land,whose boundaries are that of imagination that a sign post up ahead,your next stop,the twilight zone.do do,do do.do do,do do.the court that was terrible.get to the question,please.reinglass noting for the record,counsel was singing the twilight zone theme song.the court and how the jurors left it will be reflected on the same record.by callahan q endless white room with no doors or windows.is that where you got your idea of this white room theory a from where the court twilight zone.that his question.the witness no sir.callahan do do,do,do.do do,do do.reinglass i request that counsel stop singing.as entertaining as it is for the jury,it mocking my client and mocking the trial.by callahan q ever heard of the twilight zone,the show a yes sir.the court for the record,he hit a few notes of the twilight zone theme song which i do see as mocking.he was off color sic.callahan i go through life tone deaf and colorblind.this is tough.
during defense counsel of litton,he read approximately pages of the deposition of rhonda stevenson,a employee of ricoh.stevenson was not a defendant and at the time of her deposition no longer worked for ricoh.she never testified at trial.litton had complained to her about what he believed was unfair treatment.litton was asked whether he had read her deposition and then counsel was allowed to read several portions of her testimony and ask litton if he recalled reading that testimony.for example,did you read where stevenson said you were insincere and tried to manipulate both her and another employee do you recall stevenson testimony that you were a proper candidate for layoff when litton said he did not recall,the court permitted defendants lawyer to read stevenson testimony to that effect.
during that testimony,plaintiffs lawyer raised numerous objections.at one point she asked to have a running objection until i add anything new.the court that would help.same objection that been going on all day will be deemed to be made to every question and every answer throughout time.reinglass there may be some i like.the court with the same ruling.well,until i die.same ruling.okay.reinglass just as to stevenson deposition.i settle for that for now.
as defendants counsel continued to litton using that deposition,before one question he stated,okay.this one is not good for haluck reinglass objection to the characterization by counsel.improper argument.the court it a warning.just giving the witness a heads up.what the question,sir 
the next day,as defendants lawyer again began to litton using the deposition,plaintiffs lawyer objected,to which the court responded overruled.objection.reinglass huh the court i got a number for all these things.callahan in the penal code,what is that,your honor the court murder.
in another instance,when litton was testifying that he was discriminated against because of his race,his lawyer asked and did you feel that it was based upon your race because of comments by defendant nomura the court sustained an objection as leading.counsel then rephrased,asking,was there any other reason why you felt that it was based upon your race a d ue to the comment by defendant nomura.defendants attorney stated,what a surprise,to which the judge remarked,are they clever.laughter.
as defendants counsel was concluding his of litton,the following exchange occurred with that,your honor oh,do you litton play poker a no,sir.q terrific poker face.plaintiffs lawyer objected to the editorializing by counsel.there was no ruling.
after a question by plaintiffs counsel,defendants attorney stated,objection.gosh,what is that the court what is it callahan hearsay.the court overruled.callahan how about the court no.go back to sleep.callahan wake me when it break time.the court it very close.laughter.later that day,when callahan made an objection,the court stated,do wake him up,to which callahan replied,hey,i do get a lot of sleep.
discussion 
plaintiffs.introduction 
plaintiffs assert the judgment should be reversed because the judge committed misconduct so egregious they were denied a fair trial.we agree.
in conducting trials,judges should be exceedingly discreet in what they say and do in the presence of a jury lest they seem to lean toward or lend their influence to one side of the other.citation.people sturm cal th,d.their conduct must accord with recognized principles of judicial decorum consistent with the presentation of a case in an atmosphere of fairness and impartiality.hernandez paicius th,d.the trial of a case should not only be fair in fact,it should also appear to be fair.id.at,d.the judge actions and comments during trial violated these principles such that it shocks the judicial instinct to allow the judgment to stand.citation.ibid.
ex parte contact 
plaintiffs challenge the judge viewing of the videotape with defendants counsel present,claiming it was improper ex parte contact that tainted the court ruling on its admissibility.
generally ex parte contacts between a judge and counsel are improper,and if not unjust in actuality,give the appearance of injustice.see in re hancock d.a judge shall not initiate,permit,or consider ex parte communications concerning a pending proceeding,except where circumstances require,for administrative purposes that do not deal with substantive matters provided the judge reasonably believes that no party will gain a procedural or tactical advantage as a result of the ex parte communication,and the judge makes provision promptly to notify all other parties of the substance of the ex parte communication and allows an opportunity to respond.jud.ethics,canon d see also rules conduct,rule b lawyer shall not communicate with judge about merits of pending contested case except in open court,in writing,or in presence or with consent of opposing counsel.
the record shows defendants lawyer was present when the court previewed the video.although it also reflects that the judge stated he would review the video at lunch,there was never any indication he would do so with defendants counsel present or that plaintiffs lawyer was invited to participate.
and the contact between defense counsel and the court dealt with a substantive or not the videotape,to which plaintiffs objected,would be admitted.as plaintiffs note,we have no way of knowing whether there was discussion during which defendants counsel explained the video,to which plaintiffs lawyer would be entitled to respond.
we are not holding that either the judge or defendants counsel intended to violate any professional standards in this instance.however,the trial judge should not have permitted counsel for only one party to participate in viewing the video with him.
lack of courtesy and decorum 
the remainder of the court conduct set out above was also improper.judicial ethics require a judge to be patient,dignified,and courteous to litigants and lawyers and require similar conduct of lawyers under the judge direction and control.jud.ethics,canon b.the delineated exchanges between the court and counsel are the antithesis of judicial decorum and courtesy.they can not in any sense be characterized as tempered miscellaneous comments,as defendants suggest.bold,capitalization,and underscoring omitted.
twilight zone 
we are not persuaded by defendants assertion that many of the exchanges between the judge and defendants lawyer,such as the twilight zone colloquy,can not be judicial misconduct because they were made by counsel,not the judge.that misses the point.although some of these comments were counsel,the judge instigated and encouraged many of them.he also allowed,indeed helped create,a circus atmosphere,giving defendants lawyer free rein to deride and make snide remarks at will and at the expense of plaintiffs and their lawyer.that was misconduct.jud.ethics,canon b a judge shall require order and decorum in proceedings.
overruled signs 
the overruled signs also demonstrated the court lack of courtesy and decorum.defendants arguments justifying this conduct are imaginative but fatuous.we reject their characterization of use of the sign as the court overruling certain objections in writing.bold,underscoring,and capitalization omitted.the judge suggestion to plaintiffs lawyer that she supply a sustained sign was not circumspect nor is counsel to be faulted for not choosing to provide one.this conduct was a sideshow in the overall circus atmosphere mocking a serious proceeding important to the parties,and it cast the judicial system itself in a bad light in the eyes of the litigants and the public at large.hernandez paicius,supra,th at,d.
defendants challenge plaintiffs argument that the court used these signs only when ruling on their objections.again,this misses the mark.it is like saying a baseball team could not complain if the umpire decided to call balls and strikes with his eyes closed,as long as he kept them closed for both teams.the point is not that the acts were,it is that the game could not safely be said to have been played according to the rules.and if defendants lawyer was enjoying the spectacle,he would not object to use of the signs to overrule his objections.
plaintiffs argue the court use of the sign was persistent.the record does not specifically reflect it.but the fact that the sign was still in use a week after first being displayed lends support to this assertion.we agree this conduct made a mockery of plaintiffs objections.
defendants argument plaintiffs waived their challenge to this behavior by failing to object to the judge initial use of the sign he made,by commenting it was adequate,or by failing to ask for a curative instruction does not persuade.counsel did note the judge sign for the record that certainly was not to approve of it.she also objected to use of defendants sign,twice,and the court denied the objections.a request for a curative instruction would have been futile.people sturm,supra,cal th at,d.
stevenson deposition 
improper use of deposition 
there was also misconduct connected to the reading of the stevenson deposition.plaintiffs argue actual use of the deposition testimony was improper for several reasons,including that it contained improper opinion and hearsay,and lacked foundation,and based on the failure to comply with evidence code section,subdivision a.in addition to the erroneous ruling on admissions,plaintiffs protest the demeaning manner in which the court overruled their objections.plaintiffs are correct on both counts.
under evidence code section,subdivision a,subject to certain conditions not at issue here,previously recorded testimo
