by order of october,appellant pamela hunter,a practicing attorney in charlotte,north carolina,and an active member of the north carolina state bar,was suspended from practice in the western district of north carolina for five years.hunter appeals this suspension,imposed upon her pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.as explained below,we conclude that her appeal has merit,and we vacate her suspension from practice by the district court.
hunter,along with her clifton cannon and charlene bell,represented a group of workers at a charlotte,north carolina,bakery owned by appellee earthgrains company bakery earthgrains these three lawyers filed a class action lawsuit against earthgrains on february,in the superior court of mecklenburg county the first lawsuit.the class action complaint,verified by the three named plaintiffs,alleged violations of title vii of the civil rights act of,and it also asserted fraudulent misrepresentation on the part of earthgrains in the closing of its charlotte bakery.earthgrains promptly removed the first lawsuit to the western district of north carolina.
earthgrains responded to the class action complaint on april.the plaintiffs thereafter filed certain motions in the district court,specifically seeking certification of the class filed september,to amend the complaint filed september,to amend the motion for class certification filed january,and for intervention by other plaintiffs filed april,the plaintiffs also filed responses to several motions made by.throughout the wrangling concerning the various motions,hunter and her maintained certain essential assertions,including that a pattern and practice of racial discrimination existed at earthgrains charlotte bakery that the workers there were more skilled,but paid less,than those at other earthgrains bakeries that the hourly wage workforce at the charlotte bakery was predominantly,while the workforce at other bakeries was predominantly white and that earthgrains management had represented to its charlotte employees that the charlotte bakery was profitable and would remain open after a corporate spinoff,but that it was nonetheless closed.the plaintiffs alleged various incidents of racial discrimination by earthgrains,including an assertion by an earthgrains manager that he wanted to change the complexion of the workforce in the charlotte bakery.earthgrains denied the allegations of the first lawsuit and moved for summary judgment,contending,first,that its charlotte employees were bound to arbitrate their title vii claims under their collective bargaining agreement the earthgrains cba second,that the plaintiffs had failed to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination and third,that if a prima facie case had been shown,the plaintiffs had failed to rebut earthgrains legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for closing its charlotte bakery.in response,the plaintiffs consistently asserted,inter alia,that the earthgrains cba did not apply to the title vii claims at issue.
by order entered on april,the district court awarded summary judgment to earthgrains it concluded that the plaintiffs were obligated to arbitrate under the earthgrains cba,and alternatively,that they had failed to rebut the nondiscriminatory reasons proffered by earthgrains for the closing of its charlotte bakery.further,the court determined that the plaintiffs had failed to establish a prima facie case of fraudulent misrepresentation under north carolina law.the court included in its order a sua sponte directive that plaintiffs lawyers show cause why rule sanctions should not be imposed on them for their conduct in the first lawsuit the show cause order on may,the lawyers responded to the order,seeking reconsideration of the summary judgment decision and requesting a stay of the show cause order pending their appeal of the summary judgment award.by order of july,the stay was granted and reconsideration of the summary judgment was denied.
on february,hunter and cannon filed another lawsuit against earthgrains in north carolina state court concerning the closing of the charlotte bakery.this complaint the second lawsuit was not of the class action variety,but instead named individual plaintiffs and alleged the tort of fraudulent misrepresentation under north carolina law.in response,earthgrains filed its own lawsuit in the western district of north carolina,seeking an injunction under the anti injunction act,and asserting that the second lawsuit constituted a collateral attack on the summary judgment awarded to earthgrains on april.the second lawsuit was voluntarily dismissed on may.
on april,this court affirmed the summary judgment award to earthgrains,concluding that plaintiffs had failed to rebut the legitimate,nondiscriminatory rationale offered by earthgrains for the closing of its charlotte bakery,and also concluding that plaintiffs had failed to make a prima facie showing of fraudulent misrepresentation under north carolina law.williams earthgrains.bakery,cir unpublished.in that decision,we explicitly declined to address whether the plaintiffs were required under the earthgrains cba to submit their claims to arbitration.id.
on may,hunter filed another complaint against earthgrains in north carolina state court the third lawsuit,this time alleging the tort of negligent misrepresentation under north carolina law.the third lawsuit,which earthgrains promptly removed to the western district of north carolina,arose from the same essential facts and circumstances as the two earlier cases.thereafter,on october,the district court concluded that federal jurisdiction was lacking,and it remanded the third lawsuit to state court.
for over two years,from may until june,no action was taken with respect to the show cause order of april.on june,however,earthgrains filed a motion in district court seeking rule sanctions against hunter and her,entitled motion for rule sanctions pursuant to show cause order the sanctions motion.the bases asserted for the motion were twofold the fourth circuit had affirmed summary judgment for earthgrains,and plaintiffs lawyers hunter in particular had filed two subsequent lawsuits on the same facts.on july,hunter and her filed a memorandum in objection to the sanctions motion,pointing out that the show cause order related only to the first lawsuit,and referring the court to their response to the show cause order,filed on may,as establishing their compliance with rule.
on october,the district court entered the order we are called upon to review in this appeal.williams earthgrains.bakery,order,the sanctions order.finding the attorneys behavior to be sanctionable,the court barred hunter from the practice of law in the western district of north carolina for a period of five years.it also reprimanded hunter,and it admonished them to be conscious of and strictly abide by the provisions of rule in the future.the court based its sanctions order on the following

hunter has timely appealed the suspension imposed upon her,maintaining that rule sanctions are unwarranted and that her suspension from practice was an overly severe penalty.we possess jurisdiction under.

although rule does not specify the sanction to be imposed for any particular violation of its provisions,the advisory committee note to the rule amendments provides guidance with an illustrative list.a court may,for example,strike a document,admonish a lawyer,require the lawyer to undergo education,or refer an allegation to appropriate disciplinary authorities.note,frcp see also thornton motors,cir w hen a district court finds that a disciplinary sanction more severe than admonition,reprimand,or censure under rule is warranted,it should refer the matter to the appropriate disciplinary authorities.while a reviewing court owes substantial deference to a district court decision to suspend or disbar,in re evans,cir,it is axiomatic that asserting a losing legal position,even one that fails to survive summary judgment,is not of itself sanctionable conduct.christiansburg garment eeoc,d in re sargent,cir noting that losing argument well within the bounds of fair adversarial argument was not sanctionable.
under rule,the primary purpose of sanctions against counsel is not to compensate the prevailing party,but to deter future litigation abuse.in re kunstler,cir disallowing award of attorneys fees which compensated defendants rather than deter ring improper litigation importantly,a sua sponte show cause order deprives a lawyer against whom it is directed of the mandatory day safe harbor provision provided by the amendments to rule in such circumstances,a court is obliged to use extra care in imposing sanctions on offending lawyers.united ins.r d latex,cir noting that sua sponte rule sanctions for allegedly baseless legal claims are to be examined closely as there is no safe harbor available.the advisory committee contemplated that a sua sponte show cause order would only be used in situations that are akin to a contempt of court,and thus it was unnecessary for rule safe harbor to apply to sua sponte sanctions.note,frcp.furthermore,when imposing sanctions under rule,a court must limit the penalty to what is sufficient to deter repetition of such conduct,and shall describe the conduct determined to constitute a violation of this rule and explain the basis for the sanction imposed.c 
in considering this appeal,we first address the inordinate delay between issuance of the show cause order in april and entry of the sanctions order in october while rule sanctions may be imposed when a case is no longer pending,cooter gell hartmarx,d,the delay an adequate the rule purposes.indeed,the supreme court has observed that a lthough rule does not establish a deadline for the imposition of sanctions,the advisory committee did not contemplate that there would be a lengthy delay prior to their imposition.id.at.interpreting rule prior to its amendments and finding plaintiff voluntary dismissal did not deprive court of jurisdiction to award attorney fees in re kunstler,cir.
if we construe the suspension of hunter as having been imposed pursuant to earthgrains motion of june,it presents a serious timeliness problem it is important that such a motion be served promptly after the inappropriate paper is filed,and,if delayed too long,it may be viewed as untimely.note,frcp morganroth morganroth delorean,cir.indeed,the safe harbor provisions of rule c a preclude the serving and filing of any rule motion after conclusion of the case.note,frcp given the safe harbor provisions,a party can not delay serving its rule motion until conclusion of the case or judicial rejection of the offending contention.although we have not held the safe harbor provision to be jurisdictional,we recently noted that many courts have decided that compliance with it is mandatory.rector approved fed.sav.bank,cir see,hutchinson pfeil,cir noting that motion filed after summary judgment challenging interlocutory disputes would have been untimely under rule barber miller,cir concluding that a party can not wait until after summary judgment to move for sanctions under rule ridder city of springfield,cir same.
earthgrains waited for fourteen months after this court affirmed the summary judgment award in the first april to june of initially move for rule sanctions against hunter.in this case,earthgrains failed in its obligation to notify its opponent and the court of its intention to pursue sanctions at the earliest possible date.kunstler,at.while hunter has not asserted prejudice from the late filing and lack of notice,we are unable to find them excusable.sanctions should operate as educational tools,and this exemplary function is ill served when sanctions are delayed.prosser prosser,cir 
if,as earthgrains counsel suggests,we should construe the suspension of hunter as being a sua sponte action of the court,we run into the legal principle that a court should resolve sua sponte rule issues before resolution of the merits of the case if,as earthgrains now contends,the suspension was imposed sua sponte,we must examine the court assertion that hunter legal contention was frivolous with particular stringency.united ins.r d latex,cir.
in these confusing circumstances,we will accord earthgrains the benefit of the doubt,and we will assume the suspension of hunter was imposed sua sponte.notwithstanding our serious concern over the delay in its imposition,we will proceed to examine the suspension of hunter.
the primary basis for the suspension of hunter is that she advanced a frivolous legal position in the first lawsuit.by presentation of a pleading to a court,an attorney is certifying,under rule b,that the claims and legal contentions made therein are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension,modification,or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.in its sanctions order,the district court found the legal assertions of hunter to be utter nonsense that were paradigmatic of a frivolous legal contention.sanctions order at.
we have recognized that maintaining a legal position to a court is only sanctionable when,in applying a standard of objective reasonableness,it can be said that a reasonable attorney in like circumstances could not have believed his actions to be legally justified.in re sargent,cir internal citations and quotations omitted.that is to say,as judge wilkins recently explained,the legal argument must have absolutely no chance of success under the existing precedent.id.although a legal claim may be so inartfully pled that it can not survive a motion to dismiss,such a flaw will not in itself support rule the lack of any legal or factual basis is sanctionable.simpson welch,cir.we have aptly observed that t he rule does not seek to stifle the exuberant spirit of skilled advocacy or to require that a claim be proven before a complaint can be filed.the rule attempts to discourage the needless filing of groundless lawsuits.cleveland demolition azcon scrap,cir.and we have recognized that c reative claims,coupled even with ambiguous or inconsequential facts,may merit dismissal,but not punishment.brubaker city of richmond,cir quoting davis carl,cir.
in its sanctions order,the court maintained,with respect to hunter,that p laintiffs standing to file suit was challenged based on a binding arbitration clause in the earthgrains cba.plaintiffs response to this gateway issue rested on a tenuous,if not preposterous,reading of the cba and applicable law.sanctions order at.the court was correct that the legal position it found a collective bargaining agreement cba arbitration clause must contain specific language to mandate arbitration of a federal discrimination been rejected by us four years earlier in austin glass container,cir.however,our reasoning in austin,as of april,when the show cause order issued,stood alone on one side of a circuit split.six of our sister circuits the second,sixth,seventh,eighth,tenth,and eleventh had taken the legal position contrary to austin on whether a cba could waive an individual employee statutory cause of action.see penny united parcel,cir finding that allowing judicial forum for individual statutory claim under cba displays fidelity to supreme court precedent brisentine stone webster eng g,cir finding that mandatory arbitration clause in a collective bargaining agreement does not bar litigation of a federal statutory claim and disagreeing with austin harrison eddy potash,cir adopting majority view and noting that only this circuit required arbitration of federal statutory claims when cba contains an arbitration clause pryner tractor supply,cir rejecting austin and adopting majority view varner super markets,cir allowing pursuit of title vii claim in judicial forum under cba tran tran,cir deciding that plaintiff need not have arbitrated before pursuing lawsuit in point of fact,and consistent with the foregoing,none of our sister circuits,as of april,had agreed with the position we took in austin.
the circuit split evidenced by these decisions concerned whether collective bargaining agreements containing general language required arbitration of individuals statutory claims,such as those arising under the adea and title vii.the disagreement of the circuits on this issue resulted from varying interpretations of the court decisions in alexander company,d,and gilmer lane,d this court,in austin,had deemed gilmer to be the controlling authority,while the other circuits chose the alternate route,finding the court decision in alexander to control.
in opposition to earthgrains summary judgment motion,hunter repeatedly relied upon the supreme court decision in alexander failing,however,to rely on the decisions of the six circuits that had followed alexander.she further sought to align her case against earthgrains with alexander by discussing the generality of the applicable clause of the earthgrains cba,which included the agreement not to illegally discriminate.she contended that this provision was not sufficiently specific to require her clients to arbitrate.
the district court was particularly concerned with hunter attempt to distinguish her case from our decision in brown trans world airlines,cir.she maintained to the court that brown had distanced itself from austin on essentially the same facts,and she inferred from this the reluctance of our brown panel to follow austin.hunter argued that,as in brown,the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement which allegedly proscribe racial discrimination,do not mention title vii,or common law fraud,and that the language of the collective bargaining agreement between plaintiffs and defendant is not sufficient to require plaintiffs to first arbitrate their claim.earthgrains contended,on the other hand,that the agreement not to illegally discriminate in the earthgrains cba compelled arbitration of title vii claims under austin.the district court agreed with earthgrains and based its suspension of hunter largely on this legal contention.as we have pointed out,however,there was a basis for hunter to assert the position she propounded.we would be reaching to conclude that,as of,hunter position had no chance of success under existing law.sargent,at.and subsequent legal developments render hunter position on the austin issue not only tenable,but most likely correct.
on november,two years before the sanctions order of october,supreme court decided that,in order for a cba to waive individuals statutory claims,it must at least contain a clear and unmistakable waiver of the covered employees rights to a judicial forum for federal claims of employment discrimination.wright universal.serv,d.the court declined to address whether even a clear and unmistakable waiver of the right to take one statutory discrimination claim to court would be enforceable.id.it also observed that the right to a federal judicial forum is of sufficient importance to be protected against union waiver in a cba,and that a clause requiring arbitration of matters under dispute was not sufficiently explicit to meet the standard.id.at.the court distinguished its earlier decision in gilmer on the basis that gilmer involved an individual waiver of his own rights,rather than a union waiver of the rights of represented employees,and thus it was not subject to the clear and unmistakable standard.id.at.see also supra.when the district court suspended hunter for advancing a legal position that was not the law of this circuit,see sanctions order at,it was itself propounding a legal proposition in conflict with the supreme court wright decision 
in blue united states of army,cir,we had occasion to address a rule sanctions issue in a similar,but distinguishable,context.we there affirmed an award of sanctions where the attorneys had pursued a claim after it became clear that it was factually without merit.of significance,the plaintiffs counsel had espoused a legal position contrary to circuit precedent regarding the necessary showing for a prima facie case of discrimination,but arguably more consistent with supreme court authority.id.at.in blue,the district court recognized that the question of law at issue was in a state of flux,and it declined to impose rule sanctions based on the legal contention being asserted.id.in this appeal,the suspension of hunter was in large part premised on her legal contention on the arbitrability of discrimination claims under the earthgrains cba,a legal position being asserted in connection with a body of law that was in a state of flux.indeed,the district court sanctioned hunter for advocating a legal proposition supported by a majority of our sister circuits,which was later substantially adopted by the supreme court.
in pursuing the first lawsuit,hunter,under rule b,was plainly entitled and probably obligated to maintain that austin was incorrectly decided.while she could expect the district court to adhere to austin,she was also entitled to contemplate seeking to have this court,en banc,correct the error perceived by her of its earlier austin decision.if unsuccessful,she might then have sought relief in the supreme court on the basis of the circuit split.indeed,our good chief judge,in his blue decision,observed that if it were forbidden to argue a position contrary to precedent,
the parties and counsel who in the early brought the case of brown board of,might have been thought by some district court to have engaged in sanctionable conduct for pursuing their claims in the face of the contrary precedent of plessy ferguson.the civil rights movement might have died aborning.
this astute observation of judge wilkinson is especially pertinent in the context of this case.the district court erroneous view of the law in its suspension of hunter necessarily constitutes an abuse of discretion.hartmarx,at.although hunter and the other lawyers,her and the lawyers for failed to provide the court with a thorough exposition on the circuit split and the supreme court decision in wright,their lack of thoroughness does not render her position frivolous.because hunter legal contentions in the first lawsuit on the issue of arbitrability were not frivolous,her suspension from practice in the western district of north carolina on this basis does not withstand scrutiny.
although the district court enunciated two other bases for its suspension of hunter,neither of them supports the suspension first,in its sanctions order,the court broadly observed that hunter had demonstrated a lack of judgment and skill.sanctions order at.other than its conclusion on the frivolous nature of hunter legal contentions on the cba issue,no other basis was specified for her lack of judgment and skill.as we have pointed out,a court,especially when acting sua sponte,must particularize the behavior it deems sanctionable,and it may only impose the sanction necessary to deter future misconduct.see.c requiring court entering sua sponte order to describ e the specific conduct that appears to violate the rule,and authorizing sanction limited to what is sufficient to deter repetition of such conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated thornton motors,cir finding general assertion in show cause order of failure to produce evidence insufficient to support sanction for inadequate prefiling inquiry.in these circumstances,where the lone basis of its support has failed,a broad assertion that a lawyer is lacking in judgment and skill does not pass muster under rule 
second,the district court relied upon a previous incident involving hunter in further support of its sanction
