the primary issue in this case is when an associate of a law firm may refer a matter to another firm or lawyer without breaching a fiduciary duty to his or her employer.brewer pritchard,sued its former associate and another lawyer with whom that associate formed a partnership,asserting causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty,actual and constructive fraud,conversion,and negligence.the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the former associate and his partner on all claims.the court of appeals reversed in part,remanding the breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud causes of action against both defendants.
we hold that an associate owes a fiduciary duty to his or her employer not to personally profit or realize any financial or other gain or advantage from referring a matter to another law firm or lawyer,absent the employer agreement otherwise.although our reasoning differs from the court of appeals,we affirm that court judgment.
james chang and nick johnson,the defendants in this case,filed a motion for summary judgment pursuant to rule c as to certain causes of action or elements thereof and pursuant to rule i as to others.although some of the facts are disputed,we consider the record in a light most favorable to brewer pritchard,who was the nonmovant.we accept the summary judgment evidence offered by brewer pritchard,the nonmovant,as true in determining if there is a genuine issue of material fact 
brewer pritchard employed james chang as an associate.his practice was devoted to corporate securities and other corporate transactional matters.one of chang close personal friends was henry king.they had been members of the same fraternal organization during their college years and had been friends for eleven years before the events that gave rise to this suit took place.
in april,while chang was employed by brewer pritchard,he and henry king were together on a ski vacation when king father herbert king and several members of a delegation from china were severely injured in a helicopter crash that occurred near flower mound,texas.chang returned home two days later and talked to two members of brewer pritchard about the possibility that the firm might be retained to represent the crash victims.chang asserted that because henry king father and chang mother were friends,and because of chang ties to the chinese community,he could control the case and could sign up the crash victims.chang said that he expected brewer pritchard would make a lot of money handling the case.one of the brewer pritchard partners,patrick gaas,discussed with chang how to structure a contingent fee agreement and issues that could arise.gaas explained to chang the possibility of referring the case to another firm and how to structure a referral fee agreement.gaas mentioned the names of several prominent personal injuries lawyers to whom the case might be referred.chang asserted that he was in the best position to consummate an agreement with the crash victims.chang likewise told the other partner with whom he discussed this matter,thomas pritchard,that the case was a significant business opportunity for our firm.chang asked pritchard if he would be available to travel to denton,texas,if needed,to which pritchard responded that he would assist in any way that he could.chang did not tell either gaas or pritchard that henry king was a personal friend,that chang considered herbert king to be his surrogate father,or that chang intended to assist king as a family friend without payment.
chang scheduled meetings for henry king with several personal injury lawyers and firms.chang accompanied king at all of those meetings.one of the attorneys they consulted was nick johnson,a close friend of chang since they had been in law school together.henry king and johnson were also friends.they had become acquainted six or seven years earlier through chang.
chang billed to brewer pritchard business development file faxes to and from henry king,nick johnson,and another personal injury lawyer in houston.chang also billed to the same file long distance telephone calls to the hospital where henry king father was being treated and to the hotel where the king family was staying,and chang billed shipping charges on a package from henry king to the same file.
five days after the crash,henry king signed a contingent fee agreement with nick johnson during or shortly after a meeting at which chang was present.johnson told king at that meeting that he would flip the case to the firm of jamail kolius.the next day,johnson consummated an agreement with jamail kolius,referring the matter for of the net fee.jamail kolius had been among the several firms and lawyers with whom chang and king had previously met.joe jamail and johnson subsequently met with other victims of the crash who were hospitalized in fort worth,and jamail and johnson were retained to represent them as well as the survivors of a victim who was killed in the crash.all the claimants other than the king family were citizens of china,and suit was filed in federal court.there is evidence that johnson actively participated as with the jamail kolius firm in representing the kings and the other crash victims in that suit.
when chang was asked by brewer pritchard how he was progressing in reaching an agreement with the crash victims,he said that the firm had lost out and that the jamail firm had been retained.he disclaimed any knowledge of how that firm had procured the representation.
chang left brewer pritchard about two months after the crash occurred to work for another firm that had a corporate securities practice.the king family personal injury suit was settled a little more than a year after that,in october,and nick johnson received a fee.it is unclear from the record whether that fee was solely referable to the kings claims or whether it also included a fee from the other crash victims who were citizens of china.about a year later,at the end of,chang left the firm with which he had been working and formed a partnership with nick johnson.
brewer pritchard first sued johnson and chang in october,when the helicopter crash suit was settled,which,as noted above,was about a year before johnson and chang became law partners.brewer pritchard contended chang had breached a fiduciary duty that he owed to brewer pritchard and that johnson had knowingly assisted chang in committing that breach.specifically,brewer pritchard alleged that chang directly or indirectly profited by receiving or arranging to receive all or part of johnson referral fee.brewer pritchard sought actual and exemplary damages.when brewer pritchard case was set for trial and after johnson and chang had filed a motion for summary judgment addressing all claims,brewer pritchard filed a notice of.on the same day that the notice of was filed,brewer pritchard filed a second,identical suit.johnson and chang filed a motion for summary judgment in that case,which the trial court granted.
brewer pritchard appealed.the court of appeals held that fact questions remained as to whether chang had breached a fiduciary duty and whether johnson had knowingly assisted chang it accordingly reversed the trial court judgment in part,and remanded the breach of fiduciary duty and constructive trust claims.the court of appeals otherwise affirmed the trial court judgment.
we granted johnson and chang petition for review and brewer pritchard conditional petition for review.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm the court of appeals judgment,although the basis for our judgment differs from the court of appeals.we turn first to johnson and chang petition for review and the breach of fiduciary duty cause of action.
brewer pritchard asserts that throughout chang employment,he owed a fiduciary duty to put the firm interests above his own and to refrain from taking actions detrimental to the firm.the firm alleges that chang seize d for himself what he perceived to be a lucrative business opportunity,thereby breaching a fiduciary duty.brewer pritchard also asserts that it had policies forbidding associates from practicing law for their own account,engaging in employment of any kind other than their employment with the firm,or referring cases without securing a referral fee for brewer pritchard.the firm contends that its actual damages for chang breach of fiduciary duty are the amount of the referral fee that nick johnson obtained in connection with the helicopter crash.
johnson and chang argue that as a matter of law chang owed no fiduciary duty to brewer pritchard.they assert that chang had no employment agreement with brewer pritchard and that an associate does not owe a fiduciary duty to his or her firm merely as a result of being employed.
fiduciary duties are imposed by courts on some relationships because of their special nature.we recounted in kinzbach tool that the term fiduciary is derived from the civil law.we recognized that it is impossible to give a definition of the term that is comprehensive enough to cover all cases.we said,g enerally speaking,it applies to any person who occupies a position of peculiar confidence towards another.it refers to integrity and fidelity.it contemplates fair dealing and good faith,rather than legal obligation,as the basis of the transaction.our courts have long recognized that certain fiduciary duties are owed by a trustee to a beneficiary of the trust an executor to the beneficiaries of an estate and an attorney to a client we have historically held that partners also owe certain fiduciary duties to one another we need not consider here the impact of the provisions of the texas revised partnership act on duties partners owe to one another 
under the common law of most jurisdictions,including texas,agency is also a special relationship that gives rise to a fiduciary duty the restatement second of agency sets forth in general terms the concept that u nless otherwise agreed,an agent is subject to a duty to his principal to act solely for the benefit of the principal in all matters connected with his agency.in elaborating on the extent of this fiduciary duty,the restatement second says 
the agreement to act on behalf of the principal causes the agent to be a fiduciary,that is,a person having a duty,created by his undertaking,to act primarily for the benefit of another in matters connected with his undertaking.among the agent fiduciary duties to the principal is the duty to account for profits arising out of the employment,the duty not to act as,or on account of,an adverse party without the principal consent,the duty not to compete with the principal on his own account or for another in matters relating to the subject matter of the agency,and the duty to deal fairly with the principal in all transactions between them 
in virtually all of the cases that we have found in which an agent diverted an opportunity from the principal or engaged in competition with the principal,the agent or an entity controlled by the agent profited or benefitted in some way that was the situation in kinzbach tool the principal directed its employee to act as its agent in negotiating the purchase of an tool.unbeknownst to the principal,its agent had already had conversations with the seller of the tool,and the seller had agreed to pay the agent a commission of that would be undisclosed to the principal.we held that the agent had a fiduciary duty to disclose this arrangement in its entirety and to disgorge any compensation he received from the seller,even though the principal was willing to pay the full price desired by the seller 
it is beside the point for either turner or corbett to say that kinzbach suffered no damages because it received full value for what it has paid and agreed to pay.a fiduciary can not say to the one to whom he bears such relationship you have sustained no loss by my misconduct in receiving a commission from a party opposite to you,and therefore you are without remedy.it would be a dangerous precedent for us to say that unless some affirmative loss can be shown,the person who has violated his fiduciary relationship with another may hold on to any secret gain or benefit he may have thereby acquired.it is the law that in such instances if the fiduciary takes any gift,gratuity,or benefit in violation of his duty,or acquires any interest adverse to his principal,without a full disclosure,it is a betrayal of his trust and a breach of confidence,and he must account to his principal for all he has received.
consistent with our holdings in kinzbach,the court of appeals held in siegrist that an agent who agreed to accept a profit from the person with whom he was dealing on behalf of his principal must disgorge that profit 
however,courts have been and should be careful in defining the scope of the fiduciary obligations an employee owes when acting as the employer agent in the pursuit of business opportunities.for example,in bray squires the court of appeals delineated obligations that an associate of a law firm does and does not owe to his or her employer.while there are some overly broad statements in bray to the effect that an associate owes a fiduciary duty to his or her firm based merely on the employment relationship,the court ultimate analysis and holding were correct.in that case,three associates made plans to form their own firm while still employed by bray associates.they had discussions with one of bray largest clients before their departure.that client subsequently moved its business to the associates new firm.when bray then sued his former employees,the jury failed to find a breach of fiduciary duty.in affirming the trial court rendition of judgment based on that finding,the court of appeals correctly acknowledged that the associates could not compete with their employer while he still employed them but the court held that there was evidence from which the jury could have concluded that the associates did not improperly solicit bray client.there was evidence that the client was not asked to and did not agree that it would move its business while the associates were still at the bray firm but only expressed an interest in pursuing a relationship if certain contingencies unrelated to the associates formation of their own firm occurred.
the bray decision was consistent with decisions in other jurisdictions which have held that an employee does not owe an absolute duty of loyalty to his or her employer.as the supreme judicial court of massachusetts explained in augat,aegis,an employer right to demand and receive loyalty must be tempered by society legitimate interest in encouraging competition 
it is important to define the limited basis for liability we recognize in this case.an employee may properly plan to go into competition with his employer and may take active steps to do so while still employed such an employee has no general duty to disclose his plans to his employer,and generally he may secretly join other employees in the endeavor without violating any duty to his employer the general policy considerations are that employees should be allowed to change employers freely and competition should be encouraged if an employer wishes to restrict the competitive activities of a key employee,it may seek that goal through a agreement the plaintiffs did not do so in this case.
there are,however,certain limitations on the conduct of an employee who plans to compete with his employer.he may not appropriate his employer trade secrets he may not solicit his employer customers while still working for his employer,and he may not carry away certain information,such as lists of customers of course,such a person may not act for his future interests at the expense of his employer by using the employer funds or employees for personal gain or by a course of conduct designed to hurt the employer 
we have no difficulty in concluding that under agency principles,an associate owes a fiduciary duty not to accept a fee or other compensation for referring a matter to a lawyer or law firm other than the associate employer without the employer consent.the more difficult question is whether an associate can be said to have breached a fiduciary obligation to his or her employer when the associate undertakes to pursue the representation of a party on behalf of his or her employer,then participates in referring the potential client to other counsel with no compensation,benefit,or other advantage to the associate.there is evidence in the case before us that chang specifically undertook to act as brewer pritchard agent in obtaining an agreement from the helicopter crash victims to represent them.brewer pritchard also offered summary judgment evidence that its associates were not permitted to practice law for their own account or engage in employment of any kind other than their employment with that firm.
there are a number of competing considerations in deciding whether to impose a fiduciary duty under such circumstances.one of these is that under texas rules of ethics governing lawyers,an attorney may agree to represent a client even though the attorney is not competent to handle the matter,as long as another lawyer who is competent is associated with the prior consent of the client brewer pritchard argues that it would have been entitled to a substantial referral fee if chang had signed up the helicopter crash victims with that firm,rather than nick johnson,even if brewer pritchard had no intention of actually handling the case but instead intended to immediately refer it to other lawyers.
however,on balance,we think it unwise to impose an absolute fiduciary duty upon associates of a law firm to abstain from directing those with legal needs to a firm other than the associate employer.if one of the parties injured in the helicopter crash had been chang mother,should brewer pritchard have a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty if chang referred her to an experienced personal injury lawyer without securing a referral fee for brewer pritchard the answer to that question should be no.
there could be many reasons why it would be in a potential client best interest for an associate to suggest that they seek representation from a firm other than the firm for whom the associate works.for example,suppose that an existing client of a firm asks an associate if that firm handles corporate and tax matters.the associate says yes,and tells her employer that she will try to secure representation of the client in these matters.the client meets with the tax and business lawyers of the firm,but afterwards asks the associate for a frank evaluation of whether lawyers at another firm who handle such matters on a more regular basis and to the exclusion of other practice areas might be better suited.the associate should not be faced with breaching a fiduciary duty to the firm that employs her by giving an answer that leads the client to another firm.
there is evidence in this case that brewer pritchard had little or no experience with personal injury claims and had never taken to trial a claim involving catastrophic personal injuries.a firm legitimate interest in demanding loyalty from its associates should not outweigh competing considerations of the public interest in encouraging lawyers to assist those who need legal advice in securing the most appropriate representation for the particular type of case and market competition.
brewer pritchard contends that its policy forbidding an associate from referring a case to another lawyer or firm without compensation to brewer pritchard gives rise to a fiduciary duty.we disagree.the firm referral policy may have been a contractual condition of chang employment,an issue we need not decide since brewer pritchard has not sued chang for breach of contract.but a contractual obligation does not generally give rise to a fiduciary duty.the court of appeals in kline correctly held that although an agreement between lawyers recited that one would be an associate of the other law firm for purposes of the agreement,there was no fiduciary duty in handling settlement proceeds arising from the matter covered by the agreement simply because of their business ties.an employee may agree in a contract with his or her employer not to make any referrals at all to another firm or lawyer,even if the employee receives no referral fee or other payment.but we will not elevate such a consensual,contractual duty into a fiduciary duty imposed by law.
nor do we today set forth a broad rule governing all employees who might divert a business opportunity from their employer without receiving any compensation or benefit in return.we need not and do not decide whether there may be a fiduciary duty in other contexts.we hold only that an associate may participate in referring a client or potential client to a lawyer or firm other than his or her employer without violating a fiduciary duty to that employer as long as the associate receives no benefit,compensation,or other gain as a result of the referral.however,an associate owes a fiduciary duty not to accept or agree to accept profit,gain,or any benefit from referring or participating in the referral of a client or potential client to a lawyer or firm other than the associate employer.with these premises in mind,we turn to the summary judgment record.
johnson and chang moved for summary judgment on only one ground with respect to the claim that chang owed and breached a fiduciary duty.that ground was that chang was an employee of brewer pritchard and did not owe the law firm or any of its principals any fiduciary obligation emphasis added.as we have just said,chang did owe a fiduciary duty not to profit or gain from assisting henry king in retaining counsel other than brewer pritchard.johnson and chang were not entitled to summary judgment on the basis that they urged.
the court of appeals correctly observed that johnson and chang did not move for summary judgment on the basis that the evidence conclusively established no breach of fiduciary duty nor did johnson and chang move for summary judgment under rule i on the basis of no evidence of breach although johnson and chang motion for summary judgment addressed other of brewer pritchard causes of action,which included constructive fraud,conspiracy,conversion,and negligence,the sections of the motion dealing with those claims was not incorporated by reference or otherwise mentioned in the section that dealt with fiduciary duty.in a generic section at the beginning of their motion entitled procedural background,johnson and chang set forth facts and record cites to support their contention that chang did not agree to accept,has not received,and does not expect to receive any compensation as a result of the king suit or the agreement between henry king and nick johnson and the subsequent referral to jamail kolius.but in the only section of their motion that addressed the breach of fiduciary claim,johnson and chang did not incorporate their general discussion of these facts by reference or in any way refer to or rely on the evidence identified in the procedural background section of the motion.
as we discuss in detail in sections vi b and vii below,johnson and chang asserted in their summary judgment motion that the conspiracy and conversion claims failed because there is no evidence in the summary judgment record that chang accepted or has agreed to accept any compensation for his role in referring the king family to nick johnson or his role in the subsequent referral to the jamail kolius firm.but johnson and chang did not make these same arguments in connection with the breach of fiduciary duty claim.thus,johnson and chang were not entitled to summary judgment on the basis of no breach of fiduciary duty because they did not include that ground in their motion.a court can not grant summary judgment on grounds that were not presented accordingly,the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the breach of fiduciary claim,and the court of appeals properly remanded that claim.
brewer pritchard alleged that johnson and chang were liable to brewer pritchard for their acts,omissions and concealment which involved a breach of the legal duties owing to brewer pritchard,as well as a breach of trust and confidence,and that such conduct constituted constructive fraud.this claim is derivative,at least in part,of the breach of fiduciary claim.johnson and chang moved for summary judgment on the constructive fraud claim solely on the basis that neither chang nor johnson owed brewer pritchard a fiduciary duty.for the same reasons that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on the breach of fiduciary duty claim,it should not have granted summary judgment on the constructive fraud claim.
as an independent ground for summary judgment on all of brewer pritchard causes of action,johnson and chang contended that any recovery by brewer pritchard of damages for its loss of a referral fee in connection with the crash victim personal injury claims would violate rule f of the disciplinary rules of professional conduct because the kings would have objected to and do object to the participation of brewer pritchard in any fee a fee sharing agreement between lawyers who are not in the same firm violates public policy and is unenforceable unless the client is advised of and consents to the sharing arrangement 
the fact that brewer pritchard seeks damages measured by the amount of the referral fee that it contends it would have received does not remove its claims from the scope of rule.brewer pritchard could not have shared a fee with another firm or any lawyer who was not a member of brewer pritchard without the crash victims knowledge and consent.therefore,absent that knowledge and consent,there could be no referral fee and thus no damages because there would be no loss.
however,rule does not prohibit lawyers within the same firm from sharing in fees,even if the client is unaware of the sharing arrangement.rule provides only that a agreement between lawyers who are not in the same firm should not be made unless the client is advised of,and does not object to,the participation of all the lawyers involved.
there is evidence from which a factfinder could conclude that chang acted as brewer pritchard agent in his dealings with the kings in the aftermath of the crash and attempting to represent them and the other crash victims.the alleged referral by chang to johnson occurred while chang was a member of the brewer pritchard firm.accordingly,any compensation chang may have received or might receive in the future that is related to the crash victims claims would be referable to the time that he was an associate at brewer pritchard.to the extent that brewer pritchard seeks recovery or disgorgement of payments or other compensation to chang,it is not seeking,for purposes of rule,to share a fee with a lawyer who is not in the same firm.
there is no evidence that the king family would object to chang,as distinguished from brewer pritchard,sharing in fees paid in their suit over the helicopter crash.henry king only denied that any agreement to compensate chang exists.he did not say that if chang had been or will be compensated,the king family would object.
johnson and chang also failed to offer summary judgment evidence that rule would bar brewer pritchard from sharing in fees paid by the crash victims other than the king family.johnson and chang did not offer any summary judgment evidence that the crash victims other than the kings objected to chang and brewer pritchard sharing in legal fees.accordingly,johnson and chang were not entitled to summary judgment based on rule.
we now turn to the issues raised in brewer pritchard petition for review in which it argues that the court of appeals erred in affirming summary judgment for johnson and chang on the conspiracy,conversion,actual fraud,and negligence claims.
brewer pritchard alleged that nick johnson conspired with chang to accomplish an unlawful purpose.the brewer pritchard firm asserted that johnson was a conduit through which chang shared in a referral fee from jamail kolius.johnson and chang moved for summary judgment on this claim on the basis,among others,that there was no evidence that any unlawful purpose had been accomplished and that they were therefore entitled to summary judgment under rule i.
the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment.the court of appeals affirmed without reaching the merits of the conspiracy claim.the court of appeals reasoned that brewer pritchard response to the no evidence motion for summary judgment did not tie facts in the record to the specific elements of the conspiracy claim brewer pritchard challenges the disposition of the conspiracy claim in its petition for review.we first consider whether brewer pritchard response to the no evidence motion for summary judgment met the requirement of rule i that evidence must be produced raising a genuine issue of material fact.
the court of appeals held that brewer pritchard response to the motion for summary judgment failed to point out evidence as it related to the challenged elements of the causes of action,including the conspiracy claim the court observed that the response globally stated facts to support its conclusions as it sees them and cited to the record in support of those facts,but made no effort to connect any of the facts to the challenged elements of the causes of action.the court concluded that it was not required to search the record without guidance from brewer pritchard to determine whether it has produced evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact on the elements challenged by johnson and chang.
while brewer pritchard response might have been more specific in addressing the elements of its conspiracy claim,the response was not wholly inadequate under rule i.that rule provides 
i motion.after adequate time for discovery,a party without presenting summary judgment evidence may move for summary judgment on the ground that there is no evidence of one or more essential elements of a claim or defense on which an adverse party would have the burden of proof at trial.the motion must state the elements as to which there is no evidence.the court must grant the motion unless the respondent produces summary judgment evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact 
this court comment to rule explains that a respondent to a motion under paragraph i need not marshal evidence,but may point out evidence that raises a fact issue on the challenged elements 
this comment is intended to inform the construction and application of the rule to defeat a motion made under paragraph i,the respondent is not required to marshal its proof its response need only point out evidence that raises a fact issue on the challenged elements.the existing rules continue to govern the general requirements of summary judgment practice.a motion under paragraph i is subject to sanctions provided by existing law tex civ.prac.and rules.
brewer pritchard response to the motion for summary judgment was divided into several sections by a number of headings and.none of these headings identified the conspiracy claim by a specific reference to that claim.a large part of the response was devoted to a recitation of facts in the record,and one of the in the facts section is settlement and referral loss of the money.within this subsection,brewer pritchard detailed evidence that it says indicates that chang benefitted from johnson fee agreement with henry king.after identifying this evidence,brewer pritchard asserted in a single sentence,t hese facts clearly evidence a sloppy but,thus far effective scheme to funnel half of the referral funds through johnson and lasco and then,back to chang.
another section of the response is entitled there are genuine issues of material fact that preclude the granting of summary judgment.within a subsection of this part of the response,brewer pritchard states that b p claims of conspiracy,conversion,actual and constructive fraud,and negligence,are all based on chang breach of his fiduciary duty to b brewer pritchard then sets forth argument and authorities in support of its position that chang owed a fiduciary duty.within that discussion is brewer pritchard contention that third parties are also liable if they knowingly aided and assisted in the breach of the fiduciary duty.in succeeding paragraphs,brewer pritchard points to facts that it contends establish a fiduciary duty and breach of that duty.
whether brewer pritchard adequately pointed out evidence relating to challenged elements of the conspiracy cause of action is a close question.but we conclude that
