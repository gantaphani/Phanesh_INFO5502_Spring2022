prosecutors are public fiduciaries.they are servants of the people,obliged to pursue impartially in each case the interests of justice and of the community as a whole when conflicts arise that compromise their ability to do so,they can and should be recused.but defendants bear the burden of demonstrating a genuine conflict in the absence of any such conflict,a trial court should not interfere with the people prerogative to select who is to represent them.
in this and a companion case,hollywood superior court may,cal th,d,wl we consider the extent to which involvement in literary and cinematic endeavors may give rise to conflicts requiring recusal.here,the lead prosecutor moonlighted as a novelist,writing a fictional account of a heroine prosecutor decision whether to try a rape case involving an intoxicated victim.the novel was published shortly before her scheduled prosecution of petitioner massey harushi haraguchi for the rape of an intoxicated victim.in this case,as in hollywood,the trial court found no conflict.in opinions issued the same day,the same court of in part on the unusual and distinctive facts of these its independent judgment and in both cases reversed and ordered recusal.thus,we must also consider the standard for reviewing a trial court decision finding,or rejecting,the existence of a disqualifying conflict.
we reaffirm our rule that recusal motions are reviewed under a deferential abuse of discretion standard.furthermore,we reverse the court of appeal here based on its failure to grant appropriate deference and based on the presence in the record of evidence sufficient to support the trial court conclusion that no disqualifying conflict existed and no unlikelihood of a fair trial had been proven.
factual and procedural background 
on september,an information was filed charging haraguchi,inter alia,with rape of an intoxicated person,subd.a.
on april,haraguchi moved for recusal of deputy district attorney joyce dudley and the santa barbara county district attorney office based on dudley publication of a novel,intoxicating agent,in january,as well as her subsequent promotion of the book.haraguchi alleged,inter alia,that the book contained a lengthy fictional account of the rape of an intoxicated person the fictional trial,like haraguchi,was to begin around april a character in dudley novel bore a resemblance to haraguchi and the facts of the fictional rape in other respects mirrored another unrelated case in which dudley had obtained only a hung jury.haraguchi further contended that dudley was marketing the book locally,selling it in at least two local bookstores,conducting a book signing at one of the bookstores and at the women center of the university of california at santa barbara,and doing an april,interview with a santa barbara television station about the book.in addition,the santa barbara independent published a favorable review of the novel.
haraguchi contended dudley publication and promotion of her book was influencing how she handled his case.according to haraguchi counsel,w hen i took over the haraguchi case from prior counsel,dudley first unsolicited remarks to me were that no other prosecutor at the da office would take a case like haraguchi,but that she could win it.counsel argued that dudley remarks were similar to views in the novel expressed by the protagonist,santa barbara county district attorney jordon danner jordon was positive another would want this case and,she knew the victim would feel betrayed if she handed it off.dudley,intoxicating agent intoxicating agent.counsel further declared from the first time the undersigned talked to dudley about this case,she said it would not settle.she has refused to enter into any settlement negotiations and has summarily informed the court that the case will go to trial.based on this,haraguchi contended dudley interest in promoting her book was compromising her willingness to seek justice impartially.
in opposition,dudley disputed these allegations.she submitted a declaration denying that intoxicating agent was based in any way on the haraguchi case,that its publication or publicity were in any way coordinated with the haraguchi case,that haraguchi counsel had accurately represented her remarks,or that her decisions had in any way been shaped by the book publication.
the trial court denied haraguchi motion,finding there was no conflict warranting recusal.it concluded publication of the book around the same time as haraguchi trial was coincidental the rape case described in the book was unrelated to haraguchi case the alleged physical resemblance of a character not the fictional rapist to haraguchi was not prejudicial and,to the extent there might be any conflict,it was not so grave as to render it unlikely haraguchi would receive a fair trial.
the court of appeal granted haraguchi petition for a writ of mandate.declining to defer to the trial court because the trial court had no precedent to guide it,the court of appeal held recusal was required as a matter of law.it concluded dudley views of the justice system,as reflected in the novel,were so as to raise a reasonable possibility she would not exercise her discretion evenhandedly,and her interest in promoting her book presented a conflict so great it was unlikely haraguchi could receive a fair trial.however,the court of appeal declined haraguchi further request to recuse the entire office.
we granted review to consider both the standard of review and its application to a prosecutorial recusal motion in these circumstances.
discussion 
standards for a motion to recuse 
section sets out the standard governing motions to recuse a prosecutor such a motion may not be granted unless the evidence shows that a conflict of interest exists that would render it unlikely that the defendant would receive a fair trial,subd.a.the statute articulates a test i is there a conflict of interest and ii is the conflict so severe as to disqualify the district attorney from acting hambarian superior court cal th,d,quoting people eubanks,supra,cal th at,d.
we uniformly have held that a motion to recuse is directed to the sound discretion of the trial court,and its decision to grant or deny the motion is reviewed only for an abuse of discretion.people vasquez cal th,d,hambarian superior court,supra,cal th at,d,people eubanks,supra,cal th at,d,people superior court greer,supra,cal d at.the abuse of discretion standard is not a unified standard the deference it calls for varies according to the aspect of a trial court ruling under review.the trial court findings of fact are reviewed for substantial evidence its conclusions of law are reviewed de novo and its application of the law to the facts is reversible only if arbitrary and capricious 
the court of appeal in this case gave no deference to the trial court findings of fact or its application of the law to those facts it offered two justifications for this departure this case involved novel circumstances and was thus a matter of first impression and the court of appeal had an independent interest in eliminating errors before trial.neither persuades us to create an exception to the choice of the abuse of discretion standard.
with respect to this case being a matter of first impression,we note that virtually every case is,to a greater or lesser degree,a matter of first impression.the difference between each new set of facts and those that previously have been ruled upon may be small and immaterial or large and momentous.where on the continuum a new set of facts lies is to some extent in the eye of the beholder a court of a mind to reverse may always point to those elements of a case that it views as distinguishing and on that basis assert the issue is a matter of first impression.the court of appeal proposal that cases of first impression should receive independent review thus offers no meaningful boundaries and wholly undermines the trial court role in evaluating recusal motions in the first instance.
as an alternative ground for exercising independent review,the court of appeal pointed to its interest in policing conflicts of interest and addressing potential errors at the earliest opportunity,rather than on direct review or in habeas corpus proceedings.its concerns are valid we have acknowledged that pretrial recusals serve the important function of avoid ing conflicts that might lead ultimately to due process violations and hence to reversals or mistrials.people vasquez,supra,cal th at,d.these concerns justify vesting trial courts with broad discretion to protect against procedural unfairness by ordering pretrial recusals,as we emphasized in vasquez and in people superior court greer,supra,cal d at pages.they may also justify allowing the decision to grant or deny recusal to be reviewed pretrial through mandamus,as it was here.
the court of appeal concerns do not,however,support a change in the standard of review.the assertion that pretrial review should be de novo rests on the unspoken assumption that independent review will reduce the rate of appellate courts given a free hand to weigh the evidence and disregard trial court findings will reverse erroneous rulings and eliminate error more often than they reverse correct rulings and thereby introduce error.that assumption is unfounded.we review rulings on motions to recuse only for abuse of discretion precisely because trial courts are in a better position than appellate courts to assess witness credibility,make findings of fact,and evaluate the consequences of a potential conflict in light of the entirety of a case,a case they inevitably will be more familiar with than the appellate courts that may subsequently encounter the case in the context of a few briefs,a few minutes of oral argument,and a cold and often limited record.see people roldan,supra,cal th at,d,abuse of discretion standard reflects the trial court superior ability to consider and weigh the myriad factors that are relevant to the decision at hand people conner,supra,cal d at,trial court is in the best position to assess the impact of events giving rise to possible prosecutorial conflicts people jenan th,d abuse of discretion standard applies because the trial court is in the best position to make relevant conflict determinations.nothing suggests to us that de novo review of pretrial recusal motions would increase the accuracy of such determinations.as the trial court has the superior vantage point,the abuse of discretion standard applies.
ii.application to 
we turn to the application of the recusal statute to the lead prosecutor in haraguchi case.as noted,section sets out a test for determining whether recusal is appropriate.under the first part,a court must determine whether a conflict exists,that is,whether the circumstances of a case evidence a reasonable possibility that the da office may not exercise its discretionary function in an evenhanded manner.people conner,supra,cal d at,accord,people eubanks,supra,cal th at,d.if such a conflict exists,the court must further determine whether the conflict is so grave as to render it unlikely that defendant will receive fair treatment during all portions of the criminal proceedings.people vasquez,supra,cal th at,d,italics omitted.thus,the first half of the inquiry asks only whether a reasonable possibility of less than impartial treatment exists,while the second half of the inquiry asks whether any such possibility is so great that it is more likely than not the defendant will be treated unfairly during some portion of the criminal proceedings.
existence of a conflict 
the trial court concluded there was no conflict that would justify recusal of dudley.it based that conclusion on a series of factual findings the publication of her book appears to be coincidental to haraguchi circumstances.the circumstances related in her book factually do appear to relate to haraguchi circumstances,and the fact that there may be similarities to some other case that dudley tried in the past does establish any conflict as far as haraguchi case is concerned.whatever dudley feelings about the results of that prior prosecution are,those feelings would be present with or without the existence of the book and do create any conflict of interest.
in reversing the trial court and concluding that dudley had to be recused as a matter of law,the court of appeal found two alleged conflicts.first,it reasoned that publishing a book linked to the haraguchi case gave dudley a financial incentive to prosecute the case,as the publicity might increase her book sales.second,it concluded the fictional prosecutor jordon danner views could be imputed to dudley and,more generally,that the views about the criminal justice system as a whole reflected in the book interior world could be imputed to dudley,and that those views rendered it unlikely haraguchi could receive a fair trial.
in reasoning that dudley had a disqualifying financial conflict of interest because of links between intoxicating agent and the haraguchi case,the court of appeal disregarded the trial court findings that intoxicating agent was not factually based on haraguchi,its publication was not intentionally timed to coincide with haraguchi,and its publicity was not linked to haraguchi.each finding was supported by substantial evidence.in a declaration,dudley asserted under oath that intoxicating agent publication was not timed to coincide with haraguchi trial her declaration likewise asserted that she did not base the plot on the haraguchi case,and a comparison of the book with the haraguchi record fully supports that assertion 
the trial court was entitled to credit dudley declaration.likewise,review of the evidence in the record confirms the trial court conclusion that haraguchi failed to establish any interconnection between his case and the promotion of intoxicating agent none of the promotional materials submitted by haraguchi in support of his recusal motion allude in any way to his case.we thus are required to accept,as was the court of appeal,the findings,supported by substantial evidence,that t he publication of her book appears to be coincidental to haraguchi circumstances and that t he circumstances related in her book factually do appear to relate to haraguchi circumstances.
the trial court findings that the rape case in intoxicating agent was not based on and was factually dissimilar to the haraguchi prosecution are significant.because there was no meaningful factual connection between the two,publication of the book created little incentive for dudley to handle the haraguchi prosecution any differently than she otherwise would have.that is,while a prosecutor literary career might benefit generally from publicity attendant on successful prosecutions or plea bargains,there is little reason to conclude such a second career would have distortive effects on the incentives to try,settle,or dismiss any particular unrelated case.dudley would not gain from insisting on pressing forward with a case whose merits might otherwise suggest a different disposition,rather than settling or dismissing it and devoting prosecutorial resources to another case with a better chance for a favorable outcome.thus,whatever financial incentives her novel might have created for dudley,those incentives were not likely to alter how she handled the haraguchi case people eubanks,supra,cal th at,d,holding that financial incentives tied to a particular case that might skew the charging or plea bargaining decisions in that case create a cognizable conflict.
as a further basis for recusal,the court of appeal concluded dudley personal views about the criminal justice system,as reflected by intoxicating agent,would preclude haraguchi from receiving a fair trial.in the world of intoxicating agent,as the court of appeal interpreted it,defendants are villainous,defense attorneys are manipulative schemers,and prosecutors are heroes.moreover,the court of appeal directly attributed the views of the fictional prosecutor,jordon danner,to dudley.
however,as the trial court correctly recognized,dudley views about her role as a prosecutor,and her ability to fairly and impartially represent the interests of the people,are unaffected by and largely independent of whether a fictional character in a novel she wrote might not embody the prosecutorial ideal in the eyes o
