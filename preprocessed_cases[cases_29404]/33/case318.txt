three years ago,we upheld the district court imposition of rule sanctions against john curry for filing an answer and counterclaim that i denied certain facts that curry client,krull electric company,previously had admitted in companion litigation and ii asserted a frivolous counterclaim for which curry never provided any evidentiary support,despite the frequent opportunities to do so during the underlying litigation tortuous road to trial.divane krull electric,cir hereinafter divane i.we remanded the case to the district court to determine the appropriate amount of sanctions,vacating the district court initial blanket award of attorney fees and costs because it necessarily included some amount that did not directly result from curry sanctionable conduct.id.dissatisfied with the district court decision on remand,curry appeals the sanction award once again,arguing this time that the district court abused its discretion by ignoring certain elements of our mandate and disregarding governing principles in fashioning an appropriate award.because the district court acted within its discretion in reducing the amount of the original sanction award by a figure representing a reasonable estimate of what the plaintiffs attorney fees and costs would have been absent curry sanctionable conduct,we affirm.
the sanctions were imposed in a case that began in october,when william divane,et,known collectively as the electrical insurance trustees,filed a complaint against defendant krull electric company claiming that the defendant owed them delinquent contributions under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement cba.for ease of later explanation,we will refer to this case as krull electric ii.specifically,in krull electric ii,the trustees alleged that krull electric was an electrical employer employing electricians pursuant to an october letter of assent that krull electric had executed to a cba originally entered into between local of the international brotherhood of electrical workers and the electrical contractors association of the city of chicago.under the terms of the cba,krull electric as an employer agreed to pay certain wages and to file a monthly payroll report and make corresponding monthly contributions to the trustees as the duly appointed representatives of local and the association to cover certain fringe benefits for krull electric employees.the trustees alleged that tan electrician employed by krull electric and husband of its president,pamela testified in a september deposition taken in a related case,which is explained below that he had been working forty hours a week for the company.this was news to the trustees krull electric had stopped making contributions in october,filing monthly payroll reports that claimed that no contributions were due because no clock hours had been logged by any of its electricians.citing provisions of the cba and its related agreements,which granted the trustees the power to demand and collect delinquent contributions on the fund behalf,the trustees brought suit under erisa and the labor management relations act to recover the delinquent funds.
krull electric denied liability,claiming it had no payment obligation because it was no longer a signatory to the cba,and filed a counterclaim alleging that the trustees demand for payment constituted a violation of section of the lmra.et prohibiting the collection of payments without the requisite provisions of services or benefits.in its answer,krull electric denied knowledge of various cba and provisions,denied knowledge that tan lee had testified to working forty hours a week,and although it admitted that it had not made any contributions since october,denied that it had any obligation to make them.it asserted four affirmative defenses that it was not bound by any agreement to pay contributions that the trustees suffered no loss that the amounts claimed by the trustees were excessive and that the trustees demands for payment were unlawful.in its corresponding counterclaim,krull electric explained why it was no longer obligated to make contributions despite its october assent to the cba krull electric alleged that in october,local determined that the company was no longer a signatory of the cba.and since the trustees knew or should have known of local determination,their demand to compel payment violated the lmra.
krull electric denials and counterclaim allegations frustrated and confused the trustees.first,the denials directly contradicted admissions the company had made just months earlier in response to another,related complaint the trustees had filed against krull electric.in that case,which had been pending before judge kocoras since april,the trustees claimed that krull electric had been underreporting the amount of hours tan lee had worked each week for the years and in order to minimize the amount of contributions the company was responsible for making under the cba.since it was filed first even though it is discussed second here,we will call this case krull electric i.the trustees krull electric i complaint had set forth some of the same cba and provisions that were alleged in krull electric ii.but in its krull electric i answer,the company had admitted knowledge of these provisions and to being a signatory to the agreement.tellingly,krull electric filed a motion on may,days after filing its answer in krull electric to amend its krull electric i answer in order to remove its admissions regarding its knowledge of the cba provisions and to refute its status as a signatory.judge kocoras denied the motion.second,it was in the course of discovery for krull electric i that tan lee deposition had been taken,revealing the hours worked that formed the core of the trustees cause of action in krull electric ii.and as such,the trustees were perplexed over how krull,as a party in krull electric i,attended the tan lee deposition and was entitled to the same copy of the deposition transcript that the trustees had credibly claim lack of knowledge over what tan lee had testified to.finally,at pamela lee deposition on may,the trustees inquired into the factual underpinnings of the counterclaim namely,the alleged local determination.over objections by curry,pamela claimed she did know what local might have done in october and,strangely,that if she did,the information about it was privileged.after the deposition,the trustees informed curry that if he could not provide support for krull electric counterclaim allegations,they would seek sanctions.
curry never did.he deposed several local members,but never was able to drum up any support for the notion that the union had repudiated its agreement with krull electric.so on september,the trustees sent curry a motion requesting that he withdraw the counterclaim and amend his answer by october,or face sanctions.judge lindberg denied the motion to strike,noting that by alleging the october repudiation by local,krull electric had raised an issue of fact.but the court warned curry that if he could not substantiate his claim,he would face sanctions.discovery concluded,and the case went to bench trial in december.in his trial brief,curry advanced a couple of new arguments as to why the company was not obligated to pay contributions as required by the cba.finding these arguments as equally unsupported by the evidence as the october repudiation allegation,the district court found in favor of the trustees and awarded just over in damages.
in proceedings,the trustees renewed their rule motion,requesting the court to award as a flat sanction.simultaneously,they filed a fee petition against krull electric under erisa provision.in a march,order addressing both motions,the district court first found curry conduct sanctionable,observing that the answer and counterclaim had been filed without any evidentiary support or reasonable inquiry and were intended for the improper purposes of incurring unnecessary delay and needlessly increasing the costs of litigation.as such,curry sanctionable conduct had infected the entire proceeding,pressing an otherwise straightforward,routine,and,for that matter,meritorious case because,after all,krull electric never was able to produce any viable defense to the trustees claim all the way to trial,imposing en route undue burdens on the trustees and the court.as a sanction,the district court ordered curry to pay a penalty to the court,and,should krull electric not be able to satisfy its judgments,to pay the roughly in attorney fees and in costs prayed for by the trustees in their erisa fee that the practical effect and perhaps targeted goal of curry obstructionism was the avoidance of any realistic possibility of the trustees recovery from krull electric,which had by then claimed insolvency and seemed likely to enter bankruptcy proceedings.in setting the amount of the fee award,the district court considered and rejected krull electric numerous objections to the trustees fee petition,including claims that the trustees attorney billing rates were unreasonable and the time requested was excessive.
dissatisfied,curry filed a rule e motion seeking to alter or amend the court sanction award,essentially repeating the arguments he advanced in opposition to the trustees rule motion and fee petition the first time.in an april,order,the district court refused to address the only new argument curry the court had in fact already stricken the counterclaim back in june that argument was available to curry at the time he filed his original response.but the court did proceed to modify the judgment.having determined that circumstances now made clear that krull electric would not be able to satisfy the judgments entered against it,the court dispensed with contingencies altogether and ordered curry to pay the trustees all attorney fees and expenses incurred after may,date of the offensive total of in fees and in costs.in the court opinion,this amount was an appropriate sanction for curry conduct and was warranted for effective deterrence.
on appeal,we upheld the district court imposition of rule sanctions against curry,rejecting his procedural and substantive challenges.divane i,at.but in evaluating the sanction in light of the rule mandate in subsection c that sanctions be limited to the least amount sufficient to deter repetitious conduct being an award of reasonable attorney fees and other expenses be limited to those directly resulting from the sanctionable conduct,we could not accept that all of the awarded legal expenses were warranted.id.at see also.c.we remanded the case so that the district court could set a more appropriate amount,noting that it was in the best position to determine which of the trustees legal costs were the direct result of the sanctionable conduct.id.
in remanding,we added a cautionary note to the district court,which explained that a proper award would include,for example,any research into the sole legal issue raised by curry counterclaim,but that it could not include such activities as the cost of deposing witnesses who would have been deposed without regard to the frivolous counterclaim.id.at.moreover,we observed that we could see no reason why the sanctionable denials in the answer would cause the trustees to incur additional legal expenses since those denials were directly at odds with admissions made in companion litigation.id.
on remand,curry seized upon our cautionary language as an explicit endorsement that the district court evaluate each specific entry in the fee petition in setting the appropriate award.moreover,he read our language questioning whether any additional fees could result from contesting denials in an answer that had been admitted elsewhere to mean that we had conclusively held unrecoverable any fees claimed to have resulted from the sanctionable answer.as this left only the sanctionable counterclaim,he scoured the fee petition objecting to any entry that did not specifically reference it and it alone.as a result,he struck all but two entries,which totaled in fees.apart from his objections,curry advocated for a period of discovery during which he could depose the trustees counsel and gain access to their individual timesheets,which in his opinion were the only evidence of contemporaneous timekeeping capable of clarifying the reports and conclusively establishing the time spent addressing his sanctionable conduct.he demanded that at the conclusion of this additional discovery the court hold an evidentiary hearing before ruling on an appropriate award.
viewing his latest procedural requests against the protracted procedural history of this case and its related proceedings,the trustees argued in response that granting the request for additional discovery and an evidentiary hearing would do nothing more than create another battlefield for curry war of attrition,one that the court need not endorse or participate in.in any event,they asserted that their time descriptions were adequate and that discovery of individual timesheets would aid the district court in its analysis.the difficulty in separating recoverable from nonrecoverable fees was curry to insufficient procedures or a failure to satisfy the trustees burden to substantiate their fee request,but was instead a byproduct of curry sanctionable conduct.the denial that krull electric was no longer bound by the terms of the cba an argument up until trial based solely on the counterclaim allegations so pervaded discovery and the pretrial proceedings that the trustees were unable to separate by individual time entry that time spent litigating against the counterclaim from that time spent prosecuting their own case.to illustrate,they responded to many of curry objections to their individual time entries on the report,setting forth how each challenged entry directly related to curry sanctionable conduct.moreover,they argued that krull electric only practical defense to the action was to delay the course of the litigation,which curry accomplished by asserting the baseless counterclaim and obstructionist answer.absent this sanctionable conduct,the trustees argued that the company would,at the least,have been forced into favorable settlement terms since krull electric had no viable defenses to the trustees claims as born out by the meritless arguments asserted in its trial brief.but because of the time the trustees spent battling against curry stonewalling tactics,krull electric was essentially allowed to liquidate its assets,preventing any meaningful recovery by the trustees.thus,the trustees stood by their claim to the entire amount originally awarded.
only after additional prompting by the court to come up with some portion attributable only to the counterclaim did the trustees capitulate.they pointed to the fees they had been awarded in prosecuting a similar straightforward erisa case and argued that those fees,be deducted as a fair benchmark of what it would have cost them to prosecute this litigation against an opponent who was unwilling to violate rule.the court agreed,but deducted not the eventually awarded which reflected deductions,but the that the trustees had requested in that fee petition.so it reduced the original amount of the sanctions,by,to arrive at.moreover,the district court agreed with curry position that in our cautionary note we had determined that no additional fees could have been generated in response to the answer sanctionable denials.the court estimated that of the fees that were not attributable to the estimated figure of the trustees base prosecution costs were attributable to other nonrecoverable aspects of the case,litigating against the denials,and thus further reduced the award by,arriving at.as for costs,the district court reduced the original requested by percent,since the fee award represented percent of the original requested for fees.so it added in costs to the running total,bringing the sanction award to.finally,the district court added an additional in attorney fees generated in litigating the rule motion through remand,representing of the total amount requested,the reduction representing the amount of time on remand the trustees had spent arguing that the sanctionable denials resulted in additional fees an estimate based on the observation that approximately of the trustees briefs addressed that argument.
not case is back before us.curry argues that the district court chosen methodology was an abuse of discretion and,for that matter,that had the district court conducted anything short of a over each of the recorded entries,it would have likewise abused its discretion.in the alternative,since the trustees refused to meet him on the battlefield,curry argues they are in dereliction of their duty to substantiate their fee request and thus entitled to no award at all or at least,only to the he admits directly resulted from his sanctionable conduct.in addition,he asserts a number of objections to the reasonableness of the entire fee request itself namely,that the hours submitted were excessive and that the rates were unreasonably high.finally,he argues that the award should have been further reduced based upon numerous equitable principles most notably,that the trustees failed to mitigate their damages and that the district court did not properly take into account his ability to pay the fine assessed.curry remaining challenges have been considered by the court,are meritless,and warrant no discussion here.
a request for attorney fees should not result in a second major litigation.hensley eckerhart,d.despite this admonition,fee litigation has become a significant burden on the federal courts.as we have previously observed,fee litigation can turn a simple civil case into two or even more case on the merits,the case for fees,the case for fees on appeal,the case for fees for proving fees,and so on ad infinitum,or at least ad nauseam.ustrak fairman,cir.given the burdens this litany of fee litigation imposes upon the courts,we have granted wide latitude to district courts in setting awards of attorney fees,for neither the stakes nor the interest in uniform determination are so great as to justify microscopic appellate scrutiny.id.generally,a district court will only abuse this discretion when no reasonable person could have taken the same view it adopted.bright land,cir.
the same holds true for awards of attorney fees as rule sanctions.in general,the district court enjoys broad discretion in setting a sanction award that it believes will serve the deterrent purpose of rule.in an effort to deter future conduct,it may impose a flat sanction,it may strike offensive pleadings,may direct the offending party to pay the other party reasonable attorney fees.in the latter case,rule is not a statute in the sense that the loser pays.mars steel cont.bank,cir.instead,rule ensures that each side really does bear the expenses of its own the proponent of a position incurs the costs of investigating the facts and the law.see also johnson chesterton,cir.but if the court determines that an award of attorney fees will serve the deterrent purpose of rule,it has an obligation to award only those fees which directly resulted from the sanctionable conduct.c a.this ensures that the proponent of a sanctionable position ultimately pays the costs resulting from it,serving a dual purpose of deterrence and restitution,while avoiding blanket,which would have the tendency to overcompensate the opponent and penalize the proponent.
in practice,this proves to be an inexact science.essentially,the analysis is a matter of causation.this is apt since we have already analogized rule litigation to tort law,having opined that it establishes a new form of negligence,where one owes a duty to one adversary to avoid needless legal costs and delay.mars,at citing in re central ice cream,cir t he rule speaks of reasonable prefiling inquiry,the language of tort law.and hays sony,cir rule defines a new form of legal malpractice.carrying the analogy further once a violation of this duty has been established,a claimant must still show how its damages resulted from that violation.as with tort law,there are easy cases and hard ones.if a plaintiff files a baseless complaint,it is fairly simple for a district court deciding upon an award of attorney fees as a rule sanction to determine which fees resulted from the plaintiff conduct they are those that the defendant spent answering the complaint and defending against it.this scenario is the of rule cases.the task becomes more complicated with multicount complaints or multiple defenses intertwined around similar operative facts,some of which are sanctionable,some not.think of these cases as complex litigation.but just as tort law has developed various mechanisms to allow innocent plaintiffs to recover from negligent defendants even if it is difficult,if not impossible,to prove that all of the plaintiff injuries resulted from the defendant conduct,so too has the law of fee litigation developed to address these more complex scenarios.
in deciding upon a fee award in a case where a plaintiff has only partially prevailed,a court must apportion the award according to the results actually achieved.hensley,at.perhaps a victorious plaintiff will have succeeded on only some of his claims for relief,in which case the district court has an obligation to adjust the award downward to account for time spent on unsuccessful claims.in hensley,the supreme court outlined the framework for the district court analysis factually unrelated claims are treated as separate lawsuits,and therefore if the plaintiff loses on such a claim he is not to be reimbursed for the attorney fees allocable to it.ustrak,at discussing hensley.in this scenario,a fee applicant should have maintained and provided records identifying the general subject matter of his time expenditures,which will enable a reviewing court to identify distinct claims.see hensley,at.but where the plaintiff claims of relief involve a common core of facts or are based on related legal theories,so that much of counsel time will be devoted generally to the litigation as a whole,making it difficult to divide the hours expended on a basis,the district court should focus on the significance of the overall relief obtained by the plaintiff in relation to the hours reasonably expended on the litigation.ustrak,at quoting hensley,at.if the latter is applicable,n o exact calculation of the time reasonably required to prepare and litigate a case if that case had been confined to its meritorious issues is possible.id.at.the amount is an elusive counterfactual,and thus relegated to the domain of best estimates.id.finding that the best estimate of the cost of prosecuting plaintiff sole meritorious claim amid five other unsuccessful ones would have been half as great as it turned out to be.
we see no reason why hensley should control under rule directly resulting standard.for that matter neither do the parties.the more pressing question is where the relationship between the trustees bare prosecution costs and curry sanctionable conduct lies amid hensley distinction between factually unrelated,independent claims and those claims interwoven around a common core of facts or based on related legal theories.a district court is less likely to abuse its discretion in deciding to simply reduce the award to account for limited success,rather than identifying and eliminating specific unrelated hours,in a case where the prevalence of common facts and related themes makes it difficult,if not impossible,efficiently and expediently to pursue the other alternative.see hensley,at.there is no precise rule or formula for making these determinations.the district court may attempt to identify specific hours that should be eliminated,or it may simply reduce the award to account for the limited success.the district court necessarily has discretion in making this equitable judgment.
here,it can not be said that the trustees claim and krull electric counterclaim are factually unrelated.they share a central issue of proof during the relevant time period,was krull electric obligated under the cba agreement to make contributions to succeed on their claim,one of the elements that the trustees had to prove was that krull electric was a signatory to the cba conversely,in order for krull electric to succeed in its own right,it had to prove it was not.in its answer,krull electric first denied that it had any contributory obligations and then asserted this denial as an affirmative defense.it added as another affirmative defense that the trustees demand for payment without obligation was unlawful.these defenses comprised krull electric counterclaim only in pleading the counterclaim,krull electric was required to submit a short plain statement of the facts.krull electric alleged that local had repudiated krull electric signatory status in october no obligation and that the trustees demand for payment violated the lmra unlawful.in addition to the october repudiation allegation,krull electric trial brief presented a couple new factual twists about why krull electric was no longer bound by its earlier assent to the cba.these alternate theories could have provided support for krull electric counterclaim,had krull electric been able to offer up any proof in support.it could not.it was this complete failure of proof,regardless of the theory advanced,that ultimately made the counterclaim sanctionable.restated,if the counterclaim was supportable on any theory,it would not have been sanctionable.but regardless of whether it took the form of the initial october repudiation allegation or those later advanced,the trustees had to refute the central allegation of the sanctionable counterclaim that krull electric was no longer obligated to contribute in order to succeed in prosecuting their case.
this is not to say that a blanket award of all attorney fees incurred in the litigation was justified under rule.indeed,we remanded because it was not.but certainly this case was like those where recoverable claims are closely interwoven factually and legally with nonrecoverable ones.and we can not say that given this interrelatedness,the district court abused its discretion in determining that an analysis of each entry in the petition was overburdensome and unlikely to produce a reliable result.see tomazzoli sheedy,cir i t is generally unrealistic to expect a trial court to evaluate and rule on every entry in an application.
curry would reject this conclusion,arguing that a district court has an obligation to respond to specific objections raised in opposition to a fee petition.see oxford asset mgmt.jaharis,cir.the eleventh circuit has observed that the more specific the objections to a fee application are,the more specific the findings and reasons for rejecting those objections can be.id.at.here,curry asserted boilerplate objections to all but two entries in the fee petition.essentially,they were comprised of one of two categories either he objected to any entry that did not mention the counterclaim specifically,or he objected to line item entries that clearly referred to the counterclaim or motions written in opposition to it,but objected to them because they also included time he opined was dedicated to addressing other tasks.curry would have a point if his sanctionable conduct and the trustees prosecution efforts were demonstrated factually and legally intertwined.keeping this interrelatedness in mind,however,we the district court must curry boilerplate objections were unduly overbroad.the trustees effectively demonstrated this point to the district court in their reply,where they showed how entries that did not reference the counterclaim on their face nonetheless reflected time spent in opposition to it or at the least,time spent litigating the central issue in the case whether or not krull electric was obligated under the cba.nonetheless,even if curry individual objections were nonspecific in the sense that they were fatally overbroad,the gist of them had some merit on remand the district court was charged with the obligation to segregate the recoverable from the nonrecoverable.but curry concerns are addressed by the district court decision to reduce the award they are not offended by the court refusal of curry invitation to do so on an basis.
curry next argues that the district court violated our mandate by simply reducing the fee award instead of deciding upon specific entries in the fee petition.curry reads too much into our opinion.we remanded because we noted that the district court was in the best position to make the decision on fees,having had experience with the parties and the issues advanced throughout the litigation.had we felt otherwise,we had the authority to review the petitions and make our own determination of an appropriate award.see ustrak,at listing cases where appellate courts made necessary adjustments to fee awards without bothering to remand.in remanding,our cautionary notes merely reinforced the district court obligation to segregate out those fees generated as a result of sanctionable conduct.they did not mandate that a particular methodology be employed to achieve that end.
we next address the application of the district court chosen methodology.under hensley,the starting point in a district court evaluation of a fee petition is a lodestar analysis that is,a computation of the reasonable hours expended multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.at.here,that figure was the that the trustees had requested in their initial fee petition submitted under erisa provision.the district court used this number as a base award from which to deduct nonrecoverable fees.curry argues that the district court abused its discretion in using this figure as a starting point without first making reductions for unreasonable hours vague time entries,multiple tasks in single entries,and unreasonably high hourly rates.but the district court had already rejected these same arguments in its march,order,in which it ruled that the hours spent and the rates charged were reasonable.curry did not appeal this aspect of that ruling,and,as such,these arguments have been waived.see moriarty svec,cir.in any event,since no circumstances have changed that would affect the district court initial impression of the reasonableness of the total hours spent litigating the case or the hourly rates charged,we can see no abuse of discretion in the district court refusal to readdress the issue on remand.
curry also challenges the baseline figure by arguing that it still improperly included some amount of fees generated before the filing of the sanctionable answer and counterclaim.looking at the original fee request,curry asserts that just over in fees included in the original petition was generated between october and may.we agree and will subtract from the court baseline figure of.in so doing,we note that curry receives a bit of a windfall from this deduction since the court later subtraction for estimated prosecution costs,which was based on a bare erisa claim taken from filing to judgment,would have by definition accounted for expenses incurred at the outset of the trustees claim that is,between filing the complaint and receiving the sanctionable answer.but in the face of clear the burdensome and inexact task of segregation discussed above is not at issue for the time period before the sanctionable papers were even will make the deduction 
curry main problem with the court chosen methodology is its decision to use the fees incurred by the trustees in another,unrelated erisa case as a benchmark for what their fees would have been in this case had no sanctionable conduct occurred.despite curry protestations,the approach itself is not novel.we have noted that district courts often look to fees awarded in similar litigation for guidance in fashioning appropriate awards.see,tolentino friedman,cir fees charged in other cases used as evidence of attorney market rate people who care rockford bd.of,cir same.here,the district court looked to a recent erisa case prosecuted by the trustees against another signatory to the same cba,divane barnet electric,c,wl.an audit of barnet electric payroll by the trustees accountant revealed inaccurately kept records for fiscal year and,as a result,showed the trustees being owed some in delinquent contributions.there was no dispute that barnet electric was a signatory to the cba or that it was liable to make regular reports and corresponding contributions.instead,the only issue presented for trial was whether the audit revealed unreported overtime hours or merely noncompensable reimbursements.barnet electric was a single issue erisa case at mos
