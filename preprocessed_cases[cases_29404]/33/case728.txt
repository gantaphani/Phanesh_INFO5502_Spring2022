discussion 
standard of review 
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo and therefore make an independent assessment of the correctness of the trial court ruling,applying the same legal standard as the trial court in determining whether there are any genuine issues of material fact or whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a defendant moving for summary judgment meets its burden of showing that there is no merit to a cause of action by showing that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.once the defendant has made such a showing,the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or as to a defense to the cause of action.code civ,subd.p aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,aguilar interinsurance exchange of automobile club superior court th,d moser ratinoff th,d.
plaintiffs raised a triable issue of fact regarding the christensen firm vicarious liability for shapiro alleged acts 
the trial court granted the christensen firm motion for summary judgment on the ground that shapiro acted outside the scope of his authority as a partner of the christensen firm when he participated in the removal and use of cash from laing residence.the trial court erred in doing so.based on the evidence presented,a reasonable trier of fact aguilar,supra,cal th at,d,could find that shapiro acted in his capacity as a member of the christensen firm and at a client request to protect the funds from which the client bail and the christensen firm legal fees would be paid.helping a client arrange bail and ensuring the payment of his firm fees is within the scope of a law partner authority.
a law partnership,as any partnership,is vicariously liable for loss or injury caused to a person,or for a penalty incurred,as a result of a wrongful act or omission,or other actionable conduct,of a partner acting in the ordinary course of business of the partnership or with authority of the partnership,subd.a blackmon hale cal d,black sullivan d.mallen smith,legal malpractice ed.vicarious liability,a law firm,of course,is liable for the conduct of its principals and employees.the principle upon which the liability of a partnership for injuries to a third person rests is the same as that applicable to principal and agent and master and servant.cahill,clementina d,disapproved on another ground in bay development,superior court cal d,fn,see madsen cawthorne d.the rule is based on the policy that losses caused by the torts of employees,which as a practical matter are certain to occur in the conduct of the employer enterprise,should be placed on the enterprise as a cost of doing business.kephart genuity,th,d.

shapiro declared that he represented laing in his private capacity that his activities on behalf of laing were part of shapiro criminal law practice that was separate from his practice in the christensen firm and that the monies he received were payable to him and deposited in his personal bank accounts.on the other hand,there is evidence suggesting a different relationship between shapiro and the christensen firm in connection with this matter.the christensen firm web site promotes shapiro as the head of the firm criminal defense practice.his name is in the firm name.there is a retainer agreement dated april,between laing and the christensen firm relating to the federal criminal charges against laing.that agreement provides,we are pleased that you have decided to retain christensen,miller,fink,jacobs,glaser,weil and shapiro,llp the firm as your counsel.the firm is committed to providing efficient and responsive service to our clients.the retainer agreement is signed by shapiro the retainer agreement also specifies an hourly rate for attorney sara caplan,who,documents indicate,is of counsel to the christensen firm.the christensen firm repeatedly billed laing for over in costs that were due.shapiro used the christensen firm letterhead in corresponding about laing case with the assistant united states attorney prosecuting laing,and the assistant united states attorney addressed correspondence regarding laing case to shapiro at the christensen firm.shapiro identified his affiliation with the christensen firm on the record in at least three hearings in laing case,including one in the central district of california and two in the southern district of new york.shapiro was asked at his deposition whether he represented to the court at the first bail hearing for laing that he was with the christensen firm.he answered,yes.yes,i always do.thus,there is a triable issue of fact with regard to shapiro capacity in his representation of laing 
the summary judgment record also raises a triable issue of fact regarding whether shapiro participation in removing the cash from laing residence was a foreseeable consequence lisa henry mayo newhall memorial hospital,supra,cal th at,d,of the christensen firm representation of laing so that the christensen firm would be liable for the acts of shapiro.the christensen firm retainer agreement specifies a flat fee of shapiro testified that he told laing and laing associates that laing legal fees could run a million dollars.shapiro further testified that it is the general practice of criminal defense attorneys who bill on a fixed fee basis to be assured that they are paid in advance.
at laing initial bail hearing on april,the prosecutor indicated that laing bank accounts could be frozen by the end of that day.the only real property laing owned was a condominium that he inherited from his father worth approximately.nevertheless,shapiro represented to the court at the bail hearing that laing would be able to post a cash bail of that afternoon,if time permitted.the court set laing bail at.shapiro testified that after the bail hearing and at his client request,he met with those associated with laing and told them that laing wanted them to secure property from laing residence,which shapiro knew to include over million in cash.at that time,neither shapiro nor the christensen firm had been paid a retainer.one of laing associates testified that of the cash taken from laing residence was to be used as collateral for laing appearance bond.of that money,was ultimately used to pay shapiro fees.
based on this evidence,a reasonable jury could conclude that shapiro participated in removing the money from laing residence in an effort to help a client of the christensen firm post bail and to ensure that the christensen firm fees were paid or at least indirectly to serve the interests of the christensen firm.both are activities typical of or broadly incidental to the practice of a criminal defense lawyer torres parkhouse tire service,supra,cal th at,d,and therefore sufficient to render the christensen firm liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior.thus,there is a triable issue of fact regarding whether shapiro alleged actions can be attributed to the christensen firm.
moreover,any separate practice by shapiro while he also was a partner in the christensen firm would not necessarily immunize the christensen firm from liability.w here the employee is combining his own business with that of his employer,or attending to both at substantially the same time,no nice inquiry will be made as to which business he was actually engaged in at the time of injury,unless it clearly appears that neither directly nor indirectly could he have been serving his employer.farmers ins.group county of santa clara cal th,d,baptist robinson,supra,th at,d.based on the evidence,we can not say as a matter of law that it clearly appears that shapiro was not directly or indirectly serving the christensen firm.the trial court therefore erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the christensen firm.
plaintiffs failed to raise triable issues of fact on their claims for conversion and breach of fiduciary duty 
because this is an appeal from a final judgment,we have jurisdiction to review the trial court prior grant of summary adjudication on plaintiffs claims for conversion and breach of fiduciary duty.code civ,jennings marralle cal th,d,bono clark th,d.
conversion claim 
the trial court granted summary adjudication against plaintiffs on their conversion claim on the ground that plaintiffs,in effect,failed to identify a definite sum of money received by the christensen firm.plaintiffs argue that the definite sum of money consists of the money that was removed from laing residence that has not been recovered,the precise amount of which is properly for a jury to determine.we reject that contention.
