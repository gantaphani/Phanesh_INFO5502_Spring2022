the united states has petitioned for rehearing in each of the captioned cases to challenge our rulings that permit the sentencing judges on remand to consider a downward departure.we permitted the departure because the combined effect of substantially overlapping offense level adjustments and the increased extent of enhancement of the applicable sentencing range that occurs at the higher end of the sentencing table resulted in the overlapping adjustments adding significantly more time to the sentence ranges than would have occurred if the adjustments had been applied at the lower end of the sentencing table see united states lauersen,cir united states jackson,cir.because we had ruled on our own motion that such cumulative effects departures were available and the parties had not briefed the issue on the original appeals,we granted the government petitions for rehearing,afforded time for briefs,and heard oral argument.we now adhere to our original rulings for the reasons set forth in this opinion.
background 
the facts are detailed in our prior opinions.we recapitulate only the essential facts that bear on the departure issue.
lauersen.niels lauersen,an,was convicted of health care fraud.he submitted false claims to insurance companies by misrepresenting fertility treatments,which were not covered by his patients insurance,as other procedures that were covered.
the district court calculated his adjusted offense level under the sentencing guidelines to be.starting from a base offense level of,see a the court added levels for the amount of the loss,see id.b n levels for more than minimal planning,see id.b a levels for leadership role,id.a levels for abuse of trust,see id.and levels for obstruction of justice,id.the adjusted offense level of in criminal history category i yielded a sentencing range of to months.see id.ch,pt.a sentencing table.the court imposed a sentence of months seven years and three months,the minimum of the applicable sentencing range.
on the original appeal,we upheld the government contention,raised on its,that the district court had erred in not increasing the adjusted offense level by an additional levels pursuant to b b.lauersen,at.that enhancement applies if the offense affected a financial institution and the defendant derived more than in gross receipts from the offense.b b.the revised adjusted offense level of,which we required to be used on remand,yielded a sentencing range of to months.see id.ch,pt.a sentencing table.the additional adjustment increased the minimum of lauersen sentencing range by months four years.
before remanding,we ruled that the additional enhancement creates a new circumstance that might well justify a downward departure.lauersen,at.as we explained,the new enhancement substantially overlapped with the existing enhancement for the amount of the loss because the large amount of money involved in the fraud significantly triggers both of them.id.at.we also noted that in lauersen case,the added adjustment increased the minimum of his sentencing range by four years,a much larger amount than would have resulted if his adjusted offense level had not placed him at such a high level in the sentencing table.although recognizing that the two enhancements did not constitute impermissible,we concluded that the cumulation of such substantially overlapping enhancements,when imposed upon a defendant whose adjusted offense level translates to a high sentencing range,presents a circumstance that is present to a degree not adequately considered by the commission.id.quoting b.for that reason we permitted the district court to exercise discretion to mitigate the effect of the enhancement by making a downward departure.id.footnote omitted.
jackson.james jackson was convicted of fraud offenses involving identity theft employed to purchase valuable items and charge them to his victims credit card accounts.
the district court calculated his adjusted offense level under the sentencing guidelines to be.starting from a base offense level of,see a,the court added levels for the amount of the loss,see id.b k levels for more than minimal planning,see id.b a levels for use of sophisticated means,see id.b c and levels for leadership of an extensive criminal activity,see id.a.with a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,see id.a,b,the resulting adjusted offense level of in criminal history category vi yielded a sentencing range of to months.see id.ch,pt.a sentencing table.the court imposed a sentence of months,the maximum of the applicable sentencing range.
on the original appeal,we affirmed,ruling that the challenged adjustments,although overlapping,did not constitute impermissible.jackson,at.nevertheless,we concluded that,as in lauersen,the cumulative effects of the overlapping enhancements for the amount of the loss,more than minimal planning,sophisticated means,and leadership of an extensive criminal activity,combined with the significant impact of these enhancements at the higher end of the sentencing table permitted consideration of a departure by the district court on remand.see id.at.as we pointed out,most fraud schemes that obtain more than one half million dollars involve careful planning,some sophisticated techniques,and are extensive.id.
discussion 
the government petitions for rehearing challenge the propriety of the cumulative effects departure that we authorized the sentencing judges to consider in lauersen and jackson.the core of the government argument is that each of the two factors that contributed to our allowance of such a departure the aggregation of overlapping enhancements and the increased sentencing effect of an enhancement upon a defendant at the higher end of the sentencing table compared to the effect at a lower expressly prescribed by the sentencing commission.therefore,the government argument continues,they can not constitute a circumstance present in a particular case to a degree not adequately considered by the commission,such as would permit consideration of a departure under b and.we agree with the government premises,but not its conclusion.
there is no doubt,as the government contends,that the commission prescribed that all applicable enhancements are to be aggregated.the commission specified in an introductory section of the guidelines that offense level adjustments are cumulative added together,whether adjustments are from more than one specific offense characteristic within an offense guideline or from different guideline sections,comment.we have regularly recognized that all applicable adjustments are to be aggregated,at least in the absence of impermissible.see,united states martin,cir united states howard,cir.indeed,that principle underlay our agreement with the government claim on its for an additional enhancement in lauersen and our rejection of the defendant challenges to his enhancements on appeal in jackson.
there is also no doubt,as the government further contends,that the commission deliberately constructed the sentencing table so that each enhancement results in an increase in the sentencing range that becomes larger as the adjusted offense level increases.for example,in criminal history category i,a enhancement added at offense level increases the sentencing range minimum by months at offense level,by months and at offense level,by months instead of causing the sentencing range minimum to increase by the same number of months whenever an enhancement increases the adjusted offense levels,the sentencing table causes the sentencing range minimum to increase by approximately the same percentage.with each enhancement,the increase is approximately percent.for example,a enhancement added at adjusted offense level increases the sentencing range minimum by percent at level,by percent and at level,by percent because the sentencing table is structured to have this percentage proportionality effect,the government argues,the fact that lauersen enhancement and jackson various enhancements increase their sentencing range minimums by much more than would have occurred if their unadjusted offense levels were lower could not be a circumstance not adequately considered by the commission.
although the guidelines contemplate the aggregation of applicable enhancements and provide increasing sentencing range increments as the adjusted offense level increases,we continue to believe that when the addition of substantially overlapping enhancements results in a significant increase in the sentencing range minimum as it does at the higher end of the sentencing table,a departure may be considered.what is present to a degree not adequately considered by the commission is the combined effect of the aggregation of substantially overlapping enhancements and the large increase in the sentencing range minimum at the higher end of the sentencing table.we do not doubt that in lauersen case,for example,the commission expected the financial institution enhancement to be added to other applicable enhancements.nor do we doubt that the commission expected,in the general run of cases,that an additional enhancement would increase the sentencing range minimum by many more months for a defendant with a high unadjusted offense level than for a defendant with a low unadjusted offense level.
nevertheless,the commission is unlikely to have considered the combined effect upon sentencing range minimums of every group of enhancements that could be imposed under the guidelines.the guidelines provide for scores of possible enhancements.even if there were only possible enhancements,there would be possible pairings of any two such enhancements where,as in the pending cases,applicable enhancements substantially overlap,we see no indication that the commission adequately considered how serious an effect on the sentencing range minimum would result for a defendant whose unadjusted offense level is at the higher end of the sentencing table.for lauersen,the addition of the financial institution enhancement on top of his enhancement for the amount of loss increases his sentencing range minimum by four seven years and three months to eleven years and three months for jackson,the addition of his three overlapping enhancements on top of his enhancement for the amount of loss increases his sentencing range minimum by three years and eight months,from two years and nine months to six years and five months 
the commission itself has recognized that uniform application of the percentage proportionality structure of the sentencing table is not always warranted.in explaining the percentage proportionality aspect of the sentencing table,the commission noted that it had discovered that proportional percentage adjustments to sentence length are frequently appropriate.united states sentencing commission,supplementary report on the initial sentencing guidelines and policy statements.the plain implication is that the percentage increase in sentences normally resulting when enhancements are added to an offense level are sometimes not appropriate.an aggregation of substantially overlapping enhancements at the higher end of the sentencing table would seem to be the sort of circumstance that prompted the commission to deem the percentage proportionality of the sentencing table to be appropriate frequently but not always.
the government argues that the commission must have intended all combinations of enhancements,whether or not substantially overlapping,to have whatever effect results from the structure of the sentencing table because the commission expressly set a limit on the increase in adjusted offense level that can result from a few specific pairings of enhancements however,the fact that the commission chose to put a ceiling on the combined effect of a small number of pairings of enhancements does not mean that it adequately considered all of the vast number of combinations of enhancements that are possible under the guidelines and intended to preclude a sentencing judge from considering a departure where a combination of substantially overlapping enhancements has a significant effect on sentencing ranges at the higher end of the sentencing table.
the government also argues that a cumulative effects departure,available for adjusted offense levels at the higher end of the sentencing table,perversely rewards a defendant for particularly egregious wrongdoing br.for appellee at.this is an odd use of the concept of a reward.defendants like lauersen and jackson are being given added punishment because of the imposition of overlapping enhancements,and the amount of the added punishment is much longer in months than would have occurred if their unadjusted offense levels had been lower.the cumulative effects departure simply permits a sentencing judge to mitigate the extent of that added punishment,leaving them still subject to more punishment than they would have received if their enhancements had been applied to a lower unadjusted offense level.even if they receive a departure in the sentencing judge discretion,it is unlikely that they will consider a slight reduction in an additional punishment to be a reward.
finally,the government contends that a cumulative effects departure for overlapping enhancements at the higher end of the sentencing table threatens to erode the entire guideline system and that system core goal national uniformity among similarly situated defendants.br.for appellee at.we think this contention substantially overstates the impact of this departure.preliminarily,we note our doubt that national uniformity is being achieved under the sentencing guidelines.although each guideline is applied to all defendants within its coverage,mechanisms such as departures authorized by the guidelines and various other circumstances are markedly reducing whatever uniformity of results might have been expected.
for example,as the commission itself has reported based on the most recent data,downward departure rates vary from a low of percent in the eastern district of kentucky to a high of percent in the district of arizona.see united states sentencing commission,report to the congress downward departures from the federal sentencing guidelines report.moreover,the government itself is responsible for much of the lack of uniformity.substantial assistance departures,available only upon the government motion,see,accounted for percent of all downward departures,report at,and the rate of such departures varied from above percent in five districts to below seven percent in five districts,id.at.in addition,apart from substantial assistance departures,government initiated departures accounted for more than one third of all other downward departures.id.at.
furthermore,the government charging decisions and presentations of facts contribute to many sentences that are markedly not uniform.to cite just one recent example within our circuit,one defendant convicted of viewing child pornography on the internet,who had not attempted to approach any children,received a guidelines sentence of ten years,see united states sofsky,cir,and another defendant convicted of distributing child pornography over the internet,who had solicited for sexual purposes a person he thought was a girl,received a guidelines sentence of just under four years,see united states maneri,cir.see also united states,cir rejecting departure despite lack of nationwide uniformity attributable to regional variations in prosecutors practices.
wholly apart from these and other anomalies that pervade guidelines sentencing,we think the government apprehension about the consequences of permitting a cumulative effects departure for overlapping enhancements at the higher end of the sentencing table is considerably overstated.in the first place,not many combinations of enhancements will be substantially overlapping,although the two enhancements at issue in lauersen will normally be an overlapping pair.second,the departure is available only at the higher end of the sentencing table.third,the extent of the departure can only diminish,and not eliminate,the added punishment caused by the overlapping enhancements.finally,the decision whether to depart,and the extent of the departure,if made at all,remain within the discretion of the sentencing judge.under these circumstances,there is no realistic threat to erode the entire guideline system.
