a jury convicted defendant stacey miller on two counts of distributing five grams of cocaine base,and the district court sentenced him to months imprisonment,followed by eight years of supervised release.the district court granted two continuances prior to trial and appointed backup counsel for miller,because his attorney was suffering from serious health problems.miller appeals the district court decision not to grant a third continuance when his lead counsel was hospitalized two days before trial and his backup counsel felt unprepared to try the case alone.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
background 
in may,police initiated a series of undercover buys from mark winfield,a suspected drug dealer in madison,wisconsin,as part of an ongoing investigation.on may,undercover officer bernard gonzalez encountered miller in winfield apartment,where gonzalez purchased a quantity of crack cocaine from winfield.gonzalez did not know miller at that time.on may,gonzalez again contacted winfield to arrange another purchase of crack cocaine at winfield apartment.winfield told gonzalez to go to the apartment,where winfield guy was waiting to sell the drugs to gonzalez.when gonzalez arrived,miller was present again and this time miller sold the drugs to gonzalez.detectives subsequently showed gonzalez several photos of miller,and he identified miller as the man in the apartment on may and may.
officer gonzalez arranged two more buys from winfield and miller on the afternoon of may,both of which were conducted by,or in the presence of,miller in winfield apartment.both men were subsequently arrested and indicted for various charges.in particular,the government charged miller with two counts of distributing more than five grams of cocaine base in violation of a and b,to which miller pleaded not guilty.the district court appointed attorney james cooley to represent miller.winfield pleaded guilty prior to trial and is not directly involved in this appeal.
the district court scheduled miller trial for november,but on that morning,cooley informed the court that he was unable to proceed due to health problems.cooley,who suffers from clinical depression,requested a continuance of two weeks in order to recover and be prepared for trial.the district court granted the continuance immediately and set the trial over until december.one week before december,however,cooley moved the court for a further continuance to december,due to his continued health problems.in that motion,cooley noted that attorney krista ralston,a colleague of cooley,had been brought in on the case and would be able to take over if cooley was still too ill on december.the motion indicated that miller had been fully informed about cooley illness and that he wished to proceed as the motion proposed instead of acquiring new counsel.finally,the motion noted that ralston could not proceed until the week of january.
rather than grant only a one week continuance,the district court entered an order on december,resetting the trial for january,and appointing ralston as backup counsel.the court noted,specifically,that there was no real assurance cooley would be able to proceed on december and that a longer continuance would accommodate the possibility that ralston would need to take over as substitute counsel.the district court also noted that ralston needed time to adequately prepare for miller defense.the court gave cooley until december to reply as to whether the january,trial date was acceptable,and he responded affirmatively.
between and january,ralston checked with cooley on a daily basis as to how he was proceeding on miller case.because ralston believed cooley health was again normal,she did not actively prepare to take over as lead counsel.the two attorneys,however,planned to spend the weekend prior to miller trial completing preparations and meeting with miller in jail.ralston did meet with miller at the jail for approximately two hours on saturday,january,but cooley did not appear.ralston learned very late that evening that cooley had been found unconscious in his car that morning and had been hospitalized.
ralston spent much of that night with cooley wife at the hospital but was unable to speak with cooley,until a very brief conversation some time on sunday.cooley had been intubated and heavily medicated,making any substantive conversation impossible.ralston contacted the prosecution to explain the situation,and the government provided ralston with a list of its witnesses,explained each witness role in the case,and explained the testimony the government expected to obtain from each witness at trial.the government witness list totaled seven people gonzalez,the undercover officer who bought the drugs from miller winfield,miller former,who described their ongoing drug relationship and miller role on may two phone company representatives presenting records of miller and winfield cell phone calls miller probation officer the case detective who took custody of the drugs and transported them to the crime lab and the chemist who determined the drugs constituted cocaine base.
on the morning of trial,ralston explained cooley hospitalization to the court,informed the court that she was unprepared to try the case alone,and requested another continuance.the government did not object.the district court,however,denied the continuance,noting the history of the case,the prior continuances granted due to cooley health,and the district court understanding that ralston was supposed to have been working with cooley to prepare for trial precisely because cooley health was suspect.the court also pointed to the fact that a second jury pool had come to the courthouse,a jury had been selected,and both parties witnesses were present and ready for a short trial.
as a result,the trial was conducted on january.the government presented six of its seven witnesses on january and the seventh witness,plus a brief rebuttal witness,on january.miller presented three witnesses on the morning of january as well,and the case concluded before the lunch hour that day.during the trial,the district court prohibited ralston from calling three alibi witnesses because neither she nor cooley had included their names on the notice of alibi,as required by federal rule of criminal procedure a.cooley had filed an appropriate alibi notice,naming robert morgan and carleton higgins as alibi witnesses,but had only sent the prosecution a letter mentioning the three,additional witnesses.while morgan testified that he saw miller in chicago on may,higgins was reportedly on his way to the trial but failed to show up and,thus,did not testify on miller behalf.the jury did hear testimony,however,from two government witnesses regarding statements miller made that indicated he planned to provide false alibi witnesses.
the jury deliberated for a few hours that afternoon and returned a guilty verdict on both counts.the district court subsequently sentenced miller to months in prison,followed by eight years of supervised release.miller now appeals the district court denial of a third continuance on january.miller also raised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim on his direct appeal,but chose wisely,at oral argument,to reserve that claim for a petition.our decision,therefore,is limited only to his claim that the district court abused its discretion by not granting the requested continuance.
we review the district court denial of a continuance only for an abuse of discretion and a showing of actual prejudice.united states avery,cir united states schwensow,cir.while adherence to a trial date once set is a worthy goal,myopic insistence on proceeding when faced with a valid request for a continuance is not appropriate.united states farr,cir.we have developed,therefore,several factors to determine whether a further continuance is justified the amount of time available for preparation the likelihood of prejudice from denial of the continuance the defendant role in shortening the effective preparation time the degree of complexity of the case the availability of discovery from the prosecution the likelihood a continuance would have satisfied the movant needs
