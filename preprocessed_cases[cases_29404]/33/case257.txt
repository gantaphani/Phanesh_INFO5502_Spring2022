plaintiff,geoffrey fieger fieger,appeals the district court dismissal of his civil rights action challenging the refusal of certain michigan supreme court justices to recuse themselves from cases in which he is involved.we affirm the district court decision to dismiss fieger challenge to the justices past recusal decisions.we reverse the district court decision to dismiss fieger challenge to the constitutionality of michigan recusal rule.
background 
this appeal arises out of what the district court described as the acrimonious and dialogue between fieger,a former gubernatorial candidate and michigan trial lawyer,and several justices of the michigan supreme court.fieger has been an outspoken critic of the michigan supreme court,of the justices have made public remarks regarding fieger.claiming bias,fieger sought the recusal of four of the corrigan,clifford taylor,robert young,and stephen markman collectively,the justices in two appeals that were pending before the michigan supreme court in cases involving his clients.in one of those cases,gilbert daimlerchrysler,a jury awarded fieger clients a substantial verdict.after the verdict was affirmed by the michigan court of appeals,the michigan supreme court granted leave to appeal,then reversed the trial court judgment entered on the verdict,thus causing fieger to lose his entitlement to contingent fees.in the other case,graves warner brothers,a judgment favorable to fieger clients was reversed by the michigan court of appeals.the michigan supreme court later denied the plaintiff application for appeal,again causing fieger to lose his entitlement to contingent fees.although fieger was trial counsel in both cases,he did not argue either case at the appellate level.
before rulings were issued on the recusal motions in gilbert and graves,fieger and his clients filed an action in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan gilbert ferry,claiming that they were entitled to a fair hearing on the recusal motions before an impartial tribunal.after the justices denied the recusal motions in the two state court cases,the federal district court dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the basis of the doctrine gilbert ferry,d,the gilbert case.the district court explained that,because the plaintiffs had unsuccessfully raised the same due process arguments in their motions for recusal filed in the state court cases,the federal court could not find that the plaintiffs due process rights were violated without also finding that the justices wrongly decided the motions for recusal.id.at.this court initially affirmed the district court dismissal of the lawsuit on grounds.gilbert ferry,cir.on rehearing,however,this court vacated the portion of its previous opinion,citing the supreme court recent decision in exxon mobil saudi basic indus,d.gilbert ferry,cir.in exxon mobil,the supreme court held that the doctrine is limited to cases brought by losers complaining of injuries by judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.exxon,at.because fieger and his clients filed their federal action before entry of judgment in the two parallel state court cases,this court held that,under exxon mobil,the doctrine did not preclude the district court review of the plaintiffs claims regarding the justices interlocutory orders denying the plaintiffs motions to recuse.the court nonetheless upheld the dismissal of the plaintiff federal lawsuit on both and collateral estoppel grounds.gilbert,at.
in the meantime,on his own behalf,fieger filed this action in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan fieger ferry,the fieger case.he did so in response to the district court suggestion in the gilbert case that i f fieger believes he has a viable claim,he may file a separate suit where his due process interests,whatever they may be,form the primary question presented.gilbert,d at.in this,the fieger case,fieger alleged that the justices deprived him of his constitutional rights by expressing public,personal,political,and professional animus toward him,by refusing to recuse themselves from cases in which he was involved,and by actively pursuing disciplinary proceedings against him before the attorney grievance commission.invoking,fieger asked the court to enter a declaratory judgment that the defendants,and each of them,has violated the constitutional rights of the plaintiff as alleged.he also asked the court to enter a judgment declaring that the michigan supreme court interpretation of the state recusal rule was unconstitutional.finally,he asked the court to enter a judgment declaring that michigan recusal rule either permits the state court administrator to assign a judge of another court to hear and decide a motion to recuse a supreme court justice or,in the alternative,is unconstitutional.
the district court dismissed feiger case on grounds.despite fieger allegation that t here is no parallel state proceeding,nor any decision or order of a state court which would divest this court of jurisdiction under the doctrine,the district court determined that it could not enter a declaratory judgment that the defendants,and each of them,has violated the constitutional rights of the plaintiff without sitting in review of the state court implicit judgment that fieger constitutional rights were not violated by the justices failure to recuse themselves.the district court also rejected fieger challenge to michigan recusal rule,refusing to second guess the michigan supreme court interpretation of its own rule.finally,the district court rejected fieger facial challenge to the state court recusal rule,finding such challenge to be inextricably intertwined with the final judgments of the michigan supreme court.in the words of the district court 
the substance and language of the complaint make clear that plaintiff constitutional challenge is not general at all rather the complaint factual and legal allegations are exclusively limited to the manner in which plaintiff believes the justices violated his rights or the rights of his clients by refusing to recuse themselves.plaintiff factual allegations are entirely specific to the justices political censure of him and their rejection of his motions for recusal.more conspicuously,plaintiff legal claims are limited to the alleged injury to his constitutional rights caused by the justices decision not to recuse themselves.indeed,the very manner in which plaintiff frames the issue presented by his putative challenge betrays his intention to relitigate issues that were prominent in the state proceedings.certainly,there may be situations where a portion of a complaint stating a general challenge may be permitted to proceed even though the general thrust of the complaint presents an challenge.however,where,as here,a complaint is devoid of any legal or factual claim that is independent of previous state court proceedings,the doctrine requires dismissal.

ii.michigan recusal rule 
michigan court rule mcr governs the disqualification of judges in civil proceedings,providing,in pertinent part,as follows 
a who may raise.a party may raise the issue of a judge disqualification by motion,or the judge may raise it.
b grounds.a judge is disqualified when the judge can not impartially hear a case,including but not limited to instances in which 
the judge is personally biased or prejudiced for or against a party or attorney.
c procedure.
ruling.the challenged judge shall decide the motion.if the challenged judge denies the motion,
a in a court having two or more judges,on the request of a party,the challenged judge shall refer the motion to the chief judge,who shall decide the motion de novo 
b in a court,or if the challenged judge is the chief judge,on the request of a party,the challenged judge shall refer the motion to the state court administrator for assignment to another judge,who shall decide the motion de novo.
fieger maintains that the michigan supreme court does not follow the procedures set forth in mcr c for review of a judge decision not to recuse himself or herself from a case.he contends that,by failing to follow such procedures,the michigan supreme court violates the constitutional guarantee to due process.in his complaint,he asks the court to enter a declaratory judgment that the word judge in mcr includes a justice of the michigan supreme court,thus making the review procedures applicable to the michigan supreme court.in the alternative,fieger asks the court to declare that the rule is unconstitutional,both on its face and as applied.
iii.the doctrine 
in rooker fidelity trust,the supreme court held that a federal district court may not review a state court decision for alleged federal law error.such holding was reaffirmed sixty years later in district of columbia court of appeals feldman,d.in feldman,the court wrote 
l ower federal courts possess no power whatever to sit in direct review of state court decisions.if the constitutional claims presented to a united states district court are inextricably intertwined with the state court denial of a claim in a judicial proceeding then the district court is in essence being called on to review the decision.this the district court may not do.
id.at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the principles enunciated in rooker and feldman have become known as the doctrine.as clarified in exxon mobil,application of the doctrine is confined to cases brought by losers complaining of injuries by judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.exxon mobil,at.as stressed in exxon mobil,i f a federal plaintiff present s some independent claim,albeit one that denies a legal conclusion that a state court has reached in a case to which he was a party,then there is jurisdiction and state law determines whether the defendant prevails under principles of preclusion.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted see also mccormick braverman,cir explaining that i n exxon,the supreme court implicitly repudiated the circuits use of the phrase inextricably intertwined to extend to situations where the source of the injury was not the state court judgment hoblock albany county bd.of elections,cir explaining that federal plaintiffs are not subject to the bar unless they complain of an injury caused by a state judgment emphasis omitted davani virginia dep t of,cir explaining that u nder exxon,feldman inextricably intertwined language does not create an additional legal test for determining when claims challenging a decision are barred,but merely states a conclusion if the loser seeks redress in the federal district court for the injury caused by the decision,his federal claim is,by definition,inextricably intertwined with the decision,and is therefore outside of the jurisdiction of the federal district court.in other words,t he key point is that the source of the injury must be from the state court judgment itself a claim alleging another source of injury is an independent claim.mccormick,at.
iv.discussion 
standard of review 
this court reviews de novo a district court dismissal of a case on the grounds that the doctrine deprives it of subject matter jurisdiction.mccormick,at.
although the district court did not address the issue of fieger standing to sue,it issue that may be raised considered at any time.in general,to establish standing to bring suit,a plaintiff must show that he or she has suffered an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d citing lujan defenders of wildlife,d.in the context of a declaratory judgment action,allegations of past injury alone are not sufficient to confer standing.the plaintiff must allege demonstrate actual present harm or a significant possibility of future harm.peoples rights,city of columbus,cir see also littleton,d explaining that p ast exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a present case or controversy regarding injunctive relief golden zwickler,d dismissing the plaintiff action seeking a declaration that a state statute was unconstitutional because,although the plaintiff had been prosecuted under the statute in the past,the likelihood of the plaintiff suffering repeat exposure to the statute was remote and,thus,the plaintiff lacked standing.
here,fieger has alleged that t he threat that the plaintiff can not,and will not,receive a fair hearing before an impartial and independent tribunal is real,immediate,and continuing.compl.at.in,the district court in gilbert noted that fieger has been involved with as many as cases filed with the michigan supreme court.gilbert,d at.in his complaint,fieger alleged that one of the justices the election geoffrey fieger has million in lawsuit awards pending in the state court of appeals.compl.at f.given his litigation history,it is reasonable to conclude that there is a significant,rather than a remote,possibility that fieger present and future cases will someday reach the michigan supreme court.because it is,therefore,likely,rather than speculative,that fieger will again face the recusal issue that he has faced in past cases,we find that fieger has standing to pursue his claim for declaratory relief in this case.
challenge to the justices past actions 
in his brief on appeal,fieger explains that t he only relief which he sought,in the case at bar,was the entry of a declaratory judgment that the failure to provide a meaningful mechanism by which the impartiality of a member of the michigan supreme court could be feasibly and realistically challenged was a denial of due process.pl.br.at.it is unclear from his complaint,however,that fieger so limits his claim.indeed,it is only in the section entitled prayer for relief that the reader of the complaint is made aware that fieger seeks to challenge the constitutionality of michigan recusal rules.his complaint otherwise focuses on the past actions of the justices,including the justices past expression of public,personal,political,and professional animus toward fieger,the justices pursuit of disciplinary proceedings against fieger in reprisal for fieger exercise of his first amendment rights,and the justices refusal to recuse themselves from making decisions concerning fieger.compl.at at.the district court described fieger complaint as being devoid of any legal or factual claim that is independent of previous state court proceedings.dist.op.at at.fieger,moreover,requests in his complaint a declaration that the defendants,and each of them,has violated the constitutional rights of the plaintiff,as alleged.compl.at at.the district court understandably construed such a request as a request for a declaration regarding the past actions of the justices,including the justices refusal to recuse themselves in past cases to the extent,if any,that fieger seeks such a declaration,the district court was correct in finding that precludes the federal courts from reviewing the justices past recusal decisions fieger counsel conceded as much at oral argument.to this extent,therefore,the district court judgment must be affirmed.
challenge to michigan recusal rule 
the more difficult issue is whether the district court was correct in determining that fieger constitutional challenge both facial and to michigan recusal procedures was barred by.fieger challenges the district court decision,arguing that is inapplicable to his claims.among other things,fieger stresses that he is asking the federal court to compel compliance with the constitution in the litigation which poses the continuing conundrum,unresolved,and unresolveable,by the michigan supreme court.pl.br.at.he suggests,in other words,that his litigation is,that it is independent of the two cases already decided,and that he is not complaining of injuries caused by those past cases.fieger counsel reiterated this argument during oral argument.
the district court was not convinced by fieger attempts to redefine the relief sought.finding fieger complaint devoid of any legal or factual claim independent of the previous state court proceedings,the court rejected fieger argument regarding an independent claim,concluding that barred all of fieger claims,however couched,the very were inextricably intertwined with the final judgments of the michigan supreme court.
the district court cited two cases in support of its decision howell supreme court of texas,cir,and chafin west virginia supreme court of appeals,wl,aff,cir.in howell,the fifth circuit considered whether the doctrine barred a plaintiff claim that a texas rule of appellate procedure,governing recusal and disqualification of judges,was unconstitutional on due process grounds.before filing his constitutional challenge in federal court,howell a judge on the texas court of appeals had filed motions requesting that the justices of the texas supreme court recuse themselves from hearing an appeal from an adverse jury verdict in a case that he,as the plaintiff,had brought in state court.when the justices refused,howell filed a action in federal court.the fifth circuit concluded that howell constitutional claim was barred by because it was inextricably intertwined with the state court judgment.
in chafin,the plaintiff likewise challenged the constitutionality of the state recusal rules.before filing suit in federal court,the plaintiff had unsuccessfully requested that certain state supreme court justices disqualify themselves from hearing his divorce appeal.while acknowledging that a ruling to the effect that west virginia recusal rules were unconstitutional would not necessarily mean that the recusal decisions themselves were wrong,the federal district court nonetheless dismissed the claim,finding that the plaintiff constitutional claim was inextricably intertwined with the state court decision.such finding was based not only on the language of the plaintiff complaint,the substance of which was limited to a core allegation that the state justices had violated his constitutional rights by not recusing themselves from the appeal of his divorce,but also on the obvious inability of the plaintiff to establish harm in the absence of decisions by the state court justices.the fourth circuit affirmed the district court decision on grounds.
it is important to note that howell and chafin were both decided before the supreme court clarified the reach of in exxon mobil.indeed,given the lessons taught in exxon mobil and its progeny,the decisions in howell and chafin are not persuasive here.
in feldman,the supreme court explained 
challenges to the constitutionality of state bar rules do not necessarily require a united states district court to review a final state court judgment in a judicial proceeding united states district courts have subject matter jurisdiction over general challenges to state bar rules,promulgated by state courts in proceedings,which do not require review of a final state court judgment in a particular case.
feldman,at.in exxon mobil,the court emphasized that i f a federal plaintiff present s some independent claim,albeit one that denies a legal conclusion that a state court has reached in a case to which he was a party,then there is jurisdiction and state law determines whether the defendant prevails under principles of preclusion.exxon mobil,at.
in mccormick braverman,this court addressed the question of how to differentiate between a claim that attacks a state court judgment,which is within the scope of the doctrine,and an independent claim,over which a district court may assert jurisdiction.at.in the words of the mccormick court 
the inquiry is the source of the injury the plaintiff alleges in the federal complaint.if the source of the injury is the state court decision,then the doctrine would prevent the district court from asserting jurisdiction.if there is some other source of injury,such as a third party actions,then the plaintiff asserts an independent claim.
to the extent that fieger challenges the constitutionality of michigan recusal rules by alleging that t he threat that the plaintiff can not,and will not,receive a fair hearing before an impartial and independent tribunal is real,immediate,and continuing,does not bar his action.to that extent,the source of fieger alleged injury is not the past state court judgments it is the purported unconstitutionality of michigan recusal rule as applied in future cases.such a claim is independent of the past state court judgments.thus,insofar as the district court dismissed fieger challenge to the constitutionality of michigan recusal rule pursuant to the doctrine,the court judgment must be reversed.
conclusion 
for the reasons set forth above,the district court judgment of dismissal is affirmed to the extent,if any,that fieger challenges the justices past recusal decisions.the district court judgment of dismissal is reversed to the extent fieger challenges the constitutionality of michigan recusal rule.the case shall be remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
i concur in the majority opinion,but write separately to more fully explicate plaintiff standing to challenge michigan recusal rule.in my view,plaintiff has established standing to sue both in his own right,and on behalf of his present and future clients.
three elements comprise the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing injury in fact,causation,and redressibility.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.a plaintiff can establish injury in fact by showing that he suffered an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.defenders of wildlife,at.internal citations and quotations omitted.where a plaintiff seeks declaratory judgment,he must demonstrate a substantial controversy,between parties having adverse legal interests,of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.golden zwickler,d citations omitted.
plaintiff contends that the rule violates his own due process rights inasmuch as he stands to suffer the deprivation of his property interest in fees and in his client base,and of his liberty interest in practicing his chosen profession,absent any prior procedural review.see pl.br.at alleging significant possibility of future harm in the form of loss of substantial income compl.at at claiming violation of his right to pursue his chosen profession free from reprisal for exercising his first amendment rights this doubtless constitutes a cognizable injury to legally protected interests.see singleton wulff,d loss of income constitutes injury in fact to physicians conn gabbert,d acknowledging that the liberty component of the fourteenth amendment due process clause includes some generalized due process right to choose one field of private employment.a substantial controversy exists in this case,characterized by the significant possibility of harm to plaintiff economic and professional interests in the future.see peoples rights,city of columbus,cir.
the significant possibility of future harm here is born of the justices past construction and application of the michigan recusal rule.see littleton,d p ast wrongs are evidence bearing on whether there is a real and immediate threat of repeated injury.see also city of los angeles lyons,d it is the reality of the threat of repeated injury that is relevant to the standing inquiry,not the plaintiff subjective apprehensions.the immediacy and reality of the threat of future harm flow from the fact that many of plaintiff cases have been appealed to the michigan supreme court,and that notwithstanding the acrimonious and dialogue between plaintiff and the justices,the justices have declined to recuse themselves from consideration of those appeals.additionally,plaintiff continues to represent clients before michigan tribunals,and to undertake representation of new clients.zwickler,at.finding no controversy of sufficient immediacy and reality in a challenge to a law criminalizing distribution of anonymous handbills given the l
