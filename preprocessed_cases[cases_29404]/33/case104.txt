edward king appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment to his former attorney lawrence fox in a dispute over fox fees.see king fox,civ,wl,dist.lexis.king argues that the district court erroneously dismissed his collateral estoppel claim,that the fee agreement at issue was substantively unconscionable,and that the district court bases for granting summary and improper.because of ambiguities in new york law regarding client ratification of attorney fee agreements,we certify three questions relating to that issue to the new york court of appeals.we retain jurisdiction so that,upon receiving a response from the new york court,we may rule on this appeal.
background 
relationship between fox and king 
in,appellant edward king became a member of lynyrd skynyrd,a rock band that achieved great success in the and whose music is still well known today.while a member of lynyrd skynyrd,king played guitar and several of the band biggest hits,such as the southern anthem sweet home alabama.the band,and albums each went gold,and mca signed lynyrd skynyrd to an exclusive recording agreement in.joint appendix but eventually the band hard partying and physically violent internal conflicts became too much for king to bear.one night in may,when lynyrd skynyrd was on tour,king quit the band and left the tour,telling only the road manager about his decision.
under lynyrd skynyrd recording agreement with mca,king was entitled to writer and artist royalties,because he had both written and performed songs for the band.while with the band,king received a weekly salary of around,in addition to writer royalties,which he continued to receive after he left,through may.however,king artist royalties,along with those of the other lynyrd skynyrd members,had been used to buy out the band former manager al cooper for million.king did not receive artist royalties while he was with the band,nor did he receive them after he left.
in august,in need of money,king consulted with new york entertainment lawyer allen grubman about the status of his artist royalties.king believed that because the band had been so successful,the buyout of cooper likely was complete,and it was time for him to start receiving his artist royalties.grubman secured for king an advance on his writer royalties,but informed king that he would need to retain a litigator in order to determine his entitlement to artist royalties.grubman collected of the advance he secured for king as his fee,and referred king to his law school classmate lawrence fox for help with the artist royalties issue.grubman did not request any further payment from king.
fox was a litigator by training,but when he first met with king,his practice consisted primarily of personal injury cases,and admittedly he knew nothing about the entertainment field.king explained his predicament to fox and noted that he was not sure exactly how much money he was due to receive from lynyrd skynyrd.he told fox that he suspected he was entitled to his artist royalties,and that there was a log jam somewhere.however,king had no paperwork or documentation specifying his rights under the mca recording agreement to justify this hunch.after their initial meeting,fox investigated king situation by calling ina meibach,lynyrd skynyrd attorney,who informed fox that king was not entitled to anything because he had quit the band,and that king actually owed the band money.meibach also refused to give fox any information on king contract with mca.fox met with king for a second time and notified him that he believed something was wrong,and that he would need to pursue the matter by getting the relevant documentation and perhaps initiating a lawsuit.
at that second meeting,fox discussed his fee with king.at the time,king informed fox that he was in dire financial straits and had no money for a retainer,as a personal injury lawyer,fox was accustomed to working on a contingency basis,so he offered such an arrangement to king,and king was thrilled about that.according to fox,he explained to king that the retainer agreement would give fox of all of king future royalties in addition to the recovery of any royalties past due.king claims that he understood the agreement to cover the accumulated royalties of whenever he was to settle the dispute,but no further or future royalties,
fox testified that the contingency agreement with king was a risky proposition for him,because king had not received any artist royalties in years,because king was not sure exactly what his rights were under the mca agreement,and because meibach was claiming that king owed the band money.however,according to king,fox could not reasonably have thought their agreement was unduly risky,because king had informed fox at their first meting that the band debts had been paid,and because the band had earned more than million annually in both and,one seventh of which king was due to collect,
fox sent a formal contingency fee agreement to king in november which read 
this is a retainer agreement authorizing us to proceed as your attorneys in the lawsuit against lynyrd skynyrd,and ronnie van zant.
our fee for services in this matter will be a contingency fee,based upon any money recovered from the defendants.our fee for representing you will be of the recovery,whether by way of settlement,trial,judgment or other method.you will be responsible for any out of pocket expenses incurred for your benefit.
king signed this agreement.
by february,fox had secured a copy of the exclusive recording agreement between mca and lynyrd skynyrd and its members.the agreement contained a provision allowing king to order mca to pay his royalties directly to him,bypassing the band and its agent,as well as a provision stating that breach by or termination of a band member was not grounds for suspension of royalty payments.fox decided to sue mca on king behalf even though the agreement on its face appeared to entitle king to royalty payments.king filed a complaint on september,mca answered in january,and in april,mca impleaded lynyrd skynyrd manager sir productions,which was claiming that it was entitled to twenty percent of king royalties.according to fox,mca put in a very vigorous defense,to king lawsuit,claiming that king departure from the band ended his entitlement to the benefits of the contract.there was a summary judgment motion in the case,but king deposition was not taken,during the course of the litigation,in may,king writer royalties,which had never been in question,stopped being paid.eventually,in fall,the parties came to a settlement agreement in which mca agreed to pay king everything that he was owed,which totaled,king later settled with sir productions,allowing it to collect percent of the money due to him,
in late fall,when a tentative settlement agreement had been reached but before it had been signed,fox and king had a telephone conversation in which fox mentioned that under the retainer agreement,fox would be receiving of king royalties in perpetuity.king was shocked and surprised by this information,but he put it on the back burner because getting the settlement funds was of the utmost importance to him.king asked fox to send the settlement agreement and the retainer agreement to his wife attorney,john groon,to review.groon did so,and wrote fox with several questions,one of which was whether the retainer agreement entitled fox to fees deducted from future royalty payments.fox replied that the retainer agreement covered all royalty money ed is entitled to resulting from his involvement with lynyrd skynyrd,and urged king to call him if he disagreed.
in this correspondence,fox also emphasized to groon that time was of the essence,and that if king did not sign the settlement agreement with mca by november,fox would have to serve a complaint against sir productions,and mca would deposit king settlement money into court as a stakeholder with the city of new york.if this happened,according to fox,king would be liable for mca attorney fees,the settlement money would not earn interest,and it would take a long time plus a fee on ed behalf to receive the money back from the new york city treasury.groon shared this information with king,and king panicked.his wife was about to have a baby,and he needed the settlement money.he did not want to risk liability for mca attorney fees or his settlement money being tied up in the new york city treasury for years.in fact,the settlement agreement provided that the money in dispute would remain in escrow and would not be deposited into court in the event that the settlement was not signed within sixty days the record indicates that fox misrepresented this fact to groon.true or not,fox statements to groon did the trick king told groon that groon should have no further involvement with the matter including the misunderstanding over fox fees,and he immediately signed and returned the settlement papers.groon died soon afterward.
after the settlement was executed,sometime between thanksgiving and christmas of,king informed fox that he wanted to come visit him in new york to discuss the fee agreement.king testified to the events occurring when he arrived at fox offices.according to king,as he and fox were walking down a long hallway,fox 
pointed to a half dozen crates on the floor against the wall and he said you know what those are i said no.he said those are all the papers related to your lawsuit.and i was blown away.i was overwhelmed.i mean,it was a lot of papers.i mean assuming the boxes were full,i mean,just a lot of work,you know.so we went inside,sat down,and talked a little bit more.and he made comments like he doubted if either he or his staff could be adequately compensated for all the hundreds of hours of work that was put in,pretty much he made me feel embarrassed to bring up the fee arrangement,which i did not do.i fully intended to talk to him about it,i never even brought it up.
indeed,king and fox did not discuss the fee arrangement again until.in the meantime,fox continued to collect of all writer and artist royalties sent to king even though the original dispute had concerned only artist royalties.payments would be sent to fox,fox would deduct his share and forward the balance to king.
in,king asked fox to represent him in another matter.in,king had overdubbed guitar parts on songs that had been recorded by the band in,before king joined them.these recordings,called the muscle shoals masters,were released in,but king had never received any artist royalties for his guitar work.in,fox filed a complaint against mca demanding these royalties,and mca filed an answer in.mca motion to dismiss was denied,a decision the first department affirmed by summary order in.king mca records,dep t.the matter was finally settled in,and mca began paying king all royalties due to him for the muscle shoals masters.fox and king did not discuss a fee for this litigation at its outset both assumed that it was covered under the original retainer agreement,
fox also represented king in a dispute in the late between the estates of former lynyrd skynyrd members.this lawsuit was brought in federal district court in atlanta fox represented king interests and traveled to atlanta for three days,where he worked with king local counsel.fox testified also that he participated in weekly settlement conferences on king behalf until the matter was eventually resolved in or around,
during the pendency of these lawsuits,king brought up the fee arrangement between himself and fox in a telephone conversation in according to king,
fox had said that he fought hard to win back the rights to my royalties,i should be grateful,and he also mentioned in that phone call that his,the fee arrangement was somehow tied in,i do understand the exact language,but it was tied into the stipulation of settlement,and it was approved by the judge or whatever,and he said he could change it even if he wanted to.
king was under the impression that a court order had resulted from the lawsuit against mca obligating him to pay fox the contingency fee,which strongly intimidated him from raising any further issues about fox fees.fox was not questioned about the alleged court order comment under oath.he denies making the comment fox br.at,but makes no citation to sworn testimony to support his denial.king never asked for a copy of the court order.
in,after having learned from fellow band members that it was unusual to be giving anyone a percentage of his writer royalties,king wrote to fox asking him to stop taking his contingency fee from his writer royalties,because those had never been in jeopardy in the first place.between and,fox had collected in writer royalties from king.fox agreed to king proposal and stopped taking king writer royalties,but did not return any writer royalties he had collected to that point.he continued to collect of king artist royalties.
the fee arrangement continued after the conclusion of the muscle shoals and atlanta lawsuits in,and king was undoubtedly aware of its terms.when king tax return was audited,he asked fox confirm their fee arrangement.fox did so in a letter to the irs dated april.moreover,king did not seem to want to conclude his professional relationship with fox.on january,king wrote fox to express his appreciation for all of his help,and added,i anticipate many legal problems in the future s o you be hearing from me 
fox represented king on several small matters in in connection with king band strawberry alarm clock,but other than that,the two had no professional contact in the early.in,while king was undergoing treatment for congestive heart failure,a clerk at mca contacted king to verify his address,and at king request,added his current address to all of his accounts.this transaction resulted in all of king royalty checks being sent directly to king because checks were no longer sent first to fox,fox was unable to deduct his share from king artist royalties.by late,king realized that he was receiving the full share of his artist royalties,and was afraid that he was violating a court order of some kind by denying fox his contingency fee.when fox finally called king to demand his payments on february,king explained to fox that he no longer had the money,and did not contact fox again.king then told the whole story to his new attorney john shackelford,who told king that fox had been taking advantage of him for years by collecting an illegal annuity.several months after king consulted shackelford,he filed this lawsuit.
between and,fox collected in fees from king more than in contingency payments on the two settlements,approximately of king artist royalties,and of his writer royalties,
procedural history 
on june,king filed a complaint against fox,alleging that his original agreement with fox was unconscionable,and claiming breach of fiduciary duty,unjust enrichment,undue influence,conversion,and attorney misconduct.king demanded payment of the royalties improperly collected by fox plus interest,as well as punitive damages and rescission of the fee agreement.fox answered in december and filed a counterclaim for his share of the artist royalties that king had withheld since.in,the district court granted summary judgment on the primary claim,holding that fox had ceased to act as king attorney after,therefore king lawsuit was barred by the statute of limitations governing the fee agreement.king fox,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
while the summary judgment opinion dismissing king claim was on appeal,fox counterclaim for fees withheld by king went to trial before magistrate judge francis in september.at the trial,the only two witnesses were king and fox.the entire scope of their relationship was brought out during the testimony,and the jury was asked to answer four questions,including 
has fox established by a preponderance of the evidence that he and king had a meeting of the minds with respect to the retainer agreement,in that both parties agreed that king would be bound to pay him of all royalties ever after earned by king with respect to compositions and recordings that had any role in the dispute for which fox provided legal services to king 
has fox established by a preponderance of the evidence that the contract was made in good faith without unfairness or overreaching,that is,it was fair,reasonable and fully known and understood by king as fox client 
has fox established by a preponderance of the evidence that his gain from the contingency fee was not so large in proportion to the services he rendered as to make the contract between him and king unconscionable 
the jury deadlocked on questions and,but returned a verdict of no on question the court,after consultation with the attorneys,ruled that the jury verdict on question was sufficient to decide the is,if the jury felt that fox had failed to prove that the contingency fee agreement was not unconscionable,then fox could not prevail on his counterclaim even if he had proved any of the other elements.judgment was entered for king.fox initially appealed the verdict,but later withdrew the appeal.
in january,this court vacated and remanded the district court opinion dismissing king claim against fox on statute of limitations grounds,holding that the evidence tends to prove that fox acted as king lawyer through april.king fox,cir.more depositions were taken after this court opinion,and it became clear that fox indeed had acted as king attorney at least through,if not later,thereby barring fox statute of limitations argument entirely.on remand,the district court once again granted summary judgment for fox,holding that king ratified the fee agreement,and further,that his claim was barred by laches.the district court also rejected,among others,king collateral estoppel and unconscionability arguments.king fox,civ,wl,dist.lexis.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
king appeals the district court grant of summary judgment for fox on several grounds.first,he claims that the verdict for king in the counterclaim trial before magistrate judge francis should have collaterally estopped fox to defend king lawsuit.second,he claims that the original contingency agreement between king and fox was substantively unconscionable and therefore must not be enforced.third,he argues that the defenses of ratification and laches are not applicable here.
we affirm the judgment on the issue of collateral estoppel.however,because new york law is uncertain on whether a client may ratify an attorney fee agreement,generally,and in cases of fraud or unconscionability,specifically,we certify three questions related to those issues to the new york court of appeals.
collateral estoppel 
king claims that the doctrine of collateral estoppel dictates that the counterclaim jury verdict in his favor should bar fox from defending the instant action.
the new york law of collateral estoppel involves a test a party is estopped from relitigating an issue when that issue was necessary to the resolution of the prior action,and the party against whom estoppel is invoked had a full and fair opportunity to contest that issue in previous litigation.pennecom merrill lynch,cir.collateral estoppel is an equitable a matter of absolute right.its invocation is influenced by considerations of fairness in the individual case.id.at.factors to be considered when determining whether there was a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the prior action include the size of the claim,the forum of the prior litigation,the use of initiative,the extent of the litigation,the competence and experience of counsel,the availability of new evidence,indications of a compromise verdict,differences in the applicable law and foreseeability of future litigation.gilberg barbieri.
the district court held that there was no identity of issues between the counterclaim trial and the instant lawsuit,because the counterclaim concerned money that owed to fox and withheld by king between and,and this action concerns fees collected by fox between and.king,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.king notes that the questions posed to the counterclaim jury were not limited to the time period covered by the counterclaim,and that the bulk of the testimony at trial pertained to fox representation of king prior to he argues that when the jurors considered the acceptability of the fee agreement,they must have had the entire scope of representation in mind,and that their decision in his favor should collaterally estop fox to argue that the fee agreement was not unconscionable 
it is indeed possible that the counterclaim jury verdict was based on the entire period of representation.but it also is possible that the verdict was based solely on the time period covered by the counterclaim,especially given that fox did virtually no work on king behalf during that period.we agree with the district court that king has not carried his burden to show with clarity and certainty what was determined by the prior judgment bbs norwalk one raccolta,cir internal quotation marks omitted.therefore,fox is not collaterally estopped to defend against king appeal 
ratification 
the district court held that king claims were barred because king ratified the contingency agreement by accepting its terms and benefits between and.king,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.king asserts that res judicata bars fox from arguing ratification here because fox did not argue ratification at the counterclaim trial.he claims also that he could not have ratified the fee agreement because he was fraudulently induced to do so.finally,king maintains that the agreement with fox was unconscionable and should not be enforced.fox counters that his ratification argument is not barred by res judicata because the counterclaim trial covered a time period and subject matter different from those in the instant action.further,fox argues that the fee agreement was not unconscionable and that no fraud occurred.
we find that fox ratification argument is not barred by res judicata.however,we ask the new york court of appeals for guidance on whether a client may ratify a fee agreement with his attorney during a period of continuous representation in any of three,or where that agreement was perpetuated by fraud or found to be unconscionable.
res judicata 
although king did not raise the issue of res judicata in the district court,there is no absolute bar to the consideration of res judicata claims for the first time on appeal.salahuddin jones,cir.under the doctrine of res judicata,or claim preclusion,a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action.legnani alitalia linee aeree italiane,cir quoting pierre dyer,cir.two causes of action may be parallel but distinct.as this court has explained 
t he fact that both suits involve essentially the same course of wrongful conduct is not decisive nor is it dispositive that the two proceedings involved the same parties,similar or overlapping facts,and similar legal issues.a first judgment will generally have preclusive effect only where the transaction or connected series of transactions at issue in both suits is the same,that is where the same evidence is needed to support both claims,and where the facts essential to the second were present in the first.
interoceanica sound pilots,cir quoting sec first jersey,cir.
as noted above in the discussion of collateral estoppel,the issue being decided at the counterclaim trial concerned fees withheld by king between and.this appeal concerns fees charged by fox between and.the evidence needed to support a ratification claim in the counterclaim trial is different from the evidence needed to support such a claim in this action.in this appeal,fox argues that king ratified the fee agreement between and king knew and accepted the terms of the agreement and before fox had mentioned the alleged court order mandating the fee agreement.at the counterclaim trial,where fox sought fees he was owed between and,fox would have had to argue that king had ratified the fee agreement after fox alleged fraudulent court order assertion.fox ratification defense would not have been relevant at the counterclaim trial,and indeed it was not argued there.because fox was not bound to argue ratification in that proceeding,res judicata can not preclude him from doing so in this appeal 
king claims that he could not have ratified the fee agreement because fox fraudulently convinced him that the agreement was mandated by a court order.fox denies that the court order conversation occurred,although he provides no citation to sworn testimony to support this denial.he argues also that king ratified the fee agreement years before the alleged court order conversation,rendering any alleged fraudulent conduct moot.we must decide whether king ratified the fee agreement,either before or after the alleged fraud occurred.
it is undisputed that the alleged court order conversation did not occur until by then,the fee agreement had been in effect for more than years,and king had asked fox to represent him in a total of three lawsuits.king does not allege that fox deceived him in any significant way between and.he describes the pressure fox put on him to sign the settlement agreement,including fox dubious representations about his ability to recover king funds promptly if king delayed signing,and he complains that fox made him feel guilty by emphasizing all the work that had been done on his behalf.but fox never told king that he was bound to accept the fee agreement in order to go through with the settlement,nor does king allege that fox affirmatively deceived him as to the content or circumstances of the agreement at any time between the signing of the agreement and.king claims that he was not aware that the agreement applied in perpetuity until,but this ignorance did not stem from any alleged fraud on fox part.from,when king learned definitively the nature of the agreement,until when the alleged fraud occurred,king allowed the agreement to proceed,and he does not allege that fox utilized any deception to keep it alive.indeed,he reaped benefits from the agreement by receiving legal services from fox in three cases.
if this were a typical contract case,king eight years of acquiescence in the agreement with full knowledge of its terms between and would be enough under new york law to show that he ratified the agreement.see,benjamin goldstein,fish,dep t holding that a party knowing acceptance of benefits from a contract for more than one year after the agreement was executed constituted ratification,and barred the party from alleging economic duress in the execution sheindlin sheindlin,dep t a party who executes a contract under duress and then acquiesces in the contract for any considerable length of time,ratifies the contract.citation omitted.
however,attorney fee agreements have been held to different,and often higher,standards than ordinary contracts.these different standards seem in part to exist because the courts have traditional authority to supervise the charging of fees for legal services under their inherent and statutory power to regulate the practice of law.first bank brower,citations omitted.under the continuous representation doctrine,the statute of limitations for a client malpractice suit against his attorney is tolled until the relationship is completed.see glamm allen.as the new york court of appeals has explained,the continuous representation rule 
recognizes that a person seeking professional assistance has a right to repose confidence in the professional ability and good faith,and realistically can not be expected to question and assess the techniques employed or the manner in which the services are rendered a client who entrusts his assets to an attorney for professional assistance often faces the same dilemma as the client who entrusts his case to an attorney for possible litigation.in neither instance can the client be expected,in the normal course,to oversee or supervise the attorney handling of the matter,and thus in neither case is it realistic to say that the client right of action accrued before he terminated the relationship with the attorney.
greene greene,see also icahn todtman,nachamie,spizz johns,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,t he client has the right to presume the professional ability and good faith,and realistically can not be expected to question and assess the techniques employed or the manner in which the services are rendered or to jeopardize his pending case or his relationship with the attorney handling that case.quoting glamm,at,at.the fiduciary relationship between attorney and client protects the client from having to file suit against his attorney during the period of time when a client is encouraged and expected to trust that his attorney is acting in his best interests.
although the continuous representation rule prevents the operation of the statute of limitations in an dispute,new york courts have not spoken definitively on whether a client may ratify an agreement during a period of continuous representation,either generally,or if fraud has occurred during that period.in schlanger flaton,dep t,the first department rejected an attorney claim that his client had ratified his allegedly improper conduct because the client had not filed suit until three years after he might have learned of the attorney misconduct.the court held that neither ratification nor laches applied,because the attorney had been the client attorney and advisor until two months before the suit was filed,and even assuming the client had been aware of the attorney misconduct when it occurred,a delay is hardly so excessive as to warrant the imposition of laches ratification.id.at,at.schlanger implies that a client should not be held to ratify his attorney misconduct until the relationship is over,or until the client has been aware of the misconduct for a lengthy period.see also greene greene,dep t,aff,noting that there can be no ratification of an attorney fee agreement unless the client approved the acts of defendants with knowledge that she allegedly had a cause of action against them.
in this case,this court has already held that the relationship was in effect until at least,if not later,see king,and king alleges that he did not learn of fox misconduct until when he consulted with a new attorney.king filed this action less than four months after learning that fox could not have been telling the truth about the alleged court order.
however,at least one court has held that an attorney fee agreement,even when induced by fraud,may be ratified when the client accepts benefits under that agreement.ballow brasted rusin,logan,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.also,we must not forget that king accepted the benefits of the fee agreement for a period of approximately years prior to the alleged fraud.
therefore we are left with several questions relating to the new york law of fee agreements.first,is it possible for a client to ratify such an agreement at all during the course of representation that is,by accepting the terms of the original fee agreement for a period of years prior to fox alleged fraudulent conduct,did king necessarily ratify those terms second,is it possible to ratify an attorney fee agreement if misconduct has occurred during the course of the representation specifically,if king could prove that fox defrauded him in,would this misconduct prevent fox ratification defense,either prior to or after the alleged fraud 
unconscionability 
king has argued also that the original fee agreement he signed with fox was unconscionable.the court believes that there is at least an issue of material fact as to the conscionability of the agreement however,if it is possible under new york law for a client to ratify an unconscionable fee agreement,the unconscionability determination is moot because it is undisputed that king knew of and accepted the terms of the agreement at least between the years and.
the district court held that the fee agreement between king and fox was not unconscionable,stating that a contingency fee was standard throughout the state and country,and holding that s ubstantive unconscionability is not triggered because a contract provision in a case happens to benefit one side.king,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.however,the district court did not apply the test traditionally employed by new york courts to gauge the conscionability of attorney fee agreements,which dictates that 
contingent fees may be disallowed as between attorney and client in spite of contingent fee retainer agreements,where the amount becomes large enough to be out of all proportion to the value of the professional services ren
