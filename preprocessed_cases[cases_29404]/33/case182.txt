this appeal arises from a convoluted procedural history involving intertwined matters we have considered before.this time we must consider our jurisdiction in light of the recent supreme court decision mohawk industries,carpenter,wl.previously,appellant heidi myers appealed a court order enforcing two subpoenas duces tecum seeking various items.we dismissed her appeal for lack of jurisdiction because she had not been found in contempt.see united states search of queen,martinsburg,app x cir search of queen.meanwhile,in a different case,myers was served with a trial subpoena under federal rule of criminal procedure c seeking the same items.she now appeals a contempt citation for failure to produce those items and challenges the court order that she tried to appeal in search of queen for the reasons that follow,we again conclude that we lack jurisdiction and dismiss the appeal 
myers was an attorney licensed to practice in west virginia.on december,she incorporated her law practice into myers law group,pllc.in fall the united states attorney office began investigating myers possible fraudulent billing of the west virginia public defender services.this miscellaneous matter was docketed and assigned to judge frederick stamp,in the united states district court for the northern district of west virginia.
in november,a search team executed a search warrant at myers law office.although many boxes of documents were seized,the team failed to find all the closed case files and electronic records described in the warrant.thus,on november,the investigating grand jury issued two subpoenas duces tecum ordering myers to appear on december,bringing all remaining closed case files,her server,and her backup hard drive on the appointed day,however,myers failed to appear 
instead,on december,myers moved to quash the subpoenas based on the doctrine and privilege.after the district court denied the motion,the government moved for an order directing myers to produce the subpoenaed items to the magistrate judge.on march,the court ordered myers to give the government all subpoenaed items that she considered by april,and to produce all other subpoenaed items to the court by march,for privilege review.
in april,myers produced several boxes of documents to the court for privilege review produced items,but these boxes did not contain all of the subpoenaed items.on april,the district court ordered myers to produce all other subpoenaed items by may,missing items myers moved for clarification because she had faxed a letter to the united states attorney office in february invoking her fifth amendment privilege against with regard to producing the missing items.in turn,the government moved for myers to show cause why she should not be found in contempt.
on june,a magistrate judge conducted a hearing on both motions.he also reviewed the produced items.on july,the magistrate found that some produced items were protected by the privilege and the doctrine.he also found that the fifth amendment protected only personal documents and items created or received before december,when myers incorporated her law practice.
on november,the district court adopted this fifth amendment ruling but concluded that the produced and missing items were not protected by the privilege or doctrine because the government made a prima facie case under the exception.accordingly,the court ordered myers to provide to the government any missing items she admitted were corporate documents and to provide to the united states privilege team the other missing items the privilege team would then review these items and confer with myers.on april,after the government moved for clarification,the district court ordered the magistrate judge to hand the produced items over to the government.
in december,myers appealed judge stamp november,order concerning the missing items.significantly for our analysis,she did not challenge his april,order concerning the produced items possessed by the magistrate judge.on november,we dismissed myers appeal for lack of jurisdiction.see search of queen,app x at.we reasoned that the november,order was not immediately appealable because myers retain ed possession of the disputed documents and ha d not been cited with civil contempt for her refusal to turn them over.id.at.we explained that o rders enforcing subpoenas are normally not considered final and that t o obtain immediate review of such a district court enforcement order,the party to whom it is issued must defy it so that a contempt order,which is considered final,is entered against him.id.at internal quotations omitted 
meanwhile,in june the same grand jury involved in indicted myers on one count of conspiracy to defraud the united states,counts of mail fraud,and twelve counts of wire fraud.the indictment alleges that myers,when appointed to represent indigent clients,submitted invoices to the west virginia public defender services for work not actually performed and charged an incorrect hourly rate under west virginia law for work performed by.this criminal matter was docketed and assigned to judge john bailey in the united states district court for the northern district of west virginia.after the indictment was issued,the grand jury expired and another was not empanelled.
on july,in the criminal matter,the government served myers with a trial subpoena duces tecum under federal rule of criminal procedure c.this subpoena required myers to deliver to the magistrate judge the same missing items requested by the november subpoenas on july,myers moved to quash the trial subpoena and requested a protective order.in january,after a long delay during myers earlier appeal,judge bailey denied the motion to quash.the government then moved for myers to show cause why she should not be found in civil contempt.
on february,the district court held a hearing on the motion.during the hearing,myers attorney requested a contempt order,explaining i t is the only way that i can appropriately confer jurisdiction on the fourth circuit to review the rulings that have been made with regard to the subpoenas.in response,the court found myers in civil contempt and added so that we have a clean record for you to take to the fourth circuit,i would adopt the reasoning set forth in judge stamp opinion dated november,in case number as well as his order of april,in the same case.
on february,the district court issued an order that memorialized the rulings made during the hearing.the court also stayed myers incarceration for thirty days and continued the trial until january.myers now appeals the february,order finding her in civil contempt.
to determine whether we have jurisdiction,we must first clarify what matters could be reviewed in this appeal.myers appeals judge bailey february,order finding her in civil contempt.she concedes that contempt was proper but challenges judge stamp november,order compelling her to produce the missing items for privilege review and his april,order directing the magistrate judge to hand over the produced items to the government.
in maggio zeitz,the supreme court ruled that one who appeals a contempt order may not challenge the order alleged to have been violated but may only challenge whether the contempt order itself was proper.in that case,the petitioner had disobeyed a court order to turn over assets during a bankruptcy proceeding,had been found in civil contempt,and had then challenged the turnover order on appeal from the contempt order.declining to review the turnover order,the supreme court explained that a contempt proceeding does not open to reconsideration the legal or factual basis of the order alleged to have been disobeyed and thus become a retrial of the original controversy.id.at see also united states rylander,holding that the ninth circuit incorrectly allowed a defendant to challenge a discovery order during a subsequent contempt proceeding united states butler,cir affirming a district court barring a defendant from contesting a discovery order during a subsequent contempt hearing.
maggio was later narrowed by united states ryan,u,where the court implied that a discovery order may indeed be challenged during a subsequent contempt proceeding.in that case,the defendant argued that his appeal from a court order enforcing a subpoena duces tecum should be allowed because obeying the subpoena would be unduly burdensome.the court disagreed,reasoning 
if the subpoena is unduly burdensome or otherwise unlawful,one may refuse to comply and litigate those questions in the event that contempt or similar proceedings are brought against him.should his contentions be rejected at that time by the trial court,they will then be ripe for appellate review.
ryan,at applying cobbledick united states,see also mohawk,wl,at suggesting that a discovery order may be challenged on direct appeal from a subsequent contempt order,at least when the contempt citation can be characterized as a criminal punishment.
ryan addressed the tension between its reasoning and maggio in a footnote.noting a different case,the footnote states walker birmingham,is not to the contrary.our holding that the claims there sought to be asserted were not open on review of petitioners contempt convictions was based upon the availability of review of those claims at an earlier stage.ryan,at.walker upheld alabama refusal to allow demonstrators to challenge a preliminary injunction during a contempt proceeding when the demonstrators failed to challenge the injunction before disobeying it.walker,at.thus,ryan ostensibly carved out an exception to walker where one challenges a court order on appeal from a subsequent contempt order and no earlier appellate review was available.see charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure concluding that a sensible reconciliation of the supreme court cases on this point is that the validity of an order can be challenged in a contempt proceeding for violation of the order only if there was no opportunity for effective review of the order before it was violated.we believe this exception should apply equally to maggio,which announced a rule that,for our purposes,can not be distinguished from the one affirmed in walker.
accordingly,maggio and ryan together indicate that an individual appealing a contempt order can not challenge matters other than whether contempt was proper and,unless earlier appellate review was available,the order alleged to have been violated.in this case,myers conceded that contempt was proper.during oral argument,her counsel stated that judge stamp november,and april,orders are what judge bailey found violated in the february,contempt order being appealed this can not be true for judge stamp april,order directing the magistrate judge to provide the produced items to the government.because that order was directed at someone other than myers,she can not have been found in contempt for violating it.as for judge stamp november,order,search of queen shows that earlier appellate review was indeed unavailable.therefore,only that november,order could be reviewed in this appeal.
having determined what we could review if we reached this appeal merits,we now consider our jurisdiction to hear the appeal.with few narrow exceptions,our jurisdiction extends only to appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the united states.see united states juvenile male,cir.generally,a final decision ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.catlin united states.this rule aims to combine all reviewable stages from a proceeding into one appeal and thus to prevent the harassment and cost of interlocutory appeals.see cobbledick,at.
applying this rule,the supreme court has concluded that a party to litigation may not immediately appeal a order see fox capital,the rule is settled in this court that except in connection with an appeal from a final judgment or decree,a party to a suit may not review upon appeal an order fining or imprisoning him for the commission of a civil contempt.doyle london guar.accident,carbon fuel united mine workers of,cir.therefore,because myers has appealed a order issued in litigation brought against her,the rule normally would bar this appeal.see united states johnson,cir holding that fox applies to criminal defendants.myers does not dispute this conclusion instead,she asserts jurisdiction under two exceptions to the rule.
first,myers asserts jurisdiction under the perlman doctrine.in perlman united states,the supreme court allowed an interlocutory appeal from an order directing the court clerk to produce documents that perlman owned and claimed were privileged.the court later reasoned that,without immediate review,perlman would have been powerless to avert the mischief of the order,id.at,because the custodian could hardly have been expected to risk a citation for contempt in order to secure an opportunity for judicial review,ryan,at.accordingly,the perlman doctrine provides that a discovery order directed at a disinterested third party is treated as an immediately appealable final order.church of scientology of ca.united states.myers argues that the perlman doctrine applies here because judge stamp april,order directed a third party to provide the produced items to the government.as we have explained,however,that order falls outside the scope of our review because it could not have been the basis for the contempt order that myers appeals.her argument must therefore be rejected 
second,myers asserts jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine of cohen beneficial indus.loan.although final decisions in typically are judgments terminating an action,cohen held that also encompasses a small set of prejudgment orders that are collateral to the merits of an action and too important to be denied immediate review.mohawk,wl,at quoting cohen,at.that small category includes only decisions that are conclusive,that resolve important questions separate from the merits,and that are effectively unreviewable on appeal from the final judgment in the underlying action.id.at quoting swint chambers county comm n.the supreme court has stressed that these conditions are stringent,will hallock,and that the collateral order doctrine must never be allowed to swallow the general rule that a party is entitled to a single appeal,to be deferred until final judgment has been entered,mohawk,wl,at quoting digital equip.desktop direct.
having appealed a contempt order,myers challenges judge stamp november,order directing her to produce any missing items she conceded were not protected by the fifth amendment and to give all other missing items to the united states privilege team for privilege review in determining whether the collateral order doctrine applies,we address each directive separately.
first,myers was directed to produce any missing items she conceded were not protected by the fifth amendment.although myers insisted that all missing items were protected by the privilege,judge stamp found that the exception vitiated that protection.myers now argues that the contempt order on appeal would be effectively unreviewable on appeal from the final judgment in the underlying action because producing the missing items would irrevocably undermine the privilege mohawk,wl,at internal quotations omitted.
the supreme court recent mohawk decision directly addresses this argument.in that case,the petitioner argued that a district court discovery order implicating the privilege should be immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine.the court explained that,when determining whether an order would later become effectively unreviewable,the decisive consideration is whether delaying review until the entry of final judgment would imperil a substantial public interest or some particular value of a high order.id.quoting will,at.courts doing this analysis should not engage in an individualized jurisdictional inquiry,id.quoting coopers lybrand livesay,but should focus on the entire category to which a claim belongs,id.quoting digital,at.applying this standard to discovery orders affecting the privilege,mohawk acknowledged the importance of that privilege but reasoned that postjudgment appeals generally suffice to protect the rights of litigants and assure the vitality of the privilege because a ppellate courts
