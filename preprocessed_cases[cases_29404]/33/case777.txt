appellant ilene goldberg brought suit against respondents,her former employer music,warner and her former supervisor edward pierson,for wrongful termination.goldberg claimed that she was discriminated against in the terms and conditions of her employment based on her gender,and terminated in retaliation for raising complaints about discrimination.goldberg also claimed to have been terminated in retaliation for blowing the whistle on illegal conduct allegedly committed by pierson,including practicing law without a license.
goldberg moved to disqualify counsel for respondents,mitchell silberberg knupp llp ms k.the ground for the motion was that six years earlier goldberg had consulted with eugene salomon,a former partner with ms k who had left the firm three years prior to the underlying lawsuit.the consultation involved goldberg written contract with warner.respondents and ms k established in opposition to the disqualification motion that the consultation had been brief and informal,and that no one else at ms k had any knowledge concerning either the consultation or any confidential information imparted to salomon.the trial court denied the motion to disqualify.
goldberg contends that it is or should be the law in california,that an attorney presumed knowledge of a former client confidences should cause vicarious disqualification not just of the attorney present firm,but also any firm the attorney passed through after he or she gained possession of confidential information.respondents contend that we should follow the lead of the aba model rules of professional conduct,which permit a firm that employed the conflicted attorney in the past to undertake representation adverse to the attorney former client,as long as the firm can prove no current member or associate is actually possessed of confidential information concerning the client.
we agree with the trial court that an attorney presumed possession of confidential information concerning a former client should not automatically cause the attorney former firm to be vicariously disqualified where the evidence establishes that no one other than the departed attorney had any dealings with the client or obtained confidential information,and affirm.
factual and procedural background 
it is undisputed that goldberg worked as counsel for warner from until december.after her termination,goldberg retained an attorney,peter marx,to advise her with regard to a potential lawsuit.on january and,marx sent letters pertaining to settlement discussions to respondents attorneys,ms k.the letters stated that marx ha d serious concerns about the propriety of ms k representing respondents in this matter.his concerns derive d from the fact that prior to the termination of her employment with warner,goldberg had professional relationships with various members of ms k and indeed ha d worked closely with them on various matters,and also maintain ed friendships with certain members of ms k.as such,those members of ms k are to one degree or another acquainted with the circumstances concerning the termination of goldberg employment,they are privy to information which certainly created the impression of impropriety,at the very least.marx also referred to the fact that goldberg had submitted a screenplay she had coauthored to ms k partner david steinberg.there was no reference to goldberg being a former client of the firm.
in august,the parties agreed to mediation.in a letter to ms k,goldberg new counsel,greenberg glusker fields claman machtinger kinsella,stated goldberg expressly reserves any and all rights she may have to disqualify your firm.as i indicated to you,i am going to consider providing you with some information which may impact your decision to continue as counsel for respondents.in any event,your participation in the mediation will not and shall not be used in any subsequent proceeding to suggest that goldberg has waived her rights or otherwise acquiesced to your firm participation.
in november,the mediation having failed,goldberg filed her complaint against respondents.the complaint included claims for violation of the whistleblower statute,discrimination based on gender,retaliatory termination,wrongful termination in violation of public policy,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and violation of salary provisions of the labor code.there was no contract claim asserted.
ms k filed an answer to the complaint on behalf of respondents in december.
motion to disqualify 
goldberg formally moved to disqualify ms k on december.in her moving papers,she presented evidence that in,while still employed at warner,she was given a written employment agreement to sign.she asked salomon,then a partner with ms k,to advise her with respect to the agreement.she met with salomon for an hour and a half on may,to go over the terms of the agreement.she purportedly disclosed confidential information to him including the nature and term of her employment agreement,her compensation and benefits,disability,termination by warner,her ability to retain,disclose,and use information concerning her employment relationship with warner,scripts and other literary works created by her,the effect of a change in control of warner,expiration of the employment agreement,and warner obligations under state and federal law.she also had other conversations and correspondence with salomon relating to his advice about the terms and conditions of her employment agreement.on july,she sent him a letter and draft of a proposed employment agreement,and promised to send the final agreement for his files.she asked him to send her a bill for his advice,but he refused to do so 
subsequently,goldberg retained ms k to work on various matters for warner,and she did not have an objection to ms k representation of warner in matters that did not conflict with ms k prior representation of her.
opposition 
respondents presented evidence in their opposition that in april,one month prior to goldberg purported consultation with salomon,ms k began legal work on a copyright matter for warner.a formal retention letter between ms k and warner was signed on may.
the executive director of ms k stated in a declaration that there was no record in any of ms k files of goldberg ever having been a client of the firm,and that the policy of the firm was to execute a formal,written engagement letter before taking on legal representation.
adam levin,the ms k attorney who was responsible for the goldberg litigation,stated he had been involved with the matter since january,and that at no time prior to the mediation did any of goldberg lawyers assert that ms k and,in particular,salomon,had represented goldberg in her individual capacity or otherwise mention salomon name.discussions of the propriety of ms k representation of respondents centered on the possibility that goldberg personal and professional relationships with other attorneys at the firm created a conflict.in a letter to marx dated january,levin stated y ou raise purported concerns about this firm representation of warner adverse to goldberg.as we previously discussed,your concerns are wholly unfounded in that this firm has never represented goldberg personally.our past dealings with goldberg solely have been in connection with our representation of warner for whom she sometimes was our client contact,as well as other clients accordingly,there is no restriction ethical,legal or otherwise on our representation of warner adverse to goldberg.on october,at the mediation,levin learned for the first time that goldberg was contending that she had been provided personal legal advice by salomon.
salomon stated in a declaration that he practiced law at ms k from october through october,when he moved to another firm.he denied that he had been retained by goldberg to represent her in her contract negotiations with warner.instead,goldberg told salomon she was going to represent herself in negotiations over the contract,but asked if salomon would talk to her about these agreements generally to get a sense of how warner lawyers dealt with the contract various provisions.he told goldberg he would be glad to talk to her about what she could expect in the course of her negotiations.they primarily discussed what she might expect with respect to the boilerplate issues.salomon never discussed with any other lawyer at ms k what was said in his conversation with goldberg.
prior to the hearing on the motion to disqualify,goldberg sought to submit handwritten notes made at the meeting with salomon for in camera review.these notes apparently somehow made it into the public court file.
trial court ruling 
the court denied the motion to disqualify.at the hearing,the court stated that the only potential basis for disqualification was goldberg contact with salomon,not her personal and professional relationships with other ms k attorneys.the court concluded that there was an relationship between goldberg and salomon even though salomon appeared to be helping her as a friend.the court agreed that if salomon were still with ms k,the firm would be disqualified.however,because salomon had left the firm,there was no need for vicarious disqualification.
in its order,the court specifically found the evidence is undisputed that ms k and salomon never opened a file for goldberg.they never billed her.there are no notes or records in their files about the meeting and no documents were prepared.no telephone calls were made.it was simply a meeting late one afternoon where goldberg and salomon sat down and discussed the meaning of the employment contract she was being offered and what provisions she might request.there is no evidence that salomon talked to anyone about this matter when he was with ms k.and more importantly,he had left the firm approximately three years before this matter began.there is no fear of him talking about the case in the lunch room,or having his files seen by other members of the firm,as he is no longer there.
goldberg filed a petition for writ of mandate for review of the order.by order dated march,the petition was denied,with one dissent.goldberg noticed an appeal.
discussion 
rule e of the rules of professional conduct provides that an attorney shall not,without the informed written consent of the client or former client,accept employment adverse to the client,or former client where,by reason of the representation of the client or former client,the member has obtained confidential information material to the employment.there is no question that an attorney can and should be disqualified for representing a party adverse to a former client where the attorney possesses confidential information that could be helpful to the new client and hurtful to the old.see,henriksen great american savings loan th,d a former client may seek to disqualify a former attorney from representing an adverse party by showing that the former attorney possesses confidential information adverse to the former client.
the courts do not generally inquire into whether the attorney actually possesses confidential information.adams th,d.instead,the substantial relationship test is applied.when a substantial relationship has been shown to exist between the former representation and the current representation,and when it appears by virtue of the nature of the former representation or the relationship of the attorney to his former client confidential information material to the current dispute would normally have been imparted to the attorney or to subordinates for whose legal work he was responsible,the attorney knowledge of confidential information is presumed.rosenfeld construction superior court d,italics added accord city national bank adams th,d adams,supra,th at,d.
in addition,i t is now firmly established that where the attorney is disqualified from representation due to an ethical conflict,the disqualification extends to the entire firm.adams,supra,cal th at,d.w here an attorney is disqualified because he formerly represented and therefore possesses either actually or presumptively confidential information regarding the adverse party in the current litigation,vicarious disqualification of the entire firm is compelled as a matter of law.henriksen great american savings loan,supra,th at,d accord flatt superior court cal th,d,where the requisite substantial relationship between the subjects of the prior and the current representations can be demonstrated,access to confidential information by the attorney in the course of the first representation relevant,by definition,to the second representation is presumed and disqualification of the attorney representation of the second client is mandatory indeed,the disqualification extends vicariously to the entire firm.
there is,however,a recognized limited exception to this conclusive presumption in the rare instance where the lawyer can show that there was no opportunity for confidential information to be divulged.city national bank adams,supra,th at,d accord,american airlines,sheppard,mullin,richter hampton th,d.t o apply the remedy of disqualification when there is no realistic chance that confidences were disclosed would go far beyond the purpose of the substantial relationship test.ahmanson salomon brothers,d.
this limited exception was applied in adams,supra,th,d.the supposedly tainted attorney there had worked for the holliman firm.while he was with the firm,it represented aerojet with respect to advice on land use issues.the attorney in question,however,had nothing to do with that representation.he departed the firm in.a decade later,his new firm,hackard holt,was retained to represent a number of individuals in a suit against aerojet involving release of toxic chemicals and contamination of groundwater.aerojet sought to disqualify the attorney and the hackard holt firm because of the attorney former association with the holliman firm.declarations submitted to the trial court established that the attorney did not perform any work on aerojet matters and had no discussions with the other attorneys at the holliman firm regarding aerojet matters and was not made privy to any information,confidential or otherwise,about aerojet.id.at,d.the trial court ordered hackard holt disqualified.
on appeal,the court acknowledged that i f the attorney himself had been personally involved with the holliman firm work on aerojet matters during his tenure with the firm in the,this appeal would be easily resolved.the holliman firm former representation of aerojet clearly has a substantial relationship to the present lawsuit under the ahmanson salomon brothers,supra,substantial relationship test factual issues are similar if not identical disposal of waste and chemical contamination in and around the aerojet site legal issues are related toxic tort liability and the duty to warn the public and the attorney hypothetical prior work on the case would have placed him in a position to be exposed to confidential information belonging to aerojet.adams,supra,at,d.
because,however,there was no indication of the attorney personal involvement in aerojet matters,nor any direct evidence that he was exposed to client secrets during the time his former firm rendered services to aerojet,the court decided not to extend the doctrine of imputed knowledge and vicarious disqualification to the new firm.adams,supra,at,d.the court believed the case d id not present a standard application of the imputed knowledge doctrine and that the trial court applied the concept in reverse instead of imputation from attorney to the remainder of the firm,the court here ruled that,once a connection was shown between the former firm representation and the issues involved in the current lawsuit,the knowledge acquired by the former firm was imputed back to the attorney,mandating his automatic disqualification even after his departure from the firm,without inquiry as to whether the attorney was reasonably likely to have obtained confidential information.to burden an attorney with presumptive knowledge based solely on his former membership in a law firm which represented the former client,would require a significant extension of the doctrine of imputed knowledge beyond that recognized by any existing case law.id.at,d.
the court explained why it distinguished the situation before it from the situation where the attorn
