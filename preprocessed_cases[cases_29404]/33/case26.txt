this case presents important questions involving grand jury operations and the privilege.because the grand jury investigation is ongoing,our discussion omits a certain amount of detail and by a separate order the decision is being sealed.however,the court anticipates that an expurgated version of the opinion or summary of the key legal rulings will be published in due course.
background.in the course of a grand jury investigation in,a lawyer lawyer i directed his client client a to commit perjury in testifying before the grand jury,after initially advising him to tell the truth.the same lawyer has also represented another client client b who might or might not have some connection with the earlier perjury.in,lawyer i told client a to recant the false testimony.lawyer i did so after consulting with lawyer ii,who represented other clients collectively group c variously connected with client b and with pertinent events.
learning of the perjury,the government is now investigating the possible involvement of others with that perjury and with other possible crimes.the present grand jury summoned lawyer i,and the prosecutor sought to question him about the prior perjury of client a including the involvement of others with that perjury and its subornation.lawyer i refused to answer a number of these questions,saying that answering them would invade client b privilege and the privilege enjoyed by the group c clients.
that questions to lawyer i might invade the privilege of client b is clear but the group c clients are not represented by lawyer i but by lawyer ii who practices independently.however,it was lawyer i position,not contested by the government at this stage,that the two lawyers at the relevant times had a arrangement which allowed them,without waiving the privilege,to exchange confidences that their respective clients may have confided to them separately.
eventually the government moved to compel lawyer i to answer the disputed questions,arguing that the exception defeated the claim of privilege as to both client b and the group c clients.upon lawyer i request,the court notified client b current with lawyer counsel for each of the group c clients.
at the government behest,the district court also directed lawyer i not to reveal to anyone other than his own counsel the substance of the government motion to compel an order the government thought essential to protect against the risk that lawyer i might affect or influence other potential grand jury witnesses.client b objected that under.e a,lawyer i could not be barred from disclosing to client b or anyone else what he lawyer i learned as a grand jury witness or elsewhere.
current counsel for two group c clients also objected to the motion to compel.lawyer ii provided an affidavit describing his representation of the group c clients in addition to other details about his consultations with lawyer i,he said that incident to their joint defense arrangement he had disclosed to lawyer i confidential information received from at least one of the group c clients.
the district court held several hearings and heard arguments as to whether or not the privilege was abrogated.the government also made two ex parte filings whose contents were not made known to opposing counsel a redacted version of one of the filings was,however,supplied to opposing counsel.such ex parte submissions,although surprising to those unacquainted with the practice,have precedent in certain contexts including grand jury matters and privilege claims.see in re grand jury proceedings violette,cir.
the court also considered the government request that it engage in a limited type of in camera inquiry suggested as a possibility by the supreme court in united states zolin,d.in such an inquiry the judge may examine privileged material itself to determine whether it is or remains privileged.the district judge expressed reservations about his capacity,given the complexities of the background events,to conduct such a limited inquiry which would involve the judge in questioning lawyer i and not merely reviewing documents.in the end,the government chose to rest on what it already adduced and abandoned its request for an in camera inquiry under zolin.
thereafter,in march,the district court granted the government motion to compel answers to the government listed questions.requests by client b and one of the group c clients to allow their lawyers to interview lawyer i about the underlying events were denied.the objecting clients then sought access to all of the filings made so far in the district court,including the government ex parte filings.this too was denied in october when the district court issued a memorandum explaining its decisions in more detail.
in the october memorandum,the district judge explained his reasons for concluding that the exception applied.the judge said he was satisfied that the government had made a prima facie showing not only of lawyer i corruption but also,of 
a shared intent by the making the communications the government seeks to use otherwise privileged communications to facilitate corruption and frustration of the grand jury inquiry.
the district judge stressed that he was not finding that any of the clients had in fact corruptly communicated with counsel.he only found enough of a likelihood had been established to justify compelling lawyer i limited only to those lines of inquiry identified by the government.
the district court expressed discomfort with the government bypassing of the zolin in camera inquiry,warning that this might result in a remand.the court also explained its reasons for concluding that the court had authority to forbid lawyer i from disclosing to anyone,including lawyer ii and to client b and the group c clients,what he had been asked in the grand jury or other information pertaining to the subject matter of the grand jury inquiry.
on this appeal,client b and the group c clients,as the alleged privilege holders,have attacked the prima facie standard adopted by the district court and,in the alternative,argued that even this allegedly too lenient standard has not been met.client b also urges that the government and district court were obliged to follow the zolin in camera procedure.finally,the clients say that the order to lawyer i was barred by fed.e and that it was overly broad as well.
the customary standard of review in cases of privilege is that strictly legal questions are reviewed de novo,raw fact findings are reviewed for clear error,and the application of legal standards to specific facts with a measure of deference.see cavallaro united states,cir united states.inst.of,cir we begin with the privilege question,which involves both law and issues,and then return to the rule issue which presents solely a question of law.
privilege.familiarly,the a privilege of a client to refuse to testify or to have his counsel testify as to confidential communications between the two made in connection with the rendering of legal representation,see cavallaro,at see also fisher united states,d wigmore,evidence mcnaughton.it extends as well to communications made within the framework of a joint defense arrangement.in re grand jury subpoena,cir united states bay state ambulance and hosp.rental,cir.
the of several qualifications to the protection where the client sought or employed legal representation in order to commit or facilitate a crime or fraud.specifically,courts have required the privilege challenger to present evidence that the client was engag ed in or was planning criminal or fraudulent activity when the communications took place and that the communications were intended by the client to facilitate or conceal the criminal or fraudulent activity.violette,at 
like the privilege itself,the exception,where employed in a federal criminal case,is effectively a creature of federal common law.see.this means that federal judges start with a core of common precedent reflecting the privilege but also have power to refine and adjust both the substance and procedure in light of reason and experience.see zolin,at.violette,at.the process of development is far from over.
it is often hard to determine whether the relationship has been misused by the client for crime or fraud without seeing the document,or hearing the testimony,as to which the privilege is claimed.to overcome this problem as well as other privilege problems judges have sometimes been willing to review privileged materials by themselves in camera and then decide whether the other side is entitled to it.see,united states jacobs,cir.the supreme court has blessed this procedure in zolin.at.see also united states edgar,cir,cert.denied,d.
zolin also said that a lesser evidentiary showing is needed for in camera review than is needed finally to pierce the privilege,and that upon this showing whether to conduct in camera review is within the trial court discretion.at.for such a review,all that was needed was a factual basis to support a belief by a reasonable person that in camera review of the materials may reveal evidence to establish the claim that the exception applies.id.internal quotation marks omitted.may is a very relaxed test and,as only the judge gets this initial access,properly so.
however,zolin did not answer the question of what level of proof is needed to pierce the privilege itself,at,although it acknowledged that the statement in clark united states,that a prima facie case was the needed showing has caused some confusion.zolin,at.in our own case,the district court found a prima facie showing had been established,but cautiously did not further explain what this meant.we share its caution but are obliged to attempt refinement.
prima facie is among the most rubbery of all legal phrases it usually means little more than a showing of whatever is required to permit some inferential leap sufficient to reach a particular outcome.black law dictionary ed,mcdonnell douglas green,d.here,the outcome is piercing the privilege based on a certain level of proof.this circuit has previously avoided a calibration of that level,violette,at,as has the supreme court,zolin,at,but it is important in this case as to one client.
as we read the consensus of precedent in the circuits,it is enough to overcome the privilege that there is a reasonable basis to believe that the lawyer services were used by the client to foster a crime or fraud the divided on articulation and on some important practical effectively allow piercing of the privilege on something less than a mathematical more likely than not probability that the client intended to use the attorney in furtherance of a crime or fraud.this is a compromise based on policy but so is the existence and measure of the privilege itself.
precisely because of the initial barrier of the privilege,it is very hard for an adversary unaided to show that the privileged communications were themselves corrupt,so the requirements for access can not be set too high.and,if the communications were innocent,the initial look may often not damage the client.in all events,the reasonable cause standard is intended to be reasonably demanding neither speculation nor evidence that shows only a distant likelihood of corruption is enough.
in addition,the privilege is not lost solely because the client lawyer is was certainly true in this case since the lawyer suborned client a perjury.the exception requires the client engagement in criminal or fraudulent activity and the client intent with respect to communications.violette,at.accord,in re grand jury subpoenas,cir,cert.denied,d in re sealed case.if there are contrary views we do not think that they comport with the modern view of the privilege nature and purpose as explained in upjohn united states,d.
an additional limitation on piercing is that it is not enough to find reasonable cause to believe that the client is guilty of crime or fraud.forfeiture of the privilege requires the client use or aim to use the lawyer to foster the crime or the fraud.as rakes explained 
no general rule withdraws the privilege from communications that occur in the same time frame as criminal conduct t he privilege is forfeited inter alia where the client sought the services of the lawyer to enable or aid the client to commit what the client knew or reasonably should have known to be a crime or fraud.
here,we are satisfied that the reasonable cause standard is satisfied as to client 
our assessment,like that of the district judge,is preliminary,reflects no finding that client b acted wrongfully,and is limited solely to the issue whether there is reasonable cause adequate to pierce client b privilege.the compelled testimony of lawyer i or other evidence could turn out to vindicate client b entirely and inculpate someone or no one else.the prima facie case is sometimes assumed to destroy the privilege once and for all once the opponent gains access to the material which is one reason for the zolin procedure.we think that there may well be room for protective remedies if the privilege is initially pierced but this turns out to have been in error.
it should be noted,finally,that the district court initial proposal to examine lawyer i in camera was not a finding that the government had met only the lower threshold under zolin and therefore could only proceed to issue its motion to compel after acquiring additional inculpatory evidence obtained in camera.in its october decision,the district court made quite clear that the government had fully met its prima facie burden needed to overcome client b privilege,and it is this conclusion that we affirm.
the more difficult problem concerns the group c clients.there is scant evidence that these clients purpose in retaining lawyer ii was to use his services in furtherance of a crime or fraud.true,the district judge made a finding quoted above of a shared intent to use otherwise privileged communications to facilitate corruption and frustration of the grand jury inquiry.but his decision points to no facts to buttress this finding,ominously since the government certainly should any such evidence identified in the government briefs.
it is not enough that the lawyer work posed an obstacle to the grand jury perfectly legitimate representation may do this.to pierce the privilege requires that the clients have an intent to misuse their legal representation,by enlisting the lawyer advice to frame their perjury to perpetrate the crime or fraud.violette,at.such evidence may exist as to group c but it has not yet been furnished.
the government relies upon in re sealed case,at,where a client document destruction incident to litigation was treated as undercutting the privilege of communications between it and its lawyers in that litigation.but there,the attorneys represented the client in the very litigation for which evidence had been destroyed,and in hearings in which the client sought to prevent exposure of the destruction,in the course of which they filed false documents and verified their authenticity.id.at.the lawyers were thus justifiably characterized as instrumentalities in the ongoing.id.at.in this case,no such misuse of lawyer ii is shown.
now that client b privilege has been pierced,some of what the government seeks can conceivably be obtained by questions directed to lawyer i tailored to avoid disclosures that would invade group c privilege arguably lawyer b conversations can be reached regardless of what information lawyer i passed on to the group c clients.how far lawyer i may be questioned about the source of the it came from lawyer ii or the group c be more debatable.other difficult questions may also arise 
the government also remains free to ask the district court to make an in camera inquiry under zolin directed to overcoming the group c clients privilege.the government abandoned this quest when it apparently judged that the district court might side with it anyway.nothing prevents the prosecutor from pursuing this route,either before or after further questioning of lawyer i,if the district judge is willing to follow it.it is for the district court to say whether the low zolin standard would warrant in camera questioning of the group c clients.
the order.when in december the district court gave notice of the government motion to compel,it included a protective order directing lawyer i and his
