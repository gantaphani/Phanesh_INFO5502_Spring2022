order and opinion 
the opinion filed november,and appearing at,is withdrawn.it may not be cited as precedent by or to this court or any district court of the ninth circuit.
petitioner pedro imperial vega was convicted of sexually abusing his stepdaughter.in this appeal of the district court denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus,vega argues that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective when he failed to review vega client file and,as a result,failed to call as a witness a catholic priest to whom the victim had recanted her allegations of her stepfather sexual abuse.
we hold that reasonable jurists could not disagree that counsel failing deprived vega of his constitutional right to effective counsel.accordingly,the state court decision was an unreasonable application of strickland washington.the district court erred by denying vega petition and we reverse.
background 
pedro vega was convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a minor,molestation of a child,and three counts of sexual abuse of a child under fifteen,based on incidents that occurred between and.the victim was vega stepdaughter,b.as detailed by the arizona superior court 
in,the victim originally raised molest allegations,such which formed the basis for counts.those allegations were originally charged in the federal system,then dismissed after petitioner attorney denise shepard in that case learned that the victim had recanted such allegations,both to her mother,and a priest,father daniel mclaughlin.those charges were later reinstated in state court cr,in which petitioner was represented by ralph ellinwood,but dismissed after ellinwood learned of the recantations.counts arose from allegations made by the victim in.
state charges were brought for a third time following a new set of allegations by b,and the grand jury indicted vega on three counts based on the first set of allegations counts and five counts based on the second set of allegations counts.yet a third lawyer,david darby,represented vega at trial.after two mistrials,a jury found vega guilty of five of the eight counts he was sentenced to years in prison.
both vega and b testified at his trial,and the trial largely turned on their testimony and the testimony of other family members.during the trial,b testified that she recanted the first set of allegations to her mother,but no evidence was introduced that she had also recanted to father mclaughlin father dan.
after vega conviction,his counsel filed a motion for a new trial or to vacate judgment,on the grounds that he had just learned that the victim had recanted her allegations to father dan.the trial court held an evidentiary hearing where it heard testimony from several witnesses.first,father dan testified for the first time in the trial court that b mother,molly vega,brought b to his office,that he spoke with b alone,that there was a crisis in the family,and that b told him he vega did do it.he stated that because it was not a confessional matter,he was at liberty to tell the court what the nature of the conversation was.second,vega first two attorneys,denice shepherd and ralph ellinwood testified.shepherd represented vega when he was charged with federal offenses that were later dismissed.she recalled that she first learned of b recantation to father dan from b mother,molly.in her written notes from that conversation,she wrote down father dan contact information and underneath it wrote b told him dad did do it.she later spoke with father dan and he confirmed that b had recanted.attorney ellinwood was a public defender who represented vega against the first set of state charges that were also dismissed.ellinwood kept notes from two conversations he had regarding father dan.his notes,which were in vega case file and are in the record before this court,reflect that he met with vega,who told him that b recanted to father dan.he later met with molly,and his notes reflect father dan told him daddy never did anything to her.third,judge howard fell,who was the county attorney who prosecuted the second case,testified that he had no recollection of the case,but authenticated his notes which he surmised were notes of a phone conversation with ellinwood,which read in part there is no reasonable probability of success in obtaining a conviction.there are recantations from the beginning that the child still maintains.he confirmed that the charges against vega were dismissed.
vega counsel in the third case,darby,testified and advised the court that he learned of the victim recantation to father dan from b aunt about a week to two weeks after the verdict.he also admitted that it was possible that vega had mentioned the matter to him,but that he had not seen ellinwood notes about b recantation to father dan in his client file.he later told the court that he did not remember reviewing any records of ellinwood.counsel acknowledged that if vega knew that b recanted to father dan and did not tell him,vega d id so at his own peril,but urged the court to vacate the conviction on due process and grounds.darby also acknowledged that if the court refused to grant a new trial,he would have to argue that he provided ineffective assistance to vega.following the hearing,the trial court denied the motion for a new trial or to vacate because vega and his two prior counsel were aware of b recantation to father dan,and thus father dan statements were not newly discovered evidence under.a.
on direct appeal to the arizona court of appeals,vega argued that the trial court had erred by denying his motion for judgment of acquittal or a new trial.the arizona court of appeals denied his appeal on the merits,agreeing with the superior court that b recantation to the priest was not newly discovered evidence.the court of appeals also agreed with the trial court that a t a minimum vega did not exercise due diligence because mother,vega sister and presumably vega himself all knew and told others about statements to the priest.finally,the court of appeals concluded that the evidence would not have been material because the priest proffered testimony about statements would merely have been cumulative to own testimony that she had recanted her allegations to her mother and a counselor.the court concluded that there was not a reasonable probability that the priest testimony would have changed the outcome of the case.the arizona supreme court summarily denied review.
vega then sought state relief on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel.the arizona superior court held a evidentiary hearing in,and issued a detailed minute order.reciting the standard for ineffective assistance of counsel under strickland,the court refused to find 
ineffective assistance in that counsel failed to investigate the victim recantation to father dan.this court,at trial,determined that petitioner himself was aware of the recantation the court declines to find relief appropriate on this ground,given that a defendant is responsible for assisting counsel with his defense.it is illogical and unreasonable to hold counsel responsible for petitioner failure to divulge such information to him.clearly,counsel performance did not fall below the standard,and petitioner can not have been prejudiced,as he was aware of the recantation and himself,failed to reveal it to counsel.
the court concluded 
the requirements of strickland are clear petitioner must demonstrate both that counsel efforts fell below the standard prevailing in the community,and that these failings prejudiced him.the court finds that petitioner has failed to demonstrate that counsel efforts fell below the prevailing professional norms.the court further finds that,even assuming arguendo that counsel efforts fell below standards,petitioner has failed to prove prejudice as a result of those actions.the evidence against petitioner included,but by no means was limited to testimony the fact that petitioner failed to deny the molests to both mother and the police and that brothers each provided facts that provided corroboration as to elements of her testimony.
footnote omitted.the arizona court of appeals granted review,but s eeing no reason to repeat the trial court analysis here,it adopted the trial court decision and denied relief.the arizona supreme court again summarily denied review.
having exhausted his state remedies,vega initiated the instant federal habeas proceedings,seeking relief pursuant to.in a report and recommendation,the magistrate judge recommended denying the petition on the merits.the district court agreed with the magistrate judge report,noting specifically that i n light of the victim testimony that she had recanted,the additional instances of recantations would have been largely cumulative in their basic effect.the district court then concluded that g iven the reasons the arizona courts stated for not granting relief,this court does not find that the state courts decision involved an unreasonable application of federal law.however,the district court granted a certificate of appealability for vega ineffective assistance of counsel claim.vega timely appealed 
ii.discussion 
a.the aedpa standard 
this case is governed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.under aedpa,habeas relief can be granted only if the state court proceedings resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.
a decision involves an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law under d if it identifies the correct governing legal principle but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.williams taylor.thus,t he pivotal question is whether the state court application of the supreme court precedent was unreasonable,harrington richter,as opposed to merely incorrect or erroneous,lockyer andrade.in applying this standard,we must give decisions the benefit of the doubt,woodford visciotti,per curiam,and we will refrain from issuing a writ so long as fairminded jurists could disagree on the correctness of the state court decision.richter.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
under d,the unreasonable determination clause,a factual determination is not unreasonable merely because the federal habeas court would have reached a different conclusion in the first instance.burt titlow,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.instead,we presume that the state court factual findings are correct unless the petitioner rebuts the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.rice collins,citing e.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
the clearly established federal law for ineffective assistance of counsel claims is articulated in strickland.see williams,at.surmounting strickland high bar is never an easy task.padilla kentucky.to succeed on a strickland claim,a defendant must prove that his counsel performance was deficient and he was prejudiced by counsel deficient performance.strickland,at.
counsel is constitutionally deficient if the representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness such that it was outside the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.when evaluating counsel conduct,we must make every effort to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight,and to evaluate the conduct from counsel perspective at the time.gulbrandson ryan,cir quoting strickland,at.
a defendant is prejudiced by counsel deficient performance if there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of a proceeding.id.thus,a petitioner need not prove counsel actions more likely than not altered the outcome,but rather he must demonstrate that t he likelihood of a different result is substantial,not just conceivable.richter.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
because we are reviewing the arizona courts assessment of counsel performance under aedpa,our review is necessarily doubly deferential,knowles mirzayance,subject to the constraints of strickland,the arizona courts must defer to counsel judgments,and,subject to aedpa standards,we must defer to the arizona courts assessment of counsel judgment.we recognize that our colleagues have the same duty we have to adjudicate claims of constitutional wrong,and,subject to aedpa,we will respect their judgments.burt.at see also stone powell.
we apply the doubly deferential standard to review the state court last reasoned decision.cheney washington,f d,cir.here,the arizona superior court decision denying vega petition for relief is the last reasoned decision because the arizona court of appeal adopted the superior court reasoning and the arizona supreme court summarily affirmed.
deficient representation 
in this case,the arizona superior court properly recognized the authority of strickland and correctly cited its two prongs.applying strickland,it determined that counsel performance did not fall below the standard because a defendant is responsible for assisting counsel with his defense and i t is illogical and unreasonable to hold counsel responsible for petitioner failure to divulge b recantation to father dan to him.with all due respect,we hold that the state court conclusion in this regard is an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.
first,the state court holding that counsel had no responsibility to obtain information known to his client is an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent.in rompilla beard,the supreme court stated,in an aedpa case,that counsel was ineffective in failing to examine the defendant file for mitigating evidence.there,counsel failed to present substantial mitigation evidence during the penalty phase of a capital murder case even though the evidence was documented in the readily available file on rompilla prior conviction.id.at.the court found this point clear and dispositive the lawyers were deficient in failing to examine the court file on rompilla prior conviction.id.at.the court observed that rompilla own contributions to any mitigation case were minimal,t here were times when rompilla was even actively obstructive by sending counsel off on false leads,and rompilla family members were not helpful.id.at.despite the difficulties counsel had with their client,the court held that n o reasonable lawyer would forgo examination of the file thinking he could do as well by asking the defendant or family relations about potential mitigating evidence.id.at.because of counsel deficiency,the court held that the state courts were objectively unreasonable in concluding that counsel could reasonably decline to make any effort to review the file.id.at.
rompilla is dispositive here.the records rompilla counsel failed to investigate included rompilla school records,prior conviction records,and mental health reports all matters that rompilla himself would have had some knowledge of and could have assisted counsel in determining whether such documents would have produced probative mitigation evidence.the court made clear in rompilla that counsel had a duty independent of whatever knowledge his client may have to make reasonable investigation including,at a minimum,reviewing the court file on rompilla prior conviction.if rompilla counsel had a duty to review the court file in a prior case,it is minimally incumbent on vega counsel to review the file of the previous attorneys who handled the charges in the same case.
we think it apparent from rompilla that the client own knowledge of what is in his file is irrelevant to the discharge of his counsel duty.we applied this principle in stankewitz wong,cir,a case.stankewitz conviction following his first trial was reversed on appeal because of a conflict with counsel.id.at.prior to his second trial,new counsel was appointed,and the second counsel failed to present mitigating evidence.id.at.d espite his possession of prior counsel files,he did not investigate any of the evidence contained within them.he did not contact prior counsel to discuss the contents of the files.id.at.relying on rompilla and wiggins smith,we had little difficulty finding ineffective assistance of counsel because,despite the fact that the evidence was in his hands,he failed to do any further investigation or development of this critical mitigation evidence.id.at alteration in original quoting summerlin schriro,cir en banc.
here,it is undisputed that vega first two attorneys documented father dan exculpatory testimony in vega file,which his trial counsel neglected to read.as in rompilla,the fact that vega did not take it upon himself to inform his counsel about father dan did not excuse counsel from conducting a rudimentary investigation.after rompilla,talking with a client is not an adequate substitute for reading the client case file.
second,but relatedly,it is also clearly established federal law that counsel is deficient if he or she possesses exculpatory evidence but has no strategic reason for withholding it.in wiggins,counsel for the of a death penalty trial informed jurors y ou going to hear that kevin wiggins has had a difficult life but d uring the proceedings themselves,counsel introduced no evidence of wiggins life history.at.there,counsel were aware of appellant background,including wiggins terrible childhood,and they knew t hey had available to them both the presentence investigation report prepared by the division of parole and probation,as well as more detailed social service records that recorded incidences of physical and sexual abuse,an alcoholic mother,placements in foster care,and borderline retardation.at internal citation and quotation marks omitted.nevertheless,counsel decided not to present any of the powerful mitigating evidence.applying strickland,the court decided that counsel conduct constituted a sixth amendment violation because a competent attorney,aware of wiggins history,would have introduced it at sentencing in an admissible form.id.at.
here,vega previous two attorneys documented exculpatory evidence in vega client file.for example,shepherd wrote that the victim told father dan that dad did do it and that b told her mother she needed to get this off my chest.similarly,ellinwood wrote father dan b recanted to him.yet a third note included information about the victim question,mom what if i was lying what would they do and father dan told him daddy never did anything to her.vega trial counsel admitted,however,that he did not remember the contents of shepherd notes and did not remember reviewing ellinwood notes.on the motion for a new trial,the county argued that b recantation to father dan was not newly discovered evidence,but rather that t here was no due diligence done in finding out this information by current counsel,and that trial counsel was ineffective for not finding out this information.and darby admitted that,if the court refused his request for a new trial on the grounds of newly discovered evidence,he would be forced to confess his own ineffective assistance.so,like counsel in rompilla,vega counsel was deficient because he failed to read vega case file even though the case procedural history put counsel on notice that the federal government and arizona had previously dismissed the charges against his client and the arguably exculpatory evidence was at his fingertips.
while strickland protects strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts,at,had darby known of b recantation to father dan,there was no strategic reason for not calling father dan as a witness.he was available to testify and told the court that he had not heard b statement in confessional and,thus,was willing to testify as to what she told him.importantly,father dan was not a member of the family and had no reason to misrepresent b recantation.he thus would have brought credibility to b mother claims that b had recanted to her.
we recently applied strickland in an aedpa case in which there was also a failure to investigate evidence of a recantation.in cannedy adams,cir,cannedy was convicted of committing lewd and lascivious acts on his stepdaughter.id.at.cannedy alleged that his counsel was ineffective because he ignored evidence that the victim had recanted her allegations in an internet posting to a friend.id.at.as in this case,cannedy trial was largely a he said,she said case,with no physical evidence linking cannedy to the alleged abuse.id.cannedy was the sole witness in his defense,and his only defense was that the victim had fabricated the allegations.id.the internet posting would have explained the victim motive to implicate cannedy falsely.id.under these circumstances,n o competent lawyer would have declined to interview such a potentially favorable witness when that witness had been clearly identified,the witness was easily accessible and willing to provide information,and trial counsel faced a dearth of defense witnesses.id.
we reach a similar conclusion here.there is no dispute that counsel failure to review his client file led to a failure to present a key witness to the jury.strickland and rompilla tell us that a reasonable lawyer would not have committed such a lapse.even viewing the facts as a defense lawyer would have done at the time we can conceive of no circumstances where the decision not to read a client file a file prepared to answer the same charges would be reasonable.furthermore,there can be no suggestion that counsel made a strategic decision not to interview or call father dan because counsel did not even know about the victim recantation to father dan until a one or two weeks after the trial.see thomas chappell,cir finding strickland error when trial counsel failure to call a witness could not be excused as a tactical decision because counsel did not have sufficient information to make an informed decision.
in light of the uncontroverted evidence before the arizona superior court and the arizona court of appeals,the state court holding that vega counsel rendered effective assistance of counsel is an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,namely strickland and rompilla.because counsel has a duty to investigate,even if his or her client does not divulge relevant information,we hold that reasonable jurists could not disagree that trial counsel performance here was deficient.
as we have previously observed,to prevail on his ineffective assistance claim,vega must demonstrate prejudice as well as deficient performance.strickland,at.ordinarily,to demonstrate prejudice,the petitioner must show it is reasonably likely the result would have been different but for counsel ineptitude.richter.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.and t he likelihood of a different result must be substantial,not just conceivable.see also strickland,at holding that petitioner must prove there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.
under aedpa,we do not apply the strickland standard de novo.gulbrandson,at.instead of considering whether petitioner met the burden of proving prejudice,we must decide whether the state court was reasonable in determining that the petitioner was not prejudiced.id.at.in assessing whether vega was prejudiced by counsel conduct we must compare the evidence that actually was presented to the jury with that which could have been presented had counsel acted appropriately.cannedy,at quotation marks and citation omitted see also williams,at.
the superior court decided that vega was not prejudiced by counsel performance because counsel rendered effective assistance.nevertheless,assuming arguendo that counsel performance was deficient,the superior court found that additional recantation evidence would have been cumulative because the jury heard the victim testify that she recanted to her mother.thus,the superior court concluded,there was no prejudice because there was sufficient evidence against vega,including the victim testimony,which of itself was enough to sustain a conviction for child molestation under state munoz,and the testimony of other witnesses that corroborated b testimony.
the fact that a child victim testimony is sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction for child molestation does not mean that vega was not prejudiced by his counsel shortcomings.for that precise reason,when the child testimony goes to the heart of the state case,evidence that the victim has recanted her allegations to a responsible adult is critical to the defense.and when that evidence is not cumulative of other testimony,the defendant has been deprived of a key witness and has suffered prejudice.
the arizona court of appeals found that the victim credibility was a central issue.indeed,here as in cannedy,petitioner trial was largely a he said,she said case,with no physical evidence linking petitioner to the alleged abuse.at.further,like many sexual abuse cases,the victim credibility was essential both to the prosecution and to the defense.vega entire theory in defense was that b had fabricated her allegations against him.b credibility was also a key issue because there was evidence that undermined both the victim and vega testimony.on the one hand,the victim admitted that she recanted the first set of allegations.but,on the other hand,the victim mother and brothers corroborated other aspects of her testimony.here is the summary of the evidence from the arizona superior court opinion denying relief 
the requirements of strickland are clear petitioner must demonstrate both that counsel efforts fell below the standard prevailing in the community,and that these failings prejudiced him.the finds that petitioner has failed to demonstrate that counsel efforts fell below the prevailing professional norms.the court further finds that,even assuming arguendo that counsel efforts fell below standards,petitioner has failed to prove prejudice as a result of those actions.the evidence against petitioner included,but by no means was limited to b.s testimony the fact that petitioner failed to deny the molests to both mother and the police and that brothers each provided facts that provided corroboration as to elements of her testimony accordingly,given the evidence,the court finds that petitioner was not rendered ineffective assistance of counsel at trial.brother daniel bracamonte testified that he recalled an occasion when petitioner told him to go to bed when was allowed to stay up.daniel later heard tickling and laughing coming from the master bedroom,where and petitioner were.later tha t night,as came into the room in which the two were sleeping he saw her wiping her eyes,as though she was crying.this story closely corroborates testimony that vega molested her while tickling her.
references to trial transcripts omitted footnote in original.but this evidence,standing by itself,was likely not sufficient to convict vega without b testimony.no one,except for b,could testify to the acts of which she accused vega.
the strongest corroborating evidence referred to by the superior court was testimony from emmanuel ramirez,b older brother,that he had picked up a phone and overheard his mother,molly,ask vega did you do it and that vega answered yes.but emmanuel testimony was subject to vigorous 
before you heard your mother ask vega if he did it,and before you heard that answer,you do know what your mother and vega were talking about,do you 
q.you have no idea what they were talking about at the time,did you 
moreover,defense counsel elicited that emmanuel,who was at the time he testified and or at the time of the phone call,had been dealing cocaine since he was and was using drugs on a daily basis during that period.he remembered little of the incident except for his mother question and vega answer 
now,you do remember any dates about when any of these things that you talked about happened,correct 
is it because of a bad memory because of drug use back then 
no,i ca remember none of my childhood.
none at all nothing.
what the last thing you remember about your childhood 
just kind of all a blank to you 
i remember a little bit but nothing i just ca really remember anything.
the evidence that petitioner failed to deny the molests to both mother and the police,has minimal probative value because silence is inherently ambiguous.see united states hale,in most circumstances silence is so ambiguous that it is of little probative force.when molly confronted vega about the allegations,he neither admitted nor denied molesting b 
well,he told you he did molest b.
no,he did say that.he allowed me to hit him on the face.i just hit him on the face and he would look.he would turn to see me,to look at me 
q.so you were beating on him 
i was hitting him in the face.he broke my heart.
q.what were you saying to him when you were beating on him 
i was saying like,how could you,things like that.
and he denied it.he said,i did do anything 
i told him to leave.he could say anything.
although s ilence gains more probative weight where it persists in the face of accusation,under these circumstances it is questionable whether the confrontation naturally called for a reply,given that vega could say anything.
similarly,vega response,or lack there of,to police officer questioning was flimsy evidence.lieutenant neilsen informed vega of his miranda rights and interviewed vega after he was arrested on february.the state asked lieutenant neilsen about vega demeanor during the interview 
can you describe for us his facial expression or what he did when you said you were investigating child molestation 
i did not see any emotion at all.
q.did he,after you told him you were investigating allegations of child molestation,did he deny engaging in child molestation 
q.did he ever throughout the course of your discussion with him ever deny the allegations that were being made 
q.did he admit them 
q.what would he do 
a.he would explain them.
detective dollar interviewed vega,who voluntarily met officers at the sheriff station,around april,after b made additional allegations.once again,the state asked about vega demeanor 
q.when you talked to the defendant,peter vega,describe to us his demeanor.what he was looking like or doing when you were talking to them.
a.vega was fidgeting,playing with his hands,his thumbs.he would look down frequently while the detective was asking questions of him.he seemed to be somewhat nervous and he would wipe his brow with his hands.
during redirect examination,the detective agreed that many people are nervous during a police interview 
q.did you characterize vega demeanor when you spoke with him he was interviewed for an hour and a half about child molestation to be unusual,the way to act when being confronted by the police about child molestation 
not necessarily,no.
q.you would expect somebody to be nervous right 
especially being in the police department and being confronted by allegations of child molest,fidgeting and sweating and being nervous and fidgeting,that not all that uncommon,is it 
assuming arguendo that lieutenant neilsen testimony was admissible,it had little probative value because every silence is insolubly ambiguous because of what the state is required to advise the person arrested.doyle ohio.indeed,given that the selfincrimination clause is applicable to state interrogations at a police station,michigan tucker,it is feasible that vega did not want to say anything that could be used against him in court.miranda arizona,the warning of the right to remain silent must be accompanied by the explanation that anything said can and will be used against the individual in court.
further,vega nervousness was not particularly indicative of guilt.after all,it is not unusual for a person to be nervous when interacting with a police officer.whren united states,recognizing that even traffic stops entail a possibly unsettling show of authority and may create substantial anxiety.quoting delware prouse,see also united states chavez valenzuea,cir encounters with police officers are necessarily stressful for and criminals alike,amended by united states chavez valenzuela,cir.and nervousness is especially likely in an interrogation environment which carries its own badge of intimidation because it i
