upon learning its former counsel planned to sue for wrongful termination of employment,a company struck first by suing the former counsel for disclosing confidential and privileged information to the attorneys handling her wrongful termination case.the former counsel moved to strike the company complaint as a slapp suit the company responded with motions to disqualify the attorneys representing its former counsel on the ground they possessed confidential and privileged information belonging to the company and material to the issues between the parties.the trial court denied the slapp motion and the motions to disqualify counsel.both sides appealed.
we affirm the trial court orders denying the motions to disqualify the attorneys representing the former counsel.we reverse the order denying the slapp motion.
facts and proceedings below 
from june until july gia paladino paladino was employed under a written contract as an attorney in the legal department of fox searchlight pictures,fox.a few months before her contract expired,paladino supervisor told her the contract would not be renewed.the reason given for not renewing the contract was that a film project on which paladino had provided legal advice did not go well.paladino believed,however,the true reason for her termination was that fox management was upset over her frequent use of pregnancy leave.
believing fox terminated her on the basis of her sex and pregnancy,paladino consulted a law firm for legal advice as to her rights.paladino admits,in the course of these consultations,she disclosed ostensibly confidential and privileged information pertaining to fox.
the attorneys representing paladino sent fox a draft of the complaint for wrongful termination of employment which they intended to file on paladino behalf.in an accompanying letter paladino attorneys advised fox they did not believe the draft complaint disclosed any privileged information but they wished to give fox an opportunity to examine the complaint before it was filed and to alert them as to any material fox believed was protected by the privilege.
upon reviewing the proposed complaint fox concluded it contained privileged and confidential information.fox responded by filing a complaint against paladino alleging the disclosure of its confidences to her attorneys constituted a violation of her ethical duties as well as a breach of her fiduciary duty and her employment contract with fox in its brief on appeal,fox describes the confidences paladino disclosed in general terms as information about the way fox structures business transactions and legal advice rendered in connection with a film project which was the subject of ongoing litigation.in its complaint,fox seeks compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief to prevent further disclosure of its confidences and to require paladino to return all of fox documents and files in her possession.
paladino countered with a motion to strike fox complaint as a slapp suit.
the day after filing the slapp motion,paladino filed her complaint for wrongful termination.fox reacted by seeking an ex parte order striking and sealing the complaint on the ground it disclosed privileged information.the order was denied without prejudice after paladino agreed to rewrite the complaint to remove certain language deemed by fox to reveal matters protected by the privilege.the complaint,however,did not completely eliminate the material to which fox objected and another order was entered substituting a second revised complaint and placing the previous complaint under seal.in the meantime,the unredacted complaint was picked up by an internet news service and made available for downloading by the public 
fox then moved to disqualify paladino attorneys on the grounds they had been exposed to confidential information concerning fox affairs and they had a conflict of interest with their own client.
in opposition to paladino slapp motion and in support of its own disqualification motions,fox submitted documents under seal which purported to establish certain information contained in paladino complaint for wrongful termination was privileged or confidential.the trial court denied paladino request to inspect the sealed documents in order to respond to fox opposition to her motion.the court reviewed the sealed documents in ruling on the slapp and disqualification motions.
the trial court denied fox motions to disqualify paladino counsel and denied paladino motion to strike fox complaint as a slapp suit.both parties filed timely appeals 
paladino counsel are not subject to disqualification based on a conflict of interest.
fox moved to disqualify paladino counsel from both lawsuits on the grounds they had previously represented fox and they had a conflict of interest with their current client,paladino.fox failed to make the requisite showing for disqualification based on a conflict of interest.
fox failed to establish paladino attorneys possess relevant confidential material acquired from their prior representation of fox.
a former client may disqualify a former attorney from representing an adverse party by showing the attorney presumably possesses confidential information adverse to the former client such a presumption arises if the former client can establish a substantial relationship between the prior and current representations a substantial relationship is shown by the factual and legal similarities in the two representations and the extent of the attorney involvement with the cases 
fox failed in its attempt to establish a substantial relationship between any prior representation of fox and representation of paladino.the declarations submitted by fox merely show paladino attorneys were formerly associated with a law firm,proskauer rose,which provided fox with advice and counsel on intellectual property issues,among other things.fox provided no evidence these attorneys had,through their former employment,acquired confidential or privileged information material to the present litigation.fox did not explain what an intellectual property issue is nor did any fox employee aver proskauer rose handled any matter even remotely similar in law or fact to the current actions.
for their part,paladino counsel filed declarations denying involvement with fox in any matter related to the present litigation.finkel stated during his employment at proskauer rose he never worked on any fox matters,never met anyone from fox and never obtained any confidential fox information.cochran bond and connon stated the only work they did for fox was in connection with toxic tort litigation against a film laboratory.this former representation is insufficient to justify disqualification.possession of confidential information will not be presumed from the mere fact counsel once represented the opposing party the threshold question remains whether the former representation is substantially related to the current representation.here it is not.
fox contends there is another way paladino attorneys could have obtained confidential information from fox relevant to paladino wrongful termination action.paladino herself worked for proskauer rose before joining fox legal department.from this fact fox reasons it should be presumed that proskauer attorneys learned information about their former associate job performance at fox during the course of proskauer continued representation of fox.we see no basis for indulging this presumption.we can imagine that while meeting with fox executives,proskauer rose attorneys might ask about their former colleague,paladino.but we can not imagine fox response to such a casual inquiry would be intended by fox to be a confidential communication between client and lawyer or that the response would eventually find its way to finkel,or connon who,three years later,would use it in a lawsuit against fox.fox produced no evidence such a conversation ever took place or that information about paladino job performance at fox ever reached her attorneys except through paladino.
fox failed to establish a conflict between paladino and her own attorneys.
an attorney violates the duty of loyalty to the client by assuming a position adverse or antagonistic to the client fox posits the following scenario.suppose fox offers paladino a settlement based in part on her acknowledgement the information she provided her attorneys constituted a breach of her duty to protect fox confidences,secrets and privileged information.her attorneys might pressure her to reject the offer in order to protect themselves from an action by paladino or fox.or,in another scenario,suppose fox amends its complaint to name paladino attorneys as defendants in a cause of action for interference with contract.this would put the attorneys interests directly at odds with paladino.
a motion to disqualify will not be granted when only a hypothetical conflict exists we find fox scenarios too speculative to justify disqualification.at this point in time there is no showing the hypothetical settlement is a real possibility or that fox has any evidence on which to amend its complaint and bring in paladino attorneys as defendants.in the absence of an actual conflict between the opposing party and her attorneys the other party should not be able to create one through the simple expediency of threatening to file a suit against the attorneys 
ii.paladino attorneys are not disqualified by reason of paladino disclosing to them confidential or privileged information she acquired while counsel to fox.
fox contends the fact paladino attorneys have been exposed to fox confidential and privileged information provides an independent basis for disqualifying them.we disagree.
california courts have previously addressed the question whether attorneys should be disqualified after being exposed to the opposing party confidential information by their client.in each case the court held disqualification was not warranted.
in cooke superior court,a dissolution action,the husband butler eavesdropped on the husband discussions with his attorneys,copied privileged documents and provided this material to the wife who passed it on to her lawyers.the trial court denied the husband motion to disqualify his wife attorneys and the court of appeal affirmed.the court pointed out there had never been an relationship between the wife attorneys and the husband.w e know of no case,the court stated,where disqualification of an attorney or his firm was imposed purely as a punitive or disciplinary measure,and where there was no prior representation or confidential professional relationship between the complaining party and the attorney or law firm sought to be disqualified.
in bell century ins,a case factually similar to the one before us,bell,a former personnel officer,brought a wrongful termination action against century insurance company.bell attorneys had represented another century employee in a wrongful discharge case during the time bell was personnel officer.in the course of the previous case,bell had several privileged conversations with century attorneys regarding the theories,strategies and merits of the defense.twentieth century moved to disqualify bell attorneys on the ground they could use the confidential and privileged information bell learned while participating in the defense of the previous case to century detriment in bell case.the trial court granted the disqualification motion,but the court of appeal reversed observing it could not see how bell could have improperly disclosed information to her own counsel in the prosecution of her own lawsuit.
admittedly,bell was a personnel officer and not an counsel as was paladino.one court has suggested this might make a difference.in maruman integrated circuits,consortium,plaintiff discovered in the course of litigation that one of its former employees had passed confidential information regarding the suit to the defendant attorney.affirming denial of the plaintiff disqualification motion the appellate court remarked here,the former employee was not an attorney and therefore was never in an relationship with her former employer.the court distinguished the case before it,involving a nonattorney,from hull celanese corporation,a sex discrimination case,in which the second circuit disqualified a law firm from representing a former member of the defendant legal staff on the ground confidential or privileged information imparted by the defendant to the former attorney might be divulged in the course of the current litigation 
we do not believe disqualification should turn on whether the former employee was an attorney for the opposing party or served in some other capacity.
if an attorney representing a former counsel against her employer must be disqualified because the client might divulge confidential or privileged information,then it must logically follow the counsel also can not represent herself against her former employer because she possesses the employer confidential information.in other words,if we accepted fox view the disqualification rules would effectively ban any litigation by a former counsel against the employer as well as bar counsel from defending actions brought by the employer.as we discuss more fully in part iv below,such a result is contrary to the decision in general dynamics superior court in which our supreme court held a former counsel may sue her employer for wrongful termination so long as she does not publicly disclose information the employer is entitled to keep secret the general dynamics decision,of course,controls over anything to the contrary in maruman or hull.
for these reasons we conclude the trial court properly denied fox motions to disqualify paladino counsel.
iii.the slapp statute applies to the causes of action in fox complaint.
under code of civil procedure section a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.
as we explained in wilcox superior court the defendant in an alleged slapp suit bears the initial burden of showing the suit falls within the class of suits subject to a motion to strike under section.
fox argues its suit against paladino does not fall within the class of suits subject to a special motion to strike under section because the slapp statute does not apply to lawsuits filed to protect confidential or privileged information paladino did not show fox lawsuit was intended to chill the exercise of her right to petition for the redress of grievances through litigation and each cause of action is based,in part,on paladino failure to return confidential and privileged documents to unrelated to speech or petitioning.we reject each of these arguments.
a.the initial determination whether a lawsuit is subject to a motion to strike under section is not a determination of the merits of the suit.
fox argues its suit does not fall within the slapp statute because paladino has no first amendment right to disclose privileged and confidential documents or to refuse to return those documents to fox,their rightful owner.the same argument could be made by the plaintiff in a defamation defendant has no first amendment right to engage in libel or slander.yet,defamation suits are a prime target of slapp motions 
the problem with fox argument is that it confuses the threshold question of whether the slapp statute applies with the question whether fox has established a probability of success on the merits the legislature did not intend that in order to invoke the special motion to strike the defendant must first establish her actions are constitutionally protected under the first amendment as a matter of law.if this were the case then the inquiry as to whether the plaintiff has established a probability of success would be superfluous 
paladino did not have to show fox suit was intended to chill her right to petition for redress of grievances.
fox next contends in order for paladino to invoke the protection of the slapp statute she must show fox lawsuit was intended to chill the exercise of her right to petition for the redress of grievances through litigation.this argument is based on the preamble to the slapp statute in which the legislature declared,there has been a disturbing increase in lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances and the exercise of these rights should not be chilled through abuse of the judicial process.
foothills townhome christiansen is the only published opinion to hold the defendant initial burden on a slapp motion includes showing the plaintiff lawsuit was in fact brought to chill her first amendment rights we disagree with this holding for the reasons stated below.
first,the opinions cited in foothills townhome do not support its holding.in wilcox superior court,we observed section is limited to exposing and dismissing lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances however,in explaining the moving party burden of proof we stated t he statute requires the defendant to make a prima facie showing the plaintiff suit arises from any act of defendant in furtherance of defendant right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue.nothing in our opinion can be construed to hold the moving party must prove the lawsuit was brought primarily to chill its first amendment rights.church of scientology and ericsson ge mobile communications,telecommunications are also not on point.church of scientology,at the page cited in townhome,holds section is not limited to tort actions the case contains no discussion of the defendant burden of proof ericsson,at the pages cited in townhome,discusses what constitutes an act in furtherance of the right of free speech and an act in connection with a public issue under section,subdivision b it too contains no discussion of the defendant burden of proof.
furthermore,as our supreme court explained in construing section,legislative intent is not gleaned solely from the preamble of a statute it is gleaned from the statute as a whole,which includes the particular directives.the particular directives of section are inconsistent with a requirement the defendant prove the challenged lawsuit was brought to chill her first amendment rights.subdivision a,the preamble to the statute,explains why the legislature believed it needed to enact protect the public from lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of first amendment rights.in subdivision b the legislature directed the courts to presume a lawsuit against a person which arises from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech is brought primarily to chill the person first amendment rights unless the court determines the plaintiff has a reasonable probability of success on the merits.thus,the only thing the defendant needs to establish to invoke the protection of the slapp statute is that the challenged lawsuit arose from an act on the part of the defendant in furtherance of her right of petition or free speech.from that fact the court may presume the purpose of the action was to chill the defendant exercise of first amendment rights.it is then up to the plaintiff to rebut the presumption by showing a reasonable probability of success on the merits.
fox attempts to engraft a motive or intent requirement not contained in the plain language of section.the legislative concern is that the cause of action aris e from an act in furtherance of the constitutional right to petition or free speech.no mention is made in the statute regarding proof of the plaintiff motives or intent.we decline to impose a burden on the party seeking protection from the slapp statute of proving the plaintiff was motivated by an improper purpose.the intent and purpose of the lawsuit may be addressed by the plaintiff when it attempts to establish its ability to prevail on the merits.
we hold,therefore,a defendant moving to strike a slapp suit is not required to show the plaintiff intended its suit to chill the defendant exercise of first amendment rights or that the suit had such an effect.
fox prayer that paladino be ordered to turn over allegedly confidential material does not immunize its suit from a motion to strike under section.
finally,fox argues paladino wrongful refusal to return fox allegedly confidential material is unrelated to her lawsuit against fox and therefore can not constitute an act in furtherance of her right of petition or free speech.because each cause of action in fox complaint includes an allegation of such wrongful conduct,each cause of action is immune from a motion to strike under the slapp statute.we do not accept this argument.
as we explained above,whether the material in question is privileged or confidential is not relevant to the threshold issue of whether the slapp statute applies to fox complaint.nor can we say from the record before us,as a matter of law,the maintenance of this material was not an act in furtherance of the preparation and prosecution of paladino suit against fox furthermore,a plaintiff can not frustrate the purposes of the slapp statute through a pleading tactic of combining allegations of protected and nonprotected activity under the label of one cause of action.
for the reasons explained above,the trial court erred in ruling fox complaint is not subject to a motion to strike under section.
we turn now to the question whether fox demonstrated a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits.
iv.an counsel suing her former employer for wrongful termination may disclose to her attorney all facts relevant to the termination even if this includes divulging employer confidences and privileged communications.
fox suit for breach of confidence raises the narrow issue whether a former counsel suing her employer for wrongful termination may divulge to her own attorney employer confidences obtained during the course of her employment.we conclude the former counsel may disclose to her attorney all facts relevant to the termination,including employer confidences and privileged communications.in the present case we are not faced with,and do not decide,whether the former counsel or her attorney can be held liable to the employer for the public disclosure of those confidences and communications.
every lawyer has a duty t o maintain inviolate the confidence,and at every peril to himself or herself to preserve the secrets of his or her client.additionally,every lawyer has a duty in most cases to refuse to disclose,and to prevent another from disclosing,a confidential communication between client and lawyer 
on the other hand,an counsel is an employee and entitled to the same legal protections afforded all employees,including the right not to be discriminated against on the basis of pregnancy,childbirth,or medical conditions related to pregnancy or childbirth 
a suit by a former counsel against her employer poses the challenge of maintaining the attorney professional obligations to the client while at the same time permitting the attorney to enjoy the legal protections afforded nonattorney employees.courts in some jurisdictions have concluded it is impossible to meet this challenge and therefore have refused to permit such suits on the ground they pose too great a threat to the relationship 
our supreme court,however,has reached a different conclusion.in general dynamics,the court held there is no reason inherent in the nature of an attorney role as counsel to a corporation that in itself precludes the maintenance of a suit for breach of contract or wrongful termination provided it can be established without breaching the privilege or unduly endangering the values lying at the heart of the professional relationship.
the court stressed its main concern with wrongful termination suits by counsel was their potential for public disclosure of the former employer confidences.the court suggested three ways to avoid unwarranted disclosure of privileged information.first,the court noted counsel,like all attorneys,are bound by the ethical rule against disclosure of client confidences and observed an attorney who unsuccessfully pursues a retaliatory discharge suit,and in doing so discloses privileged client confidences,may be subject to state bar disciplinary proceedings,citing dixon state and business and professions code section,subdivision e.second,the court proposed that by taking an aggressive managerial role,judges can minimize the dangers to the legitimate privilege interests the trial of such cases may present.finally,if all else fails and the elements of the plaintiff cause of action can not be fully established without breaching the privilege,the suit must be dismissed in the interest of preserving the privilege.
courts following the lead of general dynamics have also emphasized the need in such cases to avoid the unwarranted public disclosure of client confidences,but have agreed it is possible to strike a balance between protecting the employer sensitive information and permitting the former counsel to maintain her suit 
none of these cases addressed the specific issue before us in this appeal may an attorney suing her former employer for wrongful termination disclose to her own lawyers confidences obtained during the course of her employment insofar as they are relevant to the wrongful termination action how this question is answered will determine to a large extent whether general dynamics represents a mere pyrrhic victory or a momentous step forward for counsel 
we conclude counsel may disclose ostensible confidences to her own attorneys to the extent they may be relevant to the preparation and prosecution of her wrongful termination action against her former.
we base our conclusion on three grounds.the general dynamics opinion itself contemplates that in a wrongful termination case a limited disclosure of confidences to the plaintiff own attorney will take place.in addition,we do not believe such disclosure violates an counsel duty of confidentiality to the employer so long as the disclosure is limited to information the counsel reasonably believes is necessary to her attorney preparation and prosecution of the case.finally,fundamental fairness to the plaintiff requires the plaintiff be allowed to make such a limited disclosure of the former employer secrets to her own attorneys to the extent necessary to prepare a claim for wrongful discharge.we discuss each of these grounds below.
as previously noted,our supreme court principal concern over permitting suits by counsel against their former employers was that such suits not result in the unwarranted public disclosure of the employer secrets.in expressing this concern the court stated t he attorney who publicly exposes the client secrets will usually find no sanctuary in the courts.except in rare instances it is never the business of the lawyer to disclose publicly the secrets of the client.we do not believe the supreme court apprehension about the public disclosure of confidential information included counsel disclosure of her former employer secrets to her own attorneys.the attorneys for the counsel are themselves bound by the rules of confidentiality and privilege.thus,disclosure to them is not a public disclosure.
surely,disclosure of a former client confidences to one own attorney in the course of seeking advice regarding a dispute with the former client is a far cry from the facts of dixon state bar cited by the court as an example of prohibited disclosure of privileged client confidences in dixon,the client identified in the opinion as c discharged her attorney and later filed suit seeking to enjoin him from harassing her.in his response,the attorney filed a declaration in which he stated c constantly worried about everything,including an affair that her husband supposedly had with c sister eight years ago.the supreme court characterized this declaration as gratuitous and irrelevant to any issues then pending before the court and concluded it was filed for the purpose of harassing and embarrassing both c and c sister and with the knowledge that the disclosure would cause public embarrassment to both.the court found dixon was subject to discipline because he made public a sensitive and confidential allegation that he knew would be embarrassing to the honor of his client and her sister for his own personal benefit and,in so doing,violated the sanctity of the confidential relationship existing between attorney and client.nothing in general dynamics suggests the court concern over public exposure of client confidences included divulging those confidences to one own attorneys in the course of litigating a claim against the client.
in our view,when the court in general dynamics referred to public disclosure of the employer confidences,it had in mind disclosure in public records and proceedings.this is apparent from the court suggestions about how the plaintiff could attempt to prove her case while protecting from disclosure client confidences subject to the privilege.this advice included t he use of sealing and protective orders,limited admissibility of evidence,orders restricting the use of testimony in successive proceedings,and,where appropriate,in camera proceedings.in making these suggestions,the court necessarily contemplated plaintiff attorney would not only be informed as to employer confidences relevant to the litigation but could use those confidences to make the necessary proof so long as the confidences did not become public.
counsel contemplating a wrongful termination action against her former employer clearly needs to consult with her attorneys on the issue of her former employer confidences given the supreme court warnings of dismissal and possible disciplinary action if client confidences are breached in light of the limitations the court placed on wrongful termination actions against former employers,counsel must consider whether they can assert their claims without disclosing the employer confidences or,if not,whether they can assert an applicable exception to the confidentiality requirement.counsel faced with these ethical questions should not be required to fend for themselves based on their own research and what they can remember from a state bar ethics program.instead,they should be permitted to seek out independent,candid,professional advice about their ethical duties under their particular circumstances.indeed,the employer confidentiality would seem better protected if,early on,counsel consults her own attorney about the ethical issues in a wrongful termination case rather than risk having confidential communications disclosed inadvertently in the later stages of the litigation 
it necessarily follows that if the attorneys representing the counsel are to assist their client in avoiding impermissible public disclosure of the employer confidences in court proceedings,it is essential for them to have complete knowledge of all potentially confidential information known to their client and relevant to the litigation.it is only through such full disclosure the attorneys for the counsel can make judgments about what is disclosable and what is not.for example,there may be a fine but critical line between the fact paladino took positions on certain legal issues involving fox projects and the substance of her legal opinions.without knowing the full extent of paladino positions and their context,her attorneys can not make an informed and reasoned judgment about their disclosability in the litigation.as another example,information about fox business practices which paladino believes to be confidential may,upon investigation by her attorneys,turn out to be widely known in the film industry.
thus,in general dynamics,our supreme court evinced a willingness to allow limited disclosure of confidential information to the plaintiff attorneys in prosecuting a claim of wrongful termination on behalf of a former counsel.
business and professions code section,subdivision e does not prohibit such a limited disclosure.that provision states an attorney has a duty t o maintain inviolate the confidence,and at every peril to himself or herself to preserve the secrets,of his or her client.although the statute on its face brooks no exceptions,it must be read in conjunction with other statutes and ethical rules which specifically permit the attorney to depart from the usual rules of client confidentiality.for example,evidence code section states the privilege does not apply to a communication relevant to an issue of breach,by the lawyer or by the client,of a duty arising out of the relationship.this statute may come into play in the present case because,as noted above,a corporate law department can not discriminate against its employees on the basis of sex and because fox may defend against paladino wrongful termination action by claiming it fired her not for getting pregnant but for professional negligence.
if an attorney,in protecting her own rights,is entitled to introduce otherwise privileged communications at trial,a fortiori she is entitled to reveal those communications to her lawyers in advance of trial.as we explain below,if this were not the case,an attorney could successfully defend the ethics of her behavior in court only to be disciplined for unethical behavior by the state bar the state bar court,however,has shown no interest in such prosecutions.to the contrary,the court has held the duty of confidentiality expressed in business and professions code section,subdivision e is modified by the exceptions to the privilege contained in the evidence code 
for the preceding reasons,we conclude a lawyer does not violate business and professions code section,subdivision e when she discloses client confidences to her own attorney for the purpose of determining whether those communications are admissible evidence under an exception to the privilege.
finally,fundamental fairness requires the plaintiff be allowed to make a limited disclosure of her former client ostensibly confidential information to her own attorneys for purposes of preparing and prosecuting a wrongful termination suit against the former client.if the employer can stifle even this limited disclosure,then general dynamics is nothing more than a judicial practical joke because even if counsel succeeds in a wrongful termination action against the former client she may be sanctioned or lose her license to practice or be sued separately by the former client for breach of fiduciary duty.
while every client has the right to freely confer with and confide in his attorney in an atmosphere of trust and security this does not mean the client can turn the shield of confidentiality into a sword.as one court put it,a lawyer does not forfeit his rights simply because to prove them he must utilize confidential information.nor does the client gain the right to cheat the lawyer by imparting confidences to him.once an adversarial relationship develops between the lawyer and her former client,the lawyer must be permitted to meet the client on even terms,and not be rendered helpless by the client version of the facts.simple fairness therefore demands a lawyer pursuing a wrongful discharge action against her former employer be permitted to divulge to her own attorneys information reasonably necessary to the preparation and prosecution of the action even if the information may be a client confidence.it is then up to the attorneys,in consultation with the plaintiff,to determine if,when and how this information can be utilized in conformity with the rules laid down in general dynamics 
paladino was entitled to review and respond to fox material filed under seal in opposition to her motion to strike.
to show its suit has a reasonable probability of success on the merits,fox must submit admissible evidence the information paladino divulged to her attorneys was in fact confidential or privileged and her disclosure went beyond what was reasonably necessary to permit her attorneys to prepare and prosecute a wrongful termination action on her behalf 
in opposing paladino slapp motion,fox relied in part on paladino declaration admitting she disclosed confidential or privileged information regarding fox in discussions with her attorneys and on the declaration by rita tuzon,assistant secretary of fox,who stated paladino disclosed privileged or confidential information to third parties her attorneys without fox knowledge or consent.
as the trial court recognized,these declarations were insufficient to sustain fox burden of proof.paladino declaration would be excluded at trial as hearsay.it is not admissible under the exception for declarations against interest because,even if it met all the other conditions for the exception,paladino presumably would not be unavailable as a witness if tuzon attempted to testify at trial in the conclusory language of her declaration an objection could be sustained on several grounds including lack of foundation,incompetency,improper opinion and hearsay.
this leaves only the material submitted by fox under seal to support its opposition to the motion.the trial court found this material persuasive stating its finding of a probability of success was based primarily on the in camera filing.the trial court erred in basing its ruling on this sealed material over paladino objection.
under extremely limited circumstances,a party to a civil action may file documents sealed from public view it is difficult to conceive of any circumstances,however,which would permit a party to a civil action to file documents in connection with a motion going to the merits of the action yet sealed from the opposing party view.as one court has explained when a party asserting a claim invokes privilege to withhold crucial evidence,the policy favoring full disclosure of relevant evidence conflicts with the policy underlying the privilege.courts have resolved this conflict by holding that the proponent of the claim must give up the privilege in order to pursue the claim.where privileged information goes to the heart of the claim,fundamental fairness requires that it be disclosed for the litigation to proceed.because the material fox submitted under seal was,by the trial court own admission,essential to establishing its probability of success on the merits,fundamental fairness required that it be disclosed to paladino for review and response.
fox makes several arguments in support of the trial court in camera review of fox confidential material.none are persuasive.
first,fox argues there is abundant precedent for in camera review of materials submitted in connection with a motion.none of fox cases,however,dealt with materials going to the merits of the action.most involved motions for the disqualification of counsel.the remainder involved discovery motions in which the court was called upon to determine whether particular documents were exempt from discovery on the basis of a privilege.fox has cited no case in which a party was allowed to defeat a motion going to the merits of its case with secret material revealed only to the court.
fox next contends paladino and her lawyers demonstrated by their previous conduct in mishandling the confidential information to which they had access that they can not be trusted with such information.this argument begs the question because the issue at the heart of fox lawsuit is whether paladino improperly disclosed to her own attorneys confidential information obtained from fox in the course of her employment.furthermore,the trial court could have issued a protective order enforceable by contempt or other sanctions restricting dissemination of the material fox filed under seal 
finally,fox maintains the sealing of records in suits between a former counsel and her employer was specifically approved by our supreme court in the general dynamics case.fox takes the supreme court language out of context.in discussing ways in which an counsel could prove wrongful termination by her employer while still protecting confidences subject to the privilege the court noted sealing orders and where appropriate,in camera proceedings were among the measures that might usefully be explored as circumstances warrant.nothing in the court opinion suggests those sealing orders should apply to the employee when the employer is using allegedly confidential information to support
