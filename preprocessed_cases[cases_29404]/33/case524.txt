james charles morris appeals from the sentence imposed by the district court after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to launder money.in addition to concurrent month terms of imprisonment,morris faces a three year term of supervised release and was ordered to pay in restitution.on appeal,morris alleges that the district court erred in ordering restitution when it failed to advise morris of the possibility of an order of restitution before accepting his guilty plea.morris also contends that the district court erred in imposing a sentence enhancement for abuse of a position of trust.
background 
morris and four others were indicted and charged with various counts stemming from investment fraud.in the scheme,morris obtained investors funds by falsely representing the investments as legitimate opportunities.the then would use bank wire transfers to send funds to other persons and entities,including morris,thus concealing the money trail and promoting the investment fraud.
pursuant to a written plea agreement,morris pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to launder money,in violation of and h.the agreement and the plea colloquy informed morris that he could face the following fines for conspiracy to defraud,a maximum fine of and for conspiracy to launder money,a maximum fine of the greater of or twice the value of the transaction.neither the plea colloquy nor the plea agreement alerted morris to the fact that he could be sentenced to pay restitution.
the presentence report recommended that morris receive a enhancement for abuse of a position of trust under.morris objected to the enhancement,arguing that he did not hold a special position of trust as envisioned by the guidelines.the government responded that the enhancement was appropriate because morris had used his attorney trust account to funnel the money in promotion of the fraudulent scheme and the other conspirators had informed the victims that morris was a trader and an attorney.the court overruled morris objection,but did grant a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,which resulted in a base offense level of.this adjusted offense level and a criminal history category i led to a guidelines range of to months.the court sentenced morris to months imprisonment to be followed by a term of supervised release,and ordered morris to pay in restitution to sixteen victims,jointly and severally with his four.morris did not object at sentencing to the court order to pay restitution.this appeal follows.
ii.discussion 
rule and restitution 
morris asserts that the district court violated federal rule of criminal procedure by ordering restitution where it failed to advise him,before he pleaded guilty,of the possibility that such an order might be issued.this court reviews the issue of a rule violation for plain error when it was not raised before the district court.see united states james,cir.morris must show that there is error,that is plain,and that affect s substantial rights.see united states olano,d.if all three conditions are met,an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error,but only if the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.johnson united states,d quoting olano,at.other internal quotation marks omitted.
the government concedes that morris was not made aware of the possibility of an order of restitution at either the plea hearing or in the plea agreement rule c provides 
advice to the defendant.before accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere,the court must address the defendant personally in open court and inform the defendant of,and determine that the defendant understands,the following 
the nature of the charge to which the plea is offered,the mandatory minimum penalty provided by law,if any,and the maximum possible penalty provided by law,including the effect of any special parole or supervised release term,the fact that the court is required to consider any applicable sentencing guidelines but may depart from those guidelines under some circumstances,and,when applicable,that the court may also order the defendant to make restitution to any victim of the offense.
c.because the court erred by failing to inform morris of the possibility of restitution,the next issue is whether or not this error affected his substantial rights.see.h any variance from the procedures required by this rule which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.we have identified three core objectives of rule ensuring that the guilty plea is free of coercion ensuring that the defendant understands the nature of the charges against him and ensuring that the defendant is aware of the direct consequences of the guilty plea.united states quinones,cir.failure to satisfy any of the core objectives violates the defendant substantial rights.id.
morris argues that by omitting the possibility of an order of restitution,the court failed to satisfy the concerns of rule and violated his substantial rights.both the plea agreement and the plea colloquy,however,informed morris that he faced a maximum fine of on the conspiracy to defraud count and a fine on the conspiracy to launder money count of the greater of or twice the value of the transaction.because morris faces a restitution order that is below the amount he was informed he could face in fines,the government contends that the his substantial rights were not impaired.
this is a question of first impression for this court.in united states mccarty,cir,we concluded that a defendant substantial rights were not affected when a district court failed to mention specifically the possibility of restitution but the defendant had been fully advised of his obligation to make restitution in the plea agreement.see id.at.morris,however,was not made aware of the possibility of restitution in either the plea agreement or the plea hearing.
although federal rule of criminal procedure c requires the district court to explain a defendant liability for both fines and restitution,we hold that failure to do so does not impact a defendant substantial rights where he was warned of a potential fine larger than the actual amount of restitution ordered.here,the restitution order was considerably less than the fine morris was warned of at the time of his guilty plea.in a case that involved an earlier version of rule,the supreme court stated that matters of reality,and not mere ritual,should be controlling.mccarthy united states,d citation omitted.we agree with the holding of seven of the eight circuits to have ruled on this question that a defendant is not prejudiced so long as his liability does not exceed the maximum amount that the court informed him could be imposed as a fine.it is the amount of liability,rather than the label restitution,that affects a defendant substantial rights.united states glinsey,cir accordingly,we conclude that the district court failure to mention the possibility of restitution was not plain error.
enhancement for abuse of a position of trust 
morris also contends that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence pursuant to for abuse of a position of trust.the sentencing guidelines require a increase of a defendant base offense level i f the defendant abused a position of public or private trust,or used a special skill,in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense.sentencing guidelines manual.for the adjustment to apply,the government must establish both elements that the defendant held a place of public or private trust and that the defendant abused that position in a way that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense.united states ward,cir.we review the district court fact findings for clear error,but its determination whether the facts justify an enhancement we review de novo.id.quoting united states mills,cir.
morris claims that,because he did not occupy a position of public or private trust,the enhancement was erroneous.morris was represented to the victims by his as a professional trader and a licensed attorney,both of which the government claims are positions of public trust.the government further contends that morris abused those positions when he convinced the victims of the fraud to invest or continue in their investments and by using his attorney trust account to receive,launder and transfer monies,thereby significantly facilitating the commission of the crime.
this argument is insufficient to merit the enhancement.the government states that the enhancement was appropriate because morris was represented and described as an attorney and trader,and points to our statement that the determination of whether a defendant occupied a position of trust that would warrant this enhancement is assessed from the perspective of the victim of the crime.united states garrison,cir.because the represented morris as an attorney and trader,the government asserts that he occupied a position of trust from the victims perspective.
the government argument misreads the sentencing guidelines.under the government view of,morris would face a enhancement to his sentence because of the representations of others.however,the structure of the sentencing guidelines compels the conclusion that the abuse of trust enhancement must be based on an individualized determination of each defendant culpability.united states moore,cir.the provisions of part b of chapter three of the sentencing guidelines,role in the offense,provide for adjustments to the offense level based upon the role the defendant played in committing the offense.ch,pt.b,introductory cmt.by their very nature,the role in the offense adjustments can not be based upon the actions of.moore,at.here,the government contends that the represented morris to be a trader and attorney.the language and structure of the guidelines prevents application of the enhancement to morris based upon the representation of others 
both the government statement of facts presented at the plea colloquy and the probation officer presentence report reveal evidence that the government could have presented to bolster its argument for the enhancement this is especially true given that this case involved a guilty plea and therefore the record is quite limited.according to the statement of facts,morris portrayed himself as a trader who had conducted successful dollar international bank trades in the past the statement further relates that,after the initial investments,investors contacted and maintained contact with morris directly.furthermore,morris and two other allegedly called a victim numerous times and advised,the money is on the way.the probation office conducted telephone calls to victims and reported the results in an addendum to the presentence report one victim stated that after her initial investment,she later spoke directly with the defendant who confirmed he was a practicing attorney.a second victim interviewed related that he was introduced to the defendant through brown,who identified the defendant as being an attorney and the investor or trader.morris identified himself to a third victim as the trader and indicated he was going to get him a big return on his investment.
determining what constitutes a position of trust for the purposes of is not a simple task.united states iannone,cir.in addition to the guidelines lack of a clear definition of what constitutes a position of trust,see united states mullens,cir,the determination of whether to apply the enhancement is highly dependent on the specific facts in each situation.see united states hart,cir.although the facts here make the question of the applicability of difficult,we conclude that,based upon eleventh circuit precedent,the evidence is not enough to justify the enhancement in this case.there is no doubt that the statements attributed to morris were integral to the fraud itself,but that is insufficient to justify the enhancement.see mullens,at often there is a component of misplaced trust inherent in the concept of fraud.united states koehn,cir in every successful fraud the defendant will have created confidence and trust in the victim,but the sentencing enhancement is not intended to apply in every case of fraud.morris may have abused the trust of the victims,but that is not the inquiry here.the initial question is whether or not morris occupied a position of trust.see mullens,at one must hold a position of trust before it can be abused,however.
morris status as an attorney in actuality,a attorney does not necessarily mean he abused a position of trust.although attorneys are expected to abide by ethical standards,it simply is not the case that an attorney holds a position of trust with respect to all people with whom he comes into contact solely by virtue of his status as an attorney.morris did not have an relationship with any of the victims.although morris status as an attorney may have been used to develop the trust of the victims,there are no facts to support the conclusion that as an attorney morris occupied a position of trust in relation to these victims 
the fact that morris used an attorney trust account also does not merit application of the enhancement.there was no commingling of these funds with funds and the account was not otherwise used.none of the victims had any connection to the attorney trust account,and there is no allegation that any knew of its existence instead,the victims wired or sent their funds not to morris,but to his.the in turn would transfer these funds to morris attorney trust account.morris then would immediately transfer various amounts of these commingled funds to other bank accounts in his name or the names of other persons or businesses.therefore,the use of this account does not place morris in a position of trust with respect to the victims of the fraud.we need not discuss whether the use of the attorney trust account significantly enhanced the commission or concealment of the offense because the first element required,that the defendant held a position of trust,has not been established 
some evidence supports a claim that morris represented himself as a trader to the victims.a enhancement has been applied in situations involving brokers or financial advisors.see,hart,at united states bollin,cir united states davuluri,cir united states hirsch,cir.the guidelines provide,public or private trust refers to a position of public or private trust characterized by professional or managerial discretion,cmt.the role of a financial advisor or broker is impossible to classify in general.the third circuit has stated 
i t seems apparent that the responsibilities and discretion exercised by stockbrokers spans the spectrum.at the one end are brokers who exercise authority and discretion over an account and have the power to make sales or take actions on behalf of a customer without specific direction at the other end are brokers who mechanically execute trades requested by customers.
hart,at.each situation involving a financial advisor must therefore be analyzed individually.
even assuming arguendo that morris portrayed himself as a trader and had complete discretion over the victims funds,eleventh circuit case law requires more before the enhancement will apply.the guiding precedent is mullens,which also involved the applicability of the enhancement in a situation involving investment fraud.cir.in mullens,the defendant was the head and sole stockholder in omni,his representations of being a financial advisor encouraged investors to put their life savings into omni,and he had total control over all funds.id.at.he sold investment opportunities in the form of shares,contract rights,and participation rights in limited partnerships.mullens told investors the limited partnerships were formed to purchase and sell small,privately held companies for a profit.in reality,omni was a ponzi scheme.id.at.
although mullens may have touted himself as a gifted advisor who the omni investors could trust and an investment and financial advisor,we held that w e see nothing in these circumstances to support the conclusion that a position of private trust between mullens and his victims was created.id.at.mullens thus requires more than control or discretion to justify the enhancement.as explained there,fraudulently inducing trust in an investor is not the same as abusing a bona fide relationship of trust with that investor.id.
the facts here are very similar to those in mullens.the scheme involving morris consisted of representations by the conspirators that the investors would receive very large returns on currency,and bank debenture trading programs.mullens enticed victims to invest in limited partnerships,which he claimed were formed to purchase and sell small,privately held companies for profit.both mullens and morris had complete control of the victims money,and each promised a large return based on their abilities 
what constitutes a bona fide relationship of trust is not amenable to precise definition.we explained in mullens that the defendant did not occupy a position of trust with respect to investors he cultivated at a country club where there was no evidence suggesting that mullens had a special,close,or personal attachment,or fiduciary relationship with any member of the country club.id.at.although we do not require the relationship to satisfy the legal definition of a fiduciary,united states kummer,cir,we have stated that the guideline enhancement requires more than a mere showing that the victim had confidence in the defendant.something more akin to a fiduciary function is required.united states garrison,cir quoting united states brunson,cir.garrison also quotes a similar statement from the sixth circuit a s used in the guideline,position of public or private trust is a term of art,appropriating some of the aspects of the legal concept of a trustee or fiduciary.at quoting united states ragland,cir.we need not elaborate on what constitutes a bona fide relationship of trust because the facts in this case do not prove that morris had more of a relationship of trust with his victims than did the defendant in mullens.we acknowledge that other circuits that have considered the abuse of trust enhancement under similar facts have not followed mullens however,this panel is bound by mullens as eleventh circuit precedent unless reversed by the supreme court or this court en banc.therefore,the enhancement for abuse of trust was improper.
iii.conclusion 
the restitution order is affirmed.we reverse and remand for resentencing without enhancement for abuse of a position of trust.
i concur in the majority opinion as to rule and restitution,but disagree with its reversal of the enhancement for abuse of a position of trust under.in my view,morris held a position of private trust in this scheme and abused that position to facilitate both the commission and concealment of the offense our precedent has not answered whether persons who are engaged in a business and who utilize trust bank accounts as an integral part of that business occupy a position of private trust.i would hold they do.
i first review the undisputed facts which show that morris and his not only purported to operate a business,characterized by professional and managerial expertise and discretion,but also used various trust bank accounts for their clients funds in order to facilitate and conceal the scheme.the undisputed facts are in three places in the record a the statement of facts filed with the plea agreement and then recited during the plea colloquy b the report and c admissions during the sentencing hearing.the facts filed with the plea agreement and recited almost verbatim during the plea colloquy are as follows 
during the conspiracy charged in the indictment,defendants george melvin bevre,calvin fredrick brown,robert charles stewart,james morris and royce edward tolley conducted fraudulent investment programs to obtain money from unsuspecting investors by using the telephone,facsimiles,wire transfers of funds,and the united states mail.
the five defendants induced potential investors to invest in a variety of programs and made false and fraudulent representations by wire and mail to defraud investors throughout the united states and to launder money through a fund rotation scheme,and used bank accounts in minnesota,nevada,california,colorado,maryland,alachua county,florida,and in foreign countries to move and conceal the investors funds.
they also engaged in a technique common in fraudulent schemes called layering,whereby individuals fraudulently obtain funds from investors and pass a portion on to other companies and individuals,who claim not to be the person investing the funds,and can then ostensibly cast blame on others to whom investors money was sent.in such frauds,layering and the blame game continue endlessly to stall,frustrate and eventually defeat investors who seek just compensation.
the scheme in this case consisted of fraudulent promises and representations by the defendants that investors would receive exorbitant returns on their investments in purported currency,and bank debenture trading programs.
in truth,the investment programs either did not exist or were of such dubious existence that the defendants failure to perform due diligence and their promises of investment returns constituted,at a minimum,willful blindness.
the defendants obtained investors funds by making false representations and using other persons to falsely represent to investors that the programs were legitimate opportunities in the world of international finance.
once the investors funds went into the defendants bank accounts,the defendants would use bank wire transfers to send funds to other persons and entities throughout the world to conceal the money trail and to promote the investment fraud.
from june through june,bevre made false representations to entice funds from persons to invest in fictitious currency and bank debenture trading programs,and caused those funds to be deposited into his global funding account at various financial institutions.
from late through april,brown and stewart,using the names tko maintenance and ventura enterprises,made false and misleading representations to obtain funds from investors through the united states mail and bank wire transfers.
between may,and may,george melvin bevre wire transferred million dollars from his global funding trust account at calvert shareholder services,a division of the calvert group mutual fund management firm in baltimore,maryland.bevre sent five hundred thousand dollars to brown roman carlos trust bank account at the levy county state bank in chiefland,florida,and one million dollars to stewart jonathan mencken trust bank account at the barnett bank in gainesville,florida.
brown and stewart each took approximately three hundred thousand dollars from those accounts and wire transferred to it to accounts they controlled in antigua,british west indies,from which they wire transferred funds back into the united states and used for their own benefit.
after receiving the million from bevre and skimming thousand dollars from that and other investors funds in the roman carlos trust and jonathan mencken trust accounts,brown and stewart wired million dollars to james morris,a attorney in gardnerville,nevada.
morris portrayed himself as a trader who conducted successful multimillion dollar international bank trades in the past.morris has been involved as an alleged trader with stewart in february,when brown and stewart each took from a purported investment of four hundred thousand dollars wire transferred to them.
after receiving the funds from brown and stewart in may,morris commingled them in three of his bank accounts with other moneys he had fraudulently obtained,and wire transferred hundreds of thousands of dollars to royce tolley,then an attorney in castle rock,colorado.
tolley has since been disbarred by the colorado bar for fraudulent activities with clients.both morris and tolley used trust accounts to receive and transfer funds obtained by fraudulent representations.
tolley also received wire transfers from morris in tolley echo hills swim and tennis club account.
when brown investors pressured him about their investments during the summer of,he advised them that their money had been sent to morris and that morris had transferred some of their money to tolley.the investors then contacted and maintained contact with morris,tolley,and brown.
tolley contacted investors of brown and stewart and told them that he,tolley,and james morris were attempting to find and return the investors money.in november,tolley sent investors a document titled assignment of interest in joint venture and fee agreement.
paragraph.g of that document reads 
by its signature s hereto,brown all members of the brown group agrees to forego any and all legal,civil or criminal,that it or any person or entity has against james morris,royce tolley,allen clark,pacific bank aiu,or any other person with regard to the million dollars transferred by brown group to morris for investment purposes on the condition that brown group receives the million on or before december,and the remaining million on or before february.
in a letter to calvin brown dated december,tolley stated that he had in place financial transactions totalling more than three billion dollars,and that i have a lot on the table and i believe we will work our way through these very soon.
tolley november agreement and his december letter were simply stalling tactics to keep brown investors from going to law enforcement authorities because neither he,morris,brown nor stewart had the means or intention to pay any investor.
from november through february,an investor who gave brown thousand dollars in april,received numerous telephone calls from brown,morris and tolley in which they continually stated the money is on the way,and that it would be deposited into stewart offshore accounts for payment of principal and interest to the investors.
morris also told the investor that he had cancer and was on dialysis.this investor and numerous other investors never received an interest payment or return of their principal.
morris was interviewed by the fbi and admitted that brown and stewart had wire transferred million dollars to him,but gave an excuse that the investment that he had planned was not workable.he also said brown and stewart had given him authorization to invest the money in whatever venture morris felt would return a high yield.morris said the money was to go towards the purchase or lease of million dollars in treasury bonds.
tolley was also interviewed and stated that he had dealt with morris in investment ventures in.he said brown called him in october or november about the million dollars given to morris.tolley admitted morris gave him at least six hundred thousand dollars of that money in june.he also admitted that he talked to two of brown investors and prepared an agreement in which he agreed to pay the two investors thousand dollars each.
the loss to investors during the charged mail fraud,wire fraud,and money laundering conspiracies was approximately million dollars.the individual defendants received from approximately two hundred thousand dollars to six hundred thousand dollars from their fraudulent activities the precise figure for each defendant will be determined prior to sentencing.
the report also outlined the offense conduct in similar detail.these undisputed facts are taken from that report 
james morris is an attorney licensed by the state bar of california,whose residence was in gardnerville,nevada.during the instant offense,morris was falsely portrayed to investors,by calvin brown and robert charles stewart,as a sophisticated trader of currency and bank instruments in the international financial community.when morris received wire transferred funds from brown and stewart,he would commingle those funds with other funds in his bank account and would immediately transfer various amounts of those funds to other bank accounts in his name and in the names of other persons and alleged business entities,thus rotating the funds to conceal them and prevent the funds from being traced.morris would then transfer the remaining funds to royce edward tolley,an attorney in castle rock,colorado.tolley would continue the rotation of the funds,while retaining a portion of the funds for his personal use.
bevre,also known as george hart,was the owner and controller of global funding limited trust.this trust was created on or about june,and had bank accounts at the first american bank of breckenridge,in breckenridge,minnesota and at calvert shareholder services,in baltimore,maryland.these accounts were used by to deposit and withdraw funds obtained from the fraudulent scheme.
brown was a resident of levy county,florida and was a signatory and controller of the roman carlos trust and barco resources limited accounts.the roman carlos trust account was obtained through the passport society,which provided for the creation of a colato,allegedly under the law of antigua,bwi.the passport society is an offshore investment company that sets up trust accounts,international corporations.
brown and robert stewart operated as.they induced potential investors to invest in a variety of programs and made false and fraudulent representations to investors in order to facilitate the fraud scheme.the funds obtained by the fraud scheme were then laundered through a fund rotation or shell game.
stewart was a resident of gainesville,florida,and a signatory and controller of the jonathon mencken trust and bittner group,limited.the jonathon mencken trust was obtained through the passport society,which provided for the creation of a colato,allegedly under the laws of antigua,bwi.stewart and calvin brown operated as.they induced potential investors to invest in a variety of programs and made false and fraudulent representations to investors in order to facilitate the fraud scheme.
tolley was a practicing attorney who resided in denver and castle rock,colorado.tolley received wire transfers from james morris.
at the sentencing hearing,morris counsel also acknowledged that morris was a licensed attorney.he had an attorney trust fund that was established.all of the money that was received by morris mainly from,not directly from quote victims,went into that account and that there was no other funds in that account.sent.morris admitted to receiving million in his trust fund account 
considered together,these undisputed facts reveal that morris and his operated as a business that was characterized by professional and managerial expertise and discretion and that utilized various trust accounts to engender trust and to facilitate the scheme and delay discovery of the fraud.stewart,brown,and bevre represented themselves as professional brokers.during his plea colloquy,morris admitted that morris portrayed himself as a trader who conducted successful multimillion dollar international bank trades in the past.morris also did not object to the report statement acknowledging that his also portrayed him that way to the investors.specifically,the report stated that d uring the instant offense,morris was falsely portrayed to investors,by calvin brown and robert charles stewart,as a sophisticated trader of currency and bank instruments in the international financial community.
morris also admitted he and the utilized various trust bank accounts as part of the scheme and rotated the funds through many bank accounts,including those trust accounts.the investor clients wired their money usually to one of these three trust accounts a global funding trust b roman carlos trust and c jonathan mencken trust.bevre global funding trust account was at calvert shareholder services,a division of the calvert group mutual fund management firm in baltimore,maryland.from these trust accounts,at least million in funds were wired to morris trust account.some of the money was then wired by morris to tolley trust account.these various trust accounts not only helped legitimize the transactions and engender the victims trust but also helped conceal,prevent,and delay the tracing of the funds and discovery of the fraud.
when the investor clients pressured morris,the investors then contacted and maintained contact with morris,tolley and brown.the blame game and stalling were also part of the overall scheme to provide time to conceal the funds and defeat any recovery of the funds.when the investor clients pressured tolley and morris,tolley a practicing attorney even drafted an agreement to convince the
