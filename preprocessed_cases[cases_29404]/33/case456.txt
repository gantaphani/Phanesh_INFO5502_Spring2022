david gallo gallo appeals from the district court order that pursuant to an amendment to rule of the local rules of the united states district court for the district of arizona rule,gallo no longer may appear before the district of arizona without successful completion of a pro hac vice application in his appeal,he argues that the rule is unconstitutional and that the district court erred in concluding that gallo had received sufficient notice of the applicability of the amendment to him and that the ninth circuit should exercise its supervisory power to direct the district court to apply rule a prospectively.
background 
gallo was admitted to the bar of the united states district court for the district of arizona the district court on july,under local rule,which allowed attorneys to gain admission based on their admission to the bar of any united states district court.in september,the district court amended local rule to state admission to and continuing membership in the bar of this court is limited to attorneys who are active members in good standing of the state bar of arizona.united states district court for the district of arizona,local rules a.
on may,gallo participated in the filing of bartlett arthur andersen,civ,in the district court of arizona and served as plaintiffs of record.on september,gallo received a letter,dated august,from the attorney admissions clerk of the district court in which he was informed that he was no longer admitted to appear generally before the district court of arizona.specifically,the letter stated your name has appeared on pleadings filed with this court however a review of our files indicates that you have not been admitted to practice in this court.the letter gave gallo until september,to apply for admission pro hac vice to avoid being removed as counsel of record.
on september,gallo filed an ex parte application for order clarifying status of counsel,or,alternatively,for order nunc pro tunc granting admission pro hac vice ex parte application.on october,the district court filed an order in which it denied gallo ex parte application and allowed gallo to appear in the district court pro hac vice.see order,filed october,october,order.gallo paid the dollar fee and was admitted to appear in the action pro hac vice.final judgment in the bartlett case was entered on september,and on october,gallo filed his notice of appeal we vacated and deferred submission so that we could receive briefing from the district court,the real party in.the state bar of arizona also submitted an amicus brief.
jurisdiction 
appellate jurisdiction under 
gallo case is currently before us despite the fact that gallo did not commence an official action in the district court regarding the effect of the new local rules on his ability to appear before the district court.rather,as part of the proceedings involved in his representation of the plaintiffs in bartlett,gallo requested the district court to review the august,letter informing him that he was not admitted to practice in the district court.in his ex parte application,he sought the district court reconsideration of the decision to apply the amended local rules to him.
gallo argues that the district court october,order denying his ex parte application was an interlocutory order and that pursuant to the applicable case law in the ninth circuit,his present appeal of that order is properly before us.specifically,gallo argues that jurisdiction exists because the interlocutory order constituted a collateral order that was immediately appealable.in support of this proposition,he cites estate of bishop by and through bishop bechtel power corporation,cir finding that f or the doctrine to apply,the challenged order must conclusively determine the disputed question resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the underlying action and be effectively unreviewable from a final judgment.
in accordance with bishop,gallo argues that the october,order provided a conclusive determination regarding his admission status,which was an issue unrelated to the plaintiffs claims in the underlying bartlett action.gallo also asserts that the order was unreviewable from the final judgment in the bartlett case.id.citing coopers lybrand livesay,d affirming that the purpose of the finality requirement is to combine in one review all stages of the proceeding that effectively may be reviewed and corrected if and when final judgment results internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
finally,gallo asserts that even though he did not appeal the collateral order immediately,we still have jurisdiction to review the district court decision because the order merged into the final judgment in the underlying case,bartlett,which was entered on september.city of los angeles,harbor div.santa monica baykeeper,cir citing hook arizona department of corrections,cir finding that if a party does not appeal an interlocutory order when it becomes immediately appealable,the party still has the right to appeal the interlocutory order after entry of the final judgment because the interlocutory order merges into the final judgment and may be challenged in an appeal from that judgment.thus,gallo contends that his notice of appeal was properly and timely filed on october,and that we have jurisdiction to review the district court decision.
the district court responds by arguing that as a matter of law,the district court october,order prohibiting gallo from practicing generally before it can not be reviewed upon appeal.in re wasserman,cir.the district court argues that pursuant to wasserman this court lacks jurisdiction to review an order denying a petition for admission to practice before a united states district court.in wasserman,we found that the southern district of california order barring wasserman from appearing before it was not a final decision and therefore it was unappealable.wasserman had never been admitted to the bar of the southern district of california and thus the case focused on the laws governing applications for admission to the bar.
gallo argues that his case is distinguishable because he had already obtained admission to practice before the district court.he asserts that he is not requesting reconsideration of a denial of a motion for admission based on a f ailure or refusal to act favorably upon such an application.wasserman,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.rather,he claims he is seeking redress for an improper disbarment.in light of the fact that gallo previously had been admitted to practice before the district court,his situation may not qualify as a run of the mill application.and,as discussed below,there are constitutional dimensions to gallo situation.
as the district court stated in its october,order,however,under the local rules in effect at the time gallo sought to practice before the district court,he no longer met the eligibility requirements for continuing membership,which required membership in the state bar of arizona.moreover,unlike some other districts who have revised their respective local rules governing admission,these local rules do not include a grandfather clause.see,local rules of practice for the united states district court for the district of,local rule b after october,an applicant for admission to membership in the bar of this court must be an attorney who is a member in good standing of the bar of the state of.local rules for the united states district court for the northern district of california,local rule b after the effective date of these rules,an applicant for admission to membership in the bar of this court must be an attorney who is an active member in good standing of the state bar of california.thus,gallo no longer met the requirements for membership in the bar of the district court.as discussed below,even if gallo had a property interest in his membership,the district court had a legitimate reason for altering the local rules governing admission such that its amendment passes the rational basis test.accordingly,under either analysis,his ex parte application was necessarily an application for admission.
consistent with its interpretation of wasserman,the district court also argues that gallo reliance on estate of bishop is misplaced.it correctly points out that in estate of bishop the issue before this court was whether an order denying a motion to remand to state court was an appealable order.despite the detailed analysis of the collateral order exception,the district court argues that estate of bishop nevertheless precludes a finding that gallo appeal is reviewable because such review is confined to whether the federal district court would have had jurisdiction had the case been filed in federal court in the posture it had at the time of the entry of final judgment.estate of bishop,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the district court argues that because wasserman precludes finding jurisdiction over the substance of gallo appeal,gallo reliance on estate of bishop is unavailing 
upon consideration of the district court arguments under wasserman and estate of bishop,we agree that appellate jurisdiction to review an order by the district court denying admission to practice generally before it is lacking.irrespective of whether the october,order constitutes an interlocutory order on appeal,it is nonetheless an order issued by the district court denying gallo request for a waiver from the local rules in effect at the time he submitted filings on behalf of his clients.as this circuit and other circuits have found,the denial of a petition for admission to a district court bar is neither a final order appealable under section nor an interlocutory order appealable under.wasserman,at.accordingly,we do not have appellate jurisdiction to review the denial of gallo ex parte application to appear before the district court.
in his opening brief and reply,gallo attempts to distinguish this precedent by characterizing both the initial letter sent to him on august,and the october,order as a disbarment action,rather than a denial of an application for admission.accordingly,he argues that such action is inappropriate in the absence of any findings of misconduct or unfitness,the only grounds,he asserts,upon which an attorney who has been admitted to a bar may lose his or her license.as stated above,we recognize that gallo situation differs somewhat from the situation in wasserman because he previously was licensed to appear generally before the court.however,we disagree that the district court action constitutes a disbarment.gallo ex parte application was a petition to the district court for a waiver of rule,or,alternatively,permission to proceed pro hac vice.the application constituted a request to practice before the court despite the existing laws proscribing such appearances.as discussed,infra,the amended law is constitutional on its face and as applied by the district court to gallo situation.
as recognized by gallo,disbarment proceedings generally involve an ethical violation sufficient to prevent an attorney from appearing in any capacity before the district court.all parties concede that the decision to enforce the amended version of the local rules was not based on any character determination or other ethical considerations.to the contrary,gallo was granted pro hac vice admission.thus,the district court order is aptly characterized as a denial of gallo application for a waiver of the local rules as otherwise applicable to him.accordingly,the law established in wasserman applies such that the district court october,order is neither final nor appealable and jurisdiction under section does not exist.
petition for writ of mandamus under a 
alternatively,gallo argues that this court should treat his october,notice of appeal as a petition for writ of mandamus.in the absence of appellate jurisdiction pursuant to,jurisdiction may exist under a.see miller gammie,cir en banc treating notice of appeal where appellate jurisdiction was lacking as a petition for a writ of mandamus a a ll courts established by act of congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.to determine whether to issue a writ of mandamus,we must consider the following five factors 
the party seeking the writ has no other adequate means,such as a direct appeal,to attain the relief he or she desires.
the petitioner will be damaged or prejudiced in a way not correctable on appeal.
the district court order is clearly erroneous as a matter of law.
the district court order is an error,or manifests a persistent disregard of the federal rules.
the district court order raises new and important problems,or issues of law of first impression.

the district court argues that the third factor is dispositive in this case such that our review of the district court order for clear error will determine whether we should issue a writ of mandamus.indeed,it is well established in this circuit that w hen a district court decision is correct as a matter of law,a writ of mandamus should be denied.in re allen,at citing rosenfeld united states,cir survival.div.of the whittaker united states dist.court,cir.accordingly,we will review the district court decision for clear error.
standard of review 
in light of our conclusion that we do not have appellate jurisdiction over the district court decision to deny gallo request to practice generally before it,we decline to review the district court conclusions of law de novo.in the absence of a direct appeal,we shall treat gallo challenge to the district court order as a petition for writ of mandamus.accordingly,we review the district court october,order for clear error as a matter of law.executive software north america,united states dist.court,cir 
discussion 
district court order 
as established above,the district court october,order did not disbar gallo and all attorneys similarly situated.instead,it affirmed that gallo was no longer eligible for continuing membership in the bar of the district court.the district court also determined that the amended local rules governing admission and membership should not be waived to account for the fact that under the former version of the rules,gallo previously had been admitted to practice generally before the district court.it determined that pursuant to the inherent authority of federal district courts to regulate the practice of law in their forums,the amendments to the local rules were both constitutional on their face and as applied to gallo situation.the district court declined to find that at a minimum,the amended local rules should be applied prospectively to recognize and preserve gallo previous admission and membership.the district court also determined that gallo had not suffered a due process violation but was granted admission to practice before the district court of arizona on a basis through the avenue of pro hac vice.
we now review this decision for clear error and begin our analysis by considering the constitutional dimensions of gallo claim.although the district court declined to address the constitutional arguments,we believe it is necessary to conduct a thorough review of whether application of the amended rule a in this case deprived gallo of a constitutionally protected property interest in his license to practice generally before the district court of arizona.we nonetheless arrive at the same outcome as the district court because we find that when analyzed under the applicable constitutional scrutiny,the district court amendment was to a legitimate state interest in ensuring the fitness of lawyers who appear before it.
we then discuss the remainder of the district court opinion to determine whether the district court properly applied the amended version of the local rules governing admission and continuing membership in the bar of the district court.as suggested in our previous discussion regarding jurisdiction,gallo ability to appear before the district court subsequent to the amendments is governed by the laws in effect at the time of the proceeding.after discussion of this issue,we turn to the question of whether gallo received sufficient and proper notice of the relevant changes in the local rules.
constitutionality of rule a 
the amendments to the local rules are similar to laws adopted by the majority of federal district courts.zambrano city of tustin,cir holding that a dmission to the state bar is the essential determinant of professional ethics and legal competence citing in re evans,cir.as we established above,we do not find that the district court subjected gallo to a disbarment action.however,we recognize that no jurisdiction has enacted a requirement that divests an attorney of his license to practice,which is the effect of the provision in this case.accordingly,we must consider whether this provision has deprived gallo of a constitutionally protected property interest.
substantive due process 
the supreme court has held that property interests derive not from the constitution but from existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.bd.of regents of state coll.roth,d.to have a property interest in a benefit,a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it.he must have more than a unilateral expectation of it.he must,instead,have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.id.
we have recognized in a number of contexts that an individual has a legitimate property interest in his or her professional license.see brown smith in re poole,cir sabow united states,cir holding that physician has a constitutionally protected property interest in his or her medical license see also barry barchi,d.our case law holds that a professional license,once conferred,constitutes an entitlement subject to constitutional protection.accordingly,it may be argued that in this case,procedural alternatives,including pro hac vice admission,provide an inadequate substitute for the individual previously conferred property interest.see dittman,cir holding that acupuncturist is entitled to substantive and procedural due process analysis where california required him to submit his social security number to renew his state license brown mcgarr,cir holding that attorney entitled to substantive and procedural due process analysis where general order revoked licenses of trial lawyers who did not have certain level of trial experience.
applying the constitutional analysis to this case,a retroactive licensing scheme not affecting fundamental rights will pass scrutiny if the scheme bears a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest.see ass for the advancement of psychoanalysis cal.bd.of psychology,cir schware bd.of bar exam rs of state of,d stating that any qualifications to the state bar must have a rational connection with the applicant fitness or capacity to practice law 
we applied the rational basis standard in lupert california state bar,cir,to address california state bar requirement that students from unaccredited law schools pass certain examinations.we held that the requirement did not violate equal protection because it served the legitimate purpose of protecting students from pursuing a profession for which they did not qualify and aided persons in assessing the quality of training provided by the schools.id.at.we held likewise in national association for the advancement of psychoanalysis.plaintiffs argued that california licensing scheme violated their due process rights by prohibiting them from assuming the title psychologist.id.at.we held that the licensing scheme,which contained certain educational requirements,was rationally related to california interest in protecting the mental health and safety of california citizens.id.
from lupert and national association for the advancement of psychoanalysis emerges the rule that any conceivable basis will justify the constitutionality of a licensing scheme not affecting fundamental rights.lupert,at.federal courts have inherent and broad regulatory authority to make rules respecting the admission,practice,and discipline of attorneys in the federal courts.robinson,wall.garland,wall.courts have specific authorization under,which states in pertinent part 
a the supreme court and all courts established by act of congress may from time to time prescribe rules for the conduct of their business.such rules shall be consistent with acts of congress and rules of practice and procedure prescribed under section of this title.
b any rule prescribed by a court,other than the supreme court,under subsection a shall be prescribed only after giving appropriate public notice and an opportunity for comment.such rule shall take effect upon the date specified by the prescribing court and shall have such effect on pending proceedings as the prescribing court may order.
emphasis added.
historically,however,the licensing and regulation of lawyers has been left exclusively to the states and the district of columbia within their respective jurisdictions.leis flynt,d.the states supply not only the qualifications for admission to practice and the standards of professional conduct but also the guidelines and machinery for the discipline of lawyers.id.the state bar of arizona,under the authority and supervision of the arizona supreme court,administers arizona system of attorney admission and regulation.the state bar oversees the admission of attorneys,monitors continuing legal education,and maintains the integrity of the profession.
in russell hug,cir,we held that district courts may rely on the infrastructure provided by state bar associations in meeting their own needs for monitoring attorney admission and practice in the federal courts.the pertinent issue in russell concerned the constitutionality of a general order issued by the northern district of california that required private attorneys selected to represent indigent defendants to be members of the california state bar.we upheld the requirement under the equal protection clause because the rule served the district court legitimate interest in ensuring a uniform minimum level of competence for lawyers.id.at.we stated 
because there are more than fifty bar examinations in the united states,the minimum standard of competence required to be a lawyer arguably varies considerably among the states.requiring membership in the california bar allows the northern district of california to be sure that all attorneys are at least capable enough to clear the standard required in standard with which the northern district is familiar,and a standard that is quite possibly higher than that of many other states.
the russell court also concluded that the northern district requirement that attorneys be members of the bar in good standing was rationally related to the federal court legitimate interest in policing standards of ethical conduct of the lawyers who practice law on the indigent panel.id.at.we stated that the california bar membership requirement makes discipline easier for the northern district because the california bar provides the northern district with a disciplinary mechanism complementary to its own.id.finally,the court noted that the adoption of california requirements permitted the district court to bring allegations of professional misconduct to the attention of the california state bar.id.
rule a is similar to the general order at issue in russell.in both cases,the local rule serves the legitimate interest of ensuring that all attorneys practicing before the courts clear the standard required by the respective state bar associations id.at.in its amicus brief,the arizona state bar argues that because the district court does not have its own administrative staff to supervise and regulate the conduct and ethics of attorneys who appear before it,it relies heavily upon the resources of the state bar to implement these rules.absent the arizona state bar assistance in undertaking the administrative steps necessary to enforce the regulations governing attorney conduct,questions of misconduct may never properly come before the district court.
indeed,the standard for admission in both arizona and california may well exceed that required in other states.nonetheless,rule a serves the court legitimate interest in simplifying the disciplinary process.no longer must the district court refer wayward lawyers to bar associations.the amended version of rule a permits the district court to limit disciplinary referrals to the arizona state bar.the arizona state bar also provides a number of procedures that permit the district court to file disciplinary complaints free from public exposure.if the district court files a complaint,the arizona state bar brings the complaint on behalf of the district court.the district court is not guaranteed the same privacy when referring attorneys to other state bar associations.this special procedure provides an additional legitimate justification for amending rule a.
in light of this analysis,we conclude that the retroactive application of the arizona bar requirement does not violate gallo substantive due process rights because it is justified by the rational purpose of streamlining and perfecting the regulation of attorney admission in the arizona district court.
procedural due process 
gallo also contends that the new licensing scheme resulted in the deprivation of his property without adequate notice and opportunity to be heard.whether an affected party is entitled to individual notice and a hearing depends upon the character of the action.when the action is purely legislative,the statute satisfies due process if the enacting body provides public notice and open hearings.texaco short,d b.i t has never been suggested that each citizen must in some way be given specific notice of the impact of a new statute on his property before that law may affect his property rights.inv.state bd.of equalization.holding that individual notice is not necessary if the government imposes a rule of conduct that applies to more than a few people halverson skagit county,cir.
when the government action is adjudicative,however,due process requires notice reasonably calculated,under all circumstances,to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.mullane cent.hanover bank trust.londoner denver.finding procedural due process violated where law affected a relatively small number of persons.
indeed,the line between legislation and adjudication is not always easy to draw,lc s,warren county area plan comm n,cir.however,this is not one of the more difficult cases.the three primary considerations are whether the government action applies to specific individuals or to unnamed and unspecified persons whether the promulgating agency considers general facts or adjudicates a particular set of disputed facts and whether the action determines policy issues or resolves specific disputes between particular parties.united states.coast,d harris county of riverside,cir mcgarr,at.
in mcgarr,the seventh circuit considered a general order issued by the illinois district court that required trial attorneys to have a certain level of trial experience.at.the rule revoked the licenses of those lawyers who did not have the requisite level of experience.as in this case,the plaintiff claimed that because the rule changed the admission requirements after he had qualified for admission,the local order effectively disbarred him.id.at.similar to the reasons set forth by the district court in this case,the seventh circuit rejected the plaintiff claim,stating 
disbarment is a punishment or penalty imposed on the lawyer.a court conducting a disbarment proceeding must determine for itself the facts of the attorney conduct and whether that conduct had been so grievous as to require disbarment.thus,the ultimate result of a disbarment proceeding is a finding,based upon the conduct and actions of an individual attorney,that the individual attorney is unfit.unlike a disbarment proceeding focused upon specific incidents of misconduct by an individual attorney,the district court trial bar rules were adopted in response to fact finding that was not focused on individual attorneys.

the present case is indistinguishable.the requirement that all attorneys be members of the arizona bar was adopted to streamline the district court attorney regulation procedures.the effect of the law is to revoke a general class of licenses,but unlike a disbarment proceeding,the ground for doing so is not individual attorney misconduct.ohio bell.pub.util.comm n.holding that a retroactive rate determination based solely on facts about one supplier is adjudicative.rule a is directed at the legitimate government purpose of improving the method and means of attorney regulation in the federal district courts,and it attempts to achieve this goal without targeting individual misconduct.
since the amended rule affects a large number of people,as opposed to targeting a small number of individuals based on individual factual determinations,gallo claim that he is entitled to individual notice and an opportunity to be heard fails because the amended legislative rule does not give rise to constitutional procedural due process requirements.christensen yolo county bd.of supervisors,cir see also harris,at holding that no individual notice and hearing required where county decisions affect large numbers of people mcgarr,at.
in most cases an individual would be entitled to individual notice and an opportunity to be heard before retroactive extinguishment of his or her vested property interest.justice scalia has commented that the central distinction between and adjudication is that rules have legal consequences only for the future.bowen georgetown,d scalia,concurring.nevertheless,this case presents the unique situation in which the rule,although having that central distinction of retroactivity,resembles legislation in every other way.namely,the government action applies to unnamed and unspecified persons,the district court considered general rather than particular facts and,rather than resolving specific disputes between particular parties,the action determines policy issues regarding the regulation of attorney admissions in the federal courts.
for these reasons,we conclude that even when subjected to a constitutional analysis,the balance of factors weighs in favor of finding that the enactment of local rule a is a legislative act such that gallo claim fails.even though he arguably was deprived of a vested property interest,the rule bears a rational relationship to legitimate government interests.
applicability of local rule 
as discussed above,we do not characterize the actions taken by the district court as an unconstitutional disbarment.it is the well established law that a court power to disbar can only be exercised where there has been such conduct on the part of the parties complained of as shows them to be unfit to be members of the profession.ex parte robinson,wall.see also ex parte garland,wall.here,gallo is guilty of no misconduct and the district court finding that he could not appear generally before it was not the result of any disciplinary action.instead,his ability to practice generally before the district court expired as a result of the amendments to the laws governing membership.accordingly,the district court committed no clear error by finding that the amendments did not inherently interfere with gallo ability to practice before this court.october,at.gallo still has the right to practice before the district court by seeking admission to the state bar of arizona or by requesting on a basis that he be allowed to appear before the district court pro hac vice.
having resolved that the district court did not act to disbar gallo,we address gallo additional argument that because he gained admission at one point in time,he can not now be denied the right to practice generally before the district court because the qualifications for admission have changed.he characterizes this argument as one for prospective application of rule.gallo cites the supreme court holding in selling radford,which held that where the prerequisite to admission to the bar of the supreme court was
