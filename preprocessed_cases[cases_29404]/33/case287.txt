rex carr,a successful class action lawyer in southern illinois,is locked in mortal combat with his former law partners,the defendants in a rico case with a supplemental claim,that he brought in federal district court.the dispute is over the division of legal fees in cases handled by the law firm carr korein tillery,llc before it broke up carr is seeking some million in compensatory damages alone.the district court dismissed the entire case,supplemental claim and all,under rule b failure to state a claim,on the ground that carr claims are precluded by judgments in previous suits by him against the same defendants.since res judicata is an affirmative defense,the defendant should raise it and then move for judgment on the pleadings under rule c.forty one news,county of lake,cir mccready ebay,cir.the judge thus jumped the gun in dismissing the case under rule b.but the error is of no consequence.he had before him all he needed in order to be able to rule on the defense,and anyway the plaintiff does not complain about the error.
carr appeals.the defendants from the denial of their motion for sanctions for what they contend are his abusive litigating tactics.this is carr eighth suit against the defendants complaining about the division of fees a ninth is pending in missouri and in at least four other cases that were handled by the law firm before the break up he has filed liens in an attempt to get a bigger share of the fees than the defendants had allotted to him.one of these suits,as we see,led this court to sanction carr for misconduct.
the partners had several agreements concerning allocation of fees these continued in force when the firm ceased to engage in the practice of law in,though it continued a twilight existence to administer the allocation of fees earned but not yet paid by clients in cases pending when the firm ceased practice.a further agreement was also adopted then.disputes over the allocation of fees erupted the following year and led to a flurry of suits in an illinois state court.the disputes were so it a memorandum of understanding drafted by carr and agreed to in april by the other former partners.the memorandum specified in part by adoption of the terms in the previous agreements how all,present,and be allocated among the former partners.it provided that when fees came in to the partner who had handled a case,he would pay over the entire amount to the law firm the shell for determination of how much each of the other partners was entitled to.the memorandum also required that the suits be dismissed.
one of the suits was a declaratory judgment action brought by the other partners the defendants in this case against carr.he had filed a counterclaim and in may,before the suit was dismissed as required by the memorandum,he amended the counterclaim to add a claim that he had been fraudulently induced to sign the memorandum of understanding.more than two years later,in september,the illinois court in which carr suits were pending rejected the counterclaim and entered final judgment,pursuant to the memorandum,dismissing with prejudice all the pending suits.the judgment was affirmed by the illinois appellate court in december and carr did not seek review by the supreme court of illinois.
the complaint in his present suit repeats many of the charges in the suits,including the charge that he was fraudulently induced to sign the memorandum of understanding and that the defendants had violated the previous agreements,which the memorandum had superseded.all those charges are barred by the dismissal with prejudice of the suits.the fact that the present suit redescribes the wrongful acts alleged in the earlier ones as predicate acts in support of the rico claim is irrelevant.you can not maintain a suit,arising from the same transaction or events underlying a previous suit,simply by a change of legal theory.that is called claim splitting,and is barred by the doctrine of res judicata.nowak rita high school,river park,city of highland park,curtis lofy,d,brzostowski laidlaw waste systems,cir illinois law.
as if this were not enough,those charges and more,as we see are also barred by illinois one refiling,or,as it is sometimes called,single refiling,rule.in march and april,while the dismissal of carr counterclaim in the earlier litigation was pending on appeal,he filed four lawsuits against the defendants in illinois state courts.he filed the present suit three weeks after the filing of the fourth suit,and within days of doing so voluntarily dismissed all four suits the dismissal orders state that the dismissals are without prejudice.illinois law provides that a plaintiff who voluntarily dismisses a suit may commence a new action within one year or within the remaining period of limitation,whichever is greater.ilcs.the illinois courts interpret this to mean that a plaintiff who voluntarily dismisses a suit may commence only one new action.timberlake illini hospital,flesner youngs development,gendek jehangir,schrager grossman,d,ugent,d,ko eljer industries,d,eskridge cook county,cir illinois law.it is true that fanaro first national bank,d,held the contrary,but it was explicitly rejected by the supreme court of illinois in the timberlake case.
carr concedes that the rule is applicable to the refiling in a federal court of a suit originally filed in an illinois state court,because it is a rule of preclusion,like res judicata and a federal court is required to give full faith and credit to records of including judgments in state judicial proceedings.kremer chemical construction,d allen mccurry,d.so if illinois courts would invoke the rule to bar the plaintiff from bringing the present suit in an illinois state court as he could have done,because state courts have concurrent jurisdiction with federal courts to enforce rico,we must do likewise.mcknight dean,cir.
there are two ways of thinking about the application of the rule to this case.one,which is much the less plausible,requires treating the four suits,insofar as they repeated charges in the suits,as a first refiling,so that the present suit,which carr acknowledges arises from the same facts as the suits that he filed and promptly dismissed in,is a second refiling.he argues that the illinois rule applies only when the first refiled suit is dismissed before the second one is filed otherwise the second refiled suit is really new.that is not correct,as the illinois appellate court held in schrager grossman,supra,at,and as we noted in eskridge cook county,supra,at.see also rockford mutual ins.blaase,d.the new action is the action filed later the date on which the previous action was dismissed is irrelevant.the rico suit was a new action because it was filed after the suits.failing without excuse to make up his mind whether he wanted to be in state or federal court,carr filed five lawsuits in place of a single suit that would have included all the claims in the five separate suits.
but if the four suits filed in are treated as the first refiling of the litigation,the illinois rule bars relitigation in this suit only of claims arising from acts prior to carr filing of the counterclaim in may for the basis on which the illinois courts decide whether a suit is a refiling is whether,had its predecessor been dismissed with prejudice,it would be barred by principles of res judicata.ugent,supra,at.the rule is thus the extension of the doctrine of res judicata to a class of cases in which the decision deemed to be res judicata is a dismissal without prejudice.the complaint in this present case is not quite just a rehash of the litigation,for it also do the four suits that the plaintiff filed in even if the memorandum of understanding is valid and enforceable,as the illinois state courts have held,the defendants have violated it by not giving the plaintiff the fees to which it entitles him.
the second way of applying the rule to this case,and we think the right way in light of both the illinois case law and the practicalities of the situation,is to treat the first of the four suits filed in as the first in a series of identical cases filed,the second such suit as the first refiling,and the third and fourth,critically,the present further refilings,thus barred by the rule.indeed,this is the only approach in which the rule does any work.for if the first filing was the litigation,the first refiling the four suits treated as one,and the third and thus barred refiling the present suit,the fact that the four suits were voluntarily dismissed would have no significance they would be just the first refiling of a suit the litigation dismissed with prejudice in september.the rule adds nothing to res judicata when the judgment in the first case was with prejudice indeed,it does apply,because the rule is about using a voluntary dismissal to preclude relitigation of a claim,and the dismissal of carr counterclaim was involuntary.and we about to see that a plaintiff is not allowed to maintain duplicative suits that creates just the kind of confusion and imposes just the kind of judicial burdens that inform the policy behind the rule.
each of the four suits presented a theory or ground of liability that was different from the theory or ground in the other three suits,or sought different relief.the four were a suit for an accounting,a suit seeking a declaratory judgment on the allocation of fees,a suit for breach of contract,and a suit charging a conspiracy.all four arose from the same events or transactions,this was the only new claim,the only one not barred by res alleged nonpayment of fees due after the memorandum of understanding was adopted and after carr counterclaim was filed a month later.his multiplication of suits all arising from the same dispute was classic claim splitting,which the doctrine of res judicata bars,rein david noyes,see also ilcs,as we noted in connection with his recasting his claims as a rico claim.
carr argues that despite cases like rein and the other cases we cited nowak,river park,his claim splitting is permitted by illinois law.he cites kellerman mci telecommunications.the issue was whether an illinois court should have stayed a case before it because a suit between the same parties arising from the same facts was pending in a federal court.because the claims were different,and there was much evidentiary overlap,the court held that the denial of the stay was proper.this,rather than strict application of the bar against claim splitting,is a common approach when parallel proceedings are pending in different jurisdictions,especially when each suit was initiated by a different one of the adversaries.the parallel cases can proceed,but the judgment in the first case in which a final judgment on the merits is entered will be res judicata in the other suit if the other requirements for res judicata same transaction or occurrence,same parties or their privies,are satisfied.pfaff chrysler,mizuho holding,cir illinois law.allowing both suits to proceed until one goes to judgment may be more economical than staying or dismissing one,which might require the parties to port issues or evidence from that case to the other case.staley swift,combined ins.certain underwriters at lloyd london,d,compare skipper marine electronics,cybernet marine products,d.
this case might seem similar because three of the four cases were filed in the illinois trial court of one county and one in the trial court of another illinois county.but are different counties of the same state and neighboring county and clair county,both part of the louis metropolitan area different jurisdictions for purposes of deciding whether the plaintiff has split his claim between the two courts the answer is no.staley swift,supra,at tumminaro tumminaro,d.and even if the courts in the different illinois counties were considered different jurisdictions,this would leave us with three of the four suits filed by carr in in one jurisdiction.the second of those suits was a first refiling,so the third this case,the barred by the rule.the fact that the fourth case was filed before the previous ones were dismissed is,as we said earlier,irrelevant.
so the district court was right to dismiss the entire case after all,though on the basis of the rule rather than res judicata,which as we explained would not bar a claim that the defendants had violated the memorandum of understanding.
the defendants also defend the dismissal of the present suit on the alternative ground that the rico claim has no merit.and they are right that it creates doubt whether the federal courts have jurisdiction of this lawsuit if not,the entire case must be dismissed without prejudice.this would not permit the plaintiff to refile the rico claim a jurisdictional ruling on an issue that has been fully and fairly adjudicated is barred from subsequent challenge by the doctrine of collateral estoppel,hill potter,cir okoro bohman,cir coors brewing,cir bromwell michigan mutual ins,cir deutsch flannery,cir.this illustrates the pertinent point that a dismissal can be without prejudice yet have preclusive effect another example,of course,is the rule.
but let not forget the supplemental claim as the parties are not of diverse jurisdiction,there is no basis on which that claim can be retained in the district court if there is no jurisdiction over the federal claim.even so,if carr tried to refile the supplemental claim in state court he would be barred by the rule under any view of the application of that rule to this case.he filed the claim first in one of the four suits that were dismissed at best for him the refiling of the claim in this suit insofar as the claim is based just on the alleged violations of the memorandum of understanding,the only claim not barred by res judicata is his first refiling illinois law does not permit a second one.
so probably it makes no practical difference whether the dismissal of the rico claim should be based on lack of jurisdiction or on lack of merit.but we do need to decide which it should be,as a simple affirmance would be error if the district court lacked jurisdiction.
a suit that is utterly frivolous does not engage the jurisdiction of the federal courts.hagans lavine,d johnson orr,cir jogi voges,cir.what that means as a practical matter is that if it is clear beyond any reasonable doubt that a case does belong in federal court,the parties can not by agreeing to litigate it there authorize the federal courts to decide it.insurance of ireland,compagnie des bauxites de guinee,d eeoc chicago club,cir.we once gave the example of a hypothetical dispute over bananas described by the parties as securities so that they could litigate their dispute in the federal courts under federal securities law.crowley cutlery united states,cir.congress would not have wanted the federal courts to waste their time with such a case,and the courts therefore have an independent duty to refuse to entertain it.
the presumption,however,is that the dismissal of even a very weak case should be on the merits rather than because it was too weak even to engage federal jurisdiction.travelers casualty surety of america,northwestern mutual life ins,cir johnson wattenbarger,cir williamson tucker,cir.hence our use of the term utterly frivolous.otherwise courts would spend too much time distinguishing degrees of weakness.and there is a certain perversity in a jurisdictional dismissal it permits the plaintiff to refile his case,albeit as we noted not on the ground on which the dismissal was based.
the rico claim in this case is weak,indeed feeble.the complaint contains fraud allegations that would create a prima facie rico case,but they are barred by res judicata because they relate to conduct that preceded the alleged violations of the memorandum of understanding and arose from the same events that gave rise to carr four suits.what is not barred by res judicata though barred by the rule are the allegations of violations of the memorandum.but those allegations amount merely to a breach of contract claim,which can not be transmogrified into a rico claim by the facile device of charging that the breach was fraudulent,indeed criminal.rico is not a proper vehicle for levering a breach of contract suit between citizens of the same state into federal court,and under a statute that entitles a successful plaintiff to treble damages and attor
