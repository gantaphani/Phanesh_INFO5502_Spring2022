plaintiffs,tem horwitz and horwitz matthews,collectively,horwitz matthews,filed a complaint in the circuit court of cook county against the law firm of sabo zahn the firm and its clients,defendants holabird root,jeffrey case,gerald horn,and james baird collectively,holabird root,alleging,inter alia,tortious interference with business relationships.sabo zahn is not involved in this appeal,and only count vi is at issue here.count vi sought relief against holabird root as a principal who acted by and through its attorneys,sabo zahn.
the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of holabird root,ruling as a matter of law that holabird root could not be liable for its attorneys actions.horwitz matthews appealed and the appellate court reversed and remanded,with one justice dissenting.d.we granted holabird root petition for leave to appeal.we now must decide whether,and if so when,a client may be held vicariously liable for an attorney allegedly intentional tortious conduct.
background 
holabird root is a general partnership in the architectural business.case,horn,and baird are its partners.holabird root retained sabo zahn to collect a debt incurred by horwitz matthews for architectural services.horwitz matthews is an illinois corporation that develops real estate with private investors.in the course of representing holabird root,sabo zahn obtained a judgment against horwitz matthews.
in response to a citation to discover assets,horwitz matthews provided sabo zahn with various tax returns.according to uncontradicted deposition testimony,this tax information was the subject of a confidentiality agreement.specifically,sabo zahn agreed not to disclose the tax information to anyone outside its law firm.through discovery,sabo zahn also learned the identity of several business associates and investors of horwitz matthews.sabo zahn contacted at least of these business associates and investors by letter,informing them that on its tax returns horwitz matthews had apportioned itself a greater percentage than it was entitled of the partnership business.the letters also stated that the partnership tax filing showed the investors share of the loss was underreported.the letters were on the firm stationery and stated,we represent holabird root who have a judgment against horwitz matthews.
horwitz matthews filed a complaint against sabo zahn and holabird root.the trial court dismissed counts i through iv,sounding in defamation and levied at both sabo zahn and holabird root.count v sought relief solely against sabo zahn.count vi sought relief for tortious interference with business relationships solely against holabird root as a principal acting by and through its attorneys,sabo zahn.
the trial court granted holabird root subsequent motion for summary judgment on count vi and ruled as a matter of law that holabird root could not be held liable for its attorneys actions.horwitz matthews appealed.in reversing the grant of summary judgment in favor of holabird root,the appellate court held that the relationship in this case was one governed by the laws of agency with holabird root as the principal and sabo zahn as the agent.d at.the appellate court reasoned that,although attorneys are independent contractors of their clients regarding their physical activities washington caseyville health care ass n,d,there were no allegations of any physical activities undertaken by sabo zahn therefore,sabo zahn would not be an independent contractor in its relationship with the holabird root defendants.d at.according to the appellate court,sabo zahn misconduct could be attributed to holabird root under the law of agency,binding principals by their chosen agents deeds.d at,see diersen chicago car exchange,cir.
the appellate court also found that a genuine issue of material fact existed concerning whether sabo zahn acted within the scope of its authority in sending the letters to the various business partners of holabird root.d at.in support of this conclusion,the appellate court relied on the discovery depositions of werner sabo and james zahn.each stated that the firm was performing a task it had been hired to accomplish.the appellate court also relied on defendant james baird discovery deposition statement that the letters sent by sabo zahn indicated to him that the law firm was pursuing the fee in an aggressive way and that the firm was serving them as their clients.
finally,the appellate court held that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether holabird root ratified sabo zahn misconduct.according to the appellate court,
it is not clear from the record when the holabird root defendants became aware of the letters,and when they did,if they ever disapproved of the letters being mailed or if by their silence and conduct they approved the letters.whether the holabird root defendants actions or lack thereof constituted a ratification is a question of fact.d at.
given the appellate court opinion that there were genuine issues of material fact,the appellate court remanded the cause for further proceedings.
in dissent,presiding justice hoffman stated that the decision was flawed.d at,hoffman,dissenting.the dissent concluded that,in cases involving an attorney pursuing a claim without further direction,the attorney should be held to be an independent contractor.d at,hoffman,dissenting.according to the dissent,since sabo zahn was an independent contractor,holabird root could not be held vicariously liable for its allegedly tortious conduct.the dissent reasoned that there was no vicarious liability primarily because an employer has no right to control the manner of doing the work performed by the independent contractor.see hartley red ball transit.
according to the dissent,even if sabo zahn is deemed to be holabird root agent,summary judgment was appropriately granted to holabird root because sabo zahn acted outside the scope of its authority.d at,hoffman,dissenting.the dissent reasoned 
t he general retention of an attorney to do all things necessary to pursue a claim should,as a matter of law,be interpreted as authorizing the attorney only to do all things legal and proper to pursue the claim and should not be construed,without more,as giving the attorney direction or permission to commit a tortious act.where there is no evidence that the client expressly or impliedly authorized,directed,knew of,or ratified the alleged tortious conduct of its attorney,it should not be presumed that,merely because the parties stand in the relationship of,the client intended or authorized the tortious conduct or that the conduct was within the scope of the attorney duties.d at,hoffman,dissenting.
concerning the propriety of summary judgment,the dissent further stated 
in this case,there is no evidence that the alleged tortious content of the letters sent to the business associates and investors of horwitz matthews was ordered or directed by holabird root,nor do i believe that there is any evidentiary material in the record that creates a genuine issue of fact on the question of whether the holabird root defendants knew of the contents of the letters before they were sent by sabo zahn.jeffrey case and james baird,both holabird root partners,denied seeing the letters before they were sent.their testimony constitutes the only competent evidentiary material of record on the issue since,as the appellate court points out,the most that sabo zahn is able to say is that no one at the firm can recall whether the letters were shown to anyone at holabird root before they were sent.d at,hoffman,dissenting.
holabird root now appeals.
summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings,depositions,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.ilcs c west gilbert sycamore municipal hospital.summary judgment should not be granted unless the right of the moving party is clear and free from doubt.purtill hess.while the nonmoving party in a summary judgment motion is not required to prove his or her case,the nonmovant must present a factual basis arguably entitling that party to a judgment.michigan avenue national bank county of cook.we review de novo all cases involving summary judgment.espinoza elgin,joliet eastern ry.
holabird root arguments on appeal essentially follow the reasoning expressed in presiding justice hoffman dissent.initially,holabird root maintains that the specific factual situation in this case is one of first impression for this court.accordingly,holabird root contends that the cases cited by horwitz matthews and the appellate court are inapposite and do not control the disposition.
as we stated in gomien aluminum,
generally,it is the law that a master is liable for the acts of his servant committed within the scope of his employment that a principal is liable for the acts of his agent performed within the scope of the agency but neither is liable for the acts of an independent contractor unless the act or omission causing harm was pursuant to the order or direction of the principal or employer,or unless under certain circumstances,the principal or employer failed to exercise reasonable care in selecting a careful and competent contractor.gomien,at.
in the relationship,clients are generally bound by their attorneys acts or omissions during the course of the legal representation that fall within the apparent scope of their attorneys authority.see,webster hartman,this court has long held that counsel must possess express consent or authorization to compromise or settle a case.moreover,the relationship is a fiduciary relationship.see,in re imming,in re schuyler.as fiduciaries,attorneys owe to their clients the basic obligations of agency loyalty and obedience.restatement second of agency,comment a,at.nonetheless,this case does not involve an attorney duty to a client,but rather an attorney duty to a third party.thus,holabird root has accurately pointed out that there is no illinois decision addressing whether clients may be held liable for their attorneys alleged intentional torts against a third party undertaken without the direction or knowledge of the client.
in flight kitchen,chicago bottling,d,heavily relied upon by horwitz matthews,the plaintiff filed an action to recover damages allegedly suffered by reason of an averred trespass to its property by the defendant attorney.in enforcing a judgment rendered on behalf of the plaintiff against a third party,the attorney wrongfully directed the sheriff to levy against the property of an innocent third party.the client was fully aware of the levy against the wrong party.in fact,the client executed a bond to institute the levy proceeding.thus,the misconduct engaged in by the attorney was committed with the full knowledge and direction of the client.flight kitchen,d at.that is not the case here.a factual scenario more clearly on point was presented in a case cited by holabird root,in re berry publishing services.
in berry,a party attempted to purchase a bankruptcy debtor interest in certain assets at a sale.the purchaser later commenced a cause of action against the bankruptcy trustee and the trustee attorney,alleging tortious interference with the purchaser contracts or prospective business relationships.the claims stemmed from a letter sent by the trustee attorney without the knowledge of the trustee to several of the purchaser clients,opining that the purchaser had not actually acquired the assets at issue.in addition to recovery against the trustee attorney,the purchaser also sought recovery against the trustee premised upon an agency law theory of vicarious liability.the bankruptcy court held that the purchaser could not recover from the trustee on such a theory.berry,at.
applying illinois law,the court held that a principal is not liable for an agent torts,provided the agent is not an employee of the principal.berry,at,citing anderson marathon petroleum,cir,citing gomien,at.according to the berry court,although the relationship is governed by agency principles,the attorney is considered a classic independent contractor.berry,at,citing hoffman morton american insurance,d.the berry court specifically relied on the following passage of the seventh circuit opinion in anderson 
the reason for distinguishing the independent contractor from the employee is that,by definition of the relationship between a principal and an independent contractor,the principal does not supervise the details of the independent contractor work and therefore is not in a good position to prevent negligent performance,whereas the essence of the contractual relationship known as employment is that the employee surrenders to the employer the right to direct the details of his work,in exchange for receiving a wage.the independent contractor commits himself to providing a specified output,and the principal monitors the contractor performance not by monitoring,supervising the by inspecting the contractually specified output to make sure it conforms to the specifications.berry,at,quoting anderson,at.
the berry court concluded that there was no authority to depart from this rule in cases concerning an relationship.berry,at.
the courts of our sister states are,however,divided on the issue of imposing vicarious liability for the actions of attorneys.in some jurisdictions,the courts find no vicarious liability.see baldasarre butler,an innocent client should not be held vicariously liable for the wrongful conduct of his or her attorney if the client does not direct,advise,consent to or participate in the attorney improper conduct lynn superior court,d.plant trust of columbus,see also aetna casualty surety protective national insurance,so d an insurance company is not vicariously liable for the malpractice of the attorney it selects to defend the insured brown lumbermens mutual casualty,aff,since attorneys employed by insurance company were independent contractors,their negligence was not imputable to insurance company feliberty damon,vicarious liability produces an untenable result where on the one hand a party is prohibited from conducting the litigation or controlling the decisions of the attorney and on the other hand that party is charged with responsibility for the lawyer independent professional judgments.other jurisdictions impose vicariously liability,holding the relationship is a relationship.see stumpf continental casualty,southwestern bell telephone wilson,but see bradt west,client not automatically liable for tortious conduct of attorney peterson worthen bank trust,united farm bureau mutual insurance groen.continental insurance bayless roberts,alaska nyer carter,me.
after careful consideration of this conflicting authority,we conclude that when,as here,an attorney acts pursuant to the exercise of independent professional judgment,he or she acts presumptively as an independent contractor whose intentional misconduct may generally not be imputed to the client,subject to factual exceptions.see lynn,d at.at.individuals more often than not seek the assistance of an attorney because they are unfamiliar with the law and unable to perform the work themselves.see at.at,at mcmorrow,dissenting,joined by garman.therefore,an attorney usually pursues a client legal rights without specific direction from the client,using independent professional judgment to determine the manner and form of the work.
an independent contractor is defined by the level of control over the manner of work performance.hartley red ball transit.
an independent contractor is one who undertakes to produce a given result but in the actual execution of the work is not under the orders or control of the person for whom he does the work but may use his own discretion in things not specified and without his being subject to the orders of the person for whom the work is done in respect to the details of the work.hartley,at.
that someone is an independent contractor does not bar the attachment of vicarious liability for her actions if she is also an agent.see petrovich share health plan of illinois,a s a general rule,no vicarious liability exists for the actions of independent contractors.vicarious liability may nevertheless be imposed for the actions of independent contractors where an agency relationship is established.a person may be both an independent contractor and an agent with the authority both to control the details of the work and also the power to act for and to bind the principal in business negotiations within the scope of the agency.see hoffman morton american insurance,d.as a general rule,attorneys fit squarely within this category.nonetheless,when attorneys act pursuant to the exercise of independent professional judgment,they possess such considerable autonomy over the details and manner of performing their work that they are presumptively independent contractors for purposes of imposing vicarious liability.accordingly,where a plaintiff seeks to hold a client vicariously liable for the attorney allegedly intentional tortious conduct,a plaintiff must prove facts demonstrating either that the client specifically directed,controlled,or authorized the attorney precise method of performing the work or that the client subsequently ratified acts performed in the exercise of the attorney independent judgment.if there is no evidence that the client directed,controlled,authorized,or ratified the attorney allegedly tortious conduct,no vicarious liability can attach.
here,the record contains no evidence that the content of the allegedly tortious letters was directed,controlled,or authorized by holabird root.nor is there any evidentiary material in the record creating a genuine issue of fact on the question of whether holabird root knew of the contents of the letters before they were sent by sabo zahn.the evidence deposition testimony relied on by the appellate court does not raise a question concerning this issue.that sabo zahn believed that the firm was performing the task it had been hired to accomplish does not address the issue of whether holabird root knew of the letters or the letters content.similarly,james baird statements that the letters indicated that the law firm was pursuing the fee in an aggressive way and that the firm was serving them as their clients does not contradict his testimony that he was unaware of the letters until after the letters were sent.the only evidence in the record concerning the contents of the letters is deposition testimony indicating that sabo zahn agreed not to disclose the tax information to anyone outside its law firm.accordingly,there was no question of fact raised as to whether holabird root authorized,directed,or controlled the content of the letters.
turning to the parties final argument,ratification of an unauthorized act is tantamount to an original authorization and confirms what was originally unauthorized.jones beker,d.the principle behind the doctrine of ratification is that the person ratifying secures a benefit through the actions of another who is acting on his behalf with apparent or implied authority.swader golden rule insurance,d.if there is no benefit,ratification will not be implied.jones,d at,see also stathis geldermann,d,ratification may be inferred from surrounding circumstances,including acquiescence,after notice,to the benefits of an allegedly unauthorized transaction.the record in this case is devoid of any suggestion that could support an inference holabird root benefitted in any way from sabo zahn alleged interference with the business relationships of horwitz matthews.without a question of fact concerning whether holabird root derived a benefit from the allegedly tortious letters,there could be no ratification and summary judgment was appropriately granted to holabird root.
in rendering our holding,we acknowledge that attorneys remain bound by strong ethical obligations to their clients and that the relationship is fiduciary in nature.as a fiduciary relationship,there are a myriad of circumstances where attorneys act as agents for their clients.the situation at hand is simply not one of them.we further acknowledge that our holding conflicts with the comment following section of the restatement of agency 
the principal is liable for its agent conduct only if that conduct is,in part at least,to carry out the purposes of the principal.the situation most frequently aris es when an attorney at law tortiously institutes or continues civil or criminal proceedings,or is guilty of oppressive or wrongful conduct during the course of the proceedings,in order that he may enforce a claim of the principal.the fact that the attorney is subject to discipline by the court does not prevent the client from being liable for his conduct.restatement second of agency,comment a.
we disagree with the restatement discounting that attorneys are constrained by certain ethical considerations that serve to distance their behavior from their clients.attorneys can not blindly follow their clients directions,even if those directions are particular and express,if doing so would require them to violate their ethical obligations.see et illinois rules of professional conduct.in representing a client,rule mandates that a lawyer exercise independent professional judgment.the rules of legal ethics are aimed at protecting the relationship,maintaining public confidence in the legal profession,and ensuring the integrity of judicial proceedings.sk handtool dresser industries,d.a lawyer is prohibited under rule f from acting on behalf of a client in any manner that serves merely to harass or maliciously injure another.f.an intentional tort as alleged here would arguably fall within the parameters of the type of behavior prohibited by rule f.further,rule i provides that w hen a lawyer knows that a client expects assistance not permitted by these rules or other law,the lawyer shall consult with the client regarding the relevant limitations on the lawyer conduct.i.similarly,rule a states that a lawyer representing a client before a tribunal shall withdraw from employment if the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the client is bringing the legal action,conducting the defense,or asserting a position in the litigation,or is otherwise having steps taken,merely for the purpose of harassing or maliciously injuring any person.a.
the preamble to the rules of professional conduct likewise emphasizes the weighty obligations attorneys undertake in the practice of law 
the practice of law is a public trust.lawyers are the trustees of the system by which citizens resolve disputes among themselves,punish and deter crime,and determine their relative rights and responsibilities toward each other and their government.lawyers therefore are responsible for maintaining public confidence in the system of justice by acting competently and with loyalty to the best interests of their clients by working to improve that system to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing society and by defending the integrity of the judicial system against those who would corrupt,abuse or defraud it.illinois rules of professional conduct,preamble,at.
were we to hold otherwise,we would in effect compel clients in similar cases to oversee or micromanage every action taken by their attorneys during the course of the relationship,and obligate clients to take control of their representation at the slightest hint of potentially wrongful conduct on the part of their attorneys.see bradt west,see also at.at,at mcmorrow,dissenting,joined by garman.such close monitoring would be impossible for most clients.see bradt,at see also at.at,at mcmorrow,dissenting,joined by garman.moreover,most clients are not qualified to undertake that type of monitoring.see link wabash,d,black,dissenting,joined by warren,it can not be said that there is a duty for a client to try to supervise the daily professional services of the attorney see also at.at,at mcmorrow,dissenting,joined by garman.the obligation to supervise an attorneys conduct would make plaintiffs reluctant to file suit and make defendants hesitant to defend themselves vigorously.see bradt west,see also at.at,at mcmorrow,dissenting,joined by garman.this would not only chill the willingness of illinois citizens to vindicate their legal rights,it would make them ultimately responsible for their own legal very act for which they hire an attorney in the first place.bradt,at see also at.at,at mcmorrow,dissenting,joined by garman.
given our holding that sabo zahn was acting as an independent contractor of holabird root,and not an agent,when it sent the allegedly tortious letters,we need not address the parties arguments concerning whether sabo zahn acted outside the scope of its authority because an employer has no right to control the manner of performance used by an independent contractor.see hartley red ball transit.
the misunderstanding of this opinion apparent in both dissents prompts us to respond to several issues.first,justice freeman dissent is based on the errant notion that,because an individual may be both an independent contractor and an agent,an attorney is at all times both.second,according to justice freeman dissent,petrovich overruled gomien.the dissent is wrong on both counts.in petrovich,a patient who was a member of a health maintenance organization hmo sued the hmo for medical malpractice,alleging that the hmo was vicariously liable for the conduct of the participating physician who had treated her.the trial court granted summary judgment to the hmo and the patient appealed.the appellate court reversed and remanded.petrovich share health plan of illinois,d.this court affirmed,holding that an hmo may be held vicariously liable for the negligence of its independent contractor physicians under the doctrines of apparent authority and implied authority.petrovich,at.in order for vicarious liability to attach for an independent contractor actions in such situations,there must either be a holding out,meaning that the hmo,or its agent,acted in a manner that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that the physician who was alleged to be negligent was an agent or employee of the hmo petrovich,at,or facts and circumstances showing that the defendant exerted sufficient control over the alleged agent so as to negate that person status as an independent contractor petrovich,at.neither theory to overcome independent contractor status was raised by the plaintiffs before this court or before the trial court.therefore,petrovich is of no avail to plaintiffs here.moreover,contrary to the dissent assertion,gomien remains good law.unless petrovich is satisfied,there is,generally,no vicarious liability for an independent contractor actions.
third,justice freeman invocation of rankin heidlebaugh,d,is likewise ineffective.rankin involved the potential vicarious liability of an organization,equip for equality efe,for the actions of one of its attorney employees and had absolutely nothing to do with the potential vicarious liability of a client for the conduct of retained counsel.fourth,the other illinois cases cited in justice freeman dissent do not run counter to our opinion.for example,as discussed previously,flight kitchen involved misconduct engaged in by an attorney with the full knowledge and direction of the client.flight kitchen,d at.moreover,in woods cole,doyle shlensky,d,and danforth checker taxi,d,vicarious liability for an attorney actions was not at issue.
fifth,justice freeman dissent asserts that we rely too heavily on berry because it was wrongly decided,contradicts petrovich,and relies on anderson,a case that has nothing to do with attorneys.we acknowledge that the berry court statement,a principal is not liable for an agents sic torts,taken out of context,contradicts petrovich.that statement,however,was made in relation to a discussion distinguishing between an independent contractor and an employee for the purposes of imposing vicarious liability.
sixth,justice freeman dissent expresses concern that several of the foreign jurisdiction cases that we have cited with approval are insurance cases.unfortunately,it is often not possible to find factual scenarios directly on point when deciding a particular issue.in such cases,general propositions of law are often taken from factually similar cases and applied to the scenario at hand.that the dissenter frowns on this practice is of no consequence.
finally,the misunderstanding of our holding apparent in justice freeman dissent can be most vividly seen in the statement that the majority disavows basic principles of agency law when it holds that principals are not liable for their agents conduct within the scope and in the service of the agency.at.at,at freeman,dissenting.we are not disavowing agency law.we acknowledge that principals are liable for their agents conduct within the scope and in the service of the agency.irrespective of this principle,we hold that an attorney can be both an independent contractor and an agent,but regarding particular conduct is either one or the other,not both.thus,there is no basis for the straw man distinction drawn by the dissent between a normal agent and an attorney.at.at,at freeman,dissenting.in the case at bar,plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether sabo zahn was acting as the agent of holabird root when it engaged in the allegedly tortious conduct.accordingly,the trial court correctly determined that holabird root was entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.
additionally,chief justice mcmorrow dissent is precariously close to agreeing with the majority opinion.chief justice mcmorrow plainly agrees with our answer to the central question presented by this appeal whether,and if so,to what extent,clients may be held vicariously liable for the intentional torts of their attorneys.her dissent,like the majority opinion,answers that question in the affirmative,qualifying that answer in essentially the same manner as the majority in order to hold a client liable for the intentional torts of the client attorney,a plaintiff would be required to produce evidence that the client authorized,directed,had knowledge of or ratified the attorney misconduct.at.at,at mcmorrow,dissenting,joined by garman.moreover,we agree with chief justice mcmorrow that it can not be presumed an intentional tort as alleged here,or,for that matter,any other illegal or unethical act,lies within the scope of the relationship.at.at,at mcmorrow,dissenting,joined by garman.we further agree that it should be presumed,as a matter of public policy,that clients hire attorneys to pursue legal remedies in a legal and ethical manner and that,since attorneys stand in a fiduciary relationship to their clients and are officers of the court,clients are reasonably justified in expecting that their attorneys will represent them ethically and within the bounds of the law.at.at,at mcmorrow,dissenting,joined by garman.
chief justice mcmorrow parts company with the majority by her agreement with justice freeman that an attorney is both an agent and an independent contractor at all times,even when the attorney allegedly commits an intentional tort and there is no proof that the client directed,controlled,authorized,or ratified the attorney conduct.in order to avoid justice freeman conclusion that a client,in every instance,is vicariously liable for retained counsel intentionally tortious actions committed within the scope of the agency see restatement second of agency,comment a accord peddinghaus peddinghaus,d,letsos century west realty,d,chief justice mcmorrow distinguishes attorneys from all other types of agents and carves out an exception to the vicarious liability rule based on that distinction.while chief justice mcmorrow position is not completely untenable,we believe that our opinion presents the more reasoned approach.rather than fashion a wholesale exception to the agency rules for attorneys,we merely distinguish situations in the relationship where,as here,vicarious liability is claimed by a third party for the alleged intentional tortious conduct of the attorney.
moreover,contrary to chief justice mcmorrow protestations,our holding in this case does not alter the core relationship between the attorney and client.nor does it impact the ability of an attorney to bind his or her client in a traditional,representational context.see in re marriage of marr,d,generally,a client is bound by the acts or omissions of his attorney within the scope of the attorney authority.we continue to affirm the principles of an attorney fiduciary obligations and ethical responsibilities to a client that exist at all times during the representational relationship.see imming,at,schuyler,at,see also et illinois rules of professional conduct.rather,this opinion must be understood as limited to the narrow scope of vicarious liability claims against a client based upon an attorney alleged intentional tortious conduct.
conclusion 
for the reasons,we hold generally that attorneys may be both independent contractors and agents but,regarding specific conduct,are either one or the other.we further hold that for purposes of imposing vicarious liability for allegedly tortious conduct,when attorneys act pursuant to independent professional judgment,they are presumptively independent contractors whose alleged misconduct may not be imputed to their clients,unless it is shown that the client directed,controlled,authorized,or ratified the alleged misconduct.since there was no genuine issue of material fact presented regarding whether holabird root directed,controlled,authorized,or ratified the allegedly tortious conduct of sabo zahn,we reverse the judgment of the appellate court and affirm the judgment of circuit court of cook county granting summary judgment to holabird root.
appellate court judgment reversed circuit court judgment affirmed.
this appeal presents an important issue of first impression for this court whether,and if so,to what extent,clients may be held vicariously liable for the intentional torts of their attorneys.the majority holds that attorneys are nonagent independent contractors whose intentional misconduct may not be imputed to the client,unless a plaintiff proves facts demonstrating either that the client specifically directed,controlled,or authorized the attorney precise method of performing the work or that the client subsequently ratified acts performed in the exercise of the attorney independent judgment.at.at,at.applying this rule to the facts before it,the majority also holds that the circuit court properly granted summary judgment to the client,holabird root,finding that there was no evidence giving rise to a genuine issue of material fact as to whether holabird root authorized,directed,had prior knowledge of,or ratified the allegedly tortious conduct of its attorneys,sabo zahn.
i respectfully dissent from the opinion of the majority.it is my view that the appellate court below was correct in determining that an agency relationship exists between an attorney and client.it is also my position that the appellate court correctly held that,under the facts presented in this cause,summary judgment was improperly granted by the circuit court because there exists a genuine issue of material fact both with respect to whether sabo zahn was acting within the scope of its authority when it engaged in the allegedly tortious conduct,and whether holabird root subsequently ratified the conduct of sabo zahn.i would arrive at this conclusion,however,somewhat differently than the appellate court below.
the central issue presented in this case reaches the core of the relationship between an attorney and a client to what extent can an attorney bind his or her client for the actions taken by the attorney in order to answer this question,it is necessary to briefly review basic principles of the law of agency,and the differences between an agent and an independent contractor.in general,an agency relationship is characterized by a fiduciary affiliation between two individuals in which the principal exercises some degree of control over the conduct of the agent,and the agent has the power to act on behalf of the principal.restatement second of agency see also d agency.section of the restatement second of agency defines an independent contractor as a person who contracts with another to do something for him but who is not controlled by the other nor subject to the other right to control with respect to his physical conduct in the performance of the undertaking.restatement second of agency.notably,section of the restatement also provides that an independent contractor may or may not be an agent.restatement second of agency.thus,under the restatement,the concept of an independent contractor and agent are not mutually exclusive.the comments to section of the restatement explain that,generally,an agent who is not a servant is an independent contractor when he contracts to act on account of the principal.restatement second of agency,comment b,at.however,not all independent contractors are agents.restatement second of agency,comment b,at.for example,one who contracts for a stipulated price to build a house for another and who reserves no direction over the conduct of the work is an independent contractor but he is not an agent,since he is not a fiduciary,has no power to make the one employing him a party to the transaction,and is subject to no control over his conduct.emphasis added.restatement second of agency,comment b,at.
thus,a fundamental distinguishing characteristic between an agent and an independent contractor is that an agent stands in a fiduciary position with respect to the principal,whereas an independent contractor is not a fiduciary of the principal.the agency relation results if,but only if,there is an understanding between the parties which creates a fiduciary relation in which the fiduciary is subject to the directions of the one on whose account he acts.restatement second of agency,comment b,at see also restatement second of agency,comment b,at the fact that an agent is subject to fiduciary duties distinguishes him from other persons who have power to affect the interests of others and the understanding that one is to act primarily for the benefit of another is often the determinative feature in distinguishing the agency relation from other relations.
section of the restatement second of agency more clearly states the concept that an individual may be characterized as both an agent and an independent contractor.this section provides that o ne who contracts to act on behalf of another and subject to the other control except with respect to his physical conduct is an agent and also an independent contractor.restatement second of agency.particularly relevant to the matter before us,the comment to section discusses the dual roles that an attorney plays during the representation of a client.comment a to section explains that most of the persons known as agents,that is attorneys are independent contractors as that term is used in the restatement of this subject,since they are contractors but,although employed to perform services,are not subject to the control or right to control of the principal with respect to their physical conduct in the performance of the services.emphasis added.restatement second of agency,comment a,at.the comment goes on to explain that,even though attorneys may be considered independent contractors,they nevertheless also fall within the category of agents,because t hey are fiduciaries they owe to the principal the basic obligations of agency loyalty and obedience.restatement second of agency,comment a,at.
whether an attorney is characterized as an agent or an independent contractor affects the vicarious liability of the client for the attorney conduct.a principal is liable for the acts of an agent committed within the scope of the agent authority.brubakken morrison,d.conversely,no vicarious liability exists for the conduct of independent contractors.petrovich,at.however,v icarious liability may nevertheless be imposed for the actions of independent contractors where an agency relationship is established.petrovich,at.
although the majority correctly acknowledges that an attorney may simultaneously be an agent and an independent contractor at.at,at,the majority nevertheless incorrectly holds that regarding particular conduct an attorney is either one or the other,but not both at.at,at.based upon the apparent,yet incorrect,premise that the concept of an agent and an independent contractor are mutually exclusive,the majority concludes that when attorneys act pursuant to the exercise of independent professional judgment,they possess such considerable autonomy over the details and manner of performing their work that they are presumptively independent contractors for purposes of imposing vicarious liability.at.at,at.the majority justifies this holding by reasoning that although an attorney is vested with a classic hallmark of an agent the power to act for and to bind the principal in business negotiations within the scope of the agency at.at,at,quoting hoffman morton american insurance,d,an attorney is not an agent because he or she is also an independent contractor who act pursuant to the exercise of independent professional judgment.at.at,at.the majority concludes that,presumptively,unless it is shown otherwise,an attorney is not an agent at all.in my opinion,the majority holding is inconsistent with fundamental principals of agency law,as set forth above,which provide that the concepts of agent and independent contractor are not mutually exclusive and while the relationship of an attorney to a client may be characterized,in some respects,as that of an independent contractor,it nevertheless remains a relationship of agency to the extent that an attorney is a fiduciary to the client.
under the majority holding,an illinois attorney,when acting pursuant to independent professional judgment,is now considered a nonagent independent contractor.see at.at,at.the comments to section of the restatement second of agency define a independent contractor as an individual who contracts to accomplish something for another or to deliver something to another,but who is not acting as a fiduciary for the other.emphasis added.restatement second of agency,comment b,at.i can not agree with the majority apparent position that,as of today,the relationship in illinois is now simply a relationship wherein an attorney,when acting pursuant to independent professional judgment,is an independent contractor who does not act as a fiduciary for the client,and who,therefore,neither stands in a position of confidence or trust with respect to the client,nor owes a duty of loyalty or obedience to the client.i can not support such a result.
for almost a century,this court has repeatedly held that,as a matter of law,the existence of an relationship creates a fiduciary relationship between those parties,in re imming,in re schuyler,gaffney harmon,people ex rel.chicago bar ass charone.indeed,the majority readily acknowledges that the relationship between a client and an attorney is fiduciary in nature.see at.at,at the relationship is a fiduciary relationship at.at,at attorneys stand in a fiduciary relationship to their clients.it is well settled that a fiduciary relationship is an agency relationship.latimer perry,american environmental,d.when two parties enter into an agency relationship,the principal has the right to control the conduct of the agent and the agent has the power to affect the legal relations of the principal.taylor kohli.indeed,it is precisely because an attorney stands in a fiduciary relationship to the client that the attorney has the power to act for and to bind the client to matters within the scope of the attorney agency.restatement second of agency,comment e see also in re marriage of marr,d,generally,a client is bound by the acts or omissions of his attorney within the scope of the attorney authority hoffman morton american insurance,d,an agent,w hen properly authorized makes contracts or other negotiations of a business nature on behalf of the principal,by which his principal is bound.
despite acknowledging,as it must,that an relationship creates a fiduciary relationship between those parties,the majority nevertheless holds that,when an attorney exercises independent professional judgment,the attorney status automatically shifts from that of an agent of the client to an independent contractor.in other words,in the view of the majority,an attorney is no longer an agent of the client,even though he or she always stands in a fiduciary relationship to the client,when the attorney acts pursuant to independent professional judgment.this reasoning is in error.an attorney exercise of independent professional judgment is the very essence of the attorney relationship to the client.indeed,rule of the illinois rules of professional conduct mandates that,i n representing a client,a lawyer shall exercise independent professional judgment and render candid advice.therefore,because an attorney is required to exercise independent professional judgment during the course of representation of a client,the majority holding leads to the conclusion that an attorney is a independent contractor throughout the duration of the client representation.
the majority assures that its holding today neither alter s the core relationship between the attorney and client nor impact s the ability of an attorney to bind his or her client in a traditional,representational context.at.at,at.i disagree.the flaws inherent in the majority protestations are apparent from the majority statement that it continue s to affirm the principles of an attorney fiduciary obligations,and the majority citation to case law holding that a client is bound by the acts or omissions of his attorney within the scope of the attorney authority.at.at,at,quoting in re marriage of marr,d.as set forth above,a fiduciary obligation arises from an agency relationship,a relationship which the majority today holds is nonexistent when an attorney exercises independent professional judgment.similarly,any discussion of the scope of the attorney authority is defined by the scope of the attorney agency relationship with the client,a relationship which the majority has found does not exist when an attorney exercises independent professional judgment during the representation of a client.
it is my position that,as a result of the majority holding that during the course of representing their clients illinois attorneys are nonagent independent contractors,the court opinion today calls into question the ability of attorneys to bind their clients in any legal or business dealings conducted by the attorney on behalf of the client.as stated,it is by operation of agency principles that an attorney has authority to bind a client with respect to acts performed by the attorney within the scope of the agency.it is foreseeable that a client,unhappy with a transaction,would rely upon the majority holding to argue that because his or her attorney was merely an independent contractor,the client is not bound by any actions that the attorney performed during the course of the legal representation.under the majority holding,not only is the power of an attorney to act on behalf of a client limited,but those third parties with whom the attorney must deal may legitimately question whether the attorney has the necessary authority to negotiate for and bind the client.
in light of our own precedent which establishes that the fiduciary relationship between an attorney and client renders an attorney an agent of his or her client,there is considerable cause to question the basis of the majority holding in this case that because an attorney is an independent contractor,the attorney,therefore,is not an agent of the client.review of the majority opinion,which not only effectively overrules a long line of precedent,but also calls into question the ability of illinois attorneys to bind their clients to any matters the attorney engages in on the client behalf,appears to lead to the conclusion that this is a decision aimed at achieving a particular result the nonliability of a client,in virtually every instance,for the intentional torts of the client attorney.
the majority attempts to somewhat ameliorate the result in this matter in several ways.the majority repeatedly characterizes its holding that an attorney is an independent contractor as a presumption limited to vicarious liability claims against a client based upon an attorney alleged intentional tortious conduct.see,at.at,at w e conclude that when,as here,an attorney acts pursuant to the exercise of independent professional judgment,he or she acts presumptively as an independent contractor whose intentional misconduct may generally not be imputed to the client,subject to factual exceptions at.at,at when attorneys act pursuant to the exercise of independent professional judgment,they possess such considerable autonomy over the details and manner of performing their work that they are presumptively independent contractors for purposes of imposing vicarious liability at.at,at f or purposes of imposing vicarious liability for allegedly tortious conduct,when attorneys act pursuant to independent professional judgment,they are presumptively independent contractors whose alleged misconduct may not be imputed to their clients.the majority further holds that its presumptive general rule of nonliability may be rebutted,and vicarious liability can attach,if a plaintiff proves either that the client specifically directed,controlled or authorized the attorney precise method of performing the work,or that the client subsequently ratified the attorney allegedly tortious acts.at.at,at.
under the majority view,then,it is only upon proof of either of these two elements that an attorney becomes an agent of a client for whose acts the client may be vicariously liable.it would follow,then,that it would only be upon such proof that a client would be bound by the conduct engaged in by his or her hired attorney,because only then would the attorney be considered an agent of the client.as explained above,this holding is contrary to basic principles of agency law,which stand for the proposition that an attorney may be characterized,simultaneously,as both an agent and an independent contractor.under the majority holding,an attorney will never be an agent of his or her client,as long as the attorney abides by professional standards of ethics and satisfies his or her obligation to exercise independent professional judgment during the representation of the client.in this way,the majority presumption effectively becomes irrebutable.in addition,by holding that an attorney is not an agent when acting in accordance with his or her independent professional judgment,the majority also calls into question the fiduciary obligations which an attorney owes to a client as a result of the agency relationship.by dispensing with the agency relationship,the majority also dispenses with the attorney fiduciary obligations to the client.
the difficulties which are apt to flow from the majority holding can not be overstated.in addition to the several serious concerns i have outlined above,i note that in practical application the majority holding will be unworkable,as the status of an attorney will constantly be in flux.in apparent acknowledgment that its holding is problematic,the majority attempts to explain the result in this case by stating that,a s a fiduciary relationship,there are a myriad of circumstances where attorneys act as agents for their clients.the situation at hand is simply not one of them.at.at,at.this statement will do little to provide guidance to the bench and bar in addressing similar cases in the future.to the contrary,it will cause additional confusion.after holding that attorneys are nonagent independent contractors,the majority backtracks and states that there are circumstances where attorneys act as agents.however,under the majority holding today,these undefined circumstances can not include actions where the attorney exercises his or her professional judgment,the very reason why an individual retains an attorney services in the first place.accordingly,for the foregoing reasons,i submit that the majority holding is untenable.
i am,therefore,in agreement with the dissenting opinion filed by justice freeman that the majority errs in holding that attorneys are independent contractors to which traditional agency principles do not apply.my position mirrors that of justice freeman to the extent that,under application of basic principles of agency law and this court own precedent,an attorney is both an independent contractor and an agent for his or her client.accordingly,as the relationship is one of agency,it is proper to apply principles of agency law in resolving the matter before us.finally,i also am in agreement with justice freeman that the majority relies upon inapposite and unpersuasive authority in arriving at the opposite conclusion.
i can not join justice freeman dissent,however,with respect to his conclusion that,under agency law principles,a client,in every instance,is vicariously liable for the intentionally tortious actions of his or her attorney committed within the scope of the agency.it is my position that,as a matter of public policy,a plaintiff who attempts to hold a client liable for the intentional torts of that client attorney must show more than the mere existence of an relationship.for the reasons set forth below,i would hold that,because an attorney is readily distinguishable from other agents,it should not be presumed that intentional,tortious acts performed by an attorney automatically fall within the scope of the attorney agency.rather,as a matter of public policy,it should be presumed that a client hires an attorney to pursue legal remedies in a lawful and ethical manner,and that because an attorney not only has a fiduciary obligation to his or her client but is also an officer of the court,the client is justified in expecting that any activities engaged in on the client behalf are ethical and within the bounds of the law.it is this presumption which should set the parameters of an attorney authority in his or her representation of a client.
attorneys are unique agents.first,an attorney must be licensed by the state,in accordance with both the attorney act ilcs et west,and the rules of this court.although other professions also have licensing requirements,attorneys,in addition to meeting specific academic requirements and passing the bar examination,must also be of good moral character and general fitness to practice law.a.in addition,an attorney is different from other licensed professionals in that every person admitted to practice law as an attorney in this state must take and subscribe to the following oath i do solemnly swear or affirm,as the case may be,that i will support the constitution of the united states and the constitution of the state of illinois,and that i will faithfully discharge the duties of the office of attorney and counselor at law to the best of my ability.ilcs west.the taking of an oath is a condition precedent to the practice of law in this state and is imposed by the legislature.in re anastaplo.
this court has repeatedly made clear that the practice of law is a privilege and not a right.in re anastaplo,at.it is only upon satisfaction of the requirements that an individual is awarded a license to practice law.a license to practice law makes the holder of that license an officer of the court.in re,in re anastaplo,at,in re both.this court has made it clear that,a lawyer,as an officer of the court,holds a position of public trust in re anastaplo,at,and,as such,an attorney professional conduct must be above reproach in re,at.indeed,one court has accurately described attorneys as having a superior agency status,due to their unique roles as officers of the court and the heightened duty which attaches to attorneys as a result of this status.clark burden.in clark,the supreme court of kentucky described the relationship as follows 
the relationship is generally that of principal and agent however,the attorney is vested with powers superior to those of any ordinary agent because of the attorney status as an officer of the court thus,the attorney is responsible for the administration of justice in the public interest,a higher duty than any ordinary agent owes his principal.since the relationship of is one fiduciary in nature,the attorney has the duty to exercise in all his relationships with this the most scrupulous honor,good faith and fidelity to his client interest.clark,at,quoting daugherty runner.
this court has similarly emphasized the heightened duty attendant to attorneys as a result of the unique role attorneys play in our society.we have stated that,because attorneys are officers of the court,
it is their duty to aid in the establishment of truth and the due administration of justice.citation.when a license is granted to one to practice law by this court he assumes grave responsibilities,which only those worthy of trust and confidence and possessed of absolute fidelity and honesty should bear.confidences are reposed in them interests of great magnitude,and even the life,liberty and character of their,are entrusted to their care.citation.a license granted by this court to practice is a guaranty that,so far as this court is advised,the person holding such license is a fit and proper person to assume the responsibilities,to enjoy and the confidences of others,and to aid and assist them in the care and management of their legal business and affairs.people ex rel.chicago bar ass czarnecki.
see also people shirley.in other words,t he relation of the court and its attorneys to the people is one of high responsibility,involving on the one hand complete trust and confidence and on the other absolute fidelity and integrity.in re both,at.
the preamble to the rules of professional conduct also emphasizes the serious responsibilities attorneys undertake in the practice of law 
the practice of law is a public trust.lawyers are the trustees of the system by which citizens resolve disputes among themselves,punish and deter crime,and determine their relative rights and responsibilities toward each other and their government.lawyers therefore are responsible for maintaining public confidence in the system of justice by acting competently and with loyalty to the best interests of their clients by working to improve that system to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing society and by defending the integrity of the judicial system against those who would corrupt,abuse or defraud it.illinois rules of professional conduct,preamble,at.
because the relationship is a fiduciary relationship based on trust and confidence,s uch confidence can only be maintained if the lawyer acts competently and zealously pursues the client interests within the bounds of the law.zealously does not mean mindlessly or unfairly or oppressively.rather,it is the duty of all lawyers to seek resolution of disputes at the least cost in time,expense and trauma to all parties and to the courts.illinois rules of professional conduct,preamble,at.
to this end,the rules of professional conduct provide a framework for attorney conduct.for example,rule f states that a lawyer shall not file a suit,assert a position,conduct a defense,delay a trial or take other action on behalf of the client when the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that such action would serve merely to harass or maliciously injure another.f.rule i provides that w hen a lawyer knows that a client expects assistance not permitted by these rules or other law,the lawyer shall consult with the client regarding the relevant limitations on the lawyer conduct.i.indeed,rule a states that a lawyer representing a client before a tribunal shall withdraw from employment with permission of the tribunal if such permission is required,and a lawyer representing a client in other matters shall withdraw from employment,if the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the client is bringing the legal action,conducting the defense,or asserting a position in the litigation,or is otherwise having steps taken,merely for the purpose of harassing or maliciously injuring any person.a.
thus,as an officer of the court,an attorney has a heightened duty to deal honestly and fairly with his or her client,with the court and with the public.in obtaining a law license,an attorney takes an oath that he or she will uphold the law,and in granting an attorney a license to practice law,this court has determined that the attorney is a fit and proper person to assume these heightened responsibilities.accordingly,a client would be justified in having a heightened expectation that his or her attorney will represent the client in a manner that is fair,honest and ethical in all respects.therefore,i would hold that public policy dictates that the ordinary rules of agency,which would make a client vicariously liable for the intentional tortious actions of his or her attorney simply because of the agency relationship which exists as a result of their relationship,should not apply to this unique agent.more specifically,i believe that it should not be presumed that the allegedly tortious acts of the attorney were done within the scope of the attorney authority.rather,i believe that the most appropriate manner of resolving this issue was proposed by justice hoffman,who submitted a separate opinion below.based upon the premise that attorneys are agents of their clients,justice hoffman reasoned that 
the general retention of an attorney to do all things necessary to pursue a claim should,as a matter of law,be interpreted as authorizing the attorney only to do all things legal and proper to pursue the claim and should not be construed,without more,as giving the attorney direction or permission to commit a tortious act.where there is no evidence that the client expressly or impliedly authorized,directed,knew of,or ratified the alleged tortious conduct of its attorney,it should not be presumed that,merely because the parties stand in the relationship of,the client intended or authorized the tortious conduct or that the conduct was within the scope of the attorney duties.the undesirable implications of a contrary position seem rather obvious.clients who in good faith employ an attorney will be exposed to vicarious liability for the attorney tortious conduct when,as a practical matter,the client is in no position to control the attorney conduct.d at,hoffman,dissenting.
i would hold that,when assessing the liability of a client for the tortious acts of the client attorney,we should not presume that the scope of the attorney authority extends to encompass intentional misconduct.to the contrary,as a matter of public policy,we should presume that the client hired the attorney to pursue legal remedies in a legal and ethical manner and that,because the attorney stands in a fiduciary relationship to the client and is an officer of the court,the client is justified in expecting that the attorney will represent the client ethically and within the bounds of the law.it is this presumption that should define the scope of the attorney authority in representing the client.it would then be incumbent upon the party seeking to hold the client liable to rebut this presumption by producing evidence that the client authorized,directed,had knowledge of or ratified the attorney misconduct,so as to bring that misconduct within the scope of the attorney authority.it is well settled that t he client is not liable for acts of the attorney which are outside the scope of the attorney authority.thus,a client is not responsible for any illegal action taken or directed by his attorney which the client did not advise,consent to,participate in,and which was not justified by any authority he had given.attorney client,at.the proposed analysis which i employ serves not only to protect an innocent client who hired an attorney in good faith who thereafter engaged in misconduct not known to the client,but it would also allow a plaintiff to hold vicariously liable those clients who authorized,directed,had knowledge of or ratified the attorney misconduct.
a contrary result imposing vicarious liability upon a client in every instance of intentional tortious misconduct by the client attorney would mean that clients would be forced to micromanage the conduct of their attorneys.this would require that the client be appraised of every step taken by the attorney during the course of the legal proceedings.it is precisely because clients have no expertise in the law that they hire attorneys for their specialized legal skill,and it would be manifestly unfair to hold a client liable for the intentional torts of his or her attorney if the client did not authorize or direct those actions,and if the client was unaware of those actions.indeed,m ost clients can not possibly monitor their attorneys to the degree that would be required to meet such an obligation,and most,clearly,are not qualified for such monitoring,anyway.imposing such an obligation on clients would,unjustly,make plaintiffs reluctant to file suit,and defendants far too tentative about defending themselves vigorously.this would not only chill the willingness of citizens to vindicate their legal rights,it would make them ultimately responsible for their own legal very act for which they hire an attorney in the first place.bradt west.
in the words of the majority,the holding set forth in its own opinion is precariously close to agreeing with the position i take in this dissenting opinion.according to the majority,it is in agreement with my position that a client is not vicariously liable for the intentional torts of his or her attorney unless the plaintiff proffers evidence that the client authorized,directed,had knowledge of or ratified the attorney misconduct.at.at,at.the majority also states that it agrees with my position that it can not be presumed that an intentional tort as alleged here,or,for that matter,any other illegal or unethical act,lies within the scope of the relationship.at.at,at.the majority further states that it agrees with my position that it should be presumed,as a matter of public policy,that clients hire attorneys to pursue legal remedies in a legal and ethical manner and that,since attorneys stand in a fiduciary relationship to their clients and are officers of the court,clients are reasonably justified in expecting that their attorneys will represent them ethically and within the bounds of the law.at.at,at.
the majority states,however,that it departs from my position based upon my agreement with justice freeman that an attorney is both an agent and an independent contractor at all times.at.at,at.the majority notes,however,that i,unlike justice freeman,distinguish attorneys from all other types of agents and carve out an exception to the vicarious liability rule based on that distinction.at.at,at.although,in the view of the majority,my position in this dissenting opinion is not completely untenable,the majority adheres to the belief that its own opinion presents the more reasoned approach.at.at,at.the majority arrives at this conclusion based upon the following reasoning rather than fashion a wholesale exception to the agency rules for attorneys,we merely distinguish situations in the relationship where,as here,vicarious liability is claimed by a third party for the alleged intentional tortious conduct of the attorney.at.at,at.
i respectfully submit that it is the majority which is unnecessarily and improperly creating a wholesale change to the traditional laws of agency with the issuance of its opinion.as explained above,the majority holding rests upon incorrect premises and uses reasoning which is sure to engender confusion and uncertainty among the bench and bar.in contrast,the proposed analysis which i employ does not attempt to alter the principles of agency law,but,instead,seeks to carve out a limited public policy exception to those traditional principles when a plaintiff is seeking to hold a client liable for the intentional torts of the client attorney.as set forth above,my proposed analysis is straightforward.as the relationship is one of agency,it is proper to apply principles of agency law in resolving the matter before us.however,because an attorney is a unique agent,as a matter of public policy it should be presumed that a client hires an attorney to pursue legal remedies in a lawful and ethical manner,and,therefore,that only such lawful actions fall within the scope of an attorney authority in his or her representation of a client.accordingly,to hold a client vicariously liable for the intentionally tortious acts of his or her attorney,a plaintiff must proffer sufficient facts to establish that the client authorized,directed,had knowledge of or ratified the attorney misconduct,so as to bring that misconduct within the scope of the attorney authority.
applying my proposed analysis to the case at bar,i agree with the appellate court below,and also with justice freeman dissent,that there are sufficient facts presented to withstand summary judgment.the purpose of summary judgment is to determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact.purtill hess.the grant of summary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings,depositions,admissions,affidavits and exhibits on file,when viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmovant,establish that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.ilcs c west petrovich,at.although summary judgment is to be encouraged as an expeditious method of disposing of a lawsuit,it is a drastic measure and should be allowed only when the right of the moving party to judgment is free and clear from doubt.olson etheridge.a triable issue of fact exists where there is a dispute as to a material fact or where,although the facts are not disputed,reasonable minds could differ in drawing inferences from those facts.petrovich,at.the standard of review in cases involving summary judgment is de novo.ragan columbia mutual insurance.
unlike the majority,i can not conclude that,as a matter of law,holabird root is not liable for the actions of its attorneys and therefore entitled to summary judgment.a review of the record reveals that sufficient evidence was presented by plaintiffs to give rise to a question of fact as to whether holabird root expressly or impliedly authorized,directed,or knew of the alleged tortious conduct of its attorneys,sabo zahn.for example,the record reflects that during his deposition testimony,a principal of holabird root stated that the letters sent out by sabo zahn indicated to him that the law firm was pursuing the fee in an aggressive way and that the firm was serving them as their clients.the record also reflects that in their depositions,attorneys of the sabo zahn firm stated that in sending out the letters,they were doing what they were hired to do.in addition,in its motion for summary judgment,holabird root stated that the letters were a discovery tool in litigation.the above evidence gives rise to a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the client authorized,directed,or knew of the allegedly tortious acts committed by sabo zahn,and thus created a genuine issue of fact with respect to whether the acts fell within the attorneys scope of authority.as stated,summary judgment is a drastic measure,and is not appropriate when the right of the moving party to judgment is not free and clear from doubt.
finally,even if the actions of sabo zahn were determined to fall outside the scope of its authority in representing holabird root,a genuine issue of material fact remains as to whether holabird root subsequently acquiesced to,or ratified,the misconduct.ratification occurs when the principal becomes aware of an unauthorized transaction,yet retains the benefits of the transaction or takes a position inconsistent with nonaffirmation.stathis geldermann,d.for ratification to take place,the principal must,with full knowledge of the act,evidence an intent to comply with,and be bound by,the transaction.peskin deutsch,d.ratification may be inferred from surrounding circumstances,including acquiescence,after notice,to the benefits of an allegedly unauthorized transaction.stathis,d at.
the majority holds that the circuit court appropriately granted summary judgment on this issue because t he record in this case is devoid of any suggestion that could support an inference holabird root benefitted in any way from sabo zahn alleged interference with the business relationships of horwitz matthews.at.at,at.i disagree with the majority.rather,i am in agreement with the appellate court below that it is unclear from the record before us when holabird root became aware of the letters,and,when they did,if they disapproved of the letters being mailed or whether holabird root subsequent silence amounts to a ratification of this conduct.accordingly,whether the acts or omissions of holabird root constituted a ratification of the conduct of sabo zahn is an issue of fact precluding the entry of summary judgment.
for the foregoing reasons,i would hold that,in the course of representing a client,an attorney is both an agent and an independent contractor.i would also hold that,as a matter of public policy,a plaintiff who attempts to hold a client liable for the intentional torts of that client attorney must show more than the mere existence of an relationship.because an attorney is a unique agent,it should not be presumed that intentional,tortious acts performed by an attorney automatically fall within the scope of the attorney agency.rather,as a matter of public policy,it should be presumed that an attorney is authorized only to do all things legal and proper to pursue a client claim.in order to hold a client liable for the intentional torts of the client attorney,a plaintiff would be required to produce evidence that the client authorized,directed,had knowledge of or ratified the attorney misconduct,so as to bring that misconduct within the scope of the attorney authority.i also would hold that,under the facts presented in the instant cause,summary judgment was improperly granted.accordingly,i respectfully dissent from the majority opinion.
i respectfully dissent.
the question raised in this appeal is simple may a client be held vicariously liable for tortious conduct committed by counsel during litigation on the client behalf in furtherance of that litigation the majority holds that a client can only be liable when the client specifically directed,controlled,or authorized the attorney precise method of performing the work or subsequently ratified acts performed in the exercise of the attorney independent judgment.at.at,at.i believe this position is inconsistent with basic agency law which this court has previously endorsed.the majority holding is also inconsistent with previous decisions directly on point by our appellate court,the seventh circuit,the restatement second of agency,and the vast majority of foreign jurisdictions to have addressed the issue.accordingly,i respectfully dissent.
agency law tells us that there are three types of relationships in vicarious liability analysis,and independent contractor.see restatement second of agency.the relationships of and independent contractor are mutually subordinate is either an independent contractor or a servant,not both.restatement second of agency.but the relationships of independent contractor and agent are not mutually exclusive one may be both an independent contractor and an agent,as the appellate majority noted.d at.see also restatement second of agency a n independent contractor may or may not be an agent.in fact,
most of the persons known as agents,that is,attorneys,are independent contractors as the term is used in the restatement of this subject,since they are contractors but,although employed to perform services,are not subject to the control or right to control of the principal with respect to their physical conduct in the performance of the services.however,they fall within the category of agents.they are fiduciaries they owe to the principal the basic obligations of agency loyalty and obedience.emphases added.restatement second of agency,comment a.
so far,the majority and i are in majority recognizes that a person may be both an independent contractor and an agent.at.at,at.yet,the majority immediately thereafter states that an attorney should not be treated as an agent because of precisely those attributes which make the attorney an independent contractor autonomy over the details and manner of performing their work.at.at,at.thus,according to the majority,even though a person may be both an independent contractor and an agent,attorneys are not agents,because they are independent contractors.this is confusing at best.
the fact that someone is an independent contractor does not bar the attachment of vicarious liability for his actions if he is an agent,as this court explicitly held less than five years ago.petrovich share health plan of illinois,as a general rule,no vicarious liability exists for the actions of independent contractors.vicarious liability may nevertheless be imposed for the actions of independent contractors where an agency relationship is established.to the extent that our decision in gomien says otherwise,it is incorrect and was overruled by petrovich 
simply put,a principal is liable for its agent conduct within the scope of the agent authority.brubakken morrison,d.liability is not limited to those cases in which the principal authorized the specific conduct of the agent.restatement second of agency.although a principal is not liable for physical harm caused by negligent physical conduct of an agent who is also an independent contractor restatement second of agency,a principal is liable for the agent conduct in matters which the agent has the right to direct under the agreement creating the agency relation,even if the principal is wholly unaware of the specific conduct in question.restatement second of agency,comment a.accord peddinghaus peddinghaus,d,letsos century west realty,d.woods cole,u nder the doctrine of respondeat superior,a principal may be held liable for the tortious actions of an agent which cause a plaintiff injury,even if the principal does not himself engage in any conduct in relation to the plaintiff.
the restatement second of agency contains an entire title devoted exclusively to agents not dependent upon relation of master and servant.restatement second of agency,ch,topic,tit.c.moreover,section of the restatement speaks to the precise situation presented in this case.that section,entitled tortious institution or conduct of legal proceedings,states that 
a principal who authorizes a servant or other agent to institute or conduct such legal proceedings as in his judgment are lawful and desirable for the protection of the principal interests is subject to liability to a person against whom proceedings reasonably adapted to accomplish the principal purposes are tortiously brought by the agent.restatement second of agency.
the comments to section explain that
