introduction 
george daniel petrisca,who stands charged with murder and other felonies in connection with driving his vehicle at excessive speeds on the wrong side of the road,successfully moved to recuse the entire office of the district attorney of los angeles county da from prosecuting the case again him.he based his motion on the fact that one of the deceased victim sons,jeffrey semow,was a deputy district attorney dda of los angeles.petrisca argued this relationship created a conflict of interest for the da and made it unlikely he would receive a fair trial.the trial court ordered the recusal pursuant to penal code section after finding a prosecutor in the da office would feel extra pressure and be more uncomfortable than a prosecutor in another agency we reverse the recusal because the court applied the wrong legal standard in making its decision and no substantial evidence supports it.
factual and procedural background 
the evidence at petrisca preliminary hearing shows that on december,petrisca drove his vehicle at high speeds through two red lights,darting in and out of traffic on the wrong side of the road.petrisca almost hit two vehicles before eventually colliding with two other cars,one driven by shirley semow,who died as a result of her injuries.petrisca had previously completed traffic school.the hearing magistrate denied petrisca motion to dismiss the charges and held him to answer at trial.
the day after the preliminary hearing,the da filed an information charging petrisca with murder,subd.a,manslaughter,subd.c,and assault with a deadly weapon by means likely to produce great bodily injury,subd.a.james falco,the dda assigned to prosecute the case,conducted the preliminary hearing and was in charge of determining the crimes to be charged.
about four months later,petrisca filed a motion recusing the da from prosecuting the case.petrisca argued the da had an inherent conflict of interest because the deceased victim son,jeffrey,was a dda and used his influence to make sure petrisca was overcharged.he further claimed a conflict existed because the victim family had initiated a civil lawsuit against petrisca,and the victim other son,glenn semow who was not employed by the da office,had threatened to take a harsh stance at any sentencing hearing.the attorney general office opposed petrisca motion.
the trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing,during which falco testified.this evidence,together with the declarations filed in support of and in opposition to the motions,revealed the following the da office is the largest prosecutorial agency in the nation,with prosecutors,investigators,and support personnel.there are offices throughout the county,including central trials in downtown los angeles and nine branch offices where adult felony trials are typically conducted.falco and jeffrey worked in the same branch office before,after which falco was transferred to a different branch office the van nuys branch.during the short time they worked in the same office,falco and jeffrey would sometimes greet each other in the hallway.but they never worked together,ate lunch together,or socialized outside of the office.also,jeffrey had never supervised falco.
at the outset of the case,bureau director john zajec,who oversees the branch offices but not central trials,decided it had to be assigned to someone who did not have a relationship with jeffrey.zajec himself never worked or had a social relationship with jeffrey.former head dda phil wynn,who zajec supervised,assigned the case to falco.while falco discussed the case with wynn and zajec,he was from the outset given complete discretion regarding how to charge petrisca and proceed with the case.based upon the alleged facts that petrisca drove his car recklessly at approximately miles per hour in a zone drove through two red lights drove down the wrong side of the street,heading straight for another vehicle,swerving away from that vehicle at the last minute,and eventually hitting the vehicle driven by the victim and that he recently attended traffic school,falco independently theorized that petrisca acted with malice.falco concluded petrisca was driving literally like he wanted to kill someone,and charged him accordingly.
falco never spoke to jeffrey before charges were filed against petrisca,and has never spoken with glenn.later,when falco did talk with jeffrey,he explained to him that he would be treated like any other family member who had lost a loved one,and that he would keep him updated on the status of the case.jeffrey assured falco that was all he expected.jeffrey did not interfere in any way in the prosecution of the case,and falco never altered his course of action based upon his contact with jeffrey.
when asked whether he felt any pressure from his superiors regarding the case,falco testified,i under pressure whenever i handle a case where someone has been killed.i got family members who are looking to me for some form of justice,even though,you know,there is no real justice when you lose a loved one.i mean,i ca bring that person back.all i can do is prosecute an individual who is charged charged with committing a crime.when further asked whether he felt any extra pressure because the victim was a relative of a dda,falco said,i put pressure on myself because,yes,i know semow.we do have a personal relationship.we have a professional relationship.i have made filing decisions on this case that i feel i can present to a jury and whether or not all jurors would agree with my theory,i mean,that remains to be seen.but,yeah,there is pressure on me.obviously,i have a very big office,and i see people,and people say to me,oh,you handling jeff semow mother case so,yes,there is pressure.there pressure,but it not external where people are telling me how i should handle this case,what i should do.just the fact people are aware that i prosecuting an individual who is charged with taking the life of a deputy mother.so,yeah,there is pressure there,and some of it is,you know,i put pressure on myself.falco further testified he felt uncomfortable in handling the case because i put in a position where i creating my own feeling of being uncomfortable,because i putting pressure on myself.
at the close of the hearing,the trial court specifically found the da office has handled the case appropriately to date and that all the charging decisions that were made were handled in an appropriate fashion.when framing the issue of whether recusal of the entire da office was appropriate,the court said,so the question that i have to ask myself is whether a dda,whether it falco or somebody else,is going to feel more pressure and more uncomfortable because it the mother of a prosecutor in his own office than would an outside prosecutor.the court concluded,i think,all things considered,although i do believe the da office has handled everything appropriately to date,i think any prosecutor in this office would of the very close relationship would feel more pressure and more uncomfortable than a prosecutor from another agency.so i granting the motion to recuse the da office.
the attorney general and the da appealed the ruling.see,subd.a.we expedited briefing and oral argument and now reverse the ruling.
