an individual investor securities fraud claims against a brokerage firm were rejected when the district court granted the firm a summary judgment and dismissal.the firm then invoked a provision of the private securities litigation reform act of act or reform act,c,contending that the investor complaints and briefs violated federal rule of civil procedure b and that monetary sanctions were mandated.the district court found three rule b violations,one in the investor complaints and two in his brief opposing summary judgment.the court,however,declined to impose any sanctions.both sides appeal.we affirm for the most part,but vacate the district court order to the extent that it imposed no sanction at all.the reform act mandates a sanction in any private securities action where a party or lawyer violates rule b.accordingly,we remand for the district court to enter an order that identifies and admonishes the lawyers responsible for the three rule b violations committed in this action.
patrick morris owned shares of the proctor gamble worth about million when he retired from the company in.morris decided to sell the shares and invest the proceeds in a diversified retirement portfolio.in december he invested roughly million with the masters program,an investment service offered by wachovia securities.the masters program allows investors with more than to have their portfolios handled by money managers who usually work with accounts exceeding million.wachovia describes participation in the program as involving three steps first,a wachovia financial advisor helps the investor choose an investment strategy second,the advisor recommends money managers who will implement the strategy by selecting and monitoring suitable securities and third,the advisor and the investor periodically assess investment results.
morris selected five money managers who had contracted with wachovia to participate in the program.morris signed several documents disclosing numerous fees associated with the program.contrary to his expectations,morris initial account balance of approximately million decreased by,or percent,within several months.morris wachovia,d.
in november morris sued wachovia in the district court for the eastern district of virginia.his complaint attributed his losses to wachovia operation of the masters program in violation of the securities laws specifically,section b of the securities exchange act of exchange act,b,and the securities and exchange commission rules and.morris amended his original complaint as a matter of right.see.the district court granted wachovia motion to dismiss the first amended complaint without prejudice,and morris then filed his second amended complaint.morris,d at.wachovia filed a counterclaim against morris seeking indemnity under one of the parties agreements.
among the allegations contained in the first amended complaint,but not the second amended one,was that wachovia never disclosed that the firm profited by lending to third parties stocks held in morris account.sec rules sharply constrain such lending,but permit it for stocks held by investors who have bought on margin.see.morris never bought any stocks on margin.his lawyers based the stock loan allegation on the knowledge that such lending takes place generally in the securities industry,but they had no evidence that wachovia had lent any of morris stocks to third parties.the district court later determined that the stock loan allegation violated rule b.
the second amended complaint contained numerous claims under section b of the exchange act and section of the investment advisers act of.the district court grouped the section b claims into four categories claims involving selection and monitoring of money managers those involving aggregation of trades those involving rounding up and passing along sec fees to investors and those involving misrepresentation of securities prices and the failure to provide adequate periodic account information.morris,d at.in august the district court granted wachovia motion to dismiss the claims in the first three categories,concluding that morris did not satisfy the elements of a claim for relief under section b of the exchange act.id.at.the court allowed morris to proceed with his section b claim as to the fourth category and with his investment advisers act claim.id.at.morris moved to certify a class action for money damages under rule b based on his surviving claims.the district court concluded that the common issues did not predominate over the individual ones and denied certification.morris wachovia.
wachovia moved for summary judgment.in his brief opposing wachovia motion,morris through counsel made two contentions that the district court later determined were rule b violations.the first contention concerned the deposition of charles baldiswieler,an executive at tcw investment management,one of the five money managers morris selected.at one point in his deposition baldiswieler was asked about a wachovia questionnaire to tcw that used the phrase commission recapture program.baldiswieler testified that the phrase could have been a reference to a soft dollar arrangement.id.under such an arrangement an investment adviser directs its clients brokerage transactions to a in exchange for products and services other than transaction execution ranging from research reports to client referrals.see securities exchange commission,inspection report on the soft dollar practices of,investment advisers and mutual funds at part,available at.gov news.
however,baldiswieler also testified in his deposition,i believe wachovia is not a soft dollar broker i do believe they even have the apparatus to do soft dollars.morris brief quoted baldiswieler more tentative comment about soft dollars and argued that t he logical and reasonable inference to be drawn from this and other facts was that wachovia selected only those money managers who would help wachovia earn trade execution income,not those who would maximize client returns.the brief never pointed out that baldiswieler said specifically that he did not believe wachovia was a soft dollar broker.
the second problematic contention in morris brief opposing summary judgment concerned the deposition of wachovia executive burt white.white described himself as the only door that gets money managers into the masters program.asked whether wachovia had any controls or policies to ensure that financial advisors are paying attention to the portfolio construction in a way that maximizes their returns for the investors,white replied,i do know if there are any controls or not.morris brief cited this testimony as supporting the assertion that wachovia had no systems or controls in place to assure that the results of any research on money manager performance was received by any financial advisors who were placing customers in the masters program.white lack of awareness about whether there were any controls for the review of investor accounts by wachovia financial advisors,however,had little bearing on the claim that the advisors had no information about the performance records of the money managers they were recommending.
the district court granted wachovia summary judgment as to all of morris remaining claims on august.on the same day,the district court entered an order dismissing wachovia counterclaim that had been based on morris express waiver of receipt of trade confirmation slips.a provision in the waiver purported to obligate morris to indemnify wachovia for any expenses arising from wachovia actions based on the waiver.the court concluded that the indemnity provision neither applied to morris suit nor complied with virginia rule that indemnity against one own wrongdoing must be clearly set forth in the contract.
although the summary judgment and dismissal order terminated the case on the merits,the district court did not make specific findings upon the final adjudication as to whether all parties and lawyers had complied with the requirements of rule b,as the reform act requires.on august,wachovia moved to alter or amend the judgment,see rule e,to include these findings and to obtain reform act sanctions against morris for alleged rule b violations.see c.morris,in turn,moved for sanctions based on wachovia counterclaim.
wachovia requested that the district court direct it to submit its affidavit of costs and attorneys fees incurred in defending this action.reply br.at.at the sanctions hearing on november,the district court noted that wachovia had not submitted any actual evidence of its fees.later that week wachovia counsel submitted an affidavit listing the fees by generic procedural stages of the case,for example,class certification motion and document discovery.the affidavit named the lawyers or paralegals who worked on each stage,their hourly rates,hours billed on the stage,and the total amount billed.morris moved to strike this affidavit as untimely presented.
in a memorandum opinion filed on january,the district court found as noted above three rule b violations by morris counsel the unsubstantiated stock loan claim in the original and first amended complaints,the selective citation of baldiswieler testimony in the brief opposing summary judgment,and the mischaracterization of white testimony in that same brief.the district court concluded,however,that these violations did not merit the award of monetary sanctions.the court held that the other instances of misconduct alleged by wachovia were not rule b violations and did not merit sanctions.the court therefore denied wachovia motion to alter the judgment to impose sanctions and denied as moot morris motion to strike the fee affidavit.finally,the court denied morris motion for sanctions,concluding that wachovia had not violated rule b in filing its counterclaim.wachovia appeals and morris.
title i of the reform act,stat,represents congress effort to curb perceived abuses in securities fraud suits through provisions that,among other things,mandate imposition of sanctions for frivolous litigation.merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,dabit,d.in particular,the act alters the consequences of rule b violations in private actions under the exchange act.see c.the act nevertheless leaves rule b architecture intact.for its part,rule b requires that an attorney conduct a reasonable investigation of the factual and legal basis for his claim before filing.brubaker city of richmond,cir.an overview of the act and rule b brings the parties specific contentions into focus.
at the end of a private securities fraud action,the district court must evaluate on the record whether each party and lawyer complied with rule b as to any complaint,responsive pleading,or dispositive motion filed.c.before finding that a party or lawyer has violated rule b,the district court must provide the potential violator with notice and an opportunity to respond.id.c.if the district court goes on to find a rule b violation,the act provides that the court shall impose sanctions on the offender.id.because the sanctions instruction comes in terms of the mandatory shall,which normally creates an obligation impervious to judicial discretion,lexecon milberg weiss bershad hynes lerach,d,the district court must impose sanctions for each violation found.also,the act applies to any action with a claim arising under chapter of title of the,et,so the rule b inquiry is mandatory even if other claims in the action arise under other laws.
the act guides the district court selection of a sanction.when the abuse being punished is a rule b violation in any responsive pleading or dispositive motion,the act establishes a rebuttable presumption that the appropriate sanction,c a,is an award to the opposing party of the reasonable attorneys fees and other expenses incurred as a direct result of the violation.id.c a i.when the abuse is the substantial failure of any complaint to satisfy rule b,the act establishes a rebuttable presumption that the proper sanction is an award to the opposing party of the reasonable attorneys fees and other expenses incurred in the action.id.c a ii.these presumptions are rebutted if the party or lawyer to be sanctioned proves either that the statutory award would impose an unreasonable burden on the offending party or lawyer and that fail ing to make such an award would not impose a greater harm on the party seeking sanctions,id.c b i,or that the rule b violation being punished was de minimis,id.c b ii.if the presumption is rebutted,then the court shall award the sanctions that the court deems appropriate pursuant to rule.c c.
thus,for private securities fraud suits congress altered the consequences of a rule b violation but did not rewrite the conventional standards for evaluating rule b compliance.dellastatious williams,cir quoting simon debartolo group,richard jacobs group,cir.those standards continue to apply.
rule b provides in part that when a lawyer present s to the court a pleading,motion,or other paper,the lawyer on penalty of sanctions certifies two things to the best of his or her knowledge,information,and belief,formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances.first,the lawyer certifies that the claims,defenses,and other legal contentions therein are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension,modification,or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.b.second,the lawyer certifies that the allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support.b.
a legal argument fails to satisfy rule b when in applying a standard of objective reasonableness,it can be said that a reasonable attorney in like circumstances could not have believed his actions to be legally justified.hunter earthgrains.bakery,cir punctuation omitted.the legal argument must have absolutely no chance of success under the existing precedent to contravene the rule.id.punctuation omitted.factual allegations fail to satisfy rule b when they are unsupported by any information obtained prior to filing.brubaker,at.
by the time a case reaches the final order stage,the district court has acquired unique familiarity with the conduct of the parties and their lawyers.that familiarity explains why our review of all aspects of a district court rule determination is for abuse of discretion.in re kunstler,cir.nothing in the reform act sanctions provision changes this standard of review.moreover,the supreme court has reasoned that review of rule decisions for abuse of discretion discourage s litigants from pursuing marginal appeals,thus reducing the amount of satellite litigation.cooter gell hartmarx,d.
a district court has abused its discretion if its decision is guided by erroneous legal principles or rests upon a clearly erroneous factual finding.westberry gislaved gummi ab,cir.we do not ask whether we would have come to the same conclusion as the district court if we were examining the matter de novo.fellheimer,eichen braverman,charter,cir.rather,after reviewing the record and the reasons the district court offered for its decision,we reverse for abuse of discretion if we form a definite and firm conviction that the court below committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.westberry,at punctuation omitted.
wachovia first challenges the district court evaluation of morris complaints.c a ii.wachovia contends that,notwithstanding the district court conclusion to the contrary,the complaints substantial ly fail ed to comply with rule b,and this failure required the district court to presume that the appropriate sanction was an award of wachovia full attorney fees and costs.id.wachovia further insists that the rule b violation was not de minimis.id.c b ii.to prevail on its argument about morris complaints,wachovia must show one of two things a the single rule b violation found in the complaints namely,the stock loan claim,see supra part warranted monetary sanctions,or b certain other claims in the complaints were rule b violations so serious as to require an award of fees and costs.
the district court held that morris counsel lacked a sufficient factual basis to include the stock loaning allegation in the first amended complaint.the allegation,in other words,was unsupported by any information obtained prior to filing in contravention of rule b.brubaker,at.the court then found that this rule b violation in the first amended complaint did not compel an award of fees and costs under the reform act for two reasons the violation impact on wachovia and the case was de minim i s,and the baseless allegation d id not qualify as a substantial violation triggering c a ii presumption for the sanctions sum.
a rule b violation in a complaint is only severe enough to activate the full attorney fees and expenses presumption if the violation makes the complaint as a whole a substantial failure under rule b.therefore,if we determine that the district court did not err in concluding that the stock loan allegation alone did not make the first amended complaint a substantial failure under rule b,we may affirm without reaching the question whether the impact of the violation was de minimis in the context of the litigation as a whole.
we must first consider what standard of appellate review applies to a district court reform act determination that a complaint is a substantial failure under rule b.the act does not specify the standard.while at first blush de novo review might appear to be appropriate,as it is for ordinary questions of law,we conclude that reform act substantial failure determinations should be reviewed for abuse of discretion.this conclusion hews to two supreme court precedents.in one case the court explained that because trial judges are in a better position than appellate judges to decide whether parties or their lawyers have violated rule,trial judge decisions in this area warrant deference.cooter gell,at.reform act substantial failure determinations are simply a variation of rule b assessments.in the other case the court adopted abuse of discretion as the standard of review for district court rulings under the equal access to justice act eaja,d,which authorizes an award of reasonable attorney fees against the government unless the court finds that the position of the united states was substantially justified.pierce underwood,d.the eaja is a statute requiring examination of the merits of the government litigating position,just as the reform act sanctions scheme requires examining the merits of the complaint.thus,the congruence between the eaja,rule,and the reform act indicates that the abuse of discretion standard is proper here.
under this standard we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the stock loan allegation did not turn the first amended complaint into a substantial failure under rule b.t he substantial failure language requires an inquiry into whether the complaint rule b violations make the complaint as a whole essentially,without material qualification,in the main,or materially frivolous.gurary,cir walker,concurring citing black law dictionary ed see also pierce,at.concluding that the government position is substantially justified under the eaja if it is justified in substance or in the is,justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.punctuation omitted.
here,the stock loan allegation was only one of many claims asserted in the first amended complaint.wachovia does not contend that rebutting the allegation,which was not very complex factually,imposed any demonstrably onerous burden.the allegation did not,moreover,figure so prominently in the case as to contaminate the first amended complaint in the main.so the district court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to classify the first amended complaint as a substantial failure under rule b solely because of the stock loan claim.
wachovia next argues that the district court should have concluded that several of morris other allegations were without legal or factual support in violation of rule b.in particular,wachovia homes in on four matters the allegation that wachovia selected as money managers only those who pledged to generate trading fee income for wachovia the allegation that wachovia impermissibly earned hidden fees the allegation that wachovia earned revenue at morris expense and the fraud on the market allegation that would have enabled morris to benefit from a presumption of reliance on a wachovia misrepresentation.
to prevail wachovia must first show that the district court abused its discretion in finding that none of these claims violated rule b.if violations are established,wachovia must next show that the court abused its discretion in concluding that these violations did not make the complaints as a whole substantial failure s under rule b.finally,the sanctions opponent such as morris counsel could avoid payment of the adversary full fees by demonstrating that the rule b violations found were de minimis,but we do not reach this last analytical step because we dispense with wachovia claims at the first two steps.
among the allegations in the second amended complaint was the claim,namely that wachovia allowed a money manager to enlist in the masters program only if the manager promised to help wachovia earn stock trade,asset custody,or other fees from the manager clients.the complaint attributed the information supporting this allegation to a investment adviser.
a complaint containing allegations unsupported by any information obtained prior to filing,or allegations based on information which minimal factual inquiry would disprove,will subject the author to rule sanctions.kunstler,at emphasis added.this rule also empowers the district court to sanction a party or lawyer for insisting on a position after it is no longer tenable.b advisory committee notes to amendments.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that morris lawyers had a sufficient factual basis for the claim.morris lawyers initially grounded the allegation on information provided by stephen goddard,the anonymous investment adviser.goddard deposition testimony,however,came close to contradicting the allegation.in opposing summary judgment,morris lawyers then relied on matthew mooney,goddard former business partner who was also one of morris lawyers earlier in the case.mooney testified repeatedly in his deposition that he had personal knowledge substantiating the allegation.yet mooney only claim of firsthand knowledge was based on a hazy recollection of a meeting at which goddard and wachovia employees may have discussed a variety of business deals in addition to the masters program.
the district court concluded that mooney personal knowledge was only hearsay and therefore insufficient to allow morris to survive summary judgment on the allegation.the court nevertheless determined that the testimony was sufficient to avoid a rule b violation on the allegation.because mooney testimony provided some albeit vulnerable support for the allegation,there was no abuse of discretion in the court determination.
the first amended complaint alleged that wachovia charged hidden fees each time morris bought stocks.this claim stemmed from an apparent discrepancy in the account statements.the price per share as listed on the statements,multiplied by the number of shares purchased,did not match the total sum charged each month.the hidden fees claim was brought into doubt when morris lawyers examined the confirmation slips associated with each trade.the slips,unlike the monthly statements,reported the prices charged to a full nine decimal places.morris had waived receipt of the slips when he opened the account,and wachovia provided the slips to morris counsel only after the first amended complaint was filed.the second amended complaint dropped this hidden fees claim.
the district court acted within its discretion in holding that morris lawyers were entitled to infer from the monthly account statements that morris was being charged transaction fees not previously disclosed to him.although wachovia asserted that the slips,not the monthly statements,accurately stated the fees charged when the firm provided the slips to morris lawyers,that assertion alone did not compel morris lawyers to abandon the hidden fees claim.rather,morris lawyers were entitled to a reasonable amount of time to investigate the assertion and the discrepancy between the slips and the account statements.because morris lawyers dropped the claim when their inquiry established that it was no longer tenable,the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining there was no rule b violation.
the first amended complaint also alleged that on some unspecified trades wachovia acted as a principal rather than as an agent for morris as buyer or seller,thereby profiting directly at morris expense.morris counsel based this revenue claim on wachovia statement in a disclosure document that it engaged in transactions as agent,or where permitted by law,as principal for clients.this claim did not appear in the second amended complaint.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the disclosure document relied on by morris lawyers provided a sufficient factual basis for his revenue claim.wachovia points to another document that said the firm would act only as agent,not as principal,in transactions relating to the masters program.the document relied on by morris lawyers covered the broad range of investment services offered by wachovia.even assuming that morris lawyers made a mistake in drawing an inference from a general disclosure document that was contradicted by a document,this mistake did not compel the district court to find a rule b violation.the rule required some evidentiary support for the revenue claim,but it did not require perfection.
with regard to morris allegation that he had relied on wachovia fraudulent statements or omissions,the first amended complaint asserted the fraud alleged herein consisted of the omission of material facts,accordingly reliance is presumed as a matter of law.alternatively,should the fraud alleged herein be construed as misstatements the plaintiff and the class members rely on the fraud on the market doctrine.see longman food lion,cir w here material false statements or omissions have been disseminated to an impersonal,market for securities,the reliance of individual plaintiffs on the integrity of the market price may be presumed.punctuation omitted.the second amended complaint,by contrast,did not invoke the fraud on the market theory rather,it emphasized that morris was entitled to rely on wachovia representations because wachovia owed morris a fiduciary duty.the district court concluded that the first amended complaint reference to the fraud on the market theory did not contravene rule b requirement that legal contentions be reasonably justified.wachovia argues that this conclusion was an abuse of discretion.
we agree that this case was for the fraud on the market theory.the case concerns alleged improprieties in an investment advice and management program wachovia operated.wachovia alleged misstatements about fees charged were not falsehoods that could have been reflected in the market price of any securities.the fee charged for a securities trade is distinct from the price of the security being traded.the masters program connected morris to money managers in exchange for fees wachovia charged,but the program was not a security traded on any market let alone,in terms,an impersonal and market.the fraud on the market theory was simply inapplicable to morris claim.thus,when morris lawyers invoked the theory in the first complaint,they violated rule b prohibition on legal arguments that have absolutely no chance of success under existing precedent.hunter,at.
the next step is to determine whether this violation made the first amended complaint a substantial failure under rule b.we note that the violation concerned an essential element of the securities fraud claim,which was the only kind of claim the first amended complaint asserted.a private plaintiff rule securities fraud complaint must allege among other things that the plaintiff relied on the misrepresentations at issue.see the wharf holdings united int l holdings,d the plaintiff must sustain damages through reliance on the misrepresentation citing basic levinson,d.
nevertheless,wachovia arguments ultimately pay insufficient attention to the entirety of the first amended complaint.the reliance assertion must be read in context.morris lawyers did not rest this assertion on the fraud on the market theory alone.instead,they expressly invoked the theory as an alternative to the primary assertion that the investor reliance on wachovia omissions could be presumed.the paragraph labeled reliance quoted above did not specify the basis for such a presumption,but a few paragraphs in the preceding pages did.these paragraphs stressed that wachovia owed fiduciary duties to morris.the express references to the fiduciary relationship allow the reliance paragraph to be fairly understood as arguing that reliance may be presumed in a fiduciary relationship.this argument is supported by supreme court language,thereby forestalling a successful rule b attack.under the federal securities laws a duty to disclose material information may arise from the relationship between parties.chiarella united states,d.the alleged fiduciary relationship between morris and wachovia was one imposing on wachovia a duty to disclose material information,id.at,and when such a duty has been breached courts dispense with a requirement of positive proof of reliance.basic,at.
the first amended complaint reliance allegation did not hinge,then,on the fraud on the market theory,but could be reasonably understood to hinge on the fiduciary relationship between wachovia and morris.as a result,the frivolous invocation of the theory did not transmute the first complaint as a whole into a substantial failure under rule b.we therefore can not conclude that the district court committed reversible error in assessing wachovia claim.
in sum,the district court did not err in rejecting wachovia four arguments that morris complaints were substantial failures under rule b.in addition,because the sole instance of rule b misconduct that the district court identified in the complaints did not convert them into substantial failures of compliance in violation of the rule,supra part,the district court was not bound to presume that wachovia should receive an award of its full fees and costs in the action under c a ii.
wachovia next challenges the district court evaluation of morris brief opposing summary judgment.because a motion for summary judgment is a dispositive motion,a brief opposing such a motion falls within the ambit of the reform act sanction inquiry.see c a i presuming sanctions for any responsive pleading or dispositive motion contravening rule b.although the district court found that morris lawyers drew impermissible inferences from the testimony of baldiswieler and white in their brief see supra part,the district court declined to order any monetary sanctions for these rule b violations because it concluded that wachovia failed to prove the amount of its fees and costs incurred as a direct result of the violation s.c a i.
wachovia contends that the district court erred in allocating the burden of proving the fee amount to the firm and in not providing it another chance to explain what portion of its fees were fairly traced to the baldiswieler and white violations.in arguing that the district court was obligated to award a fee notwithstanding any deficiencies in its fee affidavit,wachovia relies on isolated language from another circuit precedent.see oxford asset mgmt.jaharis,cir a district court faced with an inadequate fee application must still award a reasonable fee.citing norman hous.auth.of montgomery,cir.
the reform act does not instruct the district court how to determine a reasonable attorneys fee.statutes such as the civil rights attorney fees awards act of,similarly speak in terms of reasonable attorney fees.this linguistic similarity is a strong indication that the routine procedures for determining a fee may be used as a guide for determining a reform act fee.flight attendants zipes,d.to be sure,congress differing large objectives including equitable considerations behind different statutes mean that a fee award reasonable under one statute may not be reasonable under another.martin franklin capital,d punctuation omitted.this caveat does not counsel hesitation here,however,for nothing in the dif
