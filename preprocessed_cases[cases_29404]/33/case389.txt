william jefferson,william jefferson lost a state administrative appeal in which william jefferson challenged the orange county tax assessor assessor valuation of a parcel of real property.william jefferson then filed suit in federal district court,alleging that its procedural due process rights were violated in the course of the administrative appeal hearing.we affirm the district court conclusion that the state administrative appeal did not deny william jefferson procedural due process.in a separate memorandum disposition filed concurrently with this opinion,we affirm the lower court grant of the agency motion for a protective order and its denial of class certification.
william jefferson owns a parcel of real property located in orange county,california.william jefferson disputed the assessor valuation of that property and assessment of state property taxes.william jefferson appealed the assessor determination to the assessment appeals board for orange county board.the board denied,on statute of limitations grounds,william jefferson administrative appeal.the merits of the board decision are not relevant here.
the assessor was represented at the administrative hearing by james harmon.paula whaley advised the board.both harmon and whaley are attorneys who work for the county counsel for orange county,the county public law office.william jefferson alleges that because the board was advised by one member of the orange county counsel office,and the assessor was represented by another member of that office,the hearing did not comply with the requirements of due process.the orange county counsel dual representation of the board and the assessor is expressly authorized by california government code.
william jefferson filed suit in federal district court arguing that the hearing procedures employed by the board violated william jefferson procedural due process rights under the fourteenth amendment and seeking relief under.at a brief bench trial,whaley,harmon,and the clerk for the board testified regarding the procedures that the orange county counsel office employed to avoid improper exchange of information between attorneys who represent the board and those who represent the assessor.harmon and whaley also testified about their conduct with respect to the william jefferson case in particular.
the district court issued findings of fact.the district court found that whaley was a member of the county counsel advisory section,while harmon was a member of the litigation section.in the william jefferson case,whaley duties included reviewing the parties briefs to the board,attending the hearing,observing the board deliberations,advising the board on the applicable law,and preparing the written findings of fact memorializing the board decision.the district court found that whaley did not have,and did not seek to exercise,any discretionary authority in drafting the findings of fact.
the district court found that t he county counsel office takes diligent measures to separate the members of its advisory section from the members of its litigation section.these include maintaining a separate work space for members of the advisory section and a locked file cabinet for all documents relating to advising the board.both whaley and harmon had received training on the county counsel procedures for maintaining an ethical wall between the advisory and litigation sections.the district court found that due to the county counsel procedures and whaley own diligence in observing the office ethical rules,she had no formal or informal contact with harmon during the pendency of the william jefferson appeal.
the district court found that whaley had never represented the assessor and that harmon played no direct or indirect role in whaley professional reviews or advancement in the county counsel office.whaley and harmon had mutual professional respect for each other but rarely interacted and there was no evidence of any shared loyalty that would have influenced whaley advice to the board in the william jefferson case.the district court concluded that t here is simply no evidence that harmon was ever in a position to influence whaley advice,if any,to the board.
the district court also issued ten conclusions of law.the district court found that expressly permits one member of the county counsel office to advise the board in a hearing in which another member represents the assessor.the district court concluded that this provision was not unconstitutional on its face because the dual representation it permits does not necessarily call into question the impartiality.the district court also concluded that the statute did not violate due process as applied in william jefferson case,because there was no evidence that whaley advice to the board was improperly influenced by her professional respect for harmon.the district court added that even if whaley had been so influenced,the board,not whaley,was the in william jefferson case and there was no evidence that it was biased.
the district court entered judgment against william jefferson and william jefferson timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
william jefferson does not challenge the district court findings of fact.we review de novo the district court legal conclusion that the board hearing procedures did not violate william jefferson procedural due process rights.see singh holder,cir.william jefferson makes both a facial and an challenge to california government code,the state provision authorizing the county counsel office to represent both the board and the assessor.if william jefferson challenge fails,then william jefferson facial challenge necessarily fails as well because there is at least one set of circumstances where application of does not violate a taxpayer procedural due process rights.see united states inzunza,cir a facial challenge to a statute necessarily fails if an challenge has failed because the plaintiff must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the statute would be valid.quoting united states salerno,d.
william jefferson asserts that the dual representation scheme authorized by denies taxpayers an unbiased adjudicator and undermines the appearance of fairness in the board proceedings.william jefferson also argues that whaley interactions with the board were impermissible ex parte contacts with a decision maker.finally,william jefferson suggests that the orange county counsel office has a financial stake in the outcome of taxpayer appeals that could influence the advice its attorneys give to the board.we consider each of these arguments in turn.
we begin our constitutional analysis with the state statutory provision at issue.section provides in full 
the same law firm shall not be employed to advise or represent both the assessor and the county board of equalization on any matters relating to hearings before the county board of equalization.this prohibition shall not apply to the county counsel office.individual representatives of that office may represent the assessor and the county board of equalization,as long as the same individual does not represent both parties.
although there is no federal authority directly on point,the california court of appeal has held that does not violate procedural due process,so long as the attorney advising the county board is screened from any inappropriate contact with the advocate for the assessor.howitt superior court,th,d.the california court resolution of a federal constitutional question is persuasive but is not binding on us.see davis metro,cir.
we turn first to william jefferson argument that having whaley advise the board in the same proceeding where harmon represented the assessor undermined the impartiality of the board,or the appearance thereof.it is axiomatic that a fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process.caperton massey coal,d alteration in original quoting in re murchison.this applies to administrative agencies which adjudicate as well as to courts.withrow larkin,d.moreover,justice must satisfy the appearance of justice.marshall jerrico,d quoting offutt united states.accordingly,due process requires that
