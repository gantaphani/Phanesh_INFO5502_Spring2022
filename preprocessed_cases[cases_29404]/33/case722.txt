sometimes lawyers seem to forget that,in their professional capacities,they owe a duty of loyalty to their when they no longer like them.and when a lawyer becomes convinced his client is on the wrong side of a particular legal dispute,the lawyer generally has the option of staying out of that dispute.he does not,however,have the option of switching sides and suing a client on behalf of a third party,alleging that the very settlement he obtained for the client in prior litigation actually belongs to the third party.and when the client objects to such an attempt,and sues the lawyer for breach of his professional obligations,the lawyer probably should back against her,apparently outraged that she has dragged him into the controversy and caused him to expend money to defend himself.
but all of that is just background,because the issue in this case is whether the lawyer technically a law firm against its client should have been stricken,in whole or in part,because it constituted a slapp action,and because the law firm failed to serve the client with mandatory notice of her right to arbitrate its fee claims under the mandatory fee arbitration act mfaa.bus,et we are not here to evaluate either the law firm subjective motivations,or whether its own conduct may have inflicted more harm on itself than anything its former client might have done.the only issues to be determined are whether the is covered under the statute,and if so,whether it states a claim that has a probability of success or was subject to dismissal under the mfaa.
focusing on those relevant issues,we conclude that each of the law firm causes of action falls within the protection of the statute,because each of them is based substantially upon a client petitioning her initiation of a fee arbitration proceeding under the mfaa,and then her initiation of a against the law firm in this action.
moreover,the law firm has failed to demonstrate a probability of success on its causes of action for fraud and negligent misrepresentation.the facts it has pleaded in support of these claims are not merely insufficient to constitute a cause of action,they wholly preclude any claim of justifiable reliance.moreover,those claims seek to recover damages not available in this case.consequently,we conclude the trial court erred in denying the motion with respect to those claims.
the law firm breach of contract and breach of covenant claims suffer from a different problem.those claims,which seek fees allegedly earned in representing the client,are subject to dismissal unless the firm gives the client notice of her right to arbitrate those fee claims under the mfaa prior to proceeding in court.and while the firm claims it served its client with the required notice,it offered no admissible evidence to support that point.moreover,the notice it claims to have sent would have been inadequate in any case.the firm second amended contained greatly expanded claims,relating not only to the single fee dispute initially alleged by the law firm and mentioned in its putative notice,but also additional fees allegedly earned pursuant to two other fee agreements.the law firm made no showing at all that it had provided arbitration notices with respect to those other fees.the purported notice was,as a consequence,inadequate to fulfill the firm obligation under the statute.
however,that flaw is not fatal to these causes of action,because the client waived her right to enforce the mfaa when she previously filed her own against the law firm in court and the decision to dismiss for lack of a proper arbitration notice is discretionary in any case.because the client cites no other reasons why the court erred in concluding these claims were viable,we conclude the court properly denied the motion with respect to them.
we therefore reverse the court order denying the client motion,and remand the case with directions to grant the motion as to the law firm causes of action for fraud and negligent misrepresentation.we also direct the court to reconsider the issue of attorney fees under the statute in light of that changed circumstance.
according to the various pleadings in this case,here is what occurred lori gulsvig was a shareholder,officer and employee of california shirt sales,a california corporation css california.in march of,css california entered into an agreement with tultex,pursuant to which css california sold assets to tultex.tultex formed a virginia corporation,also called california shirt sales,css virginia for the purpose of owning those assets.
prior to the asset sale,css california had an account receivable,owed by a company called color spot,and hired respondent,the law firm of philipson simon,to collect it.although philipson was able to obtain a judgment against color spot on behalf of css california,that judgment was later determined to be uncollectible.according to gulsvig,css california receivables that had been charged off including the color spot judgment at the time of the sale to tultex were not included in the sale,and remained the property of css california.
after the sale,gulsvig became an employee of tultex for a period of time.similarly,philipson was engaged to collect accounts on behalf of tultex.in late or early,gulsvig left her employment with tultex and formed a new business,sundog,international.she retained philipson to perform legal services on behalf of herself and sundog.among those services were renewed efforts to collect the color spot judgment.
approximately two years later,in october of,philipson obtained a settlement of the color spot judgment.the total amount to be paid by color spot was,of which was designated as attorney fees.philipson remitted of the funds to gulsvig,and made clear its intention to keep the remaining for itself.gulsvig contested philipson right to the,and filed a request for fee arbitration with the orange county bar association.
after gulsvig filed her arbitration request,philipson informed her that it questioned her right to retain any part of the settlement funds,and further that campbell advisors,the plaintiff in this case had asserted its own claim to the funds as successor in interest to tultex.in january of,philipson requested that gulsvig remit back to it the she had already received from the color spot settlement,and offered to retain those funds in its trust account pending a determination of which party was entitled to them.
philipson also filed a formal response to gulsvig arbitration request,in which it argued that the fee dispute could not be decided until after a threshold determination as to which company or person is entitled to the proceeds from the color spot settlement.
when gulsvig did not accede to philipson request that she return the settlement funds she had already received,it threatened her with a lawsuit,and even provided her with a proposed complaint purportedly one patrick grannan,of the grannan law office.the complaint accused gulsvig of breach of contract,conversion and fraud,and sought damages stemming from her retention of settlement funds which allegedly belonged to campbell.in the letter which accompanied that threatened complaint,philipson attorney jeffery simon the same attorney who had done the bulk of the work for gulsvig also made the frankly startling suggestion to gulsvig new counsel that he had had several discussions with grannan and may be in a position to mediate the dispute prior to litigation and without incurring significant costs and attorneys fees.in essence,simon admitted prior client interests with the attorney now representing a party preparing to sue her,and offered to act as a neutral in this dispute.
approximately three months later,philipson itself through jeffrey simon,then acting as counsel for campbell,filed what appears to be a copy of the grannan complaint against gulsvig.
gulsvig responded with a demurrer and a motion to disqualify philipson from further representing campbell gulsvig also filed a against philipson,alleging causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty,negligence,breach of contract and conversion.in substance,gulsvig alleged that philipson had breached its fiduciary duty to her,and acted negligently,by failing to ascertain who owned the color spot judgment prior to collecting it on her behalf,and then acting on behalf of campbell in attempting to retrieve it from her.gulsvig also alleged that philipson breached its contract with her,and committed a conversion,by retaining of the proceeds of the color spot judgment.
by the same patrick grannan who purportedly drafted but did not file the complaint against gulsvig for filed its own against gulsvig.it is the version of that that is at issue in this appeal.
in the initial version,philipson asserted causes of action for breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,fraud and negligent misrepresentation.it sought monetary damages,as well as indemnity,contribution and declaratory relief.philipson alleged that while gulsvig had initially represented,during her tenure with tultex,that tultex owned the color spot receivable,she later claimed to own the receivable personally.philipson purportedly relied upon gulsvig latter representation in undertaking its renewed efforts to collect the judgment and in paying funds from the settlement to her.subsequent to that payment,however,philipson asserted it was informed by campbell that the color spot judgment had been included in the assets sold to tultex.without actually asserting that campbell ownership claim was the correct one,philipson alleged that gulsvig had breached her agreement with it by not being truthful with it,and not keeping it informed of developments 
philipson further alleged that as a result of gulsvig conduct,it had been induced to wrongly distribute the settlement funds to her.it also asserted that it has been brought into this action as a result of gulsvig actions and conduct and faces possible exposure,attorneys fees and costs.if philipson had known of the falsity of the representations made by gulsvig,it would not have performed as alleged and should not have been sued in this action.
philipson indemnity,contribution and declaratory relief claims determination that gulsvig was required to indemnify it against any damages it might be held liable to pay her as a result of the she had already filed against it 
gulsvig demurred to the,and the court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend.the court order stated that as to all causes of action philipson has not adequately alleged any damages that flow from the alleged breaches and tortious conduct.further,as to the and causes of action there is no party alleged that would rise to causes of action for indemnity or contribution.
philipson first amended also alleged causes of action for breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,fraud and negligent misrepresentation,but no longer included any claims for indemnity,contribution or declaratory relief.its allegations regarding damages were expanded to include not only attorneys fees and costs of defending the action brought against it by gulsvig which would not have been incurred but for the actions and conduct of gulsvig as set forth herein,but also its potential exposure or liability for monies distributed as a result of gulsvig conduct italics added.
rather than again demurring,gulsvig moved for judgment on philipson first amended.she argued philipson had still not alleged any cognizable damages,and had failed to plead any facts demonstrating it had reasonably relied on any representation she had made the court granted the motion,but again gave philipson leave to amend.
philipson filed its second amended in january of.in that version,its allegations in support of its claims for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing were substantially expanded.in addition to the prior allegations questioning the truthfulness of gulsvig claimed ownership of the color spot judgment,philipson alleged that gulsvig had committed no less than three distinct breaches of three different retainer agreements.
first,gulsvig was alleged to have breached her initial retainer agreement,relating to the color spot matter,by refusing to allow philipson to keep the in disputed attorney very same fees it was otherwise claiming neither she nor it had any right to because they belonged to campbell.philipson also alleged gulsvig breached a separate retainer agreement with it by refusing to pay contingent fees incurred in connection with a personal injury action.and finally,gulsvig was alleged to have also breached a third retainer agreement,by failing to pay hourly fees.philipson sought damages in the distinct amounts it claimed were owed to it under each of the retainer agreements under the initial color spot agreement under the personal injury contingent agreement and under the final,hourly agreement.
philipson revised fraud and misrepresentation claims incorporated the allegations of the breach of contract claim by reference,and continued to rely upon the assertion that gulsvig had misrepresented her entitlement to the color spot judgment.in that regard,philipson alleged gulsvig used it and its law practice as an instrumentality to perpetrate frauds.in addition,it added allegations gulsvig had wrongfully induced it to forgo the fees it would have been entitled to under the parties contingency fee agreement,by promising she would pay them all sums collected as attorney fees in collection cases.philipson alleged that as a consequence of gulsvig alleged frauds,it was convinced to a waive fees for the personal injury claim and b distribute monies to gulsvig and to allegedly wrongly take monies for which gulsvig was not entitled to take sic.moreover,it has been brought into this action and faces possible exposure,attorneys fees and costs.as to damages,it claimed to have suffered significant injuries and damages and other economic and damages in an amount to be determined at trial.
gulsvig responded to this second amended by filing a combined motion to strike it,and each of the causes of action contained in it,as a slapp action,and to strike it pursuant to code of civil procedure section she made several arguments.first,she asserted the causes of action in the second amended were each based upon her conduct of first pursuing fee arbitration and then filing her against this was the conduct by which she allegedly breached her fee obligation in the color spot case,and which also caused the firm to be brought into this action and suffer consequent damages.such activity constitutes petitioning and is thus protected by the law.
gulsvig asserted that philipson claims for fraud and misrepresentation were insufficient because they lacked the required specificity to support a fraud cause of action.she further argued that none of the causes of action alleged by philipson had merit,in any event,because philipson had not served her with the arbitration notice required by business and professions code section prior to suing her for fees,and thus that the second amended should be stricken.
philipson opposed the motion,accusing gulsvig of lying about the arbitration notice,which jeffrey simon declared the firm rather than he personally had served on her in july of.that notice,which includes no written proof of service,purportedly informed gulsvig the law firm was seeking no less that,plus costs and attorneys fees per agreement in the matter of color spot,among others.simon additionally declared that gulsvig attorney had written him a letter in january of six months after the notice requesting a detailed written response outlining your position with respect to the and confirming that simon had indicated he would be amenable to arbitration.
philipson also argued its second amended did not arise from gulsvig petitioning activity asserting that the gravamen of its second amended was rather gulsvig alleged lies and of fees.
the trial court denied the motion,reasoning gulsvig had not met her burden of establishing the second amended arose out of protected activity,and concluding it stated a viable cause of action for breach of contract which might offset the claims asserted by gulsvig in her own.
our review of an order denying a motion to strike a complaint as a slapp suit is de novo.computerxpress,jackson th,d,whether code of civil procedure section applies and whether the plaintiff has shown a probability of prevailing are both reviewed independently on appeal.jespersen th,d.
code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,requires a process for determining whether a defendant section motion to strike should be granted.first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity.the moving defendant burden is to demonstrate that the act or acts of which the plaintiff complains were taken in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,as defined in the statute.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d.
then,if the court finds that such a showing has been made,the burden shifts to plaintiff to demonstrate there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim,subd.b dupont merck pharmaceutical superior court th,d.
consequently,in this case,gulsvig had the initial burden of establishing the causes of action against her arose out of an act in furtherance of her right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,subd.b.
section,subdivision e,specifically defines an act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue to include any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e,italics added.
in this case,gulsvig argued that philipson entire arose out of her act of petitioning,her pursuit of first an arbitration action and then a,against them.as such,she contends it would qualify for protection under the law.in deciding whether the arising from requirement is met,a court considers the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based,subd.b.city of cotati cashman cal th,d.
we begin our de novo review with the proposition that filing a lawsuit does qualify as petitioning under the law.chavez mendoza th,d.further,we have little trouble concluding that the initiation of a state bar sponsored fee arbitration proceeding is likewise covered after all,it is an official proceeding established by statute to address a particular type of dispute.see computerxpress,jackson,supra,th,d filing of complaint with the federal securities and exchange commission is protected activity.
next,we note that where a cause of action alleges both protected and unprotected activity,the cause of action will be subject to section unless the protected conduct is merely incidental to the unprotected conduct citation.mann quality old time service,th,d see also huntingdon life sciences,stop huntingdon animal cruelty usa,th,d.as explained in fox searchlight pictures,paladino th,d,a plaintiff can not frustrate the purposes of the slapp statute through a pleading tactic of combining allegations of protected and nonprotected activity under the label of one cause of action.
here,philipson alleges as part of its fraud and negligent misrepresentation causes of action,that as a result of gulsvig misrepresentations,it had been sued in this action,and was facing possible exposure,attorneys fees and costs.it further alleges that had it known of the falsity of gulsvig representations,it should not have been sued in this action.of course,the only one who has sued philipson is gulsvig herself,and thus these damage allegations are based on gulsvig own petitioning activity.moreover,these allegations,which have been included in every version of philipson,can not be characterized as merely incidental.indeed,they can be fairly described as constituting the gist of philipson fraud and misrepresentation claims included in its,since they reflect the only specific damages alleged.
the fact philipson has since broadened its fraud and misrepresentation claims to include allegations relating to other retainer agreements between itself and without identifying any distinct fraud damages,or abandoning its original it is merely attempting to avoid operation of the statute by combining allegations of protected and nonprotected activity under the label of one cause of action.fox searchlight pictures,paladino,supra th at,d.consequently,we conclude that philipson fraud and misrepresentation causes of action fall within the protection of the law.
the breach of contract and breach of covenant causes of action contained in philipson second amended complaint,by contrast to the fraud claims,do not mention any specific damage claims based upon philipson forced participation in litigation.instead,each merely alleges that as a proximate result of gulsvig breaches,including failing and refusing to pay fees due of approximately pursuant to the three agreements it has sustained damages in an amount to be determined at trial but not less than.
however,gulsvig points out that if we read between the lines,and compare the allegations of the second amended with the allegations of philipson earlier,we will be forced to the recognition philipson has based its claim,at least in part,on her protected activity.her point is well taken.
gulsvig relies on two things.first,she notes that in addition to alleging she failed and refused to pay the in fees owed under the three retainer agreements,philipson second amended repeats the allegations of breach contained in its complaint,gulsvig is alleged to have breached her contract s by not being truthful with p s,not cooperating with p s and not keeping p s informed of developments pertinent to the sale of tultex in.moreover,in that first amended complaint,philipson specifically alleged that those particular breaches had caused it to sustain significant damages,including but not limited to the attorneys fees and costs of defending the action brought against it by gulsvig 
consequently,based upon the similarity of those allegations,gulsvig asserts that the breach of contract and breach of covenant claims in philipson second amended complaint must be read as continuing to allege damages based upon her pursuit of litigation.in other words,gulsvig urges us to conclude philipson request for contract damages in an amount to be determined at trial but not less than should be read as seeking,plus the expense incurred in defending itself against gulsvig claims.
gulsvig second point is that philipson allegation she breached her initial fee contract by refusing to pay philipson simon the in fees,must be read as a complaint about her initiation of the state bar arbitration that is the manner in which she manifested her refusal.specifically,gulsvig points out that this is not a case in which she was ever in possession of the disputed.if she were,she could theoretically have breached her contract by simply refusing to pay it over to philipson.that would have been activity.but because philipson was at all times in possession of the disputed funds,her alleged refusal to pay required her to take some affirmative steps to dispute philipson right to retain those funds.and she did that by initiating the state bar arbitration.
we are required by statute to interpret the law broadly,subd.a.doing so in this case compels us to agree with gulsvig.the allegations of philipson prior those which have been omitted from its latest version,may properly be considered in interpreting that version.a plaintiff may not discard factual allegations of a pri
