deborah edgerly is the former city administrator of the city of oakland city.edgerly sued the city in,alleging that ron dellums mayor or dellums wrongfully terminated edgerly employment in retaliation for her refusal to violate the city charter,municipal code,and civil service rules and resolutions.
edgerly claims that the trial court erred when it sustained a demurrer to the first two of her three causes of action for violation of the statewide whistleblower statute set forth in labor code section,subdivision c c edgerly also claims that the trial court erred when it dismissed the third whistleblower cause of action on a motion for summary adjudication.
the primary question presented by this appeal is a question of first impression under california law should alleged violations of a charter city municipal law be deemed violations of state law for purposes of section c based on principles of statutory construction and public policy considerations,we hold that they should not,and accordingly,we affirm.
procedural backgrounda.procedural history.
on july,edgerly filed a complaint alleging three causes of action for retaliation under the whistleblower statute,and one cause of action for gender discrimination under the california fair employment and housing act feha,et the city filed a general demurrer to all three of the whistleblower causes of action.
the trial court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend as to the first two causes of action,on the ground edgerly did not identify any violation of state law.the trial court overruled the demurrer as to the third whistleblower cause of action,which alleged a violation of government code section.
edgerly filed a first amended complaint fac,and the city again demurred to all three whistleblower causes of action.this time,the trial court sustained the city demurrer to the first and second causes of action without leave to amend.
in these first two causes of action,edgerly alleged that she was terminated in retaliation for her refusal to agree to the mayor violations of the city charter.the trial court ruled that edgerly did not show the misconduct would result in a violation of a state statute,rule or regulation.the trial court again overruled the demurrer as to the third cause of action,that edgerly alleged a violation of a state statute government code section.
while the third whistleblower cause of action survived demurrer,the trial court later granted the city motion for summary adjudication of that cause of action because edgerly failed to produce evidence showing that a state statute was violated.a jury trial on edgerly remaining fourth cause of action for gender discrimination resulted in a verdict in the city favor.this appeal followed 
plaintiff allegations.
the factual allegations of edgerly declaration opposing the summary adjudication motion are fully consistent with the allegations of the fac.to avoid duplication,we do not separately set forth the ultimate facts recited in that pleading.the following facts are taken from edgerly opposition declaration or from matters of which we have taken judicial notice.
edgerly served as the city finance director from until.in,jerry brown appointed her as city manager.following a revision to the charter,the position of city manager was renamed city administrator in.pursuant to the city charter,the city administrator served at the pleasure of the mayor and could be discharged at any time,for any reason.oak.city charter e charter.
as city administrator,it was part of edgerly job duties to designate,appoint,discipline,or remove directors,department heads,or assistants charter execute all city laws and ordinances charter a and control and administer the financial affairs of the city charter e.specifically,as city administrator,edgerly had authority over various city departments and personnel,including the police department.she was also responsible for the city budget and expenditures.if edgerly had any concerns about the allocation of city funds,she would confer with the city attorney office.
in,dellums replaced brown as mayor of the city.knowing that the new mayor could replace her at any time,edgerly developed an exit plan.
in october,edgerly gave notice of her planned retirement set for july.the mayor agreed to this retirement date.however,on june,a little over a month before the planned retirement date,the mayor placed edgerly on administrative leave.the mayor terminated edgerly employment on july,effective immediately.edgerly claimed she was wrongfully terminated as a whistleblower because the mayor asked her to violate several provisions of the city charter,which she refused to do.
in the course of carrying out her duties as city administrator under dellums,edgerly questioned several expense reimbursement requests.these included requests regarding the mayor personal expenditures,including payment of a cellular phone bill for the mayor wife,overtime pay for the mayor driver,and increased utility costs associated with security upgrades at the mayor residence.
edgerly did not know if the mayor was aware of the questions about the cellular phone bill she also could not recall if there had been any investigation regarding this reimbursement request.ultimately,edgerly approved payment of this request in april,and it was decided that the cellular phone in the mayor wife name,which previously had been in the mayor name,would be returned to his name going forward.
as for the overtime pay for the mayor driver,edgerly was unaware whether anyone ever told the mayor that there was an issue about whether the overtime could be charged if the driver was driving dellums as opposed to the mayor.edgerly approved the overtime payment for the driver and advised the mayor office that future overtime bills needed to be for driving the mayor,not his wife.
with respect to the reimbursement request for the utility bills,edgerly sought an opinion from the city attorney office regarding whether such a reimbursement was permissible.edgerly could not recall receiving any direction from the city attorney on this issue.nevertheless,edgerly testified that she told the mayor that she could not reimburse this request.she could not,however,remember what,if anything,the mayor said in response when she advised him that she could not reimburse him for the utility bill.according to the mayor deposition testimony,he decided ultimately to drop the request.
edgerly also fielded requests from the mayor chief of staff and dellums,who sought office space and computers for a partnership initiative supported by the mayor.suitable space was not located during edgerly tenure.
according to edgerly,the mayor attempted unilaterally to enter into a service contract with former city manager robert bobb,without seeking the requisite authorization from the city council.edgerly sought the assistance of the city attorney to explain to the mayor that his actions were improper.once advised of the necessity that contracts in excess of required a competitive bidding process and approval from the city council,the mayor directed edgerly to prepare a request for proposals to obtain the bids.
edgerly claims the mayor attempted to usurp her authority by directing department and agency heads to report directly to him rather than to her.edgerly states that she opposed this.edgerly claims she also refused requests to terminate department heads and other high level executive officials so that the mayor could reward his campaign supporters with city jobs.
on june,edgerly nephew was involved in a police incident.edgerly intervened with the police.when she identified her office and sought explanations,her actions became public and controversial.as a result,the mayor directed edgerly to work solely on the competitive bidding process for the bobb service contract,because the mayor saw the police incident with edgerly and her nephew as a distraction,creating the appearance of a conflict of interest.
on june,the mayor believed that edgerly had agreed to step back from her involvement with the police department and asked her to sign documents ceding control of the police department to the interim director of the community and economic development agency.she,however,refused to appoint the mayor designee.the mayor wanted to place edgerly on administrative leave on june.on friday,june,the mayor attempted unsuccessfully to communicate with edgerly she was away at a funeral to tell her he was placing her on administrative leave.
on july,the mayor terminated edgerly employment effective immediately because he believed he could not wait for her to communicate with him,and a decision was required.
discussiona.the standard of review.
our review of the sufficiency of a complaint against a general demurrer,which is de novo,is guided by rules.we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.citation.blank kirwan cal d.fonseca fong th,d.in addition,we consider the complaint exhibits.hoffman smithwoods rv park,llc th,d.under the doctrine of truthful pleading,the courts will not close their eyes to situations where a complaint contains allegations of fact inconsistent with attached documents,or allegations contrary to facts which are judicially noticed.citation.false allegations of fact,inconsistent with annexed documentary exhibits citation or contrary to facts judicially noticed citation,may be disregarded citations.ibid.
further,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citation.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.citation.and when it is sustained without leave to amend,we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment if it can be,the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse if not,there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm.citations.the burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the plaintiff.citation.blank kirwan,supra,cal d at.fonseca fong,supra,th at,d.
in,the legislature added the whistleblower protection statute to the labor code by adopting section.this section prohibits employers from retaliating against an employee for refusing to participate in an activity that would result in a violation of state or federal statute,or a violation or noncompliance with a state or federal rule or regulation.c.
the purpose of section c is to encourag e workplace to report unlawful acts without fearing retaliation.citation.hansen department of corrections rehabilitation th,d hansen.protected employees include any individual employed by the state or any subdivision thereof,any county,city,city and county,including any charter city or county,and any school district,community college district,municipal or public corporation,political subdivision,or the university of california.in contrast to an employee of a private employer,a plaintiff employed by a governmental agency such as edgerly does not need to inform another governmental agency of the unlawful acts in order to qualify for whistleblower protection.colores board of trustees th,d.
to prove a cause of action under section,the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of retaliation.mokler county of orange th,d.if the defendant then proves there was a legitimate,nonretaliatory explanation for its acts,the plaintiff must demonstrate that this explanation is merely a pretext for retaliation.ibid.
as we shall explain,edgerly is unable to establish a prima facie case of retaliation.to establish a prima facie case for whistleblower liability,a plaintiff must show that he or she was subjected to adverse employment action after engaging in protected activity and that there was a causal connection between the two.citation.hansen,supra,th at,d.protected activity is the disclosure of or opposition to a violation of state or federal statute,or a violation or noncompliance with a state or federal rule or regulation.b c,italics added.in other words,s ection of the labor code requires that to come within its provisions,the activity disclosed by an employee must violate a federal or state law,rule,or regulation.citation.mueller county of los angeles th,d mueller.
c.the trial court properly sustained the city demurrer.
in sustaining the second demurrer to the first cause of action without leave to amend,the trial court determined that edgerly complaint relied solely on the charter,oakland municipal ordinances,city civil service rules and procedures,and city personnel manual.the trial court further determined that none of these municipal law provisions should be deemed a state statute or regulation for purposes of section c.in sustaining the second demurrer to the second cause of action,the trial court determined that insufficient facts were alleged to identify a violation of a state statute.we agree with the trial court reasoning and affirm the trial court decision.
edgerly challenges the trial court rationale,arguing that her refusal to violate the city charter,municipal code,and civil service rules and regulations is within the purview of section c.edgerly theory is simple all local laws like the city charter and the civil service rules have the force and effect of state laws.thus,when the mayor allegedly violated any charter provision or other local ordinance or rule,the mayor also violated state statutes or state regulations.similarly,whenever edgerly refused to violate the charter or local ordinances or rules,any act of retaliation because of this refusal is also an act of retaliation in violation of section.
the city argument is equally simple the city charter,municipal laws,and local civil service rules and procedures and personnel manual are local laws,which do not rise to the level of a statewide statute or regulation within the meaning of section c.therefore,edgerly can not show that her refusal to do what the mayor allegedly asked of her would result in a violation of a state or federal statute,or a violation or noncompliance with a state or federal rule or regulation.c,subds.a,b c.
this appeal requires us to interpret the scope of section to determine if it encompasses local laws enacted by charter cities.in so doing,o ur task is a familiar one.we apply principles of statutory construction in seeking to determine the legislature intent in enacting the statute,so that we may adopt the construction that best effectuates the purpose of the law.citation.citation.we begin with the statutory language because it is generally the most reliable indication of legislative intent.citation.if the statutory language is unambiguous,we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the statute controls.citations.we consider extrinsic aids,such as legislative history,only if the statutory language is reasonably subject to multiple interpretations.citation.miklosy regents of university of california cal th,d.
here,the plain language of section provides that it applies to a violation of state or federal statute,or a violation or noncompliance with a state or federal rule or regulation.based on the unambiguous statutory language,we presume that the legislature meant what it said section pertains,as relevant here,to state statutes,rules,or regulations.miklosy regents of university of california,supra,cal th at,d.
that the legislature chose to omit references to local laws when drafting section is readily apparent from its inclusion of local laws in the language of other whistleblower statutes for example,both education code section and government code section provide that an employer may not retaliate against an employee who refuses an illegal order,which is a directive to violate or assist in violating a federal,state,or local law see also,subd.f providing a whistleblower hotline for activities in violation of any local,state or federal law.where the legislature carefully uses a term or phrase in one place but excludes it in another,we will not imply the term or phrase where excluded.citation.slocum state bd.of equalization th,d.therefore,in this instance,the omission of the term local laws is indicative of legislative intent to exclude such laws from the purview of section.edgerly argument that section specifically refers to charter cities does nothing to alter the conclusion that local laws are not within the ambit of section.there is no question that section applies to charter city employees when the retaliation involves activities that violate a state statute or rule.here,however,edgerly section claim is premised on purported violations of local laws.moreover,there is nothing in the city charter,ordinances,or rules that even suggests these have the effect of state statutes.edgerly argument that these municipal matters must be construed as state statutes strains logic and offends yet another rule of construction city powers are strictly construed.city of madera black cal.for example,it is the general rule of municipal law that local governments can not pass laws that apply outside of their boundaries.harden superior court cal d.it follows that municipal statutes do not qualify as state statutes within the scope of c unless there is some enabling provision,for example,a municipal statute or rule stating that the intent of the city is to have its local laws treated as statewide statutes for purposes of this section.edgerly relies on cawdrey city of redondo beach th,d for the notion that a charter constitutes state law for that municipality.however,cawdrey is a case dealing with the home rule doctrine and,as we show below,using the home rule doctrine affirms that municipal laws are not automatically state statutes within the scope of c.
as noted above,this appeal would appear to present a question of first impression.there is analogous case law however,dealing more generally with the question of when personnel decisions are actionable under section c,and this analogous case law does not support edgerly theory 
for example,in mueller,supra,th,d,a firefighter brought suit against the county,alleging that he had been retaliated against after expressing disapproval of a decision to transfer two firefighters in the department to another division.id.at,d.there,the plaintiff asserted that the labor code only requires that the employee have reasonable cause to believe that the information he discloses to a government agency discloses a violation of such statute,rule or regulation id.at,d,italics omitted.rejecting this assertion,the court concluded that the plaintiff claims did not rise to the level of whistleblower retaliation.matters such as transferring employees,writing up employees,and counseling employees are personnel matters.ibid.in so holding,the court explained that s ection of the labor code requires that to come within its provisions,the activity disclosed by an employee must violate a federal or state law,rule or regulation.citation t his case is not about perceived violations of federal or state statutes,rules or regulations but rather about perceived violations of the department own policies which are local policies.mueller at,d,italics added.
similarly,in carter escondido union high school dist.th,d,a probationary high school teacher and basketball coach sued for wrongful termination after the district refused to renew his contract.id.at,d.the teacher alleged,among other things,that he had blow n the whistle by complaining to the school athletic director that another coach had recommended a protein shake to a student that had made the student sick.id.at,fn,d.the court held that such conduct was not protected by section because the disclosure did not involve a violation of any federal or state statute,rule,or regulation.carter,supra,d.as the court explained,carter disclosure here was not under section,but rather a routine internal personnel disclosure that was,at its core,a disagreement between the football and basketball coaches about the proper advice to give to student athletes.this type of disclosure is not encompassed by section id.at,d.
further,in patten grant joint union high school dist.th,d patten,a principal sued a school district for whistleblower retaliation for disclosing improprieties at her school.in particular,she alleged she made four separate whistleblower disclosures,for which she received adverse employment action disclosing to a state senator that her school had engaged in budgetary improprieties by reassigning funds that were earmarked by the state for a certain purpose to another educational program disclosing accusations to her district superiors that a male physical education teacher was peering into the girls locker room disclosing to her superiors certain remarks made by a male science teacher and requesting additional staff to keep the campus safe.id.at,d.
the court held that except for the budgetary disclosure,the disclosures concerning teachers conduct and lack of staff do not rise to the level of blowing a whistle but were made in the context of an internal personnel matter based on a student complaint,rather than in the context of a legal violation.patten,supra,th at,d.the court explained that the disclosures involving the two teachers did not amount to whistleblowing because although the disclosures were made by a government employee to a government agency,the disclosures indisputably encompassed only the context of internal personnel matters involving a supervisor and her employee,rather than the disclosure of a legal violation.id.at,d,italics omitted.additionally,the court held that plaintiff disclosures to her superiors about needing more staff did not amount to whistleblowing as a matter of law.again,these disclosures were made in an exclusively internal administrative context.they do not show any belief on patten part that she was disclosing a violation of state or federal law in any sort of whistleblowing context,as required for a section b whistleblowing action.id.at,d.
despite these decisions,edgerly argues that differentiating between local laws and state laws is contrary to the legislature overarching intent to foster a broad public policy goal of encouraging workplace municipal whistleblowers to report unlawful acts without fearing retaliation.green ralee engineering cal th,d.we conclude,to the contrary,that strong public policy considerations militate against adopting edgerly interpretation of section c.
we begin by noting that it was part of edgerly general job description to take the actions that she alleged she took to enforce oakland municipal laws.taken to its logical conclusion,edgerly argument is that as she routinely acted on each city official expense reimbursement requests,each rejection constituted a per se violation of section c,no matter how trivial or routine each rejection was.this interpretation strains logic and,if adopted,could have a serious impact on the workings of the city and other charter cities.as patten,supra,th,d instructs,it would thrust the judiciary into micromanaging employment practices and create a legion of undeserving protected whistleblowers arising from the routine workings and communications of the job site.citation.id.at,d.the court explained that t o exalt these exclusively internal personnel disclosures with whistleblower status would create all sorts of mischief.ibid.
similarly,here,there is no reason to micromanage the employment practices of a charter city,which is specifically authorized by our state constitution to govern itself,free of state legislative intrusion,as to those matters deemed municipal affairs.article xi,section,subdivision a of the california constitution provides it shall be competent in any city charter to provide that the city governed thereunder may make and enforce all ordinances and regulations in respect to municipal affairs,subject only to restrictions and limitations provided in their several charters and in respect to other matters they shall be subject to general laws.city charters adopted pursuant to this constitution shall supersede any existing charter,and with respect to municipal affairs shall supersede all laws inconsistent therewith.italics added.state building construction trades council of california city of vista cal th,d,city of vista.this provision,the roots of which trace back more than years,is known as the home rule doctrine.ibid.
