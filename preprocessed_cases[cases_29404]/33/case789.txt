introduction 
appellant nicholas mcintosh appeals from a summary judgment entered in favor of respondent robert mills mills the trial court granted mills summary judgment after concluding,as a matter of law,that an alleged agreement to share a legal fee the agreement entered into between mills,a member of the state bar of california,and mcintosh,a nonattorney,was unenforceable in reviewing the matter de novo,we agree that the agreement was unenforceable under the doctrine of illegality of contract.further,we conclude that no exception to the general rule of unenforceability applies in that the parties were in pari delicto as a matter of law because mcintosh was represented by counsel,attorney david anton,who also negotiated and entered into the agreement on mcintosh behalf,and mcintosh is equally as blameworthy as mills.
procedural background 
in the underlying complaint,mcintosh filed a single cause of action against mills for breach of contract,alleging that mills failed and refused to honor an agreement to share attorney fees with mcintosh.no other legal or equitable causes of action were pleaded.the agreement arose out of mcintosh oral agreement to assist mills in preparing civil actions against bank of america in two cases,carol nickel et bank of america national trust savings association et the nickel action,and fisher et bank of america national trust savings association et the fisher action in return for his consulting services,mcintosh was to receive percent of all attorney fees mills earned as a result of the prosecution of either or both actions.the consulting agreement was allegedly entered into in.
the complaint further alleged that the fisher action was settled in,and mills received total attorney fees of approximately million.the nickel action was allegedly settled in,and mills received total attorney fees of approximately million.mcintosh demanded payment under the agreement,but mills refused to make payment.
mills filed a motion for summary judgment in october,claiming the agreement was unenforceable as a matter of law because it was illegal.mills also claimed that mcintosh was barred from seeking relief for the breach of the parties agreement by the equitable doctrines of unclean hands and judicial estoppel.mcintosh opposed the motion.
on november,the trial court held that mills was not entitled to summary judgment on the alternative grounds of unclean hands and judicial estoppel however,the court granted mills motion for summary judgment on the ground that the alleged agreement to share attorney fees with mcintosh was illegal,and thus,unenforceable.judgment was entered on december,and this appeal followed.

summary judgment was properly granted on the ground the subject agreement to share fees was illegal and unenforceable 
the facts adduced on summary judgment concerning the agreement between mcintosh and mills 
in the late,mcintosh worked in the northern california investment group for security pacific,which later was merged into bank of america.the merger became final in,and mcintosh was then terminated for the ostensible reason that he had been recruiting bank of america accounts specifically,the widows and orphans fund for a new company he was forming.during the years he worked at the bank,mcintosh noticed several indiscretions about which he complained.
in early,mcintosh employed attorney david anton anton as his agent for the purpose of reaching an agreement with mills by which mcintosh would provide services assisting mills in legal matters mills either was handling or was going to handle.mcintosh gave anton complete power and authority to negotiate an agreement with mills relating to mcintosh work.mcintosh had given anton carte blanche to negotiate with mills on his behalf because he did not know how these things worked.
likewise,anton told mills that the financial arrangements were to be negotiated with anton alone,and that anton had authority to accept the arrangement without communicating the specifics to mcintosh so that mcintosh,if asked,would be in a position to state he did not know what arrangements existed.this agency relationship between anton and mcintosh was not in writing.
mills had first broached the possibility of compensation casually during a meeting at anton law office on february.in addition to mills and anton,mcintosh and another attorney in the mills law firm were present.mills mentioned it was apparent that mcintosh had valuable information about what was going on at the bank,and some thought should be given to retaining him.
in his deposition,anton explained that an agreement to pay mcintosh compensation was reached with mills as of april,subject to the contingency that mills reputation,through references,would reflect that he was the type of person with whom mcintosh should work at the april meeting,mills confirmed that he thought mcintosh could be of invaluable assistance in pursuing litigation against bank of america however,mills was unwilling to consider hourly compensation.mills opposed an hourly arrangement because he did not want a paper trail of payments from him to mcintosh while the cases were pending,and because mills wanted the rate structure to be contingent on how well mills did in the litigation.anton and mills then discussed mills desire that if only a lodestar fee recovery was achieved,mcintosh would receive only percent of the fee.
anton claimed that the need to keep the agreement secret was first raised by mills.mills also did not want the issue of the agreement discussed with anyone else in the mills law firm.he told anton that because mcintosh was a potentially important witness,it was best that other lawyers in his firm not know about the arrangement.mills also did not want either side to keep any writings about the agreement,for fear that counsel for the bank might g et wind of something and subpoena their records.for this reason,neither attorney made any writings about their discussions 
in,mills reemphasized it was critical that the arrangement be kept secret because his firm might be removed as counsel if the terms of the agreement with mcintosh came to light.his concern stemmed from his belief that the agreement could be viewed as inappropriate.
anton had been a practicing attorney in california since.when asked during his deposition if he was aware that sharing a contingency fee between an attorney and a nonattorney might be illegal,anton stated that he was aware that something like that existed,but he did know what the parameters were.he did not research the ethics of the arrangement,although he was aware there were rules of professional conduct governing the conduct of attorneys.he really was not concerned since it was mills fee that mills wanted to share,not anton fee.therefore,if there was any cause for apprehension,it was mills concern.
from his discussions with mills,anton stated there was a clear meeting of the minds as to the terms of the agreement.he felt uncomfortable not being able to tell mcintosh what the terms were,but he had no doubt that an agreement had been reached.what he did tell mcintosh was cryptic.he told him that things were set and he was to cooperate fully in any way he could with mills requests in the bank cases what he intended to communicate to mcintosh was that an agreement had been reached,that there was no way anton was going to tell mcintosh the terms,but that mcintosh had to cooperate in order to meet his end of the bargain.based on his interactions with mcintosh,anton concluded that mcintosh had an expectation or belief that an arrangement had been made but he did not know the specifics of that arrangement.
prior to being deposed in any of the bank cases,anton discussed the areas of expected questioning with mcintosh.he considered possible questions about whether mcintosh had authorized anyone to negotiate any form of compensation with mills.anton told mcintosh that if that type of question were asked,mcintosh would have to fess up.
mcintosh testified in his deposition in this case that he knew an agreement had been reached between anton and mills in either or but he was never really told the precise details of the agreement.anton was asked to handle the arrangements since he was an attorney,and he negotiated as mcintosh agent or representative.at the time anton was meeting with mills in about the agreement,mcintosh was told that the case could be a big one.in response,he told anton that he was willing to help mills on the case but i want a fair piece.from this discussion with anton,mcintosh knew his return would be fair and it would be substantial.he figured from internal discussions that the bank overcharging could be as much as a million,and attorneys get paid anywhere from percent out of recovery.therefore,mcintosh concluded that in light of the potential recovery,he expected to receive a fair percentage out of it.he knew that the harder he worked on the cases,the more the attorneys would get,and the better off he would be if they did well,he would do well.
mcintosh also testified in this case that in he did not expect to assist mills other than as compelled through legal process without an agreement for compensation.it was only after he understood that anton had reached an agreement with mills that mcintosh began assisting mills in the cases.the work mcintosh did for mills included providing mills law firm with open access to his own files fielding an infinite number of questions from members of the firm about documents,bank practices,and employee records and consulting about how to depose bank employees,including what questions to ask.
mcintosh learned of the specific terms of the agreement when he and anton discussed anton may,letter to mills requesting payment.however,in the years after,mcintosh sought confirmation periodically from anton that he still had an agreement in place with mills.
in january,mcintosh was deposed in the bank case entitled fluty bank of america,during which the following exchange took place 
q did you ever ask for any compensation for the time that you spent talking with people from the mills firm 
a i think they bought me lunch once or maybe twice.
q did you ever ask for any other compensation 
several days later,mcintosh was deposed in the fisher action.in attendance were both anton and a member of the mills law firm.during that deposition,the following exchange took place 
q have you been promised any payment in connection with this litigation 
q have you been told that there any possibility that you receive any money whatsoever as a result of this lawsuit 
a no.am i missing something 
q i just trying to distinguish between being compensated for your time testifying as opposed to any other money you might receive arising out of this lawsuit.
anton sat in as counsel when bank of america deposed mcintosh.he heard mcintosh deny there was any possibility he would receive any money whatsoever as a result of that lawsuit.anton was feeling very uncomfortable during this line of questioning,but he did not know what to do.his discomfort stemmed from the fact that he and mills had worked hard to make this weird arrangement,they knew the day would come when they would be confronted with these precise questions to mcintosh,and damn,they were getting close.when asked during his deposition if he thought mcintosh testified truthfully in the fisher action,anton said,i do know what i thought about that.the following exchange then took place 
q you did think by answering no to that question mcintosh was perjuring himself 
a i did think about that at the time that way.
a because he was being asked about his thoughts.i do know.i knew i felt very uncomfortable because i thought he should have expected it to be a yes.
mcintosh filed a supplemental declaration in opposition to the motion for summary judgment below.in it mcintosh stated that at the time of the fisher deposition he knew only that some sort of agreement had been reached between mills and anton,but he denied having any specific information that i was to be compensated at all,much less the manner and extent of that compensation.
in may,mcintosh was informed by anton that mills had settled the fisher action,and that anton and mills had discussed compensation for mcintosh.in a letter dated may,requesting payment,anton confirm ed that the real estate partnership cases against bank of america were cases in which there was an agreement with your firm and mcintosh for a fee,call it a referral fee.anton further stated that the terms of the referral were for mcintosh to receive percent of the gross attorney fees recovered,and that anton understood that mills had settled the class action.anton concluded the letter by requesting mills to call him so that we may review this situation.mills rejected the demand.two years later,mcintosh filed this action for breach of contract.
the doctrine of illegality applies to the agreement between mcintosh and mills to divide the nickels and fisher fees 
to analyze mcintosh assignment of error,we must first determine if the doctrine of illegality applies to the agreement between mcintosh and mills.this is a question of law that we decide de novo.bovard american horse enterprises,d.see also russell soldinger d.
the illegality of contracts constitutes a vast,confusing and rather mysterious area of the law.strong,the enforceability of illegal contracts hastings strong.nevertheless,enacted as part of the original field codes,the contractual doctrine of illegality has been codified in this state since,and appears as civil code section if any part of a single consideration for one or more objects,or of several considerations for a single object,is unlawful,the entire contract is void.thus,where the illegal consideration goes to the whole of the promise,the entire contract is illegal.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts.
in turning to the question of whether the agreement in the instant case was illegal,we initially determine whether the agreement subject matter violates a professional ethics rule enacted to govern the conduct of members of the state bar.chambers kay cal th,d.subject to exceptions manifestly inapplicable here,current rule a of the cprc admonishes with stark brevity neither a member of the state bar nor a law firm shall directly or indirectly share legal fees with a person who is not a lawyer,this is not an ethics rule of recent vintage,for the state bar general prohibition against sharing fees with nonmembers was adopted by the california supreme court as part of former rule on december,and was later reenacted as rule a,as part of the cprc 
while certain legal commentators have criticized perpetuating the ban on most agreements courts have consistently upheld the prohibition based on a number of legitimate concerns.as summarized by the court in emmons,williams,mires leech state bar d.emmons prohibited between lawyer and layman carries with it the danger of competitive solicitation crawford state bar cal d,poses the possibility of control by the lay person,interested in his own profit rather than the client fate utz state bar cal d,facilitates the lay intermediary tendency to select the most generous,not the most competent,attorney linnick state bar cal d,hildebrand state bar cal d,separate opinion of traynor.rule prohibition against lay intermediaries seeks to bar both solicitation and the presence of a party demanding allegiance the lawyer owes his client.people merchants protective cal,emmons,supra,d at.
attorney ethics panels,both in and out of state,have been moved to embrace rules against fee sharing with nonattorneys out of concern for interference with the attorneys professional judgment,the creation of conflicts of interest,and the unwholesome spectre of attorneys soliciting professional liaisons with laypersons see state bar compendium on responsibility,bar of,ethics opns.of the legal ethics,formal op,pp.lawyers manual on conduct lawyers manual,aba formal ethics opn,applying model rule lawyers manual,state bar of montana ethics opn,same.one authority has also suggested that fee sharing tends to increase the total fees charged to clients,presumably in an effort by the attorney to make up that portion being paid to the third party.vapnek et,cal.practice guide professional responsibility the rutter group.
the potential problems associated with fee sharing are perceived to be particularly acute when viewed in the context of class action litigation where unique,and sometimes intractable,conflicts may already exist.these conflicts appear most commonly as agency issues resulting from the fact that the attorney is usually retained by a single or small group of named plaintiffs but who also represents a large class of unnamed individuals.because of the extent of the potential conflicts arising from the settlement of class action litigation,it has been suggested that courts should take special care to ensure accountability by the attorney to nonpresent class members.molot,an old judicial role for a new litigation era yale.
in light of these public interest concerns,and because there is no dispute here that the agreement at issue between mcintosh and mills clearly violates cprc,rule a,we conclude that the doctrine of illegality applies facially to their agreement,cain burns d,cain.
even if the agreement is illegal because it violates a rule of professional conduct,mcintosh argues that it is illegal only as to mills because mcintosh is not a member of the state bar of california,and thus,not subject to the cprc governing attorney conduct.we disagree.
first,we note that the doctrine of illegality considers whether the object of the contract is illegal.it does not turn on whether the illegality applies to the party seeking to enforce the agreement.for example,an agreement between a licensed adult and an unlicensed minor by which the minor agrees to drive a delivery vehicle for the adult is illegal and unenforceable by the adult despite the fact the party seeking to enforce the agreement the adult is a legal driver.as the above authorities make clear,the doctrine of illegality focuses on the object of the contract because it is grounded on considerations of public policy the effect to be given to an illegal element of a contract should not depend upon who alleges and proves it nor upon the manner in which it comes to the attention of the court.rather,it should depend upon how the court can best serve the interest of the public and,when not inimical to the public interest,do justice to the parties.strong,supra,hastings at,fn.omitted.
furthermore,mcintosh contention that he should be allowed to enforce the agreement because he is not bound by the rules of legal ethics is really a variation of his argument that his own conduct is less blameworthy than that of mills,and,therefore,he should be entitled to enforce the parties agreement despite its facial illegality.it is to this subsidiary argument that we now turn.
no exception to the unenforceability of illegal agreements exists because the parties were in pari delicto as a matter of law 
because of the harsh results that might be visited on innocent parties to a contract when their agreement is voided for illegality,courts have fashioned exceptions.one court has observed that the need to void contracts in violation of the law must be tempered by the countervailing public interest in preventing a contracting party from using the doctrine to create an unfair windfall.lewis queen ball sons cal d.
thus,a number of exceptions have been recognized.wells comstock cal d,contract for sale of stock enforced where illegality affecting the transaction is not relied on by the parties calvert stoner cal d,attorney fee provision in retainer agreement enforced where illegal provision prohibiting client from settling is severable city lindsey cal d,automobile installment contract enforced where statute establishing illegality contains express sanction for violation strauss bruce,usurious interest rate inserted into loan agreement by mistake.
perhaps the most common exception to the rule of invalidity,and the one mcintosh argues here,is the in pari delicto exception.at its most fundamental level,the exception allows an illegal contract to be enforced so long as the party seeking its enforcement is less morally blameworthy than the party against whom the contract is being asserted,and there is no overriding public interest to be served by voiding the agreement.see strong,supra,hastings at witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,contracts.the trial court found,as a matter of law,that mcintosh was not entitled to invoke this doctrine because there is serious moral turpitude on the part of the plaintiff and the defendants are not guilty of the greatest moral fault.emphasis in original.
in arguing that he was not in pari delicto as to the agreement at issue in this case,mcintosh attempts to align the facts with those of several decisions that enforced contracts despite their illegality.the first of these is cain,supra,d.there,the plaintiff was a private investigator who had performed services for the in return for which the attorney agreed to pay the of the net attorney fees recovered.the attorney sought to avoid the contractual obligation to pay,claiming the agreement violated former rule,the predecessor to cprc,rule a.id.at.
the court began by observing that,despite the fact that the agreement was against public policy,it would be enforceable if the parties were not in pari delicto.cain,supra,d at.it quoted the general exception from the decision in norwood judd d,language which mcintosh refers to with relish in his brief but the courts should not be so enamored with the latin phrase in pari delicto that they blindly extend the rule to every case where illegality appears somewhere in the transaction.the fundamental purpose of the rule must always be kept in mind,and the realities of the situation must be considered.where,by applying the rule,the public can not be protected because the transaction has been completed,where no serious moral turpitude is involved,where the defendant is the one guilty of the greatest moral fault,and where to apply the rule will be to permit the defendant to be unjustly enriched at the expense of the plaintiff,the rule should not be applied.citations.cain,supra d at,italics omitted.
in considering the relative culpability of the contracting parties,the court noted that the statute former rule was directed at only members of the state bar,and it lacked any direct reach over the conduct of laypersons.cain,supra,d at.accordingly,the court explained that to allow the attorney to assert his own failure to comply with professional rules as a sword to deny otherwise lawful payment to a nonattorney who had indisputably performed under the contract would put a premium on the attorney disregard of the rules made for his guidance and conduct.id.at.
the second case is emmons,supra,d,in which the plaintiff law firm preemptively filed a declaratory relief action seeking a declaration nullifying its
