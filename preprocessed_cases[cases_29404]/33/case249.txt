american family prepaid legal corporation american family appeals the district court dismissal,on abstention grounds,of its constitutional due process challenge to the ohio supreme court rule governing the unauthorized practice of law.under rule vii,section a of the ohio supreme court rules for the government of the bar the rule,the unauthorized practice of law committee of any bar association may file a motion for an interim cease and desist order with the ohio supreme court,pending resolution of whether the party is engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.because american family has not met its burden of showing that its due process challenge to the rule will not be resolved in the course of the current proceedings under ohio law,we affirm the district court decision to abstain based on younger harris,d.
background 
american family sells memberships in its prepaid legal services plan to residents of ohio.in november,the columbus bar association cba filed a complaint against american family with the ohio supreme court board of commissioners on the unauthorized practice of law the upl board,pursuant to rule vii of the ohio supreme court rules for the government of the bar bar vii.the complaint was docketed as upl case upl and alleged that american family was engaging in the unauthorized practice of law by performing certain services,such as selling,marketing,preparing wills.in march,american family and the cba entered into a consent agreement providing that american family would alter its business practices and refrain from the challenged conduct in november,believing american family had breached the consent agreement by engaging in the challenged conduct,the cba filed a motion with the upl board to reopen upl.the upl board denied the cba motion.
in march,the cba filed a motion with the ohio supreme court to enforce the rule american family filed a motion in opposition to cba motion to enforce the rule,pursuant to bar vii,a a.however,american family failed to present its constitutional due process claims to the ohio supreme court in that motion.thereafter,on april,the ohio supreme court granted the cba motion,ordering american family to cease and desist engaging in the unauthorized practice of law interim order,and ordering the upl board to hold a hearing to consider whether the march settlement agreement had been violated and file a report with the court.
on april,pursuant to bar vii,a c,american family filed a motion to clarify,dissolve,modify stay the court april,interim order motion to clarify.in its motion to clarify,american family included the following due process challenge 
alternatively,the interim order should be stayed in its entirety and the matter remanded to the upl board for a full hearing to determine whether american family is engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.otherwise,american family will be placed out of business without the cba having to prove its allegations in a hearing on the merits,a classic and unlawful infringement of constitutional due process rights.see,cleveland board of education loudermill,d holding that the root requirement of the due process clause is that an individual be given an opportunity for a hearing before he is deprived of any significant property interest.emphasis in original.
the motion to clarify was denied without comment by the ohio supreme court on may.the matter of the whether american family violated the consent agreement is currently pending before the upl board as u pl.
on june,the cba filed a second complaint against american family with the upl board,alleging that it had again engaged in the unauthorized practice of law upl.on september,the ohio supreme court ordered upl held in abeyance pending a formal hearing in upl.
american family filed the present action in federal district court on may,alleging that 
the rule on its face violates the federal constitutional guarantee of procedural due process because the rule does not provide a sufficient hearing or an adequate remedy to protect its liberty and property interests in freedom of speech and association,freedom to pursue lawful business and business goodwill.
the cba moved for dismissal on abstention grounds.during the pendency of american family lawsuit,however,the cba agreed not to file a motion with the ohio supreme court to hold american family in contempt for failing to comply with the interim order.on may,the district court granted the cba motion to dismiss based on younger abstention.as a result,the cba is no longer bound by the agreement not to bring contempt proceedings against american family.american family filed this timely appeal of the decision of the district court.
ii.analysis 
younger abstention criteria 
we have mandated three requirements for a district court to properly invoke younger abstention there must be state judicial proceedings those proceedings must implicate important state interests and there must be an adequate opportunity in the state proceedings to raise constitutional challenges.squire coughlan,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.if these prerequisites are satisfied and so long as there is no showing of bad faith,harassment,or some other extraordinary circumstance that would make abstention inappropriate,the federal courts should abstain.id.quoting middlesex county ethics committee garden state bar ass n,d.we review de novo a district court decision to invoke younger abstention.id.citing berger,at.
in squire,we considered whether the district court properly invoked younger abstention to a constitutional challenge to rules ii and v of the ohio supreme court rules for the government of the bar bar ii and v id.at.the complaint charged that the disciplinary counsel for the ohio supreme court disciplinary counsel,who investigates and prosecutes judicial grievances filed under bar ii and v,violated the complainant judge due process rights by failing to provide the names of all those contacted by the disciplinary counsel in the course of its investigation against her.id.at.
ongoing state judicial proceedings 
as we noted in squire,t he ohio state constitution vests its supreme court with original jurisdiction over the a dmission to the practice of law,the discipline of persons so admitted,and all other matters relating to the practice of law.id.at quoting ohio const.art.iv,b g.we also found as relevant that members of the board of commissioners on grievance and discipline grievance board,with whom the disciplinary counsel files its complaint,are appointed by the justices of the ohio supreme court.id.finally,we considered that the grievance board,with the approval of the supreme court,appoints the disciplinary counsel to investigate allegations of judicial misconduct in concluding that such investigations are an adjudicative,rather than a legislative function.id.at citing middlesex,at.
in the instant case,it is beyond dispute that regulating the unauthorized practice of law is a matter relating to the practice of law and is therefore within the constitutionally proscribed jurisdiction of the ohio supreme court.see id.furthermore,like the grievance board and disciplinary counsel in squire,the upl board serves as an arm of the ohio supreme court.not only is the upl board appointed by the justices of the ohio supreme court,bar vii,but its final report is subject to review by the ohio supreme court,bar vii.see berger,at noting that the ohio supreme court ultimately decided what discipline should be given as a factor showing the proceeding was judicial in nature under younger.thus,the ohio procedures are judicial in nature.see fieger,at holding that state disciplinary procedures against an attorney are judicial in nature for purposes of younger abstention.
american family attempts to distinguish middlesex and its progeny by pointing out that it is not seeking to avoid ohio authority to prosecute it for the unauthorized practice of law,but is only challenging the constitutionality of the interim order.however,this argument lacks merit because it seeks to divide the interim order as a distinct judicial action from the underlying investigation into the unauthorized practice of law.the interim
